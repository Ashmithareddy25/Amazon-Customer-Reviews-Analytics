B005ILWOZA|5.0|I was randomly introduced to James Morrison by catching him on TV in a concert and I was entranced--beautiful, soulful voice.  I bought his previous album...and this last spring, I was lucky enough to see him in concert in San Diego, and hear the music from this album firsthand. This holiday season I will be gifting friends and family with this brilliant album.  If you love Adele, and I do, he is another wonderful talent from England and should be heard.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It's so fun games like this should be for only cool people (as in everyone). How much can you love a game because I love it a lot.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Anyone who is a Beatles fan must have this CD in their collection.  I've loved the Beatles all my life and the Fab Four never disappoint. Everybody has their favorite Beatle...mine was always Paul...and still is.

0345803485|1.0|...an excellent example of marketing hype triumphing over actual substance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am cursed with an excellent memory that no amount of alcohol or triple-fudge ice cream will squelch. It's all trapped in there: those hackneyed phrases, the dangerous misconceptions about BDSM, the idiocy of the characters...and all that sniffing. What's up with the sniffing?<br /><br />If you'll notice, books 2 and 3 got much better ratings than book 1. That's because people who actually appreciate some skill in writing (basic storytelling, plot, character development and even, in this case, actual erotica) stopped after book one. The really smart ones stopped before driving themselves insane reading the entirety of book 1. But there are those of us, naive believers in unicorns and Santa Claus, who remain convinced even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that a book lauded far and wide for its genius, originality and erotic content might actually show some glimmer of at least one of those three.<br /><br />I'd have been better off sleeping with a pillow over my head and praying for the Tooth Fairy to show up.<br /><br />You've a lot to answer for Ms. James, starting with your stilted prose and ending when one of my sweet vanilla gal pals limps into work with that deer-in-the-headlights look after some arrogant ass of a boyfriend decides to use your fractured fantasy as a guidebook to playing Dom.<br /><br />If you want erotica, read erotica. If you want romance, read romance. For the sake of all that is holy, there are writers out there who do both with so much more skill and clarity. Find them. Clap your hands if you believe in fairies! Don't let Tink die!<br /><br />12/30/2013 - Edited to add: The other day I actually thought of something nice to say about these books! Ms. James makes Stephanie Meyer look like a literary genius. There, now that I've annoyed all the Twilight AND 50 Shades fans, my work here is done.

B009E3EY38|5.0|A really, really special present for Zep fans!!  If you're looking for '75 Earl's Court you won't find it, but that doesn't make this any less special. The band is in terrific form, it's obvious how hard they worked to prepare.  It's filmed with amazing clarity (even if it jumps a little too quickly) and the sound is wonderful.<br /><br />If this is the last Zep show, it's a great way to bring a legendary career to a conclusion.

B002ELIXCA|5.0|I just happened onto Dexter since it follows Homeland and have since become a great fan of the show.  The theme is so bizarre,  the acting is great, and the plot twists are very entertaining.  And still there is a lot of humor in the show.  I now have the pleasure of watching it starting with season one. I'm in luck!

B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book is a great way to learn about our country's political history.  Very interesting & enlightening, well written. I have not read anything political, but plan to read about the bay of Pigs, the Pentagon Papers, and WaterGate.
B003JQK7XM|2.0|The shipper did not say it was just the digital copy. So when i actually went to play it, I couled play it on anything other than my laptop. The movie is cool, but since I can't watch it too often because i use my laptop for other things, I don't get to watch.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Tay Tay, you did it again! Such a good album, it doesn't have all the bonus stuff like you would get at Target or something like that, but oh well. And I preorderd it, and I got it the day after it released..  love.
B005CT05GI|4.0|Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.<br /><br />Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of \\"Desperado\\" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.<br /><br />What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.<br /><br />Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious \\"Danza Kuduro\\" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.<br /><br />There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.<br /><br />The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.<br /><br />That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.<br /><br />Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.<br /><br />Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.<br /><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Steelbook Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|I went to see this movie in theaters and LOVED it. So when I heard that it was finally time to preorder it, I jumped immediately and preordered the \\"Marvel Cinematic Universe\\" box set. Unfortunately, Marvel didn't get permission to release the suitcase that was suppose to come with it. So it had to be pushed back to spring 2013 so that way the problem could get settled and they can think of something to replace the suitcase. Luckily Amazon was gracious enough to give me this blu-ray set for free, except for shipping, and I thank them for it. Because I still LOVE this movie.
B001COF3BY|5.0|There's really no need for a plot review. If you're reading the reviews, chances are you've seen this excellent cult classic. I purchased the Blu-Ray version of the film in early 2011, and getting to experience it in high-definition is a real treat.<br /><br />I was pretty late to the party with this film, having not seen it until the late 90's. When I realized it was on Blu-Ray, I had hoped that the transfer would be good. I wasn't let down. The colors are excellent, and the amount of detail that you get down to the beads of sweat is just insane.<br /><br />I can't comment on the differences between the Director's cut and the original, as I didn't have the first version on VHS or DVD. So that aside, this is still one of my favorite Blu-Rays to watch in HDTV.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Literally, could not put down, had to know what happens on the next page. Mitch is my second favorite guy, in a series<br /> Here he is caught up in a mess that takes all his resource to figure out. Ending set the reader up for the next book in the series.

B0041LG08U|4.0|The back is transparent which I somehow managed not to realize but I like it, so its all good. The hands are easy to read in low light and the band is comfortable with a secure locking system that probably has some cool name, but it holds secure whatever it's called. The only nit to pick is that the band feels...?...light?, hollow?, chincy?, not substantial?....you get the idea. It is just a nit, after all the watch is not expensive and the band is perfectly serviceable. I would A) buy this watch again and 2) recommend it to a friend.<br />Oh....it keeps accurate time too!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book will keep you wanting more. If you feel lost it reminds you that you are not the only one out there and there is a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow after all.<br />The only part that was a little disappointing was it kind of just ended it could have given the reader just a taste of Cheryl's life after PCT or just maybe that means there will be another book?<br />Thank you Cheryl for sharing you journey.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|OK, I will start out by saying, I think the audio is pretty good to my ears. I don't have the highest end turntable and receiver, but they're nice.<br /><br />Now for the bile...<br /><br />I am really overall disappointed with this package. The cover art is very poorly done and that really is half the fun of having a 12\\" record over a CD.<br /><br />Having most of the UK editions, the covers are not at all authentic to the original releases. Usually the EMI Parlophone editions were a somewhat thinner stock paperboard with lovely high gloss cover. What is here is just heavy white paperboard stock, similar to the inferior 1980's US re-issues.<br /><br />One of the biggest disappointments is the Beatles For Sale opening gate-fold instead of the envelope overlay of the original. Not accurate at all.<br /><br />The cardboard in Sgt. Pepper's for the cut-outs seemed too heavy and of course the cover was as complained of above.<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour's packaging is not accurate to the 1967 release - heavy paperboard instead of slick over cardboard, nor really even the UK re-issue either. While it is nice to not have the book glued into the inside of the package, again not what I expected.<br /><br />The White Album is a mess. The poster is not glossy, but matte finish, again not accurate to any edition of the album I've seen. Photo stock is too heavy. Further, although I may be wrong, but I believe that with the UK edition of the White Album, the disks were inserted from the top, not the open sides like in the most record sleeves.<br /><br />Since they were not being accurate, it would have been nice for them to at least have used the US presentation for Let It Be. I seem to remember seeing a UK \\"Beatles For Sale - style\\" open for Let It Be somewhere. I could be wrong. It may have been a later edition or another country such as Australia or New Zealand. It would have at least been nice to include the interior of the US gate fold as a inner bag, which even Capitoldid with reissues after they discontinued the gate fold edition.<br /><br />While the inner bags are generally a simple sleeve with a inner protective bag, it also would have been nice to reproduce the \\"Care Of Your Record\\" and \\"Important Notice\\" of the Parlophone EMI UK pressings.<br /><br />I really loved what Apple did with the Mono edition cd's, where the originals were replicated accurate to the 12\\" version in CD scale. It wouldn't have hurt to have done the same, especially for the big black box editions.<br /><br />Seriously EMI/APPLE/PARLAPHONE/BEATLES, if you are going to sell something like this, you should at least improve the packaging instead of sending out a poorly put together package like this.<br /><br />Finally, Amazon made this a very disappointing purchase overall, as well. Amazon just stuck the black box in a thin cardboard box and shipped it. My first one was severely damaged, the second one was damaged as well, but only nicks on the bottom of the box. Admittedly, Amazon customer service was kind and replaced it with no hassle and next day shipping. But having seen how other distributors sent the box set protected inside heavy cardboard with Styrofoam bumpers to protect the black box, I was considerably unhappy with the way Amazon shipped this monolith to me.<br /><br />Did I expect too much for what could have been $399? I really don't think so. And for those who say covers couldn't be prepared with the same quality like they were in the 1960's, this is untrue. Wilco's LP edition of \\"Wilco (The Album)\\" from 2009 came with a 1960's/1970's style pasted overlay cover. Furthermore, SubPop's Iron and Wine LP pressing of \\"The Sheppard's Dog\\" from 2008, cover and sleeve, look much better than most of these covers.<br /><br />This was just weak exploitation on the part of EMI/APPLE/PARLAPHONE/BEATLES and a real bad performance on the part of Amazon for crappy shipping.

B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love this app. It is perfect for all ages and can help pianists get better. You do not need to know how to play piano, you just need to know how to touch keys when it shows you to. I do not support the three touch, so be ready on Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy. Other than that, best piano app ever!
0547884591|4.0|After reading this book the one thing that strikes me is this man's passion for learning and life. It's contagious and is the reason why I would recommend buying it at the $5 kindle price point.<br /><br />But when I stand back and look at what I read, I see a lot of unorganized breadth lacking in depth.<br /><br />If that's your thing, go for it. Tim will take you on a wild ride across the faces of very many topics without delving deep into many of them.<br /><br />Many times while reading it felt like I was reading a college essay, written and hastily put together the night before by a student solely citing Wikipedia. It may be \\"correct\\" in the traditional sense, but the reader is better off reading the Wikipedia entry than waste time navigating the fluff the author inserted to differentiate his work from that of the encyclopedia's.<br /><br />While I have my qualms with the content, it's easy to see Tim's passion for success, life, and learning, which I deeply admire and wish to emulate in my own life. I appreciate how well he makes that come off in his writing and hope it inspires other people to seek those same qualities in their own lives. This is why I rate it 4 stars. 3 stars for content and 5 for inspiration.
0547884591|3.0|If you want to learn brilliant cooking then you need to learn from an brilliant chef, which Tim isn't. There are many other books much better than this, but it will appeal to people that want to believe that brilliance can be achieved without any real effort. What Tim fails to point out is that a world class chef has spent many, many hours developing subtle skills that can't be learnt in a day. Take for example the simplest of ingredients, the onion, there must be at least 3 different ways of frying an onion and each way will create a different flavour, cooking like a pro is not learned in 4 hours!

159514188X|5.0|This book was amazing. I read it all within a couple of sittings, and each time I put it down, it was only because I had no other choice. I laughed a couple of times and cried at least twice. It makes you think about how every little thing you do can affect people, which is extremely important. Highly recommended: this is a book that everyone needs to read, especially if you or someone you know has had to deal with suicide and/or depression.

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars has to be John Green at his best, and I do not take it lightly when I say this is now in my top five favorite books of all time.<br /><br />This story is still so strong in my mind because its characters refuse to leave me. They're part of me now, and I welcome them with open arms.<br /><br />Hazel has to be one of my favorite characters in YA. She was strong, very intelligent, witty, and brave. While at times she tried to wallow in self-pity, she never let it get the best of her. That partly has to do with her parents. I loved, loved, loved Hazel's parents so much! They were very active and involved in Hazel's life, and always put her wants and needs first; always caring about her well-being. They were fun, loving, and very strong characters. This was one YA novel where I never forgot the main character has parents, and I loved that.<br /><br />Every character was so wonderfully developed and beautifully crafted--they jumped right off the page and bared their souls to you. Their stories just demanded to be told.<br />Augustus Waters. The reason so many girls cry over boys in YA novels.  He was perfectly imperfect and I loved so much about him. He is one of the most complex YA characters I have ever read, and he always kept me guessing.<br /><br />The banter between both Hazel and Augustus was laugh-out-loud funny, sweet, and often very outrageous. One thing I love about John Green's writing and his characters is the fact that he never tries to make teenagers something we're not. Whenever I read a John Green book, I hear my voice; the voice of my friends. He doesn't make every character a lost puppy. He shows how intellectual young adults can be, and he shows real life issues that teens deal with and how we come to understand and learn from our challenges and mistakes.<br /><br />This is not a light story. This is a story about a girl that has cancer. How she meets an amazing boy and falls in love. How she takes the trip of a lifetime to a different country just to meet her favorite author. It's heartbreaking and honest and true and so amazing. The emotions within this novel will tear your heart from your chest and leave you feeling raw and exposed.<br /><br />This is a story of loss, of pain, of finding happiness in your darkest moments. This is a coming of age novel, but it is also so much more than that. This is Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters' story. This is the story of their lives, however young they may be. This is their life together and finding out what it means to grow up, move on, and find happiness in even the worst situations.<br />Please pick this book up. It will not be an easy read, but it is definitely worth it.This book truly changed me as a person, and has set the John Green bar even higher in my book.ferent country just to meet her favorite author.

B004VFK5LO|5.0|The movie was well thought out, the actors well suited for their roles and despite the horrific nature of the crimes, the movie was not laden with unnecessary gore.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It was ok, there was not much there to see. The usual movie for teenagers, I didn't have anything to do an didn't want to use my brains.
B000P512LQ|5.0|Typically I'm not much of a drama type gal. This movie however was well thought out and while all along one pretty much can predict was is going to happen, the ending has a wonderful twist. With the amount of Law & Order type movies out there, it is truly nice NOT to know the ending. Gere did a stand up performance.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The book begins with Annabeth, who worries about her boyfriend (of course) and the coin she holds in her pocket-the Mark of Athena. I'm not going to give a whole summary, but SPOILER ALERT!!! Overall, the book was AWESOME. It's worth A LOT more than $9.99. Don't get me wrong. And Team Leo? AWESOME!!! It was mainly Annabeth's story, and I'm afraid even Percy doesn't see her completely under the blonde princess hair. Her character really shines. Unfortunately, Piper...oh, Piper, I'm afraid you daydream about your boyfriend, Jason Grace, a bit TOO much. Oh, and Percy might be considered a cute skater boy. Other than that, it was a great book. And then the ending...oh, gods. RR has officially been entitled &#34;the god of cliffhangers&#34;. NOOO!!!!!!!! I NEED THE HOUSE OF HADES!!!!! PERCY AND ANNABETH FREAKIN' FELL INTO TARTARUS!!!!!

0785163174|2.0|First of all much of this book, close to half, was drawn by John Romita jr.His style is too clunky, too stylized, and just too plain ugly to be assigned to a story supposedly so important to the Marvel timeline.Romita works best for off stories like Ann Nocenti's Daredevils, something experimental and on the fringe. So the first half of the book is unreadable for that reason alone.The art improves considerably after romita is done, but we're left with a dud of story and a typically horrid conclusion. The Hope character was a decent idea, but in the last, poorly executed. The red hair seems trite and too predictable, but thats a minor annoyance.The story is poor, its overly long, and it brings up to many obvious questions, like why does the Phoenix always lose?When will it finally destroy the earth or the universe? I don't want to see that thing again unless it wipes everybody out and Marvel comes up with an entirely new universe with entirely new characters.This Marvel universe is played out. Tony Stark is too smart, Wolverine is too tough, Cap is too important and it was better when he was dead.Give a universe based on the kids in the Vengeance graphic novel- next gen,more multicultural, more relevant, younger.This crap is played out.Amazon gives a decent discount. Anyone who pays 75 bucks retail for this will in  all likelihood (hopefully) feel cheated.Myself, I wouldn't pay five dollars for it.

B004I8WD6E|3.0|It's inexpensive, it looks nice, and actually is a good, solid rubber material that doesn't gather all the pocket lint like softer rubber cases.  As a bonus, it actually protects the phone if you drop it -- which seems to be a rare quality in the overflooded smartphone case market.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars?  Three reasons: (1) despite being a snug fit on the phone, it somehow collects quite a bit of dirt/dust between the case and the phone, which becomes very visible since this case is translucent; (2) the case yellows over time.  It won't stay the pretty colorless rubber it is when you first get it; and (3) it has sharp edges.  I bought two of these cases and they both had the same problem.  I needed to sand some of the corners so they didn't hurt or cut my hand.  I guess whatever process they use to cut or mold these cases isn't as thorough as it should be.  With sandpaper and a little elbow grease though, this can be fixed.<br /><br />The screen protector was fine.  I put it on and with some care, got the case on there without damaging the protector like some others have reported being a problem.  I don't like screen protectors though, so I eventually just took it off.<br /><br />The case is inexpensive and has some drawbacks, but overall it was a good purchase.  Better than a lot of the other crappy cases I've owned.
0446580848|3.0|Love DeMille's main characters in most of his books,esp this and his last one(same guy in both)---so very funny! This book could have been done in 350-400 pages not 600+,much too repetitive and preachy. We understand the the whole terrorist situation these days all over the world, but Nelson won't stop reminding us over and over saying the SAME things.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|this game takes some thinking but is fun. it keeps me entertained and is a great way to spend time when u are waiting for something.
B008NB0SQO|3.0|The Christmas Carol is my favorite story. The Muppets Christmas Carol is a wonderful adaptation that I grew up on. Looking to replace my vhs with an updated media you could imagine how excited I was to see the blu-ray in the store. But then when I watched it, I noticed the cut and was very disappointed to see that they had cut one of the most beautiful pieces in the work. Having watched the movie as a child myself, the song was never boring to me and can't believe the presumption made by the Disney decision makers. Every child will find their attention diverted in any movie they watch. They are children, it's in the job description. Please put it back. It needs to be put right. And compensation to those of us who paid your high price on half a product by making the correct release more affordable would be nice as well.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Maybe the best translation to any language but there are few sentences not translated from the original 1862 french complete edition.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|A grizzled Russian ship crew, proud Inupiat Eskimos, zealous Greenpeace activists, greedy oil barons, nerdy machine inventors and attention-seeking journalists all manage to join together to achieve a common goal--rescuing three California gray whales trapped under the ice. That's the REAL miracle in this refreshing film! You care about what happens to the whales but you are also inspired and amazed by how people from all corners of the political spectrum actually cooperate, work together, and figure out how to solve a problem. Showing this film to young students provides them with a powerful message that we humans can do great things if we put aside petty differences. Whether or not you love animals, you'll love \\"Big Miracle.\\"
B006LSZECO|1.0|I enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down, until the last chapter. I can't believe that was the ending. Great story, terrible ending. Left me feeling unsatisfied and certain that a chapter was missing! Won't be seeking another book by this author again. :-(
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What Dr ALEXANDER experienced in his NDE is what was told by Baha'u'llah profphet-founder of Baha'i Faith. Anyone who has doubts about the next life should read this book.
0307165485|3.0|i ordered this book for my Grandchild. especially for the Bedtime Story Pierre Bear, wich was his Fathers favourite as a Boy. Very dissapointed to discover it was not featured in this addition and had been not deemed politically corect with 'Moose Hunting'!!!!! and so banned. can you tell me where I can purchase a book with Pierre Bear included?
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|The author uses the device of Harold's trek to tell &#34;his story&#34; which is pretty dull and boring to begin with -- failed marriage, can't connect to his son, bad childhood etc.  And when you are not reading sad, boring, why care reminiscences, you are overwhelmed with repetitive descriptions of the English countryside.  I had to read this for my book club otherwise I never would have finished.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this on sale here for only $29.99. What a 'steal'. Once I started watching these (especially the first movie) I realized I hadn't really SEEN (and HEARD) them yet. It's absolutely amazing how well they restored a movie from 1979. I haven't even had time to watch any of the MANY special features. As of today, 11/22/2012 (Happy Thanksgiving), this title is $39.49 - GET IT NOW! You won't be sorry.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|It is a nice mix of christmas songs that give a different mood than the original classics.  I wanted some songs to blend in with other albums.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|One of best Grisham books ever, and certainly in the last decade. Unique plot with unpredictable twists coupled with sound character development.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|The Pines started out well with plenty of suspense.  The ending was odd and left me hanging.  Did not delve into the emotions of his son and wife.
B00005ASGG|5.0|This is a stunning John Ford western. I have watched it again and again. I think I will continue to watch it again and again.
B007TK77QE|2.0|• The “language” while generally true to the characters being portrayed really got a bit much.. to many *!#@# words.<br />• Where is the consummate story teller of the Harry Potter series? This is not a bad yarn but not grippingly told<br />• The book ends with a whimper – it just fades away in my judgement.<br />• Rowling has great story telling ability – Harry Potter showed us that much even if the general field of magic and wizardry was not your cup of tea. But she does not demonstrate that skill here. I could never imagine anyone making an interesting film of this book.<br />• Some of the characters are well drawn – but the majority walk back and forth and we never get much insight to them as people.<br />• Was she setting out to make some social comment or give some insight into British social problems? If so, I don’t think she succeeded
B000NIVJHM|5.0|This is one of the most re-watched movies ever. Shot on a minimum budget, it just took off to be an all time favorite.<br /><br />Don't remember this style of dancing, it may have been made up for the film. Doesn't matter.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game Solitar. I play it all the time. When I say all the time I mean ALL the time! I LUV THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!
030758836X|4.0|This book sucks you in and grabs you in the first several pages.  It progresses quickly, making it hard to put it down.  The suspense builds, action occurs.  It's a great book.  Until the end.  Was she paving the way for a sequel?  Overall it's a very entertaining read, but I must take away a star for the unsatisfying ending.  No spoilers here, but just be prepared to be a bit disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series and the final book was awesome. However the second was my favorite,  you have to read this one to find out how it ends with Anna and Christian.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Too wordy for too little action.  Not his best by any stretch. A lot of it was predictable.  Not enough tension or excitement. No suspense.
B001JNNDGA|1.0|This might be the most self-indulgent film ever made. Mel Gibson peaked with the Mad Max films, which, unfortunately gave him delusions of adequacy as an actor/director. Only the uncritical mind of the &#34;true believer&#34; mentality will think this movie has any artistic merit.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Before you guys get all pis#$%d off that I gave this 4 stars, this is generally not my kind of music. But I like it quite a bit. I heard the song &#34;Burn it Down&#34; on the radio while driving in Germany last month (repeatedly) and really liked the song. That prompted me to buy the album. That song is great, and the rest of the recording is not bad. Not bad at all! Not the most creative band (pretty standard MOR stuff) and not really very technical (3 or 4 chords per song) but very gifted melodically. I find many tunes stick in my HEAD and I need to hear them again. And again. Maybe one more time for good measure...<br /><br />In the end, I would recommend this recording to anyone that likes modern rock. Don't look for any guitar solos or even any decent drum work. Just enjoy the music for what it is - solid, melodic, modern rock. And one more thing - your fly is open.
0525953728|5.0|The Obama Adminstration leaked the proponderance of classified information regarding the UBL mission long before the book was published.  The book does not reveal any more classified information.  What riled the Obama Administration was the author's criticisms.  In particular:<br /><br />On page 141, Obama, quite possibly with the advice of his ACLU admirers, changed the rules of engagement (ROE) so as to put our special forces in greater danger.  The terrorists that the DEVGU engage are trying to kill them.  But once the DEVGRU has the upper hand the ROE called for an interpreter to offer the terrorists the opportunity to surrender. Then to make matters worse the terrorists, once in custody, are then asked if they were abused.  I kid you not! It wouldn't surprise me if Obama plans to fly (first class of course) ACLU attorneys to Afghanistan to sue the DEVGRU members for inflicting emotional distress on Al Qaeda.<br /><br />However, what makes DEVGU's accomplishment even more notable is that they accomplished their mission despite the obstacles the Obama Administration placed in their path.  Obama should have less concern for the terrorists' welfare and more concern for our brave and patriotic military.<br /><br />On page 292, Post Mission, at the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment's (SOAR) headquarters in Fort Campbell, KY Obama invites the DEVGU members to the White House residence for beers.  That never happened.  Obama can fly off to be on Letterman and the View but he can't even keep a simple promise to the SEALs who sacrificed their personal safety and their familial commitments to rid the world of the greatest terrorist of all time. This chillingly reveals Obama's true feelings toward the military.  At least Obama approved the mission (after it was placed in his hands with a bow tied around it by Jose Rodriguez and VADM McGraven)-- something that Bill Clinton refused to do.<br /><br />And of course Joe Biden lived up to his reputation as a buffoon when he told ridiculous jokes that reminded the author of a \\"drunken uncle at a Christmas dinner\\".<br /><br />The book is a good read. What confirms it is the New York Times Book Review which pejoratively characterizes the author as having \\"little appreciation of what his country actually stands for\\" and further describes him as \\"just a killing machine\\".  Whenever the hard left New York Times criticizes patriots you can take that as the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.<br /><br />DEVGRU is not a killing machine.  It is a peace and freedom machine to which falls to it the unpleasant task of killing iniquitous terrorists so that the world can be a safer place for all to live.<br /><br />God bless our brave military to whom we all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|When I say that I could not put this book down, I mean it quite it quite literally. Finished it the same day I began reading it. It is a beautiful love story that endures unimaginable horror and heartache.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|&#34;Winter of the World&#34; was amazing!  Loved it and can't wait for the third book.  Ken Follett at his best.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Probably my wi fi connection. I was in a hospital. The series is good as ever, of course.But the download...not sure.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read this in two sittings. It was very suspenseful and difficult to put down. I was very interested to find out what was coming next. I thought I had it figured out pretty early on but I was wrong and was pretty surprised at the ending. It reminded me a lot of a similar book by Michaelbrent Collins and I wouldn't be surprised if there was some influence there. I agree with another reviewer though that there were some unanswered questions about the townsfolk and the way they treated newcomers but it doesn't really spoil the book much, maybe 1/2 star. I will definitely be reading more Blake Crouch!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|But it is a classic story. I guess I was expecting the story more like the movie. Then I figured out it is a lot more in the book than in the movie duh! and it is divided into weird sections. Then again it was written a long time ago and I guess people then just talked so much more!! LOL!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|trying to think of something bad to say but just cannot. simply incredible. love it. I got it so you run and get it too.
030758836X|5.0|Great book with lots of plot twists.  Was a great read for my book club. You won't predict the ending (don't read ahead and run it!)
B009DT98RK|4.0|Saw this show in Portland ME last February. Had always wanted to see Frampton and was more than impressed with his new stuff, especially \\"Asleep at the Wheel\\". The veteran musicians know that surrounding themselves with good sidemen is a key. He has done that here excellently. If you're a fan you'll enjoy it all, old and new. Audio and video quality are excellent. Thankfully the editors chose not to jump around with multiple shots every fraction of a second. Would recommend this dvd to any aspiring guitar player. Terrific.<br /><br />Honestly feels like I'm right back in the audience.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Just started Kitchen House and can hardly put it down. Great story and piece of history! A must read for everyone.

B000FC2OHA|5.0|This book has everything I need to motivate me to become successful. I am reading it for the third time and have begun to apply the principles in my daily life. My general outlook has changed and success results have improved since I first read this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to move ahead in their career.

B004JRVQX0|5.0|This is a must have for the kind of software that is intrinsic to my creative endeavors. easy to install and use. Works as advertised.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I bought this CD after listening to the Song &#34;Midnight City&#34;, and thought this is probably going to be the only good song they have. I was wrong in my assumption. This is a wonderful listening experience, and because it's a double CD it's double the listening pleasure. Side one is better then side two, but I thought the CD on the whole was worth the purchase.
1419705849|5.0|It could have been better. I wish kinney would make a longer one. Blew through this in 15 Minutes. But, it was a great, quick, read. I read this three times in one day. W00 H00. Its like a relaxing book. :)
B0080R7Q70|5.0|This is the Flower Kings first new material in years! The Flower Kings are a &#34;love 'em or hate 'em&#34; type band. I love 'em. With that said, this CD hits on all the typical FK's cylinders and if you are a fan, will appreciate the listening pleasure of this work. My first listen was a little dissappointing, but as I hung in there and gave it a few more swings in the machine, my enjoyment increased. It's like most complicated music, the first time isn't the best experience. Letting the music evolve in your brain, then process the grand musicianship of this band, is an experience.&#34; Numbers &#34; is the perfect example of this. Progressive Rock, at it's finest. It's also a double CD so you get alot of bang for your buck!

This book was really boring and short. If you like romance, I would recomend buying this. If not, dont buy.
1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an important book for all to read.  I did not have any clue regarding cells and what they are all about.  I was especially interested in reading about how tissue was harvested and used in labratories back in the 50's.  I feel sorry for the Lacks family somewhat but also am so glad there were scientific people who were eager and knowledgeable to conduct experiments such as they did.  Our lives today are certainly better for that.  Excellent book.  Should be  a must read for high school age students.

1449410243|1.0|No one expects an Oatmeal book to be high-brow humor like SMBC Comics or xkcd, but Inman's books seem to actively select the worst of his online material, adding reworked rejects for \\"new content!\\" sake. This is made worse by the fact that there's an average of three sentences per page, making for an infuriating experience. Not worth the purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't have the Pc or xbox version but this doesn't have as much stuff because of it being in an early version but it is getting better one problem though cant find diamonds or gold.

B008Y5OWMK|5.0|This a fantastic film that got a lot of bad press on its initial release....but if you see it for what it is, you will find it to be a great film.... It is a trifle long at 3 hours 37 minutes,  but it is worth every minute.... The story is excellent, the video is grainy, but very good, the sound is fantastic, and the extras are ample.... There is a digital line going vertically through the picture at the 1:28 mark on the blu-ray, but, no big deal.... Great stuff all around....the scenery is incredible....give it a chance....
B009Y4E414|5.0|Eva Cassidy was just 33 years old when cancer took her in 1996, yet her breathtakingly beautiful voice lives on. As a vocalist and guitarist, she interpreted melodies from a wide variety of musical categories - jazz, blues, soul, gospel, folk, country, and pop - infusing all of her songs with authentic emotion and a wonderful warmth, purity, and power that made them both moving and memorable.<br /><br />Performing and recording in the Washington DC area during the early 90s, Eva released only two albums before her untimely demise. She never landed a contract, mainly because she stubbornly insisted on singing and playing songs that spoke to her, regardless of genre, and this prevented her from fitting into a commercial pigeonhole. In the wake of her enormous posthumous popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, however, no fewer than eight collections of her music have been produced.<br /><br />\\"The Best of Eva Cassidy\\" is indeed her best, containing as it does a full 20 tracks over 80 minutes and including most of the songs for which she is best known. A few of my favorites are missing, of course, like \\"At Last,\\" \\"The Water Is Wide,\\" \\"Blues in the Night,\\" and \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes,\\" but that's inevitable when you assemble a compilation.<br /><br />So if you can buy only one of Eva's albums, make it this one. However, if her music touches you like it does me, you owe it to yourself to check out a few of her other collections. She never sang a song that wasn't vital and compelling. And if you'd like to know more about her life and work, search for an excellent 18-minute video from ABC's Nightline program entitled \\"The Eva Cassidy Story.\\"

B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a remake of the every popular Dr. Seuss story The Lorax.<br /><br />The Lorax is a must watch for *everyone* for the environmental message contained within regarding over consumption and unnecessary waste caused by squandering resources which is devastating the environment (ie the carbon footprint.)  This rendition is a refreshing update to the previously returned animated feature.<br /><br />I am so enthralled with The Lorax and feel the message is important enough for the next generation that I bought extra copies for each household of our grandchildren.
0525953728|3.0|I enjoyed the story of Mr. Owen's life, becoming a Seal, serving our country, and how we got Bin Laden.  Was disappointed by how sophomoric the writing was and poorly edited.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Great movie, but the option to sell this with the UltraViolet Digital Copy is not worth it.  The studio should stick with the iTunes Digital Download.

0143117009|4.0|Jared Diamond is after big game in this book, namely an understanding of how societies choose their own future through their environmental stewardship of their resources.  He studies past societies that failed and collapsed to see where they went wrong and takes a hard look at several societies that had severe environmental challenges that they succeeded in solving.  He also takes a close look at modern environmental challenges in both the Third World and the First World to determine whether or not these challenges are solvable in a realistic time frame.<br /><br />Doctor Diamond believes that a major collapse is on the way for the entire world unless we get our environmental house in order.  He gives a time frame of about fifty years to see the worst of it arrive, within the lifetimes of many children and young people alive today.  He spends a chapter or two looking at signs of hope, like forestry initiatives and mining initiatives that are trying to promote sustainable resource management.  He talks about the horrors of various Third World countries with their overpopulation problems that get solved through civil wars and genocides and warns that this sort of event will become wide-spread if we don't get our act together.  The book is a depressing read, with its focus on failures and screw-ups, but it's an important book to read and understand in these times.

B003VANOFY|3.0|there some problem with the mic but i think thats due to logitech driver. search the web and they dont have the fix yet.<br />sound got very weak bass, it you turn it just abit high it start having crack sound.<br /><br />is ok as gaming headset.
B003QSIM30|5.0|My 8 year old loves this movie.  The animation is colorful and the story timeless.  The musical scores are great to sing and dance too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best game ever made! I absolutely love the dargons! They are so cute and I like creating new dragons.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|lots of fun but to much like so many others good time killer, great graphics,fast with no quirks.get it youll probably like it
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Really held my interest but I think the Pelican Brief and the Firm I would rate with a 5. The Racketeer I felt was a 4.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It had interesting take on a subject one doesn't see very often.  Actors did a good job in keeping me engaged.  Didn't drift off during the presentation.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|These things are impossible to find in town! Plenty of i7 for at least twice the price and this one runs every app I need. Silent fan works just fine.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|It's supposed to be a prequell to Alien.  But it never really showed the 'how' and 'why' the franchise started.  Very good special effects, but it couldn't carry the movie.  It's an okay rental when you want to kill some time.
B001UU75WK|5.0|I love this series. This year they are now in the final season which is a shame. The characters are interesting along with the story lines and I recommend watching the whole series highly!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I think that this app is pretty great but I just think that they should upgrade a few things and make it simpler. They should add a tutorial or something to show how to use and take pictures, videos, etceera. All the people asking how to delete photos, just go to files, you will find a folder named DCIM, go to it then to folder Camera, press and hold picture, or video until there is a pop up, click delete, and there you go. If you are still unsure, go to Youtube to search how to use camera on Kindle Fire HD the guys name is MrTechGuy or something like that. The bad thing, though, is that, as far as I know, you will have to delete by single photos or videos. Hope ES File Explorer users find this helpful!!!! :-)
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I purchased the first season just before the second season came out so i could watch it all again and have it fresh in my mind before the new season started.  It was amazing that even though I never missed an episode in the first season, I still picked up on things that I missed.<br /><br />Definitely worth adding to your video collection.  Can't wait for the second season to come out I would definitely purchase it also as I'm enjoying watching it each week.
030759565X|5.0|Wonderful and beautiful book. It even has a whole section of interesting vegetarian main dishes and of course the desserts are amazing.  I made the pumpkin tart for Friendsgiving , people loved it.  Apple cider caramels are next.  You need this book!!!!!!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|DAMN!!! All I can say is DAMN!!! This album is badasss! Buy it, steal it, whatever, just listen to it. It's definetly  their best work in my opinion. Koi No Yokan came out the same day as Soundgarden's King Animal. I've hardly listened to the new Soundgarden. I can't stop listening to Koi No Yokan.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Literally could not put it down, fantastic good ending to the story although I would have liked to hear more about peetas recovery and gale's life
B007VUA7VO|4.0|i liked the app you can change the xolor of the battery and wvery time you plug in youre devise this app automatixle turns on.
B0041KVX1A|4.0|I have just received my copy of AHDN from Amazon it was well packaged and only took a week to travel halfway round the world.  The cover is a faithfull reproduction of the orginal and a much higher standard than my 1970's copy.  After playing my late seventies version back to back with the new one I have to say that the new version sounds much superior to me.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the record is not flat.  On the turn table (although it plays ok) you can see the needle moving up and down due to the uneveness of the record.  My 70's copy is a lot flatter.  I would have expected the 70's flatness to at least have been matched or improved upon with this new release.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Quirky little comedy that explores the problems of not fitting in and how two young people find their way. In spite of the dead pan line delivery and implausible events, I found myself caring about one happened to the characters. Watching it a second time I saw a lot of small details that added to the depth of the characters.
B00271SFB6|4.0|James Bond at it again, doing what James Bond does.  Action, beautiful women, cool cars, this movie has everything a Bond enthusiast is looking for.
B009FO96ZC|5.0|For a guy who's been doing this for many mant years this is a terrific effort. Very nice mix of tones and pace.
B0027BVMSY|4.0|Daniel Craig is an excellent James Bond.  This Movie picks up right where Casino Royal left off.  It has everything you are looking for in a Bond film.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|I had reservations at first as I don't love the thought of the fighting. I've never watched mixed martial arts and don't intend to in the future but the movie is beyond that. Yes, you'll see a bit of it and if you can't stomach it at all, perhaps you should pass but it would be a shame. The story was well written, well acted and moving above what I'd expected. I admit I was motivated by the glowing reviews from critics and on Amazon (and doesn't hurt that it was free for Prime) but I was still expecting something far more shallow then what it delivered.  Sorry I'm lousy at describing the nuances  but most of that is covered by the other hundreds of reviews. Just watch it. Terrific story. Terrific movie.
B0085A9J18|4.0|A lot of a action to keep you in front of the flat screen,if you like New Wave karate movies this will be a good purchase.
B004GYY714|5.0|I had tried to listen to radio stations online using the web on my kindle fire and it was difficult to navigate and find what I was looking for.  TuneIn Radio app has made it very easy to find radio stations and even listen to archived past programs.  The stations are categorized nicely making it simple to use.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Landing is fun. The tutorials could be more instructive.<br />Search on-line for using the HUD in other games.<br />Airport heading 0 degrees.<br />Works on HP<br />Touchpad with cyanogenmod
B009CPE424|4.0|As usual a fun movie. We adults enjoyed it, GREAT change of pace.<br />Who says your a kid only once?
B009AMANBA|4.0|I give 4 stars to every well made historical film just for the socially redeeming value. I wanted to like this film, but there are significant flaws. Daniel Day Lewis' acting saved this film for me. Although Steven Spielberg is an excellent director (Schindler's List), the film suffered from the safe and mundane interpretation of the life and times of Abraham Lincoln based on mainstream school textbooks. Like the real reason behind the assassination of JFK, Oliver Stone would have told a better story on who killed Lincoln and why he was killed. Unknown to most people, there is a common denominator in the assassination attempts on the lives of Presidents Jackson and Reagan and the successful assassinations on Lincoln, Garfield and JFK. Every American deserves to know the truth. Likewise, although slavery is one of the causes of the Civil War, it is not the only major cause as portrayed in the film. The film would have served generations of Americans better if the real story was exposed.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|it is really fun but sometimes it is boring.when it is boring I want to start over. I like that is two player game
B005NNURES|5.0|The best album Pink Floyd ever released. Yes, better than The Wall or Darkside, get off the bandwagon.<br />They are great albums but not better than Final Cut.
0465011047|5.0|I think that it is very important to read this story to understand - or try to understand - how sick and brutal the life is in North Korea. I have been travelling in NK. You can not do anything without a guide or two around you - all the time! Not see a local market, not even go out for a meal on your ovn. Everything is organized. - And very well - sure.You will only see fantastic buildings and everything is 'fantastic'. - Is that really possible? I went to the DMZ as well - very strange ...<br />But please - read this book - -The Aquarium of Pyongyang. Maybe you will understand how difficult the situation really is and how dificult life is in North Korea.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I bought this a few months back when I built my computer.  It is probably one of the best aftermarket coolers you can get for the price.  Be warned, it is gigantic and a pain to install.  I recommend having at least one other person to help you out during install, especially if you're not familiar with how to install CPU coolers, just for safety reasons.  You do not want to crack your motherboard in half.  Havn't had any problems with overheating yet on the CPU (currently running an I5-2500K).  You may need to readjust the fans on the cooler.  Keep this in mind.  If there is one persistant issue, its been with the cooler being just large enough to get in the way of the RAM.  With mine, I had to adjust the fans because of the air flow issue in my case.  As a result the fan was hitting my RAM.  I just moved the fan upward slightly by maybe half an inch.  No problem.  Just annoying.  Highly recommended for people who are looking for a high-mid end cooler at low price.  4 out of 5 just because of the issues with install.
B009X01ELC|5.0|This is an excellent case for the Fire HD 8.9\\".  We just got it earlier today and it has already greatly improved the experience of using the tablet.  I'm almost always anti-case and hate the added bulk for my phone or iPod and prefer the naked elegance of a clear skin from the likes of BodyGuardz or invisibleSHIELD.  However, this case makes the Fire easier to handle and adds the essential functionality of being able to prop the device up.  The Amazon case looks nice and it sounds like it fits the Fire well, but the standing performance seems dubious at best and looks prone to creating frustration with it slipping or falling over.  It also doesn't accommodate an angled portrait orientation.<br /><br />This case is high quality and feels and looks great.  The standing feature works very well and there is no concern with it slipping since there are detents that it fits into.  The rotation is an awesome  option and it's nice to have the flexibility to stand it in the vertical orientation as well.  The only thing lacking is an angle for a traditional typing posture, but you should be using Swype or the split keyboard anyway so it's more of a non-issue.  I highly recommend it.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I actually paid for this app, usually I just stick to the freebies. And everytime they update they add new boards so congrats on an app well done!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved learning the true meaning of some of the flowers I buy regularly. Loved the back and forth of the characters life story. It made you want to just keep reading . Hated to have the book end.. Looking forward to reading another of Ms Diffenbaugh's novels
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Filled with references from music, movies, and specially games, it is impossible to stop reading once you begin. It's hard to find a word to describe it, but perhaps EPIC can give you an idea.
B000V674E8|5.0|Great from start to finish - with the classic Supertramp formula. Sounds great decades after its release! &#34;Fool's Overture&#34; is a classic gem, unheard by many and the title track is awesome! Highly recommended!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|The basic story was OK but It dragged on and on (630 pages). However, the huge disappointment was in the ending. Without giving away the details, the story ends with the future of major characters (bad guys) totally up in the air. John Cory would have certainly got after them. DeMille must have been behind the publisher's schedule.
B003W77TPC|5.0|I loved the music. Will order more music by Erroll Garner. Glad I was introduced to his music.<br />Happy Thanksgiving everone.
B008NR8YXC|4.0|Schiff's artistry on the keyboard is legendary and I couldn't ask for a better performance.  The thing that kept me from giving the recording 5 stars is that the engineers left no space between the tracks, causing each piece of music to run into the next.  There really needs to be a short respite between pieces.  I will have to re-record these discs and insert a two second gap between the pieces.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|The \\"Underworld' series returns to form, in this the 4th installment. Getting the star Kate Beckinsale back adds the needed spark.<br />Borrowing a plot device from older horror movies, the star returns after being on ice for a number of years. The world may have changed during Selene's slumber but she has not. The movie has a decent plot that doesn't get in the way of the frequent battles, fights, shootings, car chases and other action. Staying with its strengths, they deliver a very entertaining flick that fans of the previous 3 movies in the series will certainly enjoy. Most of all, they seem to realize that Selene IS the series and they keep her front and center where fans want her.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a really good time consumer I would sugjest it to anyone. I would also suggest valor yay
B000W93CHC|2.0|I just thought this book was okay.  I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth but this was no where near as good.  The characters were flat and the author relied to much on telling the reader there traits rather than letting their actions speak for themselves.  The story was just commpeling enough to keep me reading and I rushed though it just to get it over with.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I received my box set on the day of release. The packaging was great, foam inserts top and bottom. That is the only good thing about this set. First off, Amazon is not at fault. The manufacturing process of this set is terrible. Warped records, spindle holes not in the center of the albums, and the surface noise is some of the worst I've heard in my 40 years of playing vinyl. The surface noise is so bad I thought my stylus came off, and I am being serious when I say that. This is not audiophile grade vinyl. My box set has every problem that is listed in all of the other reviews written here at Amazon.<br /><br />  As for the sound quality, it SUCKS!!! The sound is cold and lifeless. You can really tell it is a digital recording. The sound stage is narrow and flat, just like digital. I own the MOFI Beatles box set. It has warm rich sound, lots of detail and the sound stage is wide and deep. Just the way analog is suppose to sound. It is pressed on audiophile grade vinyl and is dead quiet. The MOFI set was mastered 30 years ago and is far superior to this latest 24 bit digital remaster.<br /><br />  Save your money and look for a MOFI Beatles Box set.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I expected to HATE this book simply because the of title (and description). Communicating by exchanging flowers sounded like a total snooze, but this book was surprisingly enjoyable. The trouble protaganist was interesting, and I found her struggle to get by in society to be compelling. I would have given the book 4 stars, but I was disappointed with the ending. I would give spoilers, but I thought it was unbelievable and pedestrian, given how compelling the rest of the book was.
B001GM28HO|5.0|DAUGHTER IS A BIG FAN. SO WHEN IT CAME OUT I WAS TOLD I HAD TO GET IT PRONTO. SHE ENJOYED IT.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Just have to love the classic scary movies.  One of the best movie series ever produced.  And at a reasonable price.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON HERE. TALK ABOUT CHANGIING WITH THE TIMES. THERE OLD STUFF STILL CARRIES ON TO THIS DAY.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good story. Not as good as most of the other Grisham books I have read. The ending seemed to drag and was anti-climactic.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|I have a mid grade audiophile system and a good music ear.  I must admit the set  sounds pretty good but you can definitly tell there a digital master (as stated on the covers). Very crisp. They have more of a CD sound. My MOFI Original Analog Master 1/2 speed master recordings sound much warmer and more realalistic Than this set. It is known that digital processing have issues with back ground nuances and warm echoes that provide spacious sound. If you have the remastered CD's I would not buy this set. The sound quality sounds the same.... in my opinion<br />JIM
0316228532|2.0|After reading all of the Harry Potter novels, I was very disappointed in The Casual Vacancy. The plot was weak, and the ending was very predictable.
B008MM9630|4.0|I have had this app for about 4 months or so, and it really is a blast to play. The game makers obviously put a lot of thought into it, &amp; they still do; new items and such show up sporadically. However, you do have to spend real money to level up at a quicker pace,  (although there are great deals offered daily) . Also, whenever I try to log onto Facebook, the app shuts off, and that seems to happen to a lot of people. Even so, this is a super fun app and very addictive! Give it a try!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I just love how Mr. Baldacci creates the story and then weaves us through the complexities of the theme.  For me his writing is just wonderful and I appreciate his work tremendously.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I have enjoyed the three books of this series very much. The author is very detail oriented about every aspect of the story. The only fault I have seen is that the story line seems to have been writen as a made for TV movie script, and that makes for a somewhat disjointed plot line. I almost expect to see a advertrisement appear at the end of each chapter. I do like the descriptive method of the author as it brings you into a closer contact with the players.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|This was my first Jeffrey Archer book recommended by a friend & I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would be in my top five this year. I have since read two other Jeffrey Archer books but this was by far the best one. Such a great story line with little twists all the way through that were very well thought out, and I did not see them coming.<br />I am a 44 year old female, but my husband would enjoy this equally as much if he could find the time to actually read it. A highly recommended read.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I have used ewallet for years - never a problem.  I have dealt with their support for a lost license and they were great.<br />This works - and works well.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I would recommend this band to many folks who like heavy metal / Rock.<br />They have a unique Sound, and Lyrics that provoke thought and entertain the mind and soul.<br />I look forward to them passing through My town again so that i may have the opportunity to see them Live.<br />But, since that may be a wile I intend to get the rest of their CD's here.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am new to Adele's music.  I love every song on this CD.  I am looking forward to her other CDs.

0525478817|5.0|i love this book so very much, i suggest this book to anyone. it is such a beutiful story and will have you turning the pages as fast as possible. John Green is one of my all time favorite authors. DFTBA!
0763644765|3.0|What's apotty book without the actual potty? Isn't that the point?  To  S H O W  them how/what to do then SHOW them what it looks like? There's no pay off. It just goes from sitting on the potty to YAY  UNDIES! Perhaps some people would be put off by an illustration of poop and would love it's absence...the first time i read through it,i though t it was missing a page...really.
B005K01VZS|5.0|It's always nice to read an inspiring true story.  In this book, Mr. Albom made me take a good hard look at myself and consider the commonality in all faiths.  (I started book this at 9pm one evening and finished it by 11am the next morning!)
B009FO908A|5.0|Just amaZayn!!! :3 One of the best songs on the album.... its phenominiall.... wooo ummm didn't take long to download really quick... u can listen to this all day and never get tired of it!!

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this has helped me and my child through many dr's and dentist visits. really cool game. more than decent graphics. good game controls.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|Don't be fooled by the bad reviews on the FX line of processors, this small guys give a great performance for a bargain price, if you already have a working motherboard for socket AM3 then just go for them! I have been using this since my PII died on me after two years of abuse (core unlocking + overclock) and a high current spike on my neighborhood.<br /><br />The only con i found, its the high amount of energy they require, but I am overclocking, so it was expected.
B009P5S11G|3.0|I LOVED Rihanna's third album \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" (and it's remix companion album) because it featured an array of up-tempo dance songs with catchy hooks and classy lyrics. Sadly, every album she has released after this has seen Rihanna exploring her 'dark side'- most of her song lyrics are now blatantly sexual and only a few songs on each album are dance & radio friendly, the vast majority of album tracks are sonically different and challenging to appreciate. I feel that with each album released post 'Good Girl Gone Bad' Rihanna misleads her fans by choosing to release as lead singles songs that are catchy, dance-orientated, & lyrically tame- however these songs are always the exception to the rule when compared to the rest of the songs on the album. Rihanna's latest album 'Unapologetic' (Deluxe Edition) once again has a wonderful catchy lead single called \\"Diamonds\\" (there are 3 versions of this song on the album), however there are only a few songs similar to this and appealing on the album. This album is quite dark lyrically, Rihanna appears to spend a lot of time celebrating her boyfriend Chris Brown! Many of the uptempo songs on the album are quite harsh to listen to, they are brave attempts to blend different sounds & styles together- however they are not immediately appealing, they might grow on me after repeated listening. \\"Unapologetic\\" is most similar to her album \\"Rated R\\", it is raunchy, dark, and confronting- however overall I still feel her latest album is better than 'Rated R' because of her efforts in trying to create new uptempo sounds. Rihanna's latest album is not an essential purchase item, however her lead single 'Diamonds' most certainly is an essential song for your music collection.
B004SEUIXS|3.0|Ordered three DVDs of this title, two were for presents. Viewed one and it froze at scene section 16. Viewed the other two and had the same freeze, but one jumped to section 17, so not much lost. Subsequent DVD's played fine- so it wasn't the player. Returned all three Amelie's for full credit--received in less than a week. What if I hadn't viewed the film, though? The presents would have been disappointing.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I love Jodi Picoult's books and this story did not disappoint. I downloaded it on my Kindle for my daughter to read but was looking for a new book one night and started reading this. I was immediately sucked in and couldn't put it down. It's sad to think that these things really do happen in our schools and to our children, which is what kept me intrigued. I have worked with troubled children in the court system and counseled them at my own private practice and I'm always looking for books like this that will help me to see some of the signs before a tragedy like this happens. Thank you Ms. Picoult for creating yet another wonderful and realistic story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great storytelling at its best.  Truly a &#34;can't put it down&#34; type of novel because this s based on a real event that we all have heard about.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show I have ever watched I just can't get enough I wish it ran a new episode 5 days a week!!!!!!!!!!  Great surprises, exciting turns of events and keeps you watching you just can't take your eyes off for minute.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The first half of this book is excellent.  Second half falls down just a bit but not enough to make me abandon it.  Typical good read from Lee Child.
B001AW156U|5.0|This product came in 4 days after purchase and was greatly satisfied as it was from CA and I'm in Tx. The product was as shown in seller's pictures and provides easier shooting if you switch the R1 and R2 buttons for L1 and L2 like in the game Call of Duty: Black Ops II. I highly recommend this product.

B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Superb performance by Academy Award Winner Helen Mirren.  From the scenes of the Queen receiving guests in business dress complete with purse to the scenes of her driving her SUV all over the estate grounds the movie is a birds eye view of a most unusual life of a modern day queen.  Recommend ...
B009HEMJCW|4.0|It was fun and funny and touching and I very much enjoyed it.  In a world of raunchy and/or violent movies, light whimsey was fun.  It's a great movie for folks like me who are getting tired of gutter language, sex whose purpose is not romance but to show off some girls bod, and violence, violence & more violence.  It's not that I think all modern movies are bad - far from it.  Some are very good and some are great.  But the majority of modern movies are third and fourth rate copies of the good movies and/or sequals to earlier movies that may or may not have been good to begin with.<br /><br />For all of those of you who are discovering they much prefer movies made before 1960, please try Penelope.
B0076UXKDG|4.0|My rating would have been 5 stars if not for the high cost of this grip. I purchased another grip prior to the Nikon brand, because of cost of the original. After using the other grip for some time, I came to the conclusion that even though it was fulfilling it's intended purpose it just did not feel right in my hands, was slightly bigger and had started to give me some battery issues, mainly draining of the battery, the grip I initially purchased it's made my meike. Ordered the Nikon grip and paid the premium of the original brand and I have no regrets in doing so, the grip feels solid, and the rubber feels like it is not going to slip from your hands and because it is slightly smaller, at least for me it's more comfortable when shooting outdoors for a few hours. I am very satisfied with making this purchase.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|I am so glad I got the actual CD for Cher Lloyd's album; the album booklet is a little fold-out poster (she is so pretty) and the songs are really good.

B007H1HQW0|1.0|This bottle cutter works on about every 5th bottle. Many times you do not get a nice cut the way the video shows.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I thought last season started out pretty raw, but was blown away by this season's openers! I like this season, but am equally disturbed by it. Instead of last season's ghost story format, this season is twisted, bizarre, sadistic, and thoroughly enjoyable. But, that's only my opinion. I'm a horror fan from waaaaaay back, and AHS Asylum reminds me of horror novels more than movies. Your imagination plays a huge part in reading a scary story; AHS is imagining for me... and maybe beyond me...
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I remember watching Ed Sheeran's videos on youtube before his debut CD came out.<br />He is a great artist and musician.
B003ODL004|5.0|I have heard lots of soundtracks but this is one of a kind and one that comes once in a while or may be I don't know lifetime. Words are not enough to describe the experience. Oscar nominated for \\"Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Score\\"
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is awesome. Definitely a page turner. It's cute and has an unaccepted ending! It will keep you on the edge of you seat!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Very entertaining for the whole family.  Just out and out a good time.  Great precursor to 'The Avengers.'  Can't beat it.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I would not give five stars to each of the tracks. There are a small number of  gross misinterpretations, and some don't quite make it, Many are very good, but to a greater degree there is genius in the interpretations  a significant number of his songs. Some are among the most astounding tracks I own. Many put a spin on this iconic music that has gives additional depth and enjoyment to a vast amount of material (I believe 76 tracks). The range from folk, rock, country, reggae, pop, international, is phenomenal. This is an entire collection ranging from the angry and political to the etherial and romantic. Great artists performing great work with excellent style throughout.
B004478GNI|5.0|Rare lego set. I surprised my boy with this and he was delighted. Great price and I received it rather quickly.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My husband and I love our apartment, but there are the usual issues of sharing one's walls with others. Thanks to this program, we now sleep like babies in spite of the noise around us. We have used a different sound almost every night, and the only ones I don't like are the &#34;noises&#34; - White, Brown and Pink. The nature sounds are wonderful - there must be at least six different types of rain sounds alone. We don't use the musical choices as much, but sometimes they are nice in combo with one of the other favorites. I started with the free version, but quickly upgraded - for only $3.99! - because we liked it so much and knew we'd appreciate the variety. This is one of the best apps I've ever bought!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is perfect, all it needs now is water / lava buckets and the Nether. I would also think some more mobs would be really great. The one thing I wonder about is that there is a section that has a multiplayer tab and it says &quot; Searching for WI-FI signal.&quot; And no matter how long I wait, nothing happens. Other than those things, I think this game is the best that I have on my Kindle Fire. Best $6.99 I ever spent on the App Store.
0316228532|3.0|I loved the Harry Potter books, some more than others but read them all.  So I was expecting the same level of page turning with this.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />Maybe one of the problems is that the Potter books had characters the reader liked and was interested in.  This book really had not a single character that I would want to share a cup of coffee with.  They were all either folks you feel sorry for or folks you would go to the other side of the street or town to avoid.<br /><br />I finished the book and maybe I got a bit of information about life in a small town in the UK and the interactions of the various parts of that society.  The writing is not bad and the editing was done well.  That is the reason my rating is not lower.
B008YJFDQK|5.0|I love the soul, depth and feeling Ben puts into all of his work.  His range of music is impressive whether he's playing kick ass rock or a heart-touching ballad.  He never disappoints.
B000FBJHZS|1.0|I bought this book when I had 2 hours to kill, but I only made it to about page 10. I love science fiction, but this was entirely pseudo-science. In the first few pages the heroine takes a flight several thousand miles in the backseat of a military fighter. The airplane lands on an unmarked ice sheet runway (no chance). The airplane deposits her and flies home. (No refueling needed!)  Then, she finds a giant laser is boring a hole several hundred feet through solid ice. Excuse me, but this could not work - the melted ice would just refreeze. Where does the electric power come from to run the laser? It would be much more realistic to use the same amount of fuel to drill through the ice, etc.<br /><br />So I don't know if the plot is any good. Judging by the Da Vinci code which consisted of made-up half-truths but had a good plot, this plot might be ok. But the violations of physical and technology laws of the world were too much for me.<br /><br />Save your money, buy a real techno-thriller by someone who knows something about the subject, or buy some science fiction.
B0045XKJBI|4.0|I like it and my Granddaughter loves it!  She had to get caught up before going to the premier of Part 2.
B005LAIGZU|1.0|Badly written and horribly acted. It's unwatchable. I couldn't make it more than 20 minutes.<br /><br />The only reason anyone can say they liked this movie was for the action sequences, which are straight out of a video game.<br /><br />I'd rather spend two hours watching someone play Modern Warfare.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to see and use ya da ya da ya da x x x x x x x xx x
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My daughter could hardly wait to get this book.  Then she received a kindle for her birthday and this was the first download she purchased
B008393Q2O|5.0|I was looking for note system that is simple and easy to use, and that is what SkinnyNotes has created. They didn't muck it all up with fancy gadgets or buttons to do everything. It just allows you to make a note...  Awesome job!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter downloaded it and then the whole family started.  It is a very fun and challenging game. We love to play
B009VB97EY|4.0|Fun to watch, Channing is quite nice to look at.  Obviously a &#34;chick flick&#34;, my husband turned his head.  Entertaining.
1439152802|5.0|I read many books and I loved this one! It was well written and kept me on my toes. It's one of those books that you don't want to put down.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Conventional wisdom would argue that Dr.Eben Alexander was sufferring from some kind of hallucination due to the infection in his brain. However the fact that he is a Neurosurgeon gives him a level of credibility and knowledge that most other people who have &#34;near death&#34; experiences lack. A book that certainly makes you think, and makes you realize how little we really know about the human mind and life and death. If it weren't for the fact that a close relative of mine also had a rather odd &#34;near death&#34; experiance a few years ago, I would probably have dismissed this story as nonsense. Now, I am not sure sure!
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Big stars, lots of action and a great script. This is an awesome action/suspense thriller. The actors were great especially my boy Benicio del Toro! And Selma even with that wig you are still as hot as ever.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE PINTEREST! I recommend everyone to get one! It is so much fun to pin clothes and makeup and fun thing like that!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.  I was pretty lost when I watched the job series.  Now I can put the pieces together when I sit and watch the series  with my husband.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|It was funny how inaccurate this app was. It would clearly be raining outside, but the app would tell me it was sunny. So glad that this was only a dollar. I couldn't bring myself to suggest anyone to pay more than that.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Di Capprio plays Billy Costigan a brilliant state trooper with a family history of deviants, who wants to attone for it by being a cop and is offered by a state trooper captain and staff sergeant a chance to do so by infiltrating the South Boston Irish mob run by Frank Costello. A mad man who will liquidate anyone or anything that gets in his way who has a state trooper named Collin Sullivan whose on the rise in the state troopers that answers to Costello, his job is find the rat in Costello's organization. Billy lives a tenuos life straddling both worlds, and gets freaked when Costello chooses to use a different crew and is splattered with blood. Billy eventually discovers Costello's rat, and tries to bring in Sullivan who begs for him to kill him. But dies at the hands of Costello's FBI rat, and to rub salt into the wound is given a funeral with full honors and the medal of merit. Sullivan is eventually killed by the staff sergeant, the camera focusing on a rat scurrying across the windowsill. A great movie for all those that like crime movies.
B003OJBWGK|4.0|Best Coast's Surf pop gem \\"Crazy for You\\" is a short and sweet album that just feels really good to listen to. The album uses its pop song mentality to strengthen its theme of obsession (i.e. the repetition), and goes from innocent longing for a guy to addressing the fact that she might actually be crazy for getting with him. If there is one fault to the album, it is having \\"When I'm With You\\" after \\"Each and Every Day.\\" The latter is just a perfect end to the album, and then the former comes in and ruins it. One way to remedy this is to place it in a different spot on the album in iTunes (or whatever else you use). Sadly, you cannot do this to the disc.<br /><br />All in all, this album is fun and even deep, and should definitely be given a listen.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Conor and Murphy McManus have abandoned their roles of vigilantes and retreated with their father to Ireland, until they hear of a neighborhood priest being killed and made to look just like them. The brothers gather up their tools of their trade and go to Boston to pay back the man foolish enough to frame them, they meet up with Romeo a skilled fighter they put in their ranks and begin hunting down the Yakevetta family for the hit. Eventually they meet up with their freinds on the Boston police and the woman who replaces Paul Smecker named Eunice Bloom, their father eventually comes to Boston as well and tells them of their grandfather who was killed in New York by mobsters and how he and his freind Louie made the leather vest he uses for his bloody work and how when the mob wouldn't stop he wouldn't stop. Louie using Noah the boys father managed to garner a place in the Yakevetti family, then Noah had his sons and Louie betrayed him to the police. For twenty-five years he kept the boys and their father apart, twenty-five years and still they mirrored him. Eunice upon learning of Louie begs the saints, that if they get the chance if its possible at all please, please kill this man. A great movie with a killer ending that's one of those that keeps getting good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun. I live it and how you can play a bunch of games and win points
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is quite addicting and a lot better than I expected. definately worth the free download!!<br />needs very little fixes. nothing really to complain about
B0086213XW|1.0|Huh?  What?  Review?  Oh, I'm sorry, this movie put me to sleep.  There are some more prurient reasons as to why a man might watch this movie.  A Google search can satisfy you on that end.  As for the movie itself, it did not hold my interest, and I'm someone who can watch movies like this if the story is interesting, but it was not.
0307744434|5.0|I am a voracious reader, and The Night Circus is at the top of my all-time favorite books.  I loved the story and became lost in the vibrantly descriptive sceens that expanded my imagination. I loved the book so much that after I finished reading it and began another book, I put the other book away and re-read The Night Circus again within two weeks. I didn't want it to end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love playing this since i was little using cards, still love playing it but on my kkindle fire hd. very addictive.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I loved it. So did my friend. So when he came and we played on my kindle and when we were playing it froze. We turned it off and it would not turn on. Later I had to go on the net to get advice. It finally turned on but was frustrating. Great game keep it up rovio but it froze my kindle witch took away two stars overall 3 stars.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Keeps your interest. Good good good good to to to to to to read read read read, whY require using so many words
B0086700CM|1.0|I have known it forever. I downloaded it on my tablet and tried it. Its OK at first. Then it gets really boring.Runs poorly on kindle fire. I thought it would be better.<br />All you really do is run away from evil skull monkeys in a temple and turn jump and slide. Boring.
B008Y1YK0I|1.0|the blu ray 2 disk set i just received from amazon is defective. the slection screen plays ok, but when 'play movie' is selected, just the sound plays - the screen is black. i listened for several minutes, thinking it might be some artsy music-only opening, but after 4 minutes i still didn't have a picture.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds my world favorite!!!!!! It is awesome and I would recommend this game to anywone who is looking for a great game to kill time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it starts out very easy but becomes more difficult as you progress.  helps keep your mind sharp.! a friend recently had brain surgery and I let him use this game to assist with his rehab.
0553062182|4.0|I am an HSP but unlike a lot of people I accepted myself a long time ago and felt I had the right to be who I was especially as I was not harming anyone or committing crimes. Why should other people care about how others live their lives as it is supposed to be a free country, isnt it? The answer to all this is knowledge and finding the right fit in work, social life and relationships. If someone is highly social I know I dont try to curtail them and tell them they are wrong for having that trait so why do people think its okay to push people like me around so that we fit in? The fact is is that its very rude and bullying to push others to be a certain way so I suggest the problem lies with those who cannot for some reason mind their own business and leave others alone. People like me get things done because we are not distracted by being social and trying to be accepted by pretending to be the life of the party. There are many people out there who are sensitives who have ruined their lives by trying to be something they are not and this is why so many people abuse drugs and alcohol. People drink to fit in and make it easier to socialize because it is not their true nature to be outgoing. Why cant we accept ourselves and raise our children to be self accepting so we can socialize or not or stay at home with a small circle of friends and family.  If we were more accepting of peoples differences we would not have so many kids killing themselves because they feel they do not fit in.  It is not normal or natural to be out there getting drunk and high on drugs and sexing with anybody to fit in.  It is abherrant behaviour and leads to tragedy. I did not like her advice about trying to fit in in the workforce as I believe we should have careers that suit our temperament instead of all this expending energy being who we are not.  Its time that the socials respect the fact that not everyone wants to gossip and go find others that do and let us get on with our work as we arenot harming anyone. Social people have a right to live according to their nature and so do we. Lets accept diversity instead of trying to get everyone to be a stepford man or woman. Anyway computers have seen the emergence of the nerd and thank God for that. The culture is changing  and its about time.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Enjoyable, thought-provoking, inspiring. Tries, and for the most part succeeds, to imagine how it must feel to be disabled and scorned. The real heroes of the story in my opinion is not only the disabled person (who after all is just a brave boy who endures the stares and unthinking comments in order to attend school, but in large part, those who look beyond horrendous surface differences, and accept the human being within.<br /><br />I would give this a 4.5 for the writing and the concept--the end was a little saccharin sweet to be realistic.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|Fairly interesting, somewhat haphazardly edited. For diehard Who fans, but it could have been better. Love you anyway Pete, cheers.
0316228532|2.0|Ok, I loved the Harry Potter series. Every word in those books had a reason and purpose. That being said, this book has more words than it needs and I found the frequent use of the \\"f word\\" gratuitous and grating. There are too many characters circling around each other and it takes way too long for the story to gel. It meanders along for hundreds of pages. I found most of the characters vapid and predictable. The ending is inevitable and essentially it all comes down to everyone spending too; much time minding everyone else's business and ignoring those closest to them.  I was disappointed to say the least and I doubt I will read any other of her adult novels. If J K would like to explore the characters she left behind in the HP series I could be persuaded to give her another try. Until then, I would rather reread Harry.
141659521X|1.0|I would normally give a Flynn book 4 or stars but this is the second Vince Flynn book that I will be reading from a library copy. I realize that if everybody did this it might cause some writer's to quit writing. That would be my loss but I refuse to pay $15 for a kindle copy when hardcover is only $16. I would be interested in seeing a cost and sales breakdown comparison between hardcover vs. paperback vs. e-book. In other words, would the author get more if the e-book volume doubled or more at a lower price point?
B004GYY714|3.0|Exceptional product created to tune in to radio stations all over the world however Stations sometimes pause and skip but overall it's a good app.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|It's very believable, with nothing so way out, that destroys the credibility of the author.  If you are really looking for truth, then this is worth a read.
0547884591|4.0|I read the 4 hour work week at least 5 or 6 times over the years and managed to apply a lot of it in my life and more than that it showed that there are alternative ways to work / live.  I bought the 4 hour body last year (kindle version) and although I didn't apply a whole lot to my every day life I enjoyed it.  I bought the 4 hour chef with very little in terms of expectations but I'm a fan of him and his books so I was definitely going to add this to my collection.<br /><br />I own a ton of cook books , have a ton of equipment and tools and actually enjoy spending hours putting a great dish together.  This core of this book is aimed at people who don't want to or can't do that and that is why I wasn't expecting a whole lot.  This book is actually very nice looking and more than anything, incredibly entertaining.  Flipping through the book before sitting down to read and landing on a page where he shows how to catch, clean and roast a squirrel gave me a good hint that this book was unique.<br /><br />His very informal writing style and constant jumping from topic to completely different topic may bother some people especially if you haven't read his other books but stick with it.  You can tell he is passionate about the book and that he wanted it to be great and I think he succeeded!<br /><br />UPDATE: Changed to 4 stars because the recipes did skip too many of the finer details that take these recipes from ordinary to great.  Still recommend it though for entertainment and other things you can get out of the book
B007N6NGYG|2.0|a bit hard for my 4 year old. But he is obsessed with trains so we had to give it try.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|You be the judge!  Just buy it and enjoy!<br />Every time I've listened while out or home to \\"Home\\" for the past months, I couldn't wait to hear more from Phillip Phillips.<br />I was so hoping that his new songs wouldn't be disappointing.<br />Good news!!!  They're great!! Each one better than the other..  Just do it! Buy it!<br />You'll love it!<br />Sandi
B007N8RULO|3.0|just another card game to keep me busy on the train ride home. I like the 4 suit feature, makes the game more challenging than regular freecell.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the music of today but my sons turned me onto this album. It's now one of my favorites !
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I really loved the movie i watched all the old dark shadows an this one was more modern and the actors was good
B0042GNDO8|5.0|To think you can get all the classic performances for the price is ridiculous! I shouldn't really have to say more to any fan of Heifetz, if you're here reading this, stop and go add it to your cart!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you are up to season  you already know how awesome it is and won't be spending time reading reviews!
B000R4SMCW|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this movie, but a friend of mine said I had to get it. So I did, am glad I did, it's not a typical movie, I really got into this movie, even though you know who did the murder, it gets suspenseful! I think anyone who likes murder, suspense will really enjoy this movie! 🎉
B001NEK2GE|4.0|This product does everything that I wanted it to do. The one thing that i overlooked however is that when I chat during games and use my keyboard I have to abandon my gameboard and I find myself just reverting back to using my keyboard presets!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very fun. It takes time to build up but its well worth it. My kids also enjoy it. The best part is that if you just are willing to wait then you don't have to spend money.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|it is the best cover and so glad I purchased it and the price was good as well good choice
0786956291|5.0|It has a a set of 6 dice, not 7. But the double map and tokens are cool. Great way to show sone one how to play 4th edition.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This show never gets old... it just keeps getting better and better... i definitely own every season out right now and cant wait for season 8...
B000063IPX|4.0|When i got this cd the album cover looked faded so immediately i thought it was not legitimate and somebody had just burned it off a computer and made the album cover themselves. Then the actual cd looked somewhat legit but im pretty sure the black sabbath cds look different than what this one looked like, AND sabotage was spelled S-A-B-B-O-T-A-G-E (on the disc) I listened to the cd and all the songs sounded fine so i dont know.... it was 1.89 so i guess thats what i get. All my other cds i got were perfect though so overall I'm happy.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I love this concert as much as the next person, but when I bought it for my mom's 50th birthday, she jumped up and down and cried the happiest tears!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|It's a thought-provoking movie (though admittedly politically charged). Natalie Portman does a great job in this movie, and the overall plot was very well executed.
0451418441|5.0|Have watched the TV series over and over.  Can't wait to read the book to see if I missed anything.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|this books is a must read , it's interesting and u just love how weird charlie is . please read it , i so recommend it and the author is just amazing as well ..
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is fun filled survival game and its even better now that you can play multiplayer so this way you and four friends can fight evil together
B008VVT51U|5.0|Judy Dench is wonderful in this amazing cast of characters. Great seeing so much talent in one movie. In a day and age when youth and beauty are so prized it is so good to be able to see a movie of \\"old pros\\".  A truly funny and heartwarming movie with depth. For all ages except young children.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A wonderful tale of adventure and fulfilled destiny. It is a wonderful &#34;hero journey&#34; which can be read simply for pleasure, or a book of depth that explores the spiritual expedition that we all experience as human beings
B007ZBWJXI|3.0|Bought two one for friend 60 birthday and one for myself. Was supposed to be CD & Bonus DVD and only got the CD and no Bonus DVD.
B0002V7O3I|2.0|Explorers is a sci-fi fantasy story about three boys who travel in a makeshift spacecraft, and make first contact with an alien race. There are sly references to science fiction classic novels and movies, a chance encounter with advanced alien technology, and three archetypal young friends (the thinker, the feeler, and the rebel outsider). With positive reviews on Amazon and Netflix, I thought I had a real winner. Unfortunately, the movie felt extremely flat, boring, and severely dated.<br /><br />Cinema is a medium of a particular time and place, rarely transcending those constraints. Most of the movies produced in Hollywood are conventional, conservative, and mired in present day ideas. Although Hollywood considers itself highly progressive, embracing progressive causes, supporting democrats, inserting political messages in the script, it is actually hidebound and derivative, with a few exceptions. This movie surprised me, it was so dull, lifeless, and, well, dead. I might as well be reading Cicero, so old and dated did it seem. I know that Cicero says important things, his writing is a classic, etc, but that doesn't make reading him fun. This movie doesn't really say anything, and it should be fun, because it doesn't have anything else going for it.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix are here as young teens. Phoenix already has that unhappy presence which made me think of his drug overdose and death on a sidewalk, outside of an LA nightclub. The dialogue is klunky and artificial, not at all like real life. We accept current modes of movie dialogue without question, but within a few years it becomes unbearable. If I had seen this movie in 1985, I probably would have overlooked the shortcomings, but now it just looks ridiculous. Most of today's movies will soon look the same way.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I feel as though man has his ups and down, and in the end, we're here to live a new day, with new choices that can change everything. I gave this book five stars just for that, because for those of us that have our bad days and good days, we have another chance, and in the end, we can't be perfect. So, for all you people like Charlie, be a Wallflower, and try not to misshape your life with the things you choose.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I may be bias because I am a huge TSwift fan but this is definitely one of her best albums! Love the whole albums!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love playing this. Coin regens are a little slow, but it's a lot of fun anyway. Lots of action when certain coins are dropped.
B009A9EQL6|5.0|Aerosmith's new cd has been getting alot of negative reviews but I think it is a great cd! Yes It is not Rocks but it is up their with Pump their last great cd in my book. I got the deluxe version that has three extra songs and a cool dvd with live stuff and interviews. I like the ballads. What Could Have Been Love is a great song and should be a huge hit. There are alot of hard rocking songs too.  Street Jesus kicks ass!! and reminds me of the early stuff.  Joe Perry tunes are good but I am a huge Joe Perry Project fan so Joe can't do wrong for me. Don't listen to all the people who put this cd down. I am glad I didn't listen to them. Rock out and enjoy!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this story very much. I loved the way Flynn told the story using the diary format to portray the&#34;missing&#34; character, allowing her to have a voice in the story as well. The twist and turns keep you reading non stop. I literally read this book in one sitting!
B001VLXNO2|4.0|Have always been intrigued by people seeking to achieve great heights on various mountain peaks.  This author has certainly produced an outstanding novel and I so enjoyed every page - what a story teller, and I would like to believe that in fact George Mallory did reach the summit.  Was sad when the book came to the end. Reading this book I challenge any reader to skip any pages - you just can't do that with this book.<br /><br />Elaine Taylor
0385508476|5.0|This is not a small book, big sized 851 pages in small letter fonts. There is lot of introduction, extensive references to correlate events during world War II.  There are several pages from the actual diary which shows Anne's wonderful handwriting. My daughter is fascinated with Anne's diary and was the inspiration to write her own writing with fountain pen. Anne speaks the truth in her diary and truth hurts. her diary is riveting and moving account. I wonder how much such diary of youngsters were lost or burnt along with millions of people. There are classic photographs also in the book.<br /><br />The stories are moving. Anne also has a sense of humor during the bitter war times. One example. Diary from 2 May 1943. Our food is miserably poor. Dry bread and coffee substitute for breakfast. dinner spinach or lettuce for 14 days on end. Potatoes 20 cm long tasting sweet and rotten. Whoever wants to slim should stay in the Secret Annex! It is a moving tale hitting us in the hearts the realities of war.
0547564651|5.0|I was a teacher and now a stay at home mom.  I really enjoyed this book.  The research is thorough and eloquently written.  The information is astounding.  I wish more administrators and politicians would read this or anyone that is participating in a \\"character education\\" program.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't know how they do it but every episode gets better. The plot turns are excellent. Quite possibly the best show on t.v.
B0094FQZTM|5.0|The scarred people will bring you back to the classic wildhoney and deeper kind of slumber tiamat era. Every track on the scarred people are as close to music perfection as you can get.
0385535147|5.0|WOW what a story...half way thru and cannot put it down. Grisham is one of the best writers today, keep those great ones coming.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Title says it all. Time killer but is super slow moving. The story version is more fun in my opinion but whatever.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game i have played it makes work hard to get more games and since it takes along time to get points
B009NCM248|5.0|The album comes out firing on all cylinders with Gone Sovereign/Absolute Zero.  The rest of the song match the first two making a very consistent and enjoyable musical experience.  Influence of a Drowsy God is one of my favorites.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|4.5 stars. HOLY, what just happened? The last 20% of this book was amazing and had me feeling like I couldn’t read fast enough. I love a little suspense and mystery and boy oh boy did this ending pack a punch. I didn’t see it coming…at all. Obviously, I don’t want to spoil the experience for anyone else who has yet to read it so I will zip it (although I really feel like gushing about certain tender, heart bursting moments and barfing out a bunch of theories and questions…and maybe doing a few fist pumps).<br /><br />So why not a full 5 stars? I LOVED Bared to You, I LOVE Gideon and Eva and I loved (lower case love) Reflected in You. That said, I was a teeny tiny bit frustrated with Reflected in You. I just felt like there was a lot of confusion and lack of communication throughout the story that we barely moved forward (YES, some major ground was covered but not until the last 25%). Eva & Gideon just seemed to sabotage any progress they made as a couple. The entire book was an emotional roller coaster peppered with a few moments of utter happiness. In the end, I totally understood it and it was worth it, but it made the middle of the book drag a tad. The last 20% was like piecing together an amazing puzzle and was so thrilling to read. It was like unraveling a mystery with very little information (which made it even better). My brain is still trying to piece everything together.<br /><br />So what I say now will shoot down the validity of my little complaint above. I have to say that Sylvia Day is an excellent storyteller. The storyline revolves around a couple who individually are struggling with a horrific past. We know why both Gideon and Eva are damaged and somewhat broken; they’re both survivors of abuse. Sylvia Day doesn’t just drop the bomb of their past and then moves right along on; she has built a story about two people dealing with how their past has come to define them in every way. We see them growing little by little and learning to moveforward and heal. As frustrated as I get with Eva & Gideon, they are authentic characters. We understand WHY they have acted the way they have in the past and how it has shaped their relationships both sexual and platonic. We learn WHY they still struggle with certain triggers and irrational feelings/fears of abandonment, jealousy and self-loathing. Sylvia Day has written such strong characters and has kept Gideon & Eva’s makeup consistent throughout the story. Even when the way they’re reacting isn’t rational, it makes total sense.<br /><br />Book 3 cannot come fast enough for me. The last 30% of this book had me starved for our Gideon. I need full blown Eva & Gideon back STAT. The intensity of their love for one another is unmatched and their distance from each other was hard to handle. I have so many more questions for book 3 and so much ground needs to be covered! I need answers, I need closure and I need happiness for Gideon & Eva because god knows they deserve it.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has been heart breaking,mind blowing and Earth shattering all at once! twists at every turn and &#34;Biters&#34;around every corner! There has been some sad moments as we loose some characters that have been around from the beginning and at least one character that re-emerges from the past whom we assumed was dead and turned walker.this is a great show that explores what the limit of humans are capable of in extreme situations(both good and bad)&#34;.The hard part about about being in a zombie apocalypse will be pretending I'm not excited&#34;(from a bumper sticker)
0689504764|5.0|This is a wonderful detailed book with great pictures. My son is only two and loves this book alt. We read it during nap time and he goes to bed reading it by himself.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Fun strategy game for the whole family, but even more fun with competitive friends.  No two runs are the same.  The game mechanics are fairly simple and can be learned in under an hour.  The game dynamics are complex and ever-changing, which is why this award-winning game stays at the top of our game night list.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Every American must see this movie before it is too late.  Ten years from now this country will be left with no gas, no oil and no clean water.  Water is one of the keys to human life.  We bought ten copies to loan to people because we feel strongly that our natural resources should not be stolen by rich special interests who care not for our children's future.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Jack Reacher happens to be at the wrong place at the right time.  He gets off a bus and finds himself the perfect scapegoat for a murder that took place in a small town controlled by corrupt people.  But they messed with the wrong guy, he had close ties to the murdered person.  He turns the tables on them which lands him in a heap of money - literally.  The plot is clever and the story moves fast and keeps you glued.  Loved it.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|The round ends before the last number is called and they call the numbers way too quickly. If the last number is your winning bingo number, you won't have time to even touch it or hit bingo. Kind of Sucks. Worse if you play two or more cards.
0316187216|5.0|I've read all of the previous Abercrombie books, and I have to say; this is his best written book yet. As always, there is brutal violence, black humor, and most importantly, realistic characters. However, I did feel that this book flowed much more smoothly than any previous ones. I'm not entirely sure that this is my favorite Abercrombie book (I love the characters in the First Law trilogy too much for that) but as far as the pure quality of the writing, this is the best. Red Country combines the medieval grittiness for which he is famous into a western setting without a single misstep. Also, having one of my favorite fantasy book characters of all time make a return didn't hurt.
0385535147|5.0|As always, this was a wonderful read.  John Grisham is one of the best writers there is and I will always buy his books as soon as they come out.  The only trouble is, that he does not write fast enough and it is hard to wait for the next book to come out.  The Racketeer was an exceptional book and I could not put it down.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|The game itself is good, although the touch response as far as moving the 'sheild' back and forth could be better.  Until I find another better app, this is totally passable as a good game to kill time.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has done it again with CIA agent Mitch Rapp!  As per usual his cool, no-nonsense attitude kept me up reading well into the night.  He is the hero that everyone wants on their side and he always gets the rat!  The intrigue, lies, corruption and loyalty make for a heck of a read, can't wait for the next installment.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I don't know if there are better apps than this but this is keeping my interest up and passing my time while I play chess on my tablet.  I'm not a hardcore chess player so I don't know what I'm am and not looking for.  But for basic chess, it works!
0385338910|5.0|I was especially pleased to see that this book took on a somewhat different tone that his later books. I have seen the common thread that runs through these books: male protagonist has to return home after some sort of family crisis and has somehow screwed up almost every relationship that ties said main character to his home town. Craziness ensues and relationships are usually mended. Well, this book still starts with a crisis - Doug's wife has died (no plot spoiler here folks, you could have guessed it from the title) and our good friend, Doug, isn't doing so well. Alas, craziness ensues (it's not a true Tropper novel without that piece) and this time, rather than those relationships being mended, it's Doug who is pieced back together. Yes, many similarities, but I liked the slight change of pace of this novel.<br /><br />And as always, Tropper paints the perfect portrait of the a-typical, dare I say modern family. It's that loving, quirky bunch that's straight out of a movie (I still picture Lucille from Arrested Development as the mother). It's that group of people that show flashes of your own family. You laugh a little, you cry a little, and you ultimately come out on the other side with a different perspective on grief and healing.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was interesting and a decent story but there was no feeling in this story.  No passion, nothing to get you very involved in the characters.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Not one character to like even a tiny bit..they were all nasty, selfserving !<br />Had looked forward to reading the first adult book by Rowling.  I will return to Harry to re-read if I want another dose of Rowling!
B0071QIN00|5.0|i think this game is amazing and pretty cheap for the hours of challenging moments there was.  This game got way better from the first one so Get It!!!!!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Panther...DeMillle<br />Thought the book was very interesting..rather timely..two days after I read it, there was news on Yemen and the towns that were central to the book elither on TV or in the newspaper.  I have read most of Demille's books and love the hero's and the humor he injects in his characters.

B004GYY714|4.0|A lot of folks like Clear Channel's iheart radio app - but I find this one easier to navigate and seemingly with more stations... I'm not counting, so that's just an assumption. Try it, you'll like it!
B00584UD32|2.0|The CD has the sound that you used to hear on cassettes, this kind of shhshhshh.  I did not expect that. I have a HiFi system that revealed right away the true quality of this CD. I have not idea whether it is related with this mastering or with the K2 mastering in general.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the story and it kept me interested but the ending was extremely disappointing.  I've heard this from others who have also read this book.
0812452240|3.0|Make sure you look at the size of the book before you buy & know this is what you want.  This book is the size of a paperback and the font is VERY small.  I got it for my nephew who can read small font, but if this was for my elderly eyes it would have been sent back!
B009DT98RK|5.0|I was at the NYC Beacon Theatre show... It was-- in a word--  fantastic !  I was in High School when FCA came out, so hearing songs from that album triggers many fond memories for me.<br />Frampton is given MAJOR props for being a stellar guitarist, and sometimes I think the great songs he has released (the Hits) overshadow his guitar talent.<br />Listening to what is played on the radio does NOT do this man JUSTICE.... Seeing him LIVE, will blow you away....<br />He was WAY more than what I expected ... It was a GREAT show and I think this DVD will really reveal the fact that he is undoubtedly one of the most highly under rated guitarists of our time.<br />If you have been deciding on whether to purchase this DVD, take a leap of faith, I do not think that Peter will disappoint.<br />I'm looking forward to seeing the show again !!
B009X01C64|5.0|I like this case quite a bit and find it to be of high quality and good design for the most part.  The Kindle Fire HD fits VERY tightly into the plastic holder on the case, so you don't have to worry about it falling out.  It was, in fact, fairly difficult to get the final corner to click in place, but that is okay, as I know that it will be secure.  The tri-fold design allows you to stand the Kindle on end or in landscape.  The plastic housing has a protrusion that slides into grooves on the third panel of the case when standing the Kindle in landscape.  This is very nice and allows you to have three different viewing angles.<br /><br />When folded over to hold the Kindle vertically, the case has a large, sturdy, strap to place your hand in to hold the device.  This is especially useful, as the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" is moderately heavy.  This is more useful than it sounds, so you will want to try it when you get the case... you will be pleased.<br /><br />You can rotate the Kindle 360 degrees so it can be in horizontal orientation with the ports on top for charging.  I originally thought that this was impossible, as the rotation was very stiff and I didn't want to break the case.  It turns out that the case just needed to be broken in a bit and now it is PERFECTION!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />FOR FULL DISCLOSURE, HERE IS MY ORIGINAL PROBLEM WITH THE CASE:<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the lack of a cutout for the power adapter to be placed at the top of the device.  Including a cutout at the top would have allowed the Kindle to be inserted into the case with the USB and HDMI ports facing up, allowing you to charge the Kindle or have it connected to an external display while standing horizontally if the Kindle was put in with the ports up.  As it stands, you cannot have the power plugged in and have the Kindle standing horizontally at the same time.<br /><br />Beyond that concern, this is an excellent case and is highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game is horrible because a glitch caused me to lose 25 buildings that took me a month to work on. If you want something like a castle to be deleted, you might want this game. But, PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GAME
B0096PAA6E|3.0|Gary Clark burst on the scene on the back of a few big hits on his EP recording. Some electric, others acoustic, but they had a common thread that held them together. Blak & Blu is an eclectic mix of very different types of music. I liked most of the songs, but when you listen to the CD in total, you wonder how it all fits together. My sense is Gary Clark is still searching for his voice and his sound. He has the guitar chops, just doesn't know what he wants to be when he grows up.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, shots so well framed that they are literally moving pictures. The black and white scenes interlaced with shooting colors reflect the overall feel of Mylo Xyloto. Chris Martin states the inspiration for the album came from the image of a red rose shooting up from the concrete and it is clearly reflected in their performances. Coldplay is not simply a band but a collection of real artists. The interviews in between songs give insight and make the members real and human. Any fans of U2's Rattle and Hum will instantly spot the influences it had on the creation of Live 2012. This is an absolute must own for any fan of Coldplay and fan of great concerts. I will be watching it over and over again. Well worth the $25. And it comes with the live CD! A great bonus and added value!
159562015X|5.0|I and my husband passed this test as a mandatory routine with our firms, and results turned out so true to our personalities. I wonder how they make it - such an accurate definition for each type. Maybe because they ask for an immediate answer (only 20 secs given for each question), so one really has to tell first true thing out of the head without much thinking. The test results became very instrumental in our work and life. So I encourage all my friends and relatives to pass the test right now, if not done so yet :) .
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love Grisham books, the suspense , the true face of the govt at work.<br />The truth is hard to see !!!!!!

B005WFUZTE|4.0|I like this album ( I am old, I can say album instead of disc), besides what do you call it now ... a downloadable compilation of songs released by the same artist on the same date?<br /><br />Anyway see the title, it pretty much says enough to help you decide if you would like this.  I did not like Risk at all, Cryptic writings was OK...  I think 13 is as good as Rust in peace, Countdown to Extinction, and Euthanasia.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game for kids and adults alike!!  My daughter found it and plays it but I like it just as much as she does!

B006PTZNSY|3.0|Not a whole lot of good stuff in this albumn.Half rap,half pop,you get Minaj. Not a bad cd,just a little dissapointing.I think Nicki is very talented,but the rhymes are middle school,and a bit depraved.On the pop stuff her voice passes,theyre fun to move too,and overall the pop stuff was great.<br />I feel that she should waited a little to release this album to put out a better one,it would have been worth the wait.She does all these different voices.Shes Nicki,no Roman,no,someone else,its like listening to different singers at a time,oh well.<br />Take a little break Nicki.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I think this must be the best livealbum ever, listening to track 11 is a blast played on good electronics, just amazing!

She never fails to dissapoint and this albumn is rocking.Fine,she does a song with Chris Brown,who cares? Thats what she wants.She grown up so much and watching her come out with music the past 7 years is such a delight!<br />Great songs,and lots to listen to.Eminem makes an excellent guest star on Riri's albumn,very awesome. Diamonds is the song you'll play over and over again.<br />Rihanna is gold! She is a diamond! Ive been a fan of Rihanna for a really long time,her music is never corny,and doesnt dissapoint.<br />Buy this album!
0470424656|4.0|This is a good book on valuation by applying the discounted cash flow methodology. The book is worth four stars, because it is in no way a perfect book. The book is now in its fifth edition so the material on DCF analysis is solid in my opinion. It covers basics as well as interesting extensions, but also has glaring gaps. For instance you do not get any information about valuing the cost of working capital requirements. The links to accounting are also weak, you would imagine the book would have a section on accounting ratios like ROA, RONA, ROCE. How can you forecast the future without having a good grasp of the past???<br /><br />The book is much weaker when it discusses how to actually forecast cash flows and how the stock market functions. We get to estimate the second decimal of WACC, but hardly learn anything about market share estimation.<br /><br />Instead some fairly junior consultants have read some of the academic literature and done a valiant attempt to summarize it in a traditional consulting style (i.e. with managerial implications). This is actually a bit silly. The content is interesting but the authoritative voice of the authors is a clear sign that they do not know as much as they believe they do. During the last ten years the trend in academic finance has been towards building micro-foundations based on a more realistic description of human actors. The fully rational man is long gone in cutting-edge finance research. I do not think the authors of this book has fully understand the implications of this sea change. They bravely quote research papers (that they don't really understand), but in the end conclude that the markets are so close to rational so one can proceed as if. The book describes some of the anomalies identified in finance research, but hardly touches on the anomalies identified in accounting research. The book also suffers from being written by committee. There is no voice of the author that can guide us trough the material. Instead we get the impersonal style of a university textbook. That makes for dull reading.<br /><br />Still, this book is a buy if you in any way are interested in how to value companies that are quoted in the stock market. The alternative is Damodaran's [[ASIN:111801152X Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset (Wiley Finance)]]. The advantage with Damodaran's book is that it is closer to the cutting edge research. Furthermore, the author has a voice and a very good blog with many useful articles and spreadsheets available for download. If you decide to pick one book, I would go for the current book and then access Damodaran's material through his website. If you are serious, you should buy both books, and probably also an accounting based book on valuation (e.g. [[ASIN:0073379662 Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation]] or [[ASIN:0231151187 Accounting for Value (Columbia Business School Publishing)]] - see my reviews.we get the impersonal style of a university textbook.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love Walking Dead.  It is one of the most dramatic shows that has ever been on television.  You never know what to expect.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Great movie. I will definetly watch it again. Hard hitting. It really makes you think about how you're raising your family.
0307591549|4.0|Well witten and entertaining but would rather have more specifics.  Too many stories promoting the author's successes - a bit overdone. However, an easy read and worthwhile lessons learned about the power of positive behavioral techniques.
B008A1TIOK|5.0|Beautiful! The opening Spring 0 & Spring 1 are hauntingly beautiful. Brilliant, to be able to do that to something (like Max Richter has said) we've heard so much we don't even hear it anymore, don't usually much like it since the repetition of it (from Muzak to commercials to Bob Fosse's \\"It's showtime!\\" in All That Jazz) has dumbed down our ears to its freshness. Vivaldi's The Seasons had become more *about* something than something.<br /><br />But here, Richter reconsiders Vivaldi, and the result is homage.<br /><br />Like two voices in conversation, Vivaldi's and Richter, both repeating and allowing dwelling, in the swell of it, the ebb and flow swelling, the one dancing and bright and now insistent in its youthful gaiety (and your having to hear that) and the other sustaining, mature and yet sure, both compelling in their own way with theme; neither competing, just dialogue in its musically richest sense. And if you're as much a listener as I am, we're drawn in to be part of the conversation too. Brilliant musicianship, in Richter and in Daniel Hope.<br /><br />Love it. Love having my ears (and mind) put back in my head.
B005C7SXNW|3.0|Aside from a pretty cool making-of documentary, this copy of the movie doesn't do the film justice. There are a lot of deleted scenes, however nothing was spoken about the music or Ben Stiller's involvement in producing this movie. The movie is a brilliant piece about awkward years, coming-of-age & finding your comfort with your parents, friends and adolescence. Wonderful movie, not so wonderful Blu-Ray.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Before watching the movie, I wanted to read the book.  This second book does not disappoint.  If you did not read the first book but saw the movie, this picks right up from where the movie left off as well.  A lot of twists and surprises are in store for the reader.  I really enjoyed reading this series!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Worth the read.  Not the same story as the AMC television series but all the entertainment value!  The individual panel reader works well with the Kindle or any Kindle Cloud Reader.
1594135851|4.0|As soon as I read The Hunger Games (book 1) I was stoked to read the second book, catching fire.  As I finished the book, I still had many unanswered questions, but I feel that Collins did a great job writing this and kept true to how I perceived Katniss in the first book.  In this book, I feel like we start to see Katniss mature as well as get a new idea as to how she is changing and growing up, as everything is still from her perspective.  As suspected, I still LOVED certain characters, while others I wanted to punch in the face.  Honestly.  I'm still totally in love with the first book, as that one is my favorite, but I will definitely revisit these books, they are now a staple in my book collection.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I cannot get this game, the graphics are great and sooner or later I will get it. Is there any where to go for hints?
159413586X|4.0|Of the three books, this one left me with the most unanswered questions.... to be honest, I am still confused.  I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, I was just super surprised when I got to the end, I was hoping that there would be some more loose ends that were tied.  As usual, I was sad to see some characters come and some go, but I think that Collins does a good job.  I do question the short and concise ending in relation to her own boredom as a writer with the series, as I myself would have hoped that Katniss would have had some big 'ah-ha' moment, a lot BIGGER then what actually appeared in the book.  Besides that, I know that I will for sure read this trilogy again and I will definitely be there with the movie versions are released into theatres.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|dull, boring, repetitive, predictable - grisham has been a great writer but he's over the hill - why must i write a minimum number of words to say i did not like the damn book?
034580404X|5.0|Okay.... so with the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy.. I have to admit, I have a love/hate relationship with.  On many levels, I kept thinking \\"okay, seriously... no woman is THAT hooked on a guy, and therefore she would NEVER behave in such a overly dependent manor\\" and it made me frustrated with certain situations in the books... but then I realized.... you know what, Christian Grey is supposed to be a crazy millionaire megamind, and if he can exist in James' world, then well, so can the actions of our main character... I'm not a big fan of the S&M bondage scene, so many of these scenes in the book, I felt myself cringing and/or blushing as I read them... but if you can get past those points and realize that this is supposed to be a love story with two individuals who are flawed but certainly have an undying love for each other, then I think you'd like the books.  As I said, if you want something a little bit more true to reality, maybe NOT the best books for you... but something where you can just read almost like brain candy as Anastasia watches and learns about Christian, then you might enjoy these books... smut aside, I actually think that James' does a good job keeping it rather tasteful and I was left questioning that after writing nearly 1800 pages she chose to end it the way she had... but all and all, I will most definitely read these books again.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Nice read that keeps you guessing even after you swear you know the ending. I get bored with these types of stories easy, but this one was very interesting and keeps you sucked in to the story.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie. This is my favorite movie. It keeps you going through the whole movie. One halarious scene to the next. This has to be Will's best selling movie ever. Sure to be a classic!!!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|The title should have shied me away. But, in the end it was fairly entertaining. Plenty of action. Good guys win. Bad guys lose. Good movie to watch when drinking with your buddies.
B007SPPANM|5.0|This movie my daughter really wanted me to buy. Lost my vhs copy so I pre ordered. What a bargain. Ended up watching it myself and this movie has so much feeling. Both Leonardo and Kate were so convincing. They had that magic in this movie. One I love to own!
B000009HF2|5.0|I had to buy because I have to study some songs which appear on an album of the same musician. The product is of excellent quality and made a great purchase. The product arrived on time, intact and in my expectivas.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|wow, not a big fan of musicals, and not realizing this was a musical until watching it. I have to say it was ok. I think the good music got me through it. I think all the actors really did a fantastic job. Tom Cruise did such a great job! And the comedy was ok too. Cant believe Alec Baldwin. What a character! So for the most part I was highly entertained. So I give it 4 stars.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|And never played this movie. I had hoped that it would be a good dvd remaster so finally took it out. I was so pleased to see this old movie looking so damn good. I only watched abit of this and was so Impressed at how nice this looked. I got a good price. Now not sure I will even buy the blu ray version. Great job imho ! Thanks !!:-):-):-):-)
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Cute film, I never really knew the storytale. So i had to find out, and was pleasantly surprised! Great show for adults a young ones.

B000SXJMRQ|5.0|Korn never disappoints me. This album is amazing. I feel like this is definitely one of their best. They're definitely a band that keeps evolving.
B009AMANBA|3.0|As others have noted, this film's title is rather misleading as arguably the prime focus of Spielberg's work is the Thirteenth Amendment moreso than it is the title character.  Uninformed viewers might therefore be disappointed in the limited scope of the film's plot. Though I, myself, knew in advance of its narrow focus, I was disappointed in the film nonetheless.<br /><br />Lincoln is too great a subject to be dealt with in the restrictive fashion of this film.  LINCOLN has a fabulous actor in Daniel Day-Lewis and a legendary director in Steven Spielberg and a cast of top-shelf actors.  It also has perfect costume design and vivid and authentic set design.  What it doesn't have is a very good script.  The script is extremely dense and confusing - even for some Lincoln scholars!  It is also needlessly verbose: for example, in one scene there is a Union general approaching the camera and a subtitle comes on identifying him as General Grant.  In the next scene he is on board the riverboat to which he was headed, and is identified there within the dialog - rendering the subtitle (or which the film has way too many) unnecessary.  There is a structural imbalance in the script also: why introduce Lincoln's dream of himself on a boat steering to an unknown shore and NOT bookend it with Lincoln's precognitive dream of his own death, a dream he had just a day or so before his assassination?  Why set the celebratory church bells and flag-waving crowds at the instant of the amendment's passage and leave naught for the even more immense and joyous (for the people of the North at that time and place) celebratory spirit that exploded upon news of the end of the actual Civil War?  Why have Mary Todd Lincoln mention the fear of assassination once and only once, early in the film, and never bring its dire possibility up again towards the end of the film?  The dramatic possibility was lost, yes, but so was all sense of just how endangered a man Lincoln was - and primarily due (to Booth most-of-all) to his views on race, which would include his determination to have the amendment passed.<br /><br />In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and even WAR OF THE WORLDS, Spielberg peppered his dramas with immense, sprawling, extremely moving battle scenes - especially so with the opening of the former mentioned film.  The mud-pit rumble that opens LINCOLN gives us absolutely no sense at all that the political drama of the passage of the amendment took place whilst brother battled brother leading to the holocaust of 600,000 dead.  To not graphically ground the viewer in the enormity of the stakes involved somehow lessens the vital import of the film's central subject.  By not presenting a more panoramic view of the times and the places involved, the film seems, quite frankly, low budget and  claustrophobic.  The assassination itself is a lost dramatic and poetic opportunity: rather than have the news so poorly paced and abruptly announced in Grover's Theater so that little Tad Lincoln is informed of his father's having been shot, perhaps cutting between father and son watching their respective plays might have not only heightened the climactic moment but also somewhat clarified it as well.  Yes, the scene of Lincoln leaving for Ford's Theater in the long walk away from us is poetic and immensely touching - but even in the brief scene at Lincoln's deathbed, things are so watered down that there is no real feel coming from those playing the parts of those involved in the historic moment.  Mary Todd was insane with grief - but not so in this last scene.  Stanton's \\"Now he belongs to the angels\\" (or \\"ages\\") is all but mumbled and lost on the viewers as to who is actually saying it.  These are not quibbles.  These are important movie-making matters that might have helped make LINCOLN the true and full epic it aspires to be.<br /><br />I didn't expect LINCOLN to be a History Channel docudrama. But to those uninitiated to all things Lincoln - and they exist in increasingly and alarmingly growing numbers! - viewing this film can too easily be more confusing than clarifying.  Granted that clarification is not a movie's prime purpose, but in this instance, dealing with our most important President, it surely would not have hurt. I'd hate to think that the youth of this country  might find much more interest and excitement in ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER than in LINCOLN.<br /><br />Those who argue that there is just way too much to Lincoln and the Civil War to cram into a 165 minute movie might want to take a look at 1988's TV movie LINCOLN based upon the book by Gore Vidal.  This film is only 23 minutes longer than Spielberg's, yet it covers Lincoln's entire presidency and is not only much more informative with regards to both Lincoln and the Civil War, but also better written and, yes, better acted than Spielberg's LINCOLN.  Long before contemporary discussions on the higher-pitched accuracy of Daniel Day-Lewis' vocal interpretation, we had Sam Waterston sounding probably even more like the actual Lincoln sounded.  And as much as I am in awe of Daniel Day-Lewis and think he is an absolutely incredible actor, there is somewhere in me that always knows he is acting - and not only here but in his other work as well.  Although Waterston is not tall enough for the boots of Honest Abe, there is in his performance something totally true and, yes, honest that effectively blurs the line between actor and actuality.  Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Todd Lincoln, again while not looking as much as the actual woman as does Sally Field, by far captures the real First Lady's character in incredible and immense ways.  In this TV movie, the relationship of the Lincolns is also detailed in a much more moving and effective manner.  Yes, the script gave the leads more to work with - but praise for the present shouldn't shadow the praiseworthy past.<br /><br />As a movie about the Thirteenth Amendment, Spielberg's LINCOLN mostly succeeds.  As a film dealing with  Lincoln, it is sadly lacking in scope, vision and full import.nd alarmingly growing numbers! - viewing this film can too easily be more confusing than clarifying.

B008458O3S|5.0|The 10+ star puzzles were tough, but I kept at it until I beat them all. Just when you think you've got the hang of it, a new puzzle element is thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Very fun little game, though as others say, the controls are frustrating... they require more accuracy than my fingers can provide on complex layouts and I end up retracing track many times to get what I was trying to get.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I admit I only made it through about a quarter of the book. It started out well, but all the biographical self-promotion was too much to keep wading through. Maybe someday when I have nothing better to do I'll give it another try.<br /><br />He worshipped his father. Everyone who knew his father worshipped his father. His biological father thought about training to be an astronaut. His father performed operations during the war in his underwear because of the heat and his commanding officer worshipped him too much to let him go. Blah Blah Blah. What is the point of all this?  The author clearly has some self-esteem issues, but I regret paying $10.94 to hear about them. As someone else said in another review, it was like meeting someone who you mistakenly thought to be interesting and a little too late realizing what an egotistical bore he/she really is.<br /><br />The little I found in the way of description of his NDE in the first part of the book was a vague, wandering cotton candy monologue that sounded like the Book of Revelations as portrayed on a Hallmark greeting card. It reminded me of a mediocre 1960's beat poet going on and on about attaining a state of nirvana.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this surely wasn't it. I guess the whole point of faith is that it doesn't depend on proof and, in fact, it ceases to be faith if you insist on tangible proof or unambiguous signs. Of course most people experience some doubts regarding the very fundamentals of their faith and may seek reassurance, but you'd have to be pretty desperate to rely on this ego-centric hallucinogenic account to bolster your beliefs.<br /><br />\\" The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, \\"Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.\\"

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This book is amazing!!!  I was captivated from the minute I started reading.  I read it the first time about 6 months ago, putting the huge book on a pillow in my lap and finishing the entire 845 pages in one week.  Recently I got a Kindle.  I bought the book for my Kindle and now I'm reading it again by holding it in one hand!  I am seeing new details I missed the first time and enjoying it even more the second time around.  This book is vintage Stephen King, the master of suspense, characterization, and imagination!  The creativity that comes from that man's mind is scary!  If you like Stephen King, you must read this one!  Addendum 6/21/2016...I just finished reading this for the THIRD TIME.  Yes, it is that engrossing.  Each time I read it, I see something new.  I will look forward to reading it again in a year or so.  Best book I ever read, and I've read thousands!

B008J34466|2.0|Pink has an amazing voice.  With that said, perhaps song selection is the reason this CD just does not cut it.  The songs are all over the place; cohesion does not exist on this mix... I tried to like this CD, however many of songs sound as if they were mix-mashed at the last minute to complete a CD.<br /><br />Trying something different, expanding ones limit, spreading ones wings are all understandable desires.  However this CD simply sunk instead of soar...<br /><br />Sorry Pink, you are better than this.  You can do better, and my ears deserve better!
0525952926|1.0|Is this really the same Ken Follett who wrote \\"Pillars of the Earth?\\" This reads like it was written by a high school sophomore! Don't believe the hyped reviews this is garbage! It's time for Mr. Follett to retire before he writes his third installment.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love The Piano Guys and have bought more of their MP3s from Amazon than any other artist.  Their upbeat take on old songs, their humour, and yes the great music are always a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely also check out their \\"Charlie Brown Medley\\" and \\"All of Me\\" which are not on this album but sold separately.  And be sure to watch the videos - especially Cello Wars!
B001DUGOWY|5.0|I had never before read this last of Steinbeck's novels and thoroughly enjoyed it. The moral struggle of Ethan Allen Hawley mirrors that of many people in today's society and government. I highly recommend it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a perfect game to escape to; not too hard, not too easy.  I love mystery games, I'm not that into hidden object and though this game has both, it's a good blend.  Lost City is still my favorite, and if The Ghosts of Maple Creek were longer and more involved it would be right up there.  Dear Game Designers:  more mystery games, please!
B0086700CM|5.0|idk why people hate on this game its very fun. they're just haters aha well deuces gonna at temple run
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wonderful accout of a successful mission and the hundreds of individuals who made it happened.  It was terriffic to read a first hand account of this historic mission.  We all owe a debt of gratitude to the men of our armed forces, from the lowest private to the admirals and generals who support the men of our special forces and to the professionals in our intellegence acencies who found UBL.  Highly recommend this true life adventure.

B003M696QS|4.0|A thought provoking well organized presentation on a topic that will no doubt never be truly explained or understood by science.  Very interesting ideas regarding non local consciousness and eternal consciousness.  I would recommend this book to both religious and non-religious readers.  A very rounded approach blending theology and science.  Some critics would argue \\"pseudo-science\\",  but this author succeeds (IMO) in presenting various theoretical origins of consciousness without becoming overtly metaphysical or new age.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|A great selection of Dylan songs with original interpretations from a multitude of superb artists and all for a great cause. After buying this album for myself, I also sent it as a gift to friends. Everyone enjoyed it.
B0088TG252|4.0|This movie is a good action flick but definately not one of Denzels best.  It was entertaining but the plot was just ok and time jumps a few times in the movie so you lose plot but get more action.  The twists if you call it that are easy to see coming.
B000GCFO08|4.0|With the premier of the newest Silent Hill hitting the movie theater's, I had to buy this movie immediately. It arrived really quick, but the DVD case itself was broken and the disk was just flopping around the case. Luckily there was no damage on the disk and I didn't have to send it back!!! Over all I am happy with the purchase and very happy I didn't have to deal with sending it back.<br />The movie is great, the ending has something to be desired, but non the less its a horror flick. If you like this type of movie, then I definitely suggest to add this one
B009JNQ86Y|4.0|Unlike other artists, this album keeps what makes Ellie Goulding great to listen to but in completely new songs. Definitely not a disappointment if you liked her past work.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|It was not the type of game that I thought it was. I removed it from my kindle the same day.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|If you are a diehard DeMille fan (I am) this book is so formulaic it ends up disappointing. It was soooo slow getting to the action. You'll read half the book, no kidding, before any action picks up. Nelson relies on John Corey's humor to carry a large portion of the book and it gets old. You can actually see the setup for a wisecrack and you're actually thinking it before you read it.  I feel like this book was cranked out to meet a contract deadline rather than being a result of thoughtful writing. For readers new to DeMille skip The Panter and read Goldcoast first.
B004OZZ624|5.0|The morning after we watched The Next Three Days, first topic of conversation was the movie, particularly the moral aspects, and we still occasionally bring it up after several weeks.  I don't want to give any hints, clues, or spoilers of any type but I will recommend being prepared to sit through the whole thing without stopping.  You're not going to want to pause to get more snacks or go to the bathroom until it's over.  It's that good.
B000IZ1HP4|1.0|not a good movie at all, slow and boring<br />wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone at6 all.  They just<br />keep dragging it out
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Very easy to attach to the kinect and it allows you to play in a smaller area. So far works great!!!
1451620829|5.0|Will you like Makeup to Breakup? To address this question, I believe that writing this review for Peter Criss/KISS fans and non-fans may help you decide. After reading it, it was obvious to me that even if you're not a fan of Peter Criss or KISS, you may still like this book.<br /><br />Obviously, anybody who is a KISS fan will be curious about an autobiography written by the original KISS drummer. In Makeup to Breakup, Peter Criss does not disappoint and writes 365 pages of material that few people, including rabid KISS fans, may be aware of. For instance, although it may be well known that Peter Criss was at odds with the other members of the band most notably Gene Simmons, in this book he says he exchanged blows with Gene Simmons. On another occasion, Peter Criss says that he literally wanted to murder Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley by shooting them. He also details his violence against himself in a near-suicide attempt.<br /><br />Peter Criss writes much about the other members and managers of KISS as well. He describes Gene Simmons as a \\"sex addict\\" who acted like a \\"pig\\" in his sexual exploits. He writes that Paul Stanley spent hours a day in counseling as a result of his sexual-identity problems. When KISS toured with Aerosmith, Paul Stanley became jealous of Steve Tyler, Aerosmith's lead singer, because Steve Tyler was a \\"chick magnet,\\" and Paul Stanley was saddled with attracting gay men! And Ace Frehley, of course, had his problems with drugs and alcohol. On one KISS tour, for example, Ace was so drunk that when boarding the tour plane he would fall on the floor.<br /><br />So what if you're not a KISS fan? This book details the heartfelt pain and joy of an emotionally explosive man. It goes well beyond sex, drugs and rock and roll (although there is plenty of that)and touches on subjects like love, romance, marriage, divorce, and even religion. Peter Criss is much more than a rock drummer and in Makeup to Breakup you'll read about the struggles so many ofus deal with whether we ever heard one note of a KISS song. I think there's a good chance that almost anybody who has an interest in life and people will like this book.<br /><br />Of course, I loved Makeup to Breakup. It's the best book I've read in a long time. After reading the final page, 365, I wished I could read another 365 pages. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the book might be longer and say a bit more about the other members of KISS like Eric Carr, Peter's replacement, and an index would be nice to look up subjects. In any case, though, it's a great read which I thoroughly enjoyed.
159420411X|5.0|Have a hard to buy for adult son and gave him this book for his birthday. He LOVES it, a perfectly geeky look at statistics. However, he says you don't need a math/statistics background to enjoy it or understand it. Nate Silver is now his favorite author, right after Stephen Hawking.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|um if u like killing people then u will like this game I think its to violent so bad game
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Cohesive, aural and funky.  This is her best release.  Who would know that her duet with Blake Shelton would be so beuatiful?  She's got a funky, dancy, jaunty feel going through this and it works from start to finish.  Personally, I admire this as her best total effort to date.
159420411X|5.0|Brilliant analysis of  how arithmetic works and how we live in an age of uncertainty. This is a great read, it makes you fill intelligent beyond your widest expectations.
0810989956|5.0|my son loved it  he has read it from cover to cover and cant wait to read the next one
B001NHNG64|3.0|I felt that Child did not know which direction the story was going.  The beginning was great.  Held me briefly and then it got really slow moving for about 100-150 pgs of the book.  The villian was too boistrous and it took too long to get to the main plot.  The book could have been cut down about 200 pgs.  It was good overall. I figured out who the mole was and it was almost like reading \\"The Killing Floor\\" as it was a repeat in having moles in high places. I am hoping the next Reacher book is better, otherwise I will stop at #3.  Again in this book (read my Killing Floor review) Lee Child has to work on his grammer and also learn that most people do not talk the same exact way. Each person is supposed to have a different personality and in that they talk differently as well.  He also got a little too technical in this book.  Though it was interesting to read it was a little too much.  When you got down to the story it was actually good and worth reading.  There was enough intrigue to keep you going as well as humor.  There were a few surprises and it was interesting to come across them.  Learning more about Reachers background is always a plus.  A good read.

B003L77GGK|5.0|I enjoy this series, it always has a good story line. The whole set was cheap and took me a few weeks to watch
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The book was great and it was fast reading and I had read it during hurricane Sandy and the Blackout afterwards.  I oould not put the book down. It was interesting from start to finish and it grabbed you.  As in most books there were some chapters that were slow moving but they were not one after the other.  The book was just infectious.  It kept me guessing on who the mole was and I was surprised when I found out.  I think that Lee Child has to work on his grammer and understand that most characters do not talk the same way.  Otherwise it was worth reading.
0486408434|5.0|I got this as a birthday gift for my oldest sons 30th birthday and he LOVES it! Every time I see him now he is entertaining me with a new card trick. Like I said it is a beginners book so starts from scratch for people that have never done any sort of card tricks before.<br /><br />Judging by his satisfaction with it I would heartily recommend it to others.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I can play for hrs on this. It works great on my Kindle Fire.  Also great fun for the kids.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|We bought this for our daughter last Christmas.  She loves the music and would recommend it to anyone.  Good buy.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I don't watch a lot of TV, but Modern Family is my favorite show that's on right now. The characters & the writing, makes it a damn near perfect show. I can watch it over & over.
B005PK553C|3.0|I really liked season one.  However this season is a little too over the top for my taste.  Jessica Land is wonderful!
B0015T6G2G|5.0|I didn't think this would read somewhat like a novel, but it does.  It engages you in the story of Mandela's life and doesn't disappoint.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|One of the various entry points for NEW-Who, this series hooked me. The set comes with a plethora of bonus features and commentary. Very nice buy.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have seen almost every show that hit it, but none compares to The Walking Dead. It is with out a doubt the best Show I have ever became addicted to watching. After most series hit the third season they have lost their way and leave you wondering if an episode even took the plot anywhere at all. Not The Walking Dead. You are in for the ride of your life.
B005OP7162|5.0|This show is so awesome! Every episode including throughout the show I am on the edge of my seat in anticipation of what's going to happen next!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is amazing I love it! you can tell when its fully charged and you can see how much Internet time you have left
B009INAGY0|5.0|Yet again, another fantastic Death reissue by Relapse Records. Although this record may stand out as the &#34;sore thumb&#34; between all Death releases, the mastering and quality on this album will make you think otherwise for sure. Jim Morris could take dirt and produce it into quality gold!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am not much of a gamer but i like this one,it's not on a timer and you can keep trying for as<br />long as you like.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fan of my lil pony. its a great game even my 6 yr old has fun playing. Favorite character is fluttershy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|My husband is a retired army veteran.  This gave me a lot of insight into what he mwy have gone through in those 23 years of service.  Even though I lived through it with him, I was busy with home and family and really didn't give too much thought to the inner workings of his work.  Of course, much of it was not discussed with spouses anyway!  The book is very well written , not too technical making it very understandable and even visual.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock Season Two was even better than the first season! The fun and loyal relationship between Sherlock and John, the banter between Sherlock and Mycroft, the utter creepiness of Moriarty. The Hound of the Baskervilles is a well-known Holmes story and to be frank, quite over done, but necessary to do since this series is a twist on Sherlock Holmes. I think the writers handled it very well and brought some new modern ideas that kept it fresh and exciting. Martin Freeman's acting in the last episode made me feel as though I was right there with him. He made me cry - I was in awe of his performance and he's earned respect in my book as far as acting goes. This season was absolutely excellent and I enjoyed every moment of it.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|we have the xbox verison an i saw it on the kindle fire apps an it is a fun game. it is different from the xbox verison and a lot less levels my daughter went through it pretty fast. I hope they make more levels for the kindle fire..

B007JCP8FE|5.0|I didn't know what to expect after finding Shinedown with their last album, &#34;The Sound of Madness,&#34; but this one is just as good. Brent Smith has powerful vocals, and the arrangements are wonderful.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Must read continuation of the series. Was a page turner, same as the first book, and kept me wanting to know if Christian could be more.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|LOVE this movie! The acting is incredible and the movie is very entertaining. The collaboration of all these superheroes is exciting. The actors and actresses have incredible chemistry on set, making this movie a must-see
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I've read de hole series, and I Found this book, the  most interesting of the saga. The final is incredible.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|I bought the Supernatural Season 7 for a dear friend.  He thanked me every day for two weeks.  Thank You very much!

B005VT42BS|5.0|It offers a road map so to speak of your current network.  And remembers it for next time. Allowing a display comparing before & current.  Missing devices (from prior inspections) appear grayed out.  There are a small supply of standard networking utilities like ping & getroute.
B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock is an amazing series. The actors portraying these characters do an excellent job delving deep within them and showing how they were in their beginning stages as Holmes and Watson. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series.
B00821OW8K|1.0|If you're looking for science fiction, I strongly suggest avoiding this film. Don't waste your money, too much boohoo la la land drama, and virtually \\"ZERO\\" science, strategy, or adventure. I would not force my worst enemy.... No, on second thought, I \\"would\\" force my worst enemy to watch this dumbed down garbage! IMHO it seems that this series was meant to amuse the elements of society who are (for lack of a better phrase) \\"a little slow\\".
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game ever in the history of mankind so I definetly recomend this game so badly. BUY NOW
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I honestly have never read a book quite like this...and it was sheer curiosity that finally peaked my interest! Definitely recommend!
1609611543|5.0|The book started out a little technical but just keep reading.  It is very informative. I plan to start going wheat free and hopefully loose weight and get healthier.
B008VBYN80|4.0|it is q fun game but the &quot;energy&quot; really takes away from the enjoyment factor .  Alamo it has a lot of in app purches so look out if you have little kids.
B003VIWO8Y|3.0|A few good stories, nothing that hasn't been heard before.  Like many other celeb biographies, it felt like it could have used a bit more polish/proofreading.  Concepts trail off, paragraphs feel like they didn't end, and many times there are random departures from chronological timeline formula.  Lots of extra detail on his choke hold technique and rabbit punching people into submission whenever violence was required.  I could have done with less of that and maybe get into more info about songwriting process and studio experience.<br /><br />Overall the book is true to one thing: Dave is running the show.  Drugs may have caused him to veer off the road a couple of times, but none of the stories end with anybody else 'winning', except maybe his wife for sticking with him through it all.  And the shadow of Metallica that looms over him constantly, and whose music will probably be played at his funeral.
0525478817|4.0|This was a very sweet and romantic book. I really enjoyed reading it. It has a very interesting twist to it and I love it for that. There were a few writing mistakes but it was very good!!
0743289692|5.0|I usually dislike memoirs, but this is one of the best books I've every read. What's unique about Ali is her honesty. Not many people would admit that their mother considered her 'slow', and that, for example, she worked harder than her siblings for poorer grades. (note: whatever she lacked in the study of math and Islam, is made up for her excellent language and political analysis skills). She doesn't demonize anyone, but neither does she sugarcoat things - she describes her life how she experienced it, in vivid detail.<br /><br />The story of her transformation from a timid girl, to being mesmerized by the Muslim Brotherhood (wearing, as she describes it, a 'black tent' in the Nairobi heat), to being an outspoken feminist and proponent of Western values is amazing. Her attitudes towards life traveled 1,500 years in the space of her childhood through young adulthood.<br /><br />All I can say is READ THIS BOOK. You will not be bored, you will be mesmerized. And you will never think of yourself, your religion, or your values in quite the same way again.
B007M45PMU|5.0|So glad I downloaded this album.. was just browsing and listen to a couple quick clips, bought it and they did not disappoint what so ever! So freaking good!!

B009K5257M|3.0|One of my favorite Halloween films. I've loved the first two, but this was the one I was looking for. When I finally found it, I was so excited to see it. Thank you amazon for having it on your instant videos. I was so happy to finally see it again.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a very convenient, useful,  &amp; entertaining application.  It does much more than simply provide definitions. If you love word games you'll love this app.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Very well done, good narration and the animation has a lot of visual interest. Wouldn't have shown it to my son when he was eighteen months but at three, he is ready for it and loves it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was,okay but the first book was better. The characters in this book were nothing like the ones in the first book. The story wad a little confusing at times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|to inform you this app just came out with the 0.5.0 yesterday and it is great and you can spawn zombie pigmen
B0030P1WKY|2.0|This book is not well organized and the info is confusing...having it on a Kindle Fire probably makes it worse.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I gave this show 4 stars because it has everything a great tv show should have its got the heart pumping action for the guys its got some great drama to keep the ladies involved its keeps the audiences looking for more i myself have been sucked into the show and when the credits roll up im pissed i have to wait a week to see more.<br /> The only down side is when they cut to a whole other cast in another part of the world doing there thing and you have to wait full episode to get back to the charters you love it builds the story but can be a little annoying<br /> I would recommend this show to any one who loves good horror movie built for tv who want to be  left on the edge of there seats wanting more you cant go wrong with the walking dead
B008NABUU8|5.0|This games provides a good mix of creativity and logic.  Can be frustrating at times but when you figure it out a good design it is rewarding.

160459201X|5.0|This text along with Practical Sorcery techniques is an UN-stopable force! I highly recommend it! This is the foundational text for my recent workings...I  LOVE  this text.
145210655X|5.0|My husband and I got this book for our first child (yet to be born) and we absolutely love it. The pictures are great for children and the story had funny parts for star wars fans, both young and old. This is definitely going to be a favorite in our house!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I refuse to buy any WB product that only supports Ultraviolet Digital Copy.  That means the product will not work on the biggest digital library system on the planet - iTunes.  Why must I be subjected to access 95% of my library on iTunes and only 5% on some other inferior download scheme - UV?  It makes no sense, and WB needs to wake up and join the 21st Century and offer a product that works in iTunes.  Until they do, I will refuse to buy any of their physical media.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I thought I was pretty good at this kind of game but this one is difficult! Even using walk through its a huge challenge!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Ultraviolet is horrendous.  If I don't get a free digital copy that works with iTunes, then I ain't buying.  Go to Hades WB!  Worst movie of the bunch anyway....
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is, by far, the best free weather app that I have found.  its simple and accurate.  totally recommend! -jb
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for my boys 3y n 5y. Its easy for them to play and they finish a lot of levels together. Sometimes they fight for it too :-) Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I don't care for the ads which are sometimes difficult to delete.  Otherwise I would have given it  5 stars.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Jessica Lange needs no props. Her presence speaks for itself! The other actors are excellent as well. I was pleased to see Zachary Quinto (Dr. Oliver Thredson) in yet another entertaining show. Lily Rabe (Sister Mary Eunice) is another pleasant surprise. Horror fans will love this show. It's very creepy with a dose of drama that breaks through what we typically have come to expect from &#34;horror&#34; these days. It leaves you waiting anxiously for the next episode.<br />A cautionary note to parents: This show is definitely for mature audiences.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book as a whole was Okay. The ending was horrible. After reading the last sentence I asked myself why in the world did I just do that. Rent it from the library, the book is completely free and that way you're not out any money when you're done scratching your head. It's just a shame.
B00005QB42|5.0|This is a beautiful, transcendent album by this well-known and much-loved mantra singer, a real perennial in  my collection that every time I play it still sounds as fresh as when it was new.  Highly recommend to anyone seeking a calm, serene and uplifting atmosphere.  Really great for yoga practice!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|very fun and additive game and can keep u entertained  for hours well happy thanksgivings  i am for sure thankful of this app
B000Q66JXA|5.0|This is one movie I would see again and again. The story, the visuals and acting make one complete satisfying art film.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you only want to learn how to make gourmet-quality meals in 20 minutes or less, this book is a damned good deal right then and there.<br /><br />If you want to dig deeper into how to learn new skills and change your life, this book is worth its weight in gold.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|an interesting story, well told, opened a window to India, middle of the road with drama and humor, maggie smith and judi dench are always good, bill nighy is very nice to watch. satisfying ending.
B0041KVYIW|4.0|OMG! I cannot believe what some customers are complaining about. Ok! Bad pressings, that is a legitimate complaint. But complaints because they did not use the same materials in the packaging as they did in the 1960's? Give me a break.<br /><br />My copy of Revolver was perfect. I completely disagree from those that have stated that the sound is lifeless on these. Different? Yes! I have A/B's these against both classic US and UK pressings from the past. If I wanted the same thing, I would have stuck with what I already have.<br /><br />These pressings, although there have been problems, are sill a great value. Those who are disappointed should stick to the CD sets. They are great in their own right. Once the manufacturer makes good on some these problems, these pressings will stand on their own.<br /><br />Some of the packaging manufacturing processes,especially those from the 1960's have not been around for years. I am sure that many of the companies that produced those are long out of business and the required machinery is long gone. The fact that there are still vinyl pressing plants is amazing in it's self. So when you hear all these picky complaints, it tells me how unrealistic the buying public is.<br /><br />My advise the them is to stick to MP'3s, CD's or very expensive (used) vinyl from the past. Me myself, I am very happy with these releases and would not hesitate to recommend them. Can't wait for the mono reissues.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I got this when it was cheaper than in the stores<br />And it came early . Idk about u but I can wait three days not to have to drive to the store
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|one of the best cleaning apps ever i had a notice about my memory that i could not get ride of but aftrr i tried this my kindle is now running faster and my memory  is good to go you have to get this app:)
B0081BU42O|5.0|The Hydrogen Sonata.<br /><br />Typically, Banks is an excellent science fiction writer. His concept of a future (the Culture) civilization is so far reaching that the reader's imagination is always gratified. As with all his Culture novels, he has further expanded his broad vision. Excellent.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|The show was great, the delivery was great. My wife and I are enjoying the shows.  Don't know what took so long to watch.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I've been a fan of these games since PS2, and now to have both games in one bundle with Graphics enhanced and trophies added. that makes it even better.
B0041KW076|5.0|This is a special record for me as it was one of the first LP's I bought as a kid. However, I bought the US version which was titled Beatles 65. I always wanted the British version, but the only one I could ever get a hold of was a used worn \\"Mono\\" version.<br /><br />I am buying these one at a time based on some of the problems people are having with the box sets. That way, If I get a hold of a bad pressing, I can exchange the one record and not the whole set. Fortunately, I got a good one for this title. They sound fantastic once you get a good one. So far I am four for five with buying pressing without problems. I am glad they re-released these British versions. I could care less if they were from digital masters sources. They sound clean and articulate. If you have an older stereo system like mine, these really sound warm and detailed.I have about four more records to get and I will be done.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just have started reading it and find it very interesting.  I have always been interested in the SEALS and this just brings it closer to home.  I knew they were well trained specialist, but did not realize the extent of their training.  True Heros!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Scarier and more disturbing then season 1 and the acting is top notch as always. I wonder if Connie Britton and pal Hayden Panettierre from Nashville will decide to come over from season 3 if their show is cancelled. One can dream, although it seems a few online don't like Connie B. that much. Go figure. I wouldn't mind seeing Natasha Lyonne or Drew Droege on AHS season 3 either, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Season 2 has been great and I look forward to each episode even though I remain spooked after watching any episode that heavily features Bloody Face! LOL
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was WAY more interesting than just porn light for women.  I loved the character development and was facinated.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie. My mom watched it and loved it,too. Seven middle-aged characters face new beginnings with courage, grace and honesty.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|i definitely like this app iys gr8 4 a short but after a while app got kinda boring i would recommend it if 8 or younger but if not forget it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun, very addictive! My kids love this game. Thanks Amazon for another fantastic free game for my Kindle Fire ;)
B002361MLA|4.0|Tolle presents a good perspective that isn't necessarily intuitive to anyone raised in Western society. His presentation makes it accessable and relatively easy to understand and assimilate. Though I suspect that few people will adopt his practices 100%, I believe that everyone would benefit from the concepts and incorporate those habits and practices that are valid for them in particular. In short, almost everyone will find some benefit from this read.
B004X2M3N8|4.0|I would have given this season 5 stars, but overall I'm a bit tired of the direction Moffat has taken this series and the Doctor. Although this season had some stellar episodes, the mediocre episodes were really bad and not worth buying. Not sure I will purchase the next season on amazon, I'm hopeful I will be able to catch them on BBC America. Season 7 will definitely be what makes or breaks me from my continued viewing of the program.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed writes a wonderful memoir of her struggles with the death of her mother and how she challenged herself physically to heal the wound.  Very inspirational.  I may plan a trek myself!
1741798981|4.0|I find that Lonely Planet guides are very good. Still I would like more pictures. There is lots of pointless information. Think also they should have more seasonal sections like what to do at Christmas or easter etc.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love this album! It's such a mature sound for Taylor Swift. The song Red is really catchy and Starlight is such a fun song to dance to!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its the best app ever....... It gets me thru my bad days and it makes my good days better. I wouldn't trade it in for the world.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like your games because it never gets boring.I like 101 because it has a lot of games you guys are the best.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Great fun for the kids( myself included).  You can't go wrong with the animation and the character development.  I wrote the character development thing because the review format requires a certain quantity of words and I wasn't meeting the minimum:)
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Buyer be ware. Baby monitor randomly stops working. Last night the sound stopped working and we did not hear our baby cry. The only way to get support is via email. It takes days to hear back from anyone. When they do respond, their answers don't make any sense. It seems like support is being outsourced somewhere. Many other problems reported so do your research first.
B008S80P38|5.0|I don't personally like this style, but I bought it for my girlfriend. She said this album was really good and she enjoys listen to it all the time.

B008M34INW|4.0|My wife, a die-hard Gibson fan, is willing to forgive him the Passion and his private shenanigans. So we watched his latest. He is not as pretty as Mad Max any more, but he still has something. His private miseries have turned him into a bitter cynic, but it works very well here. Or maybe he is actually acting. His Gringo is not a good man. A career criminal with survival skills.<br />The plot is not very original, though the degree of cynicism may be lifting it above the genre. Gibson is a gangster with an uncertain name, who gets incarcerated in a Mexican prison, though he did his crime in the US. He had tried to escape into Mexico with his haul from a big heist. It didnt work. Now he is in a very weird kind of prison and the Mexican police have his money, or think they have... But no spoilers here. Many people are after the money, not just Gibson. Much blood is shed. Escape from prison turns out to be the least of Gibson's worries.<br />Apart from the money, a key plot ingredient is organ transplant, not quite on the level of organization as in Kazuo's novel.<br />The best scene of the movie is Mel Gibson impersonating Clint Eastwood on the telephone...
B0019KWE6S|5.0|Where did an album this masterful come from? Though unfortunately, I haven't found anything else in his catalog like it, this is a deep, slightly dark, often orchestral, subtly textured album which recalls Scott Walker, David Sylvian, the National (in vocal quality), Mark Hollis and Talk Talk (in the instrumentation and attention to detail and sonic depth - and especially the frequent use of reverberating piano), Sigur Ros (at its most epic and accessible point, \\"The Siren Songs\\"), the Blue Nile (in its near-ambient approach to atmosphere and minimalism). But Thomas Feiner and Anywhen have created such an excellent album that, ideally, future listeners will be comparing albums by other artists to it. This is a stellar cd throughout, with almost an old-world romanticism (see \\"Betty Caine,\\" for example). Feiner is a phenomenal singer, and his voice can be floor-shakingly deep (\\"Dinah & the Beautiful Blue\\") or angelically high (\\"Betty Caine\\") with apparent ease.
B001706I5I|5.0|We absolutely love this movie.  My daughter wants to watch it all year.  We love the costumes, characters, etc.  Definitely a classis.
B00008L3U1|5.0|JACK is a great movie. Not only does Robin Williams<br />shine, but there are good human nature stories<br />within the story. A must for your home collection.
B008G12ERC|5.0|This is an amazing album by muse. They really showed a different sound but also had some of the styles going in their last album uprising. They are probably one of my top bands.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just like on the computer the extras are great. fun display and options.  good download.  good to play by self and you can play against others.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|3DD played in my hometown on 11/21/12. The set included the three new songs included in this collection, which are, in my opinion, great companions to the certified hits. This is a good collection for anyone who doesn't want to own or can't afford all the albums. To fans like me no collection is likely to seem complete since 3DD has great \\"album tracks\\" that were never released as singles. As always I encourage fellow music lovers to support their favorite artists by actually purchasing their music.
0316232955|5.0|I thought this would be a quick, fun, funny read, but it was so much more than that. When I finished it at first, all I could do was lie still for a moment simultaneously crying, smiling, and gaping in disbelief. This book resonated with me in a way that few books have. It's hard to describe all the reasons I love this book, but I'll try.<br />One reason I love this is that it's not sugar-coated. I'm so sick of reading books about the perfect, but for some inconceivable reason disliked social outcast. Carson is definitely not perfect. In fact he's far from it, but he's real. While I definitely understood why he was disliked, I couldn't help but love him, and in some sort of sick way identify with him. I could definitely relate to the feeling of counting down your days to escape, living for the future.  Whenever he opened his mouth I was internally kicking him and cheering for him.<br />There were a lot of interesting themes at work here. The main one was the idea of finding one's wings and flying. But there were other themes at work here as well. Throughout the book I was hooked on Carson's sadness and the question of his depression and whether or not he should be taking medicine.<br />Carson achieved so many things along his journey, both spiritual and physical, but what made this stick with me the most most was the ending, the stark reality that sometimes you don't always achieve everything you set out to do, sometimes no matter how hard you try, you just can't catch a break. That realization left me sad, confused, and hopeless for about a day and a half. I watched my private facade of false hope burn away, but when I rose from the ashes, I felt enlightened, invigorated, and inspired - like I had been struck with lightning. Chris Colfer, thank you so much. This book touched me in a way I can't explain. It gave me hope, if only to whisper 'you're not alone'.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Free app can be more than you expected? This one did! Much better than other one. Guy like me use English as the second language should be at some level to use it.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I paid 21 on home shopping network I love her music but if I knew it was on here for this price I would have brought from her.  She was very special in the way she sung and there never be anyone else like her.  But either way I glad I got this cd
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not usually my kind of books but I took a chance and I loved them!!:):):):):)<br />Wish there were more books.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|What can I say?  I loved the music and the Melbourne concert is well videod...could watch it over and over!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|This book is absolute nonsense.  I liked the first one enough to buy this one, but what a waste of money.  Neither of these characters are likable, there is no depth to them at all, the sex scenes are just laughable (and get really boring very quickly)  No imagination on this one at all - a big thumbs down.
0762445262|3.0|It's nicely designed, but the light is very dim. You need a very dark room and a white wall/ ceiling just to be able to make out the image.
1934030597|4.0|Appears to be excellent coverage of moderate bike maintenance.<br /><br />Speaks plainly and well placed illustrations<br /><br />No doubt it will eventually pay for itself in avoiding a trip to the bike shop. I'm glad I purchased.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I didn't even think she ever put out a Xmas cd but I love the music and her voice will always be special to me
B0050AV5MW|5.0|This book was an amazing followup of the previous four. It explained a  lot of what you missed in book four. Because Book 4 and the first half of book five was written to be chronologically side by side, one missed a lot about half of the characters. This book Resolves that loss, and then goes on to captivate you even further with unexpected story twists.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and when I went to the tittle it said the 5.0 update and caught me by surprise the only thing I found so far I have only found the painting glowstone and nether core
0316232955|5.0|Overall I found this an easy read and very enjoyable. The main character is very sympathetic even though it is quite clear he is not the most likable character. He is fleshed out and quite in depth while the other characters are not, though that makes sense as this is all written from his own perspective. Although the book is quite funny and witty throughout, my overall impression, especially at the end was more sad and longing than it was hopeful. I finally felt like I really wanted this character to succeed and it seems like everything and everyone is so against him. I do always find that is the hallmark of a great piece of fiction - if it truly makes me feel strongly - even if that feeling is sadness.<br /><br />I liked the observations and insight - both the earnest ones and the witty ones. A few times it seemed like the main character was getting almost preachy, but he then calls himself out on that and goes back to being a bit of a jerk, so it never seems too forced. There were a few times when a metaphor seemed awkward, but even those were always interesting, so I didn't mind it.<br /><br />While I am sure the overall story as well as its details are entirely fictional, it is very interesting to see a character that is so angry and uses his anger as a way to fuel his drive and ambition to make something of himself and to compare that to the author's own story of getting out of a small and constricting town and achieving great things.<br /><br />I will say there is a lot of cursing throughout the book. That's no problem for me as an adult and it probably makes it appealing to the young adult crowd, too, but it might be good for people to know this ahead of time if they are concerned about what their children might be reading. However, it certainly isn't anything they wouldn't have heard already if they're in high school.<br /><br />I got the audio version of the book because I find it really interesting to hear the author's take on the way the characters sound. Although most of this is in the main character's voice, the author does have the chance to do some other voices, which is always interesting. It also is interesting to hear the emphasis used by the author, so I highly recommend listening to the audio version. I also am really looking forward to the movie because I would like to see what differences there might be in the two versions.<br /><br />I am glad to have this in my collection and I really can't wait for more writing from Chris Colfer. He really shows such promise as an author.

B008EQIEWS|3.0|I like the original Clash of the Titans with Harry Hamline. Being a sequel to the more recent version, it followed in line with that one.

030758836X|2.0|This is a quick read, very light and entertaining. However -- I wish the author had carried out the story she started with. That was engrossing. As the story developed, it became less so.
6305754969|4.0|Robert Mitchum stole the movie with his wonderful protrayal of an habitually drunk sheriff who has hit bottom, but who is coerced by his friends to redeem himself by facing a virtual life-saving challenge. I believe this to be the finest performance by Robert Mitchum in his long career. Otherwise, the movie is typically John Wayne fare that is just a little sullied by a couple of amateurish scenes and situations. Robert Mitchum made a good westen into a memorable one.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|I do know this I love it, I love it, I love it! It is a really fun game and there are endless posabilities now that you can build undergroud. Favorite thing ever, besides Sonic the hedgehog things, I love that the best. But hey, Everyones different!

B006BAEQB2|4.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter has been another great read from Gregory. I have enjoyed the historical parts intermingled with fictious tale.
B002PYW26Y|4.0|This movie tries to be an updated version of the 1960's campy TV show.  It does have some plot problems, and the dialogue can be a bit laughable.  For its time the special effects are decent.  I liked this movie when it first came out despite other people not being big fans of it.  If you are a die hard sci fi fan you will enjoy it at the very least.  It is watchable if not a bit laughable.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|The knife came fairly sharp, it has great ergonomics, the handle is very grippy, but the sheath is a joke.  I sanded off all the \\"protective finish\\".  Please, the only reason a primal tool is painted is to conceal defects (knife steel can be blued, but should otherwise be oiled or waxed). I sanded the finger grooves to seamlessly fit up with the grips.  I also sharpened to \\"micro convex edge\\" and it is now sharp.  The blade is more than adequate for building temporary shelter.  I do not \\"baton\\" as this is actually latin for, \\"I forgot my hatchet/axe\\".  If I see another 20-something furiously whacking, slashing, banging, and otherwise pretending to be an Alaskan/Yukon/Outback trapper (while the traffic from the freeway cuts into the commentary), I think I will dirty me diapers.  The sheath is made out of \\"genuine imitation ballistic Nylon\\".  It is what I would call, \\"Ballistic Bedsheet\\".  You can't tear it, but if you accidentally cut it, you can rip it right off.  This is what I did, and it revealed the sheath's only real saving grace--a heavy plastic molded sheath/guard underneath that can be easily Kydexed.  If you are careful with the original sheath, it should last a long time.  But if you rip off the \\"Ballistic Bedsheet\\" and cover the molded plastic guard with Kydex, it will be indestructible, without being outlandishly humongous.  One last thought--a smaller knife, plus a folding saw is much more realistic and probably faster way to build shelter. Yes, I would buy it again.  But, kiddees, quit with the batoning, already.

0316098337|4.0|Other than the situation of the person in this book, it is a five-star read.  We hear about stories like this popping up on News progams, and it is not a light situation there either.  It's been a while since I have read this, but it makes you wonder who might be living just down the street or around the corner.  Read the publisher's review and other's comments, if this is a subject that keeps you wondering why? how?, then it is for you.
B007G3H8Y0|3.0|Honestly.. this train cd leaves a lot to be desired.. the songs somewhat bland together... there are a few gems.. 'Feels Good At First'.. 'Mermaid'.. and 'When The Fog Rolls In'... but 'Driveby' is a driveby.. like a hit and run more than not...a quick burn out song.. I do get tired hearing it again and again... 'You can Meet My Mom' has the guys whistling like an old Billy Joel song...and some songs are just weird... a miriachi band duo on '50 Ways To Say Goodbye'?... ahhh okay I guess if you like 'Procul Harum' flashbacks tempered with 'Abba'.... maybe it's just the repetitive 'jump' tempo that wears me out.... but after listening to this one.. I quickly retreat to 'My Private Nation'. Sorry.. but that's just the way this Train fan feels after hearing this cd about 15 times.... lukewarm... tepid...

B003L20IJM|1.0|This sequel works on the tired premise that if one is good, more is better. So there are a lot more special effects, most utterly unnecessary, and it's a lot louder, but the touching charm of the first is totally absent. The lessons these children need to learn are given lip service at best, and while the cast is good they are wasted. Set in WW2, Gyllenhaal saddled with an English accent when one line of exposition would have avoided it must keep up the family farm... Yadda Yadda Yadda. Because this is a \\"family\\" movie someone made the decision that reality needed to be absent so an enemy airplane (this is wartime in Britain when children are evacuated to the country to avoid bombing in London) is labeled as \\"enemy aircraft\\". Heaven forbid children should learn even the tiniest bit about the war, no let's put a gag in here.<br />Thompson's script is paint by numbers, with all the tough problems solved by more magic and only the tiniest nod to the rules set up in the first one... Enormously disappointing.

I heard good things abut Skyfall, and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The opening sequences are breathtaking.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. The stories need to be told of the brave soldiers who help to keep this country free.

B004XDYJRU|4.0|Very inexpensive upgrade!  Wide ranging.  It's got something for everyone from talk radio, podcasts and any genre of music one could possibly want.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book even though I would not generally be a major lover of &#34;chick lit&#34; as such.  It came recommended by a friend and I have to say I really enjoyed the book overall.  I found the characters were likable, and that for the most part the book managed to remain light hearted in spite of the topical and delicate subject matter.  A really good holiday read.

B004ZBFRTY|1.0|I chose 1 star because it didn't play right. Towards te end of the directors cut it started skipping and the theatrical version didn't play at all ok blue ray. I would recommend someone to rather go buy this DVD at target or best buy.
B003DZX44I|2.0|I purchased this item as a gift for my daughter. We started watching the Blu-ray together and had to keep advancing the disc because it kept freezing. I finally started it over again and it stopped at the same places as the first time. After three more tries, we ended up putting in the DVD and that worked fine. Since I purchased this as a gift and didn't use it right away, I am already out of time to return it... does anyone know how to get in touch with Amazon to get this corrected? I only need a replacement on the Blu-ray and not the DVD.

As far the product, I received exactly what was displayed pin Amazon's site. I liked the box set which keeps the all seasons together. The delivery was very timely. As a premium member, the order came next day without any damage. This is the type of service that keeps me coming back to Amazon.

159420411X|4.0|A fan of 538, I welcomed a broader treatment of prediction and was not disappointed by Nate Silver's book.  Along with Daniel Kahneman's \\"Thinking Fast and Slow,\\" it puts Bayesian analysis front and center in our efforts to understand complexity and cope with modern challenges -- political, economic, security or sports.  Silver makes a possibly dry subject interesting by credibly applying it to the real-world.  Clearly his success at political prediction is not a fluke; there's method to this success.  My major criticism comes with his treatment of terrorism -- ill informed and unworthy.  Far from prescient, Don Rumsfeld deliberately ignored the Al Qaeda threat prior to 9/11 (preferring to focus inter alia on missile defense) and then imposed spurious linkages to Iraq in the aftermath. (See the \\"Report of the 9/11 Commission\\".)  It would have been far better had Silver chosen Dick Clarke or George Tenet, who did foresee the threat generally and sincerely attempted to cope with both signals and noise.

B00913P6G0|5.0|Good Kid: M.A.A.D City most definitely met my expectations and I am beyond stoked about the fact that I purchased this amazing album that will for sure! become legendary in the Hip-Hop industry. I simply love and enjoyed every single track, the album contains many stories and some if not most relatable.. King Kendrick Lamar is here to stay! This man is pure genius and he is definitely one of the greatest!!!! So with that being said if you don't have this album, you ain't EATIN.

Rick Baker and the alien effects,Josh Brolin and Will Smith made great partners,great special and visual effects,great 3D.I thought this MIB is the best of them all...but im a 3D fan and this one was made in 3D and it was great 3d.Plenty of laughs,some of the jokes were laugh out loud between W.Smith and J.Brolin and plenty of action.Very,very entertaining movie.A 3D dvd for any collection.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|When it comes to James Bond I don't think it gets much better than this. From my understanding many old Bond fans weren't too happy about the more serious tone, lack of gadgets, and few other little things you come to expect from a Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. Regardless when it comes to script, story, acting, and the remarkable stunts this movie will easily sit at the top of many peoples list overall not just Bond movies. Daniel Craig came in and set a whole new tone that is much more believable and grounded in reality yet keeps that Bond magic we all live. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves action, Bond, our just a good story.
1608871045|5.0|A must have for every Batman fan out there!!! There's a lot of nice stuff, including maps, files, stickers, Wayne enterprises projets... I just love it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child has an outstanding ability to keep the reader guessing and turning the pages.  A Wanted Man was just one of those book's for me.<br />I commonly open a started book wondering where is Mr. Child going to take me tonight?  I'm amazed by the breath of his knowledge and<br />stymied by his ability to develop unforeseen plot twists.  I've read all his books now, which means I'll have to be patient.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Brandon for a while, and I was pretty excited when I found out about this book. After all, it was a new magic system. Needless to say, I was not disappointed, and the book is amazing. I highly recommend it to any fantasy reader.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|I'll come out and say it this isn't a great movie, it just was a little to slow and boring at points. That being said I don't view this movie as bad either, I find that this film 8D best when viewed immediately after casino royale as it is a direct continuation to it. I firmly if more people could accept that the film would receive much better reviews. I say this because people expect Bond to contain certain aspects that weren't present in thus film for good reason. Thus film isthe ending of the beginning of the Craig era Bond. It is a mediocre film and is definitely a lower tier Bond film.  To put it simply if you are contemplating purchasing this movie, I'd say buy it..IF you own casino royale  because if watched together it's like one long movie. If you're a Bond enthusiast buy it used to add to the  collection. If you're looking for a good film skip this one.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Harrison Ford as a curmudgeon,OK. but just. Diane Keaton is excellent as usual.<br />Rachel McAdams is certainly well cast as an innocent / naive / wide-eyed overly optimistic<br />exec-producer on a failing morning TV show. In the end, the chemistry just isn't there.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I like historical novels written in fictionalized form.  Fall of the Giants is a trilogy and I suspect I will get around to reading the 2nd novel soon.<br />I also liked sweeping drama The Pillars of the Earth (title?), plus many other genres of Mr. Follett.  Eye of the Needle was my first introduction to him and that was an exceptionally suspenseful novel.

B00000DC7J|4.0|Well, this is not for the faint of heart. Imagine a cross between Stravinsky's Rite of Spring and Tango. This is NOT pop music! I can see how Astor Piazolla once had a gun held to his head in Bueno Aires, threatening death if he ever wrote or performed again. Fortunately, this unusual genius continued his prolific output. There are a lot of transcriptions of Piazolla's music, and I believe they generally have the raw harshness toned down quite a bit. It is an eye opener to hear these pieces performed by the master, sounding the way he really intended.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I've read all of Lee Child's Reacher books and this was one of my favorites.  I have not read them in order which I think was a good idea as I<br />could put together Reacher's life piecemeal.  All Mr. Child's books are engrossing and he has created an exceptionally phenomenal hero.  If you haven't discovered Jack Reacher yet, you are in for a treat.  I look forward to his next escapade with enthusiasm.  Well done, Mr. Child.

B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I finally rented The Hunger Games. There's two hours of my life I will never get back. Horrible cinematography (would have liked at least ONE steadycam shot), the viewer was not given a chance to feel much of the emotion (which means no emotional inventment at all), and, finally, unlike the book, I didn't really want Katniss and Prim to win.<br /><br />I will not watch the rest of them. Oh, and by the way, Mr. Director of Photography, give your people room to BREATHE. Closeups and dirty-overs were so restrictive (and there were too many of them), that the whole thing could have been filmed at the park across from my High School (which is one block square). I give it 2 stars out of 5. The second star is to fatten the one-star, because not a single character looked hungry to begin with.

1608871088|1.0|I've always hated Santa Clause.<br />My mother fell in love with a white-bearded beatnik poet who rode a motorcycle. She left me to be raised by my Asian grandmother who ran a dry cleaning business in a southern Texas Hispanic town on the border of Mexico. I had to ride the bus to school all the way through to  my senior year in high school because my grandmother felt walking home would be unsafe after my bicycle was stolen in fourth grade. We suspected my teacher did it since he had pictures on his desk of his kid Pablo Juan on a bike similar to mine. We could never prove it though because he would forget how to speak English when questioned by authorities.<br />Every year without fail, every time time I would get off the school bus, someone in a seasonally specific costume would chase me all the way home, yelling and throwing holiday specific items. To this day, I have no idea who it was.<br />In the month if December, calling me by name, Santa Clause would chase me while throwing assorted confectionary items at me. Often times, the pungent smell of rotten cream and cake would rest in my blonde hair because I could not wash it out with the store brand shampoo my grandma insisted I use.<br />Halloween was as unpredictable as it was relentless. The costume would vary, but the food propelled would not.<br />Swedish Meatballs. Like everything else, it never made sense.<br />March and April were especially long as the Easter Bunny would skip the treats and just throw raw eggs at me. I chipped my front tooth when i slipped on some eggs and landed face first into a wooden fence. Unavoidably, I now speak with a whistle.<br />If anyone has been as traumatized by the childhood fantasy characters as I have, they well-know that this is a horror movie. When I became aware of this movie, all of the suppressed memories and anxieties surfaced again. I often found myself losing control of my bodily functions and subsequently being kicked off numerous buses on my way to or from home.<br />My therapist suggested that I confront these unresolved issues by purchasing this art book from the movie. During our sessions, we would then go through one page at a time and discuss the terrifying images. Following each session, I would then ride the bus home. My therapist would dress up as a seasonal character to meet me at my bus stop and torment me by throwing crumpled up pages from the book at me.<br />It was either the ineffectiveness of the \\"shock therapy\\" or the pleasure my therapist took in his job that he began to escalate his tormenting of me. I was tipped off at the less than gradual change when he, dressed as Santa Clause, laughing hysterically,  threw the entire book at me and chased me with a chainsaw while throwing deserts at me.<br />As a result, I was unable to finish the art book or find out why people must chase me when I get off the bus.e.<br />My therapist suggested that I confront these unresolved issues by purchasing this art book from the movie.

B008ULM7HK|4.0|Vince Clark formed Yazoo with jazz/blues vocalist Alison Moyet after he hastily exited Depeche Mode. The combination of Vince's minimal electronics and synths with Alison's powerful bluesy vocals was pure brilliance. The duo were an immediate hit in their native UK while their debut album \\"upstairs at eric's\\" (released under the name YAZ in the US) quietly went platinum stateside. The partnership was short lived and by the time their second album \\"you and me both\\" was released the two announced plans to split. Alison would become a successful solo artist and Vince would find further fame with Erasure.<br /><br />The work presented here is an almost complete collection of the duo's writing output over the course of two albums. Nearly every album track and b-side is included. For the record there are only three original songs missing: \\"i before e except after c\\", \\"in my room\\" and \\"And on\\". The first two omitted tracks in my opinion will hardly be missed but \\"And on\\" is a beautiful song and its a shame not to see it here among so many gems. As for the rest of the tracks they are amazing pop songs. The gorgeous \\"only you\\" is timeless with its sad longing, the club hit \\"situation\\" still sounds fresh and the opening rift to \\"don't go\\" is pure 80's synth-pop nostalgia. All the songs here are strong compositions. Later work moved away from pure pop and into deeper and more introspective territory such as the moody \\"ode to boy\\" with it's sparse beats and minimal backing and the blatantly political \\"unmarked\\".<br /><br />I cannot tell if these tracks have been remastered but it sounds like there may have been some tweaking of songs. Overall, the collection is low priced and a great way to get nearly 2 albums worth of material. There are some additional remixes which may interest those who like different mixes or arrangements but for the me the main draw are the original compositions which still impress 30 years later.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love how Patrick and Sam took Charlie under their wing, and how Charlie described things and said things, everyone thought, but nobody said. Definitely worth it.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|What a story appropriate for today's world.  The storyline exudes high integrity-something lacking in today's political arena where people will use the press to say anything regardless of truth.  The lead character is a tall, real, man of character.  I would recommend this story to all students 12 to 23 who are growing and developing as young adults.  They will need to make many choices in the future based on their values and intestinal fortitude.  They will need to decide the meaning of capitalism-open competition? or greed is ok?
0385535147|4.0|Classic Grisham storytelling.  But suspend your disbelief at the door.  The plot, with all the twists, is absurd; the characters might as well be extraterrestrials. Nevertheless, I was sucked in and read the whole book in a day.<br />There are two subplots that are compelling.  First, the power of the federal prosecutor and his minions is frightening.  If the fed searchlight beam fixes on you, you're going to the slam.<br /> Second, a theme that I have often fallen asleep contemplating, is how does one walk out of his digital footprints and live outside the purview of the authorities?  These days, given the resources of government, even the CIA director's trysts are transparent.
B007JMW46U|5.0|As I read my first chapter the solution seemed obvious until I ralized a tv or movie had been made from the story.  I enjoy both the book and the adaptations to other media.  Only finished two chapters but hope to find some stories I don't alrady Know.  Great book!!

B009E3EY38|5.0|OK, it's Led Zeppelin.  Or as close as you will ever get after 9/25/1980.  So buy it.<br /><br />Why?  This could have been an embarrassing mess.  No one would forgive these guys for trotting out on stage, sleepwalking through \\"Stairway\\", and calling it a night. Everyone would still scream for a reunion even after whispering on how sad they looked.  <cough>Live Aid</cough><br /><br />Imagine now the complete opposite.  Imagine chemistry and musicianship so powerful it could rip a hole in time.  Imagine three guys and the son of a lost friend having a ball (and showing it) while they set themselves forever in rock and roll history as a band apart.  There simply is no comparison -- nothing comes close.<br /><br />All the chestnuts are there, but they pull off some deep cuts such as \\"In My Time of Dying\\" and an absolutely brilliant version of \\"Since I've Been Loving You.\\" And of the standards, \\"Kashmir\\" has never sounded more brilliant.<br /><br />So don't really hope for the tour.  This was five years ago, and Page is about to turn 70. Don't let Zeppelin become some pathetic band hitting the state fair circuit, or re-self destruct while on tour like others (you know who you are).  Enjoy this last gem from the pagan Gods of Rock and Roll.  Turn down the lights in the basement, run it through the blu-ray and enjoy the DTS-MA soundtrack. And be thankful this Thanksgiving for the two best studio musicians in England combining with the power of the raw voice and drummer to make the greatest rock and roll band of all time.

B00979CS50|5.0|Yes, NOW!  Do you have something else in your shopping basket and don't want to spend the money?  Take it out, this is worth far more than it costs.<br />If you like Neil Young and Crazy Horse, remember Weld and Ragged Glory and like fuzzed out guitar bliss, this is a five star album for you. Even now, Neil and The Horse sound young, strong, fresh and loud as hell. The album starts with a 27 minute slab of semi-psychedelic, pounding, tight-jamming \\"Driftin' Back,\\" which recalls the excess of Arc but has the consistency of Cinnamon Girl most of the time... A 2 CD release with only 9 songs... it's three platters on vinyl. I have listened to Neil for all of my adult life and while I love some of his quiet bluesy work, especially On The Beach, when I want rocking, remembering the '60s while still moving forward, this is exactly what I hoped it would be. Believe all the great reviews you see, this is the album of the year.  I was either lucky enough or smart enough to use my birthday gift card to get this among other things... all of which pale by comparison.  I see here on Amazon it is currently #1 in \\"Classic Psychedelic Rock.\\"  That's accurate enough, I suppose.  Neil has never forgotten the '60s, but this does not sound like any rehashing or some throwback album.  It's fuzzed out, tight-jamming, ironic/smart/insightful lyrics... Let me go back to the beginning.  The first time I played this, I blissed out to \\"Driftin' Back,\\" and when it was over nearly half an hour later, I wasn't tired of it, I PLAYED IT AGAIN!  Some reviewers on here say it's not psychedelic enough... I'm not sure what that means.  I have a lot of classic psych as well as modern revivals, and this doesn't need to fit with those.  The \\"Pill\\" you are taking is a bold, loud, brilliant Trip that will take you away just as the title suggests.  Like a strong button of peyote, you are on a Vision Quest with Neil and a group of excellent musicians who know each other, know how to riff off each other, knowwhen to go all out and when to let someone else take over... and you are heading for Musical Nirvana.  Drums by Ralph Molina are stronger than they have been in years, providing a pounding support for lead guitar and seeming to match the bass of Billy Talbot at times and moving on his own when it feels right... and it sounds right.  Instead of a long review going through track by track or echoing the praise of Rolling Stone or other reviewers, let me throw out some comparisons, just briefly.  When Jim was still in his prime and delivered The Celebration of The Lizard live, The Doors were in the realm of this album.  When Jimi melded The Star-Spangled Banner and Purple Haze, he was there. Patti Smith started in this stratosphere with Horses. The Beatles hit this level off and on until \\"The White Album\\" where they were among these luminaries.  Let It Bleed, Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation... adding dissimilar but equal peaks, Radiohead's OK Computer and Kid A, My Bloody Valentine's Loveless... it starts to become difficult to find enough albums that qualify.  If I find a better album released in 2012 I will be extraordinarily surprised.  I don't think the awards often get things right, but if they did, I don't see how anything nominated could match Psychedelic Pill.  Now I need to shell out the bucks for the vinyl... you know how Neil feels about vinyl.  That will look good in a frame on my wall...  Any questions?

0312430000|5.0|Dr. Gawande shares powerful anecdotes that demonstrate how complexity in health care today makes it impossible to provide consistent quality unless we use tools that help us remember all the key things we need to do and in what sequence.  Gawande describes amazing improvements in health outcomes when surgeons and OR staff members use a simple checklist to ensure that they take all the appropriate steps in a person's surgery.  But the same points apply to how we deliver service and how we communicate.  I find it very frustrating that many managers have backed away from the concept of engaging their teams in developing key words at key times or as I prefer to call it key message points for quality communication at important touchpoints between staff and patients.  After all, every member of the healthcare team is dealing with complexity---work overload, multiple responsibilities, multi-tasking, and the challenges and stresses not only in their work but in their personal lives.  So, how can we possibly expect consistent quality in pivotal communications unless we have Gawande's equivalent of a checklist of the key message points that define quality communication.<br /><br />Here's one example from Dr. Gawande, and it's a COMMUNCIATION example.<br />\\"Good teamwork required certain things that we missed very frequently.... Like making sure everyone in the Operating Room knows each other by name.  When introductions were made before a surgery, complications and deaths decreased by 35 percent.  Gewande explains, \\"Making sure everyone knew each other's name produced what they call an activation phenomenon.  The person, having gotten a chance to voice their name, let speak in the room---were much more likely to speak up later if they saw a problem.<br /><br />So, introducing everyone before surgery is one of several items on Dr. Gewande's suggested checklist.  And he says so much more of value.<br />Wendy Leebov, Ed.D.<br />President and CEO, Leebov Golde Group<br />Co-Author, The Language of Caring for Physicians:  Communication Essentials for Patient-Centered Care

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun. Makes you think. Had never played Solitaire where the cards put themselves in the correct place just by touching them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is great but I cant figure out how to update it cause my brother updated it .
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I liked it. it is ok. it was funny because I woke up in the morning and I forgot it was the release date. I immediately got the game.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I like the variety in this album. There are some dubstep elements in All is Hell that ends Well and ethnic instruments in El Dorado. I am not the biggest fan of the vocal tracks,but overall they manage to make this another well-made epic album.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was the best book i have ever read in my life!!!!! i have read a lot of books and nothing compared to this book. I loved this book so much that i actually re-read this book ( I have never done that before). i cant wait for the next book!!! i do not recommend this book for younger readers, because there is some content that may not be appropriate. I was so sad when i finished this book, after reading this one i have such high expectations for every other book out there which makes it kind of hard. I think that after reading this book everyone wants a Travis.
B000007UXS|4.0|I received this album with a slight warp. Contacted the seller and they offered to give me a refund if I returned it. If only this record wasn't worth ever second!!! I fixed the warp myself and it sounds beautiful. Props to the seller for good/quick customer service, fast delivery, and EZ transaction. Sorry it took me so long to rate, but if you ever have a record I want again I will not hesitate to buy.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|I can't say I LOVE the movie. But it was good or okay I guess. I was just curious to know what's in the movie since it talks about the 2012 disaster. That's why I bought it. Neither I love the movie a lot nor I hate it.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I would recommend this for romantics...the poetry is an added bonus in a very modern inspiring way.<br />perfect for high schoolers and parents alike!

B001UU2RB4|4.0|As was previously stated by another reviewer, this series starts very slowly, as if it's a test run. I came across it last year on prime time and wished I had started watching it at the beginning, (it's impossible to just jump into this story). I have Amazon Prime and can now insta stream it for free! Here I am, what a ride! This show and the characters really grow on you. Who is a good guy, who is a bad guy, what makes good, what makes bad? These are the questions you start to ask by episode 9 or so.<br /><br />I will of course keep my prime account as free shipping is...well free...but when I add what it would have cost to buy all of these 5 or so seasons...well it will pay for itself at the end of the first one!<br /><br />So very happy to have a thought provoking SciFi show to grab onto and go along for the ride. If you like mystery and Scifi, you are bound to love this series. I look forward to giving a higher rating on a smoother season.<br /><br />Enjoy now!<br /><br />(Watched for free on Amazon insta stream as a Prime member.)

B005LAII08|3.0|I was very frustrated to find that the 3D disc would freeze during play.  I removed the disc and checked the back for any scratches or prints.  There weren't any.  I cleaned my player and popped it in.  It happened again in different parts of the movie 26 to 30 minutes in. I had to play the regular BluRay disc, which played fine. I was really annoyed because I bought it for the 3D experience.  I believe the 3D disc was defective.  Did anyone else experience this?

B0076DEJMO|4.0|After exploding on the fantasy scene with his excellent First Law trilogy, Abercrombie has gone on to do something rather unusual in the fantasy scene, release complete stories with unique themes and styles(yes, I'm looking at you George R.R. Martin).<br /><br />In Red Country, Abercrombie combines fantasy and western, in much the same way that the usually great Sanderson did in  his disappointing \\"The Alloy of Law.\\"  Unlike Sanderson's less than stellar effort, Abercrombie does not simply add guns, trains, and cowboy hats to his magical world, but rather, explores the themes (a rush for gold, western expansion, the effect of settlers upon native inhabitants, the splendor and danger of vast open country, feuds for land and power, etc.) using the same technology as has been present throughout the series.  This fusion of styles works quite well and I applaud Abercrombie for trying to capture the spirit and feel of a western rather than the merely appearance of a western.  As a fantasy, it is similar to his latest works; a world with little magic or heroism, but plenty of violence<br /><br />The story itself seems simple enough.  A girl sets of to rescue her brother and sister from cut throat bandits with the help of her aging step father who may not be as timid and fearful as he would have people believe.  This description does not do justice to just how epic this journey is, as it requires covering a vast amount of space, encountering numerous dangers and a large ensemble cast who are for the most part as despicable and deadly as you would expect to find in an Abercrombie novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's not perfect.  Although the characters are enjoyable, none could be ranked as Abercrombies best. With such a good journey, it is sad that the destination appears more exciting than in turns out to be.  The conclusion is good enough, but simply a little anti-climactic, and a bit overlong.  Lastly, the dirt and grime, both literal and metaphorical, may be Abercrombie's trademark style but at times can be a bit much and may not be everyone's cup of tea.
B001B7CNXI|3.0|This is a decent more serious version of the hit show. But it lacks the style that mad the original so famous. The earlier show was of it's time and place. In fact the original show actually helped save Miami! The pastel decor and rebuilding of sets helped the beach areas recover and become what it is today. In reality the city was in trouble back then and out of control due to the drug wars. Now it's a whole other place. The acting is here is good but not either of these leading mans best for sure. Still it's a good cop movie on it's own. It needed more style perhaps but then the 80's were long gone by this time. And some shows you just can't go back too unless they are made about the time they originally existed in. This was one of those probably. I actually own this blu ray and it looks good. After all this is newer film and it should! I don't agree that the dvd is a better looking deal at all. If you want this get the blu ray. Downloading does not have the quality of a good blu ray.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Good SciFi. Intro needs more information, concerning man's origin. Sequel could be interesting addition. Interesting that only robotic man survived.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|Like all those who love Fagen's music, I've been listening and dissecting these tracks for several weeks now, happy in the knowledge that whatever my initial impressions might be, they would grow and deepen over time. So it's strange for me to give CONDOS a 4-star review. I want every track -- or almost -- to be a gem, as I've come to expect. But here I can find only one genuine article, \\"Miss Marlene.\\"<br /><br />I'm giving only qualified approval to everything but \\"Miss Marlene\\" and to a lesser degree, \\"Memorabilia,\\" because I'm not wild about the lyrics. There's very little that's new, fresh or funny. Yes comrades, I know all about the English major's story-telling skills, his love of gangsters, sexy-sociopathic women with ADD, self-deprecation, irony, the end of the world, etc.  I love that stuff, or at least, I have in the past.<br /><br />From a strictly musical point of view, it's mostly good news, due to Fagen's great skills as a composer, arranger and producer (hats off to Michael Leonhart), the superb roster (Kurt Rosenwinkel gets a big thumbs-up), Fagen's excellent singing and his overall musical sensibility:  ever jazzy, rocky and funky.  But only \\"Miss Marlene\\" has both that special and surprising lyrical and musical uplift I expect to feel listening to Donald and Steely Dan at their best. Maybe I'm just spoiled. But there's a skimming-over-the-surface feeling to these tunes that doesn't take me where I'd like to go. I'm tired of hearing about the Prohibition-era gangster in \\"The Good Stuff.\\" I don't care if his boss wants to party all night. I have little sympathy for the old hippie who feels paranoid about his hot young \\"Slinky Thing.\\" Truthfully now, how come she doesn't prefer somebody \\"closer to her own age\\"? There's an odd mixture of disingenuous self-pity and self-aggrandizement in this track that makes me roll my eyes. Similarly, the scenario of \\"The New Breed\\" does little for me. And \\"Planet D'Rhonda\\" - haven't we heard about this unreliable, sex-crazed lady numerous times from Fagen over the years? (And would somebody please get me her phone number?) \\"I'm Not the Same Without You\\" does have a slightly different worldview than we'd expect from Fagen, and I like how it wavers between serious and tongue-in-cheek. It's got some nice changes, but it's tepid.<br /><br />Fagen has demonstrated many times that he has great lyrical and imaginative range. (Think \\"The Nightfly\\" from front to back.)  Why has he gotten married to the same old scenarios?<br /><br />Not sure what to say about \\"Out of the Ghetto.\\" It's well produced and Donald sounds good. I'm just not sure what it's doing on this record. The fact that it's a cover doesn't bother me. I loved \\"Ruby Baby.\\" This time Fagen decided to pay homage to his Ashkenazi Jewish roots with the use of violin and a few lyric changes. I have those same roots, and although it was nostalgic to hear those harmonic minor touches, I was like, \\"so?\\"<br /><br />In the plus column, aside from the transcendent \\"Miss Marlene,\\" \\"Memorabilia\\" is a quintessential Fagen tune about characters who live in an alternate hoarder's universe. I don't mind the repetitions; it's just funny and off-center enough to keep me hooked. \\"Weather in My Head\\" is a deeply groovy minor blues tune with the pristine, layered quality Fagen is famous for. And \\"Slinky Thing,\\" despite the tired message, sounds delightful.<br /><br />In truth, most of these tunes have enough architecture to warrant multiple listenings. When he's on, he's on. It's not a 5-star effort and not one that I play obsessively, as I have with other Steely Dan and Fagen stuff. Still, Fagen is a master of the groove.  To paraphrase his tribute to Ray Charles: it's what he do.

B0043KK4N6|5.0|I loved the movie and could not wait to get the soundtrack.  Christina was not someone I knew much about until the movie and Cher has always provided great entertainment.  I enjoy reliving the movie each time I put this cd on.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|First I should say that I really like this show. There aren't very many shows for which I find myself waiting for the release of the next episode.  I guess I just feel like the writers may have somewhat exhausted the premise and for that the script has kind of lost it's way a little.  Still a great show.  In a movie/show like the Walking Dead, certain &#34;rules of the universe&#34; are laid down, and the writers play with the rules at risk of great peril.  When the &#34;rules&#34; were changed so that anyone who dies turns into a zombie, I think the writers made a mistake, and for the plot it was (at least so far) something kind of unnecessary.  Anyone who is bitten immediately turns, but everyone is already infected? Kind of doesn't really make sense.  Just hope that the series doesn't undergo a &#34;Lost-ization&#34; (just invented that word, but I think that anyone who followed Lost will understand what I mean).
B0094OLJD0|5.0|Enjoyed all aspects of this collaboration. St Vincent has an amazing voice, and Byrne continues to amaze. Like David Bowie, there is a continuous evolution.
1451695195|4.0|An online review before the book was released caught my attention so I bought the book and read it cover to cover on a cross country flight. As I read my heart resonated with much of what he described experiencing while in a coma and I found tears streaming down my face many times.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's description of his experience with the 'beyond' and with God are consistent with my own experiences spread over a lifetime. My first experience (at age 13) the day after my father died were the words, \\"God is energy\\" entering my mind while I put dishes in the washer. The most important experience was direct contact with a powerful, beautiful, loving undulating field of energy from which the words, \\"I am what I am through you\\" slowly emerged. Dr. Alexander's experiences were consistent with mine and confirmed my belief that my indivdual conciousness or spirit survives death and that the essence of God is love.<br /><br />I think the key title word 'proof' is misleading because it is proof only to Dr. Alexander, not proof that most others would accept in the scientific sense. I would have liked more of the book focused on describing his experiences in the beyond perhaps accompanied by a few artist renderings of what he 'saw'. The details of his thoughts about the medical aspects of his illness and their possible impact on his experience of the beyond got in the way at times.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book, am glad I read it and heartily recommend it to anyone with spiritual curiosity.

1439102732|5.0|I am all for more diversity when it comes to books and the media. Jodi was very brave to write this book in the face of the hatred that still exists toward gay and lesbian people. I don't think that she was attacking all Christians. I am a straight, Christian woman, and I wasn't offended at all. That's because I don't use my Christianity as a weapon to keep other members of the human race down, such as how the Christians in this book were portrayed. I definitely know some of these Christians in real life.  I like to read books that go against the grain. Kudos to Jodi for being so brave!<br /><br />When I was reading this book, my state was trying to decide whether or not they would add a ban of marriage to the constitution. The arguments of both sides very much mirrored the arguments between the Christians and the supporters of Zoe and Vanessa. Instead of Evangelicals, Catholics were the ones leading the way, and raising millions of dollars (could have been used to help the poor,) to go toward banning gay marriage. They lost by the way. In short, I found this book to be very realistic.

So how did this film shape up?  Exciting action?  We got a totally unbelievable pre-credits chase sequence that ends on a very depressing note....  Exotic locales?  Some interesting night scenes of Guangzhou but nothing you would be in a hurry to add to your own next overseas travel itinerary.  Gorgeous women?  Earlier Bond films have featured gorgeous females that have made Bond the envy of red blooded males the world over.  This time round, there's not a single woman that would make Bond the envy of any man!  What a total letdown!  A very disappointing anniversary affair.  In the past, the Bond franchise has managed spectacular revivals after its flops.  The excellent Spy Who Loved Me followed the disappointing Man With the Golden Gun.  The impressive \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" followed the ridiculous Moonraker\\".  The full throttle \\"Living Daylights\\" followed the derided A View to a Kill and the very exciting \\"Goldeneye\\" restored the sunshine after the gloomy \\"Licence to Kill\\".  Hopefully, the next Bond film will restore the public's faith in the franchise after the current disappointment.  Am I eagerly anticipating the film's DVD release?  NO!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|very fun game, stays fun even after a few days. and read before you click and you wont buy anything you don't want. problem solved. add Aceryy, I tip well.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|This is a nice transitioning book of the series, and I am pumped for Requiem! I feel that this book probably had my expectations a bit too high; I was on the waiting list for this book for months. I see promise in this book as it directs us towards the third book in the series, but I feel that this book was just a bridge. I absolutely love Oliver's writing style, and her fluid descriptiveness, and this book displays it very well, just as Delirium did. When I first began reading the book, I thought that the back and forth change of tense would irk me, but surprisingly, I really liked it and though it went very well with how the author was telling the story. The chapterly shifts in time provided a backstory and the result, a practice and a procedure, an experience and an expertise, and an example and an outcome. A good quote from the book that displays this process is:<br /><br />\\"Running is a mental sport, more than anything else. You're only as good as your training, and your training is only as good as your thinking.\\" (65)<br /><br />Through content, plot line and character developments, I would have to say that Delirium is overly superior than Pandemonium, however Pandemonium is still an interesting book. I started to realize where the story was going, which means to me, the ending wasn't as surprising. I really wasn't sold on Julian as either a love interest or likable character as I just seemed to see him as an annoying cripple that needed constant coddling. In contrast towards Lena's strong growing empowerment as a protagonist, I was seeing Julian as a child that had to tag along for the ride. The insta-love between these two characters didn't feel real.<br /><br />\\"'There's a place for everything and everyone, you know. That is the mistake they make above. They think that only certain people have a place. Only certain kinds of people belong. The rest is waste. But even waste must have a place. Otherwise it will clog and clot, and rot and fester.'\\" (240)<br /><br />On the whole, the plot was interesting enough to keep me easily reading through the book, losing all sense of time, which is always a good thing for me. I enjoyed Lena's empowerment as she learns the ropes of being a part of The Resistance, and the author's writing maintains it's fluid beauty as she takes us through Lena's new world of life after catching Deliria.<br /><br />First Line: \\"Alex and I are lying together on a blanket in the backyard of 37 Brooks.\\" (1)<br />Last Line: ....er... haha... no. No spoilers for you!<br /><br />-----------<br />Quotes<br /><br />\\"But the old Lena is dead too. I buried her. I left her beyond a fence, behind a wall of smoke and flame.\\" (3)<br /><br />\\"The animals are on the other side of the fence: monsters wearing uniforms. They speak softly, and tell lies, and smile as they're slitting your throat.\\" (20)<br /><br />\\"the only thing worse than having no friends is being pitied for having no friends.\\" (43)<br /><br />\\"A world without love is also a world without stakes.\\" (65)<br /><br />\\"Anger is useful only to a certain point. After that, it becomes rage, and rage will make you careless.\\" (299)<br /><br />\\"The tunnels may be long, and twisted, and dark; but you are supposed to go through them.\\" (209)br />On the whole, the plot was interesting enough to keep me easily reading through the book, losing all sense of time, which is always a good thing for me.

B008D28HYS|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. Updated often with new puzzles that get harder and harder! Earlier versions would freeze, but that has been fixed in one of the latest updates. Wish it displayed the time, since you lose track of how long it takes to solve each one!
B004UID2LC|1.0|ever since the update. it will not allow you to download music! please fix! it was an excellent app! loved it!
B0031RS4UM|5.0|I enjoyed this second book in the series as much as the first.  The pace of the drama kept up until the very end.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Good for girls and boys alike. Movie helps bridge the generations. A great movie... almost wish I had three little brothers who turn into bears! LOL
B003K15IF8|5.0|I understand \\"Stoner\\" was published in 1965 with little acclaim ;perhaps it was the swinging sixties to blame. Now everyone I know seems to be reading it,and deservedly so.<br />Stoner is the son of poor farmers and he works as soon as he is able. But he is a clever boy and the school authorities persuade his parents to let him go to University to study agriculture. However he has to take a course in English, finds an inspiring teacher, and falls in love, not with a girl, and not with a boy, but with the English language and literature. And this is a love that will be with him for the rest of his life. He changes course to English and his parents accept he will never return to the farm. Instead he becomes a teacher, and a successful imparter of a love of English in his turn.<br />In other respects his life is a failure. He marries unwisely and his love affair is doomed. He does not know how to work the system and his career is little rewarded. But teach he can.<br />The book reminds me of Rattigan`s wonderful play, \\"The Browning Version\\" where the teacher, Crocker Harris is unsuccessful in his career and his marriage but discovers, in the end, that there is one boy at least he has taught.<br />An inspiring teacher is a wonderful thing, and those who have found them have been blessed.
B004J4WKDI|5.0|Beautiful story! A very unique and unpredictable plot. A delight to read. I would definitely read more by this author.
B00386EZJU|3.0|I was expecting a 'main title' or 'end title' & there really wasn't either one of those.  It was OK otherwise.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|A fun happy movie for girls. Grandsons could care less, but girls like this one. Remember this at Christmas! Nice!
B002VWNIEA|5.0|I think he enjoyed this role too much, it's scary when we take a walk on the Dark Side of The Force, or the moon.....<br />Everything about this movie is perfect.  The directing, photography, timing, it is extremely well done.<br />It is so easy to become corrupt when you have Power.<br />Denzel is one of my favorite actors and he really shined in this role.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Well written, interesting characters, very insightful. That there was no main character didn't bother me at all. I didn't want it to end!
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this season!!<br />All the women have great stories going on. Cant wait to see the final season, which I will buy next!
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I was very excited for this album to come out! However, I'm not too impressed with some of the songs. I may just be partial to the classics or a certain Aerosmith style, but some of the songs are not for me.<br /><br />A few of my favorites from the CD are:<br />~Legendary Child: It was the first single off of the album, and I love it!<br />~Oh Yeah: Heard this one in concert before the album came out. Very catchy, upbeat.<br />~Street Jesus: The lyrics caught me by surprise. The guitar is very well played and spunky.<br />~What Could Have Been Love: A bit like I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing in the slow sense. A pretty good song altogether.<br /><br />So, pretty much, if you like the classic Aerosmith I'd suggest that you choose wisely! I'm not saying the album is bad; it's just a different kind of Aerosmith than you may be used to. :)
B001FD5KJM|5.0|And &#34;Pepper&#34; (his secretary)<br />OMG! that was Gwyneth Paltrow !? I just looked it up and am shocked.<br />did an excellent job.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is always great but I didn't recognize him since he's put on weight.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, I've seen it several times and I hardly ever see a movie more than once.<br />And I think kids would like it, although it really isn't a kid film.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|The book was great all the way through but I was disappointed with the ending.  I expected more than that.

B007UWBQEU|4.0|I really enjoyed this album but not as much as the last album. There were a lot more songs that jumped out at me in the last album. Don't get me wrong. This is good. I just found myself skipping through some of the tracks.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|one of the greatest movies of all time; really captures the reality of what cold war life was like.  conveys the intense fear of living with imminent destruction.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|I read the book a long time ago.. Albeit they didnt follow the book real well. they did take certain aspects from it. . But all in all it was a great movie.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|truly legendary!!!  this is the best thing ever happened to Led Zeppelin since \\" The Song Remains The Same\\" movie.  great video and audio quality.  a must-have for Led Zeppelin fans.
0132350882|4.0|The concepts presented in the first ten chapters should be required reading for everyone who wants to make a career out of writing software.<br /><br />The final chapter is an excellent summary of the book. Don't cheat yourself, work your way through the book.<br /><br />The remaining chapters of the book feel as if they barely touch the surface of their subjects. They are fine introductions, but should refer you to additional readings.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I'm not sure, but maybe Mitch Albom wrote this too fast. Just didn't capture me into the universe of the novel like his other novels.

B008KE3960|5.0|I found this to be a very engaging and interesting game. The graphics were good, control of flight paths very nice, and the ability to keep a lot going at once to keep it exciting.
034580404X|4.0|Good value for the price. It's a good book, be prepared it is porn in book form. I hear they are making a movie not sure how that's going to be rated.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|cool game medium graphics and rewards are ok but has a little graphic problem but sweet game for those times when you are bored
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire did not only exceed my expectations ,it went above and beyond them.<br />This book is part of the best series I've ever read.<br />Catching Fire in my opinion is a not only better than Hunger Games because it takes you into the story and you get to know the characters better. It is a great continuation of the series !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free seems simple enough yet it does challenge your mind. You have to think visually, abstractly, and concretely to connect one color's dot to its match AND fill in all of the spaces on the grid. I usually play whenever I have a moment free or even before bed because it is quick to launch and exit.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|This is a not too princessy princess movie. My girls love it. Particularly, the ugly duck tavern scene.  Also, motherbgothal is not too scary.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a really good read.  I was sad when it ended and want to read more of this author's writing.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This movie demonstrates a magic surreal quality. The tale itself is warm but heart wrenching, the characters  are endearing and the portrayal exquisite.<br />If you have a little girl (aged 7 or 8) to buy for, she will love this movie. The reason I say 7 or 8 is that there is a question about the survival of a Father at one point in the movie which may be upsetting to a younger audience.
B00142X56Y|5.0|Worth it alone for the &#34;Queen of the Night&#34; aria.  Great production and great singing all around. A Magic Flute worth owning.  Played it for a non opera lover and he enjoyed it very much.

1469984202|5.0|This is a corker of a book...or books I should say.  In his preface, Hugh Howey explains how his very short story turned in to a much demanded longer one and how it has taken off beyond all his wildest dreams.  It deserves all the accolades it has received and I loved it.<br /><br />So the first book of five is very short...a novella really.  Each book is longer than the one before and the main characters grow and seed themselves in to the reader's mind.<br /><br />Part One starts off simply enough with a man called Holston climbing to his death passing giggling children and adults going about their daily lives.  But this is set in the undetermined future when a catastrophe has befallen the planet earth and human beings are living in a many floored giant silo.  Holston has decided to \\"go outside\\" and this means his certain death...he is to carry out the \\"cleaning\\" where many before him have also died and are decomposing in full view of the occupants of the \\"inside.\\"  Some have volunteered, most have been sent as a punishment or the bad luck of the draw.  It is very intriguing and Holston's story makes you want to hear more and that is why the author was asked to write more and duly obliged!<br /><br />What I loved about life in the Silo is the parallels with life today.  Everyone has knows their place.  The animals bred for milk and meat are right down on the bottom floors with the folk who tend to them.  Climbing up a bit is \\"mechanical\\" where the engineers run the machinery that runs the Silo and provide it's light and heat.  Up in the middle are the IT geeks.....and right at the top are the Mayor and his flunkeys. Nothing has changed much, despite the catastrophe, and we have to wait a bit before we find out why that has happened.  All the way through the first three books I was wondering if this was the only Silo in existence and the final sentence gave me my answer!  Then it gets really exciting!<br /><br />It's all there...life, death, grief, struggle, doubt,love and hate.  Howey has created a whole new world and tells us that Ridley Scott has \\"picked up\\" the story...which is great news.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this set as a great read and a refreshing change from most dystopian stories.  Howey has a wonderful imagination and writes superbly.  Oh and you have to make your own mind up why it is called \\"Wool\\".....I have my own take on it and would love to hear everyone else's.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Unbelievable how this little unit can make music played on your iPod  this different!  The richness of sound and stereo separation is amazing.  Which it had a longer battery life but for the price it is exceptional.

B0097C8XL0|3.0|Ok well it is not the best Run game. It doesnt have goals that are easy to find and all you do is jump. It is cute but not tue best. It doesnt center right. The good thing is it doesnt look hard but it gets really hard.<br />Thanks

B001CZVVW8|5.0|With these 2 leads, this is an awesome DVD.  A must purchase.  Also, beautifully recorded. Not enough positves to say. Lensky sings beautifully, Olga plays her part in an overdone, almost silly way but this can be overlooked in an otherwise fabulous production.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I loved this movie and I'm 26. One can never be too old for cartoons and animated movies, in fact I think they're awesome.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|Ever since \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" comic (not the movie), I've been intrigued by the basic premise: legendary characters from other genres are given the superhero treatment and then brought together under unlikely circumstances to face a global threat.  This structure is the standard plot of just about every Avengers and Justice League comic, but only recently -- perhaps a sign of the times -- has cobbling together a diverse cast of characters become movie entertainment.<br /><br />\\"Rise of the Guardians\\" continues the trend by turning the dial on iconic characters like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman up to 11. Each of these characters gives a gift to children, which in turn causes the children to believe in them and bestows a form of immortality. It's an oddly parasitic relationship that was prominent in Wizard of the Coast's \\"The Primal Order\\" supplement, in which deities need worshippers to gain power. Our heroes may not be all that powerful, but they are certainly popular.  At least some of them are.<br /><br />One of the questions weighing on my mind in bringing my five-year-old to this film was how \\"Rise\\" would deal with Santa Claus. It's one thing to question the existence of the Tooth Fairy (I never liked her anyway), the Easter Bunny (does anyone believe he exists?), and the Sandman (pretty sure NOBODY believes he exists)...but Santa Claus?  That's some tricky turf right there.<br /><br />Parents needn't worry.  Santa is a jovial, dual saber-wielding slavic warrior full of wisdom, jolly humor, and generosity.  As voiced by Alec Baldwin, this is a Santa I can get on board with!<br /><br />The Sandman doesn't speak, but he pantomimes through thought-forms that lend themselves well to 3-D viewing.<br /><br />The Easter Bunny is voiced by Hugh Jackman, which seems oddly natural.  He's a combative, boomerang-wielding humanoid rabbit that can throw egg-smoke bombs like a ninja.  He's also pretty adorable.<br /><br />Isla Fisher (yes, the nymphomaniac from \\"Wedding Crashers\\") plays the Tooth Fairy as a neurotic workaholic who has been \\"out of the field\\" for so long that she no longer knows how to relate to kids. She also moons over Jack Frost (Chris Pine, AKA Captain Kirk).<br /><br />Frost is the teenager of the bunch, frustrated by his lack of fame which makes him literally invisible to children.  Frost is on a personal journey to discover how he became who he is and in doing so, accepting his role as a new Guardian of children.<br /><br />And that's what \\"Guardians\\" is secretly all about: aging gracefully into parenthood.  The older adults (the existing Guardians) worry about being forgotten, uninvolved in their children's lives.  Pitch the Boogeyman (voiced by an unctuous Jude Law) craves attention so much that he would be happy to just be feared because it means he will be remembered.  And Frost has to deal with his own childhood before he can become a parent.<br /><br />There are some amazing set pieces, plenty of clever quips, and enough magical battles to keep the movie clicking along.  But Frost is something of a bland catch-all for every rebellious \\"cool kid\\" in the history of movies (he wears a hoodie, he MUST be cool!) and his big revelation about his past isn't much of a revelation at all. \\"Rise of the Guardians\\" is clearly just getting beginning to launch a franchise, and this is a good start.

B005NJU8PA|4.0|I think Tim Ferris is a bit of a nut. But he's an entertaining nut.<br /><br />Having read The Four-Hour Workweek and The Four-Hour Body, I find that, alas, I have become neither rich nor superhuman; however, I enjoyed both books and took away a few useful tidbits, so I was happy to preorder The Four-Hour Chef as soon as it was available on Amazon's site. I've been wanting to learn to cook for years, but cookbooks tend to drive me crazy. (Season to taste? Cook until done? I'm a computer programmer - give me precision!)<br /><br />As with Tim's other books, this one is all over the place; while it's nominally about cooking, it's really about ways to learn with cooking as the thing you happen to be learning. Lots of other things get thrown in: how to memorize a deck of cards, using a gun to make sure your luggage arrives safely, the best generator to have on hand for emergencies - pretty much whatever catches Tim's interest. I find these sidebars amusing and think they improve the book, but I can see them being pretty annoying to someone who just wants to know about cooking.<br /><br />The book is divided into five sections, plus an appendix. Section one discusses Tim's ideas about learning, with stories about how he worked them out and used them (this includes losing weight - with an excerpt from The Four-Hour Body - and learning languages. Section two is the actual \\"learn to cook\\" part of the book; there are 17 \\"lessons\\",to be completed over two months (cooking twice a week). In theory, cooking all the different dishes in this section will take about four hours total to fit the theme of the book. I'll update the review once I've tried them all out to see how well that works, but from my read-through it's looking good; Tim chose the recipes to be very difficult to screw up, which is exactly what I want. (The first night's dinner, for example, contains eight ingredients if you count salt and pepper as separate ingredients, and requires a knife, cutting board, and dutch oven (plus maybe a can opener). Total hands-on time is listed at five minutes. In other words: exactly what you want to see when you don't have a lot of confidence in your cooking skills!<br /><br />Section three is the outdoors part of the book: it starts with the more or less conventional topics (choosing a gun, cooking venison) and then goes on to more unusual topics that I'm pretty sure I won't be actually putting into practice (how to catch, kill, and cook a pigeon or squirrel). I've never killed my own food, so the parts about how to kill chickens and lobster could come in handy, and there's a lesson on how to butcher a chicken. For the most part, though, I read this section for entertainment only rather than any desire to actually follow the recipes!<br /><br />Section four is science. This section gives you a brief description of various terms (gels, emulsification, foams, etc) along with recipes demonstrating each thing. Unfortunately, some of them are a bit impractical for the home cook (I would love to try the 30-second ice cream recipe, for example, but I have no idea where I would even get liquid nitrogen!) I liked that the descriptions were informative without being overly technical (I have a background in science, I don't have a degree in chemistry!) and while some of the equipment IS more elaborate in this section, most of it isn't particularly esoteric; I have a reasonably stocked kitchen and I think buying an immersion blender and vacuum sealer would let me do most of them.<br /><br />Section five is for cooking at a professional level. Here you have many \\"classic\\" recipes (french omelet, roast chicken) that any chef should know, followed by more unusual dishes meant to teach you various advanced principles such as form mimicking, texture manipulation, and themes. (I think my favorite recipe in this section, prior to trying any, is the edible dirt centerpiece - it really does look like flowers in dirt!) The section ends with the most ridiculous dish I've ever seen: the ingredient list spans give pages, and the total hands-on time is listed at 10-20 hours. That bit of absurdity seems the perfect way to finish out the book.<br /><br />Except, of course, there's more. The appendix seems to be whatever random stuff relating to food and learning Tim decided to throw in at the end: a recipe from every country in 140 characters or less, instructions on making free shots in basketball and tying knots, maps of where to eat in NYC and San Francisco.  There are also additional materials online.<br /><br />Overall impression? While I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, the instructions make them look like things I can actually do; I'll come back and update the review once I've worked through section two in the kitchen. I would have preferred to drop section three (or move it to its own book) in favor of an extended section two; I'm more interesting in the step-by-step introduction than in things I'm unlikely to ever use like acorn pancakes and illegal fishing equipment. That's my only real complaint, though, and the book is certainly big enough (over 600 pages) to squeeze everything in. Until I get a chance to actually try out the recipes, I rate the book at slightly over four stars based on sheer entertainment value.<br /><br />Note: this got listed as being for the Kindle edition, but I actually read the hardcover; I preordered both and accidentally posted the review from the wrong page. I have not read the electronic version.<br /><br />Disclosure: this review originally appeared at Vulcan Ears Book Reviews (vulcanears.com)
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I didn't like this album the first time I heard the entire thing, but as I listened to it again and again, it really grew on me.  I now adore the song &#34;22&#34;, which is so much fun to sing along to loudly while my children and I are driving.  Many of the other songs are wonderful,too.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for traditional country, you won't find it here.

B0090O07S2|5.0|I was so amazed at the quality of this recording! The Doors, and especially<br />Jim Morrison are close up & they are perfection! The music, and especially the vocals<br />are crisp, clear and full of that unquie quality that was Jim Morrison.<br />  If you wished to see & hear the great rock & roll, rythmn & blues band<br />\\"The Doors\\" and see the legendary Jim Morrison at his very best, buy this one!

B004I744AS|5.0|What a great way to start a new day....  I know in this busy world that we live in how we use our time is essential.  However, reading the opening page in this app is well spent time.  IT starts my day off on a positive note.

0345423496|2.0|SPOILERS!<br />From the master of sci-fi comes one of the most disappointing and worst books I've ever read. It's hard to believe that the author of 2001 could churn out such an atrocious piece of literature. What's missing from this that was present in the previous books is an actual story/plot. 2001 was fascinating due to its story, suspense, and action. It was one of the most profound books I've ever read, and I felt as if I were a part of the novel. And the way ACC writes makes it seem as if everything he's written is actually plausible and real. This book had an interesting premise. Frank Poole is found on the fringes of the Solar System, and is revived after a millennium of cryostasis. Though this seemed a bit implausible, it was very interesting. However, this is all the book has going for it. Frank is revived and immediately accepts that he is living in the 31st century. No culture shock, or hesitancy. He just accepts the fact. I don't know about you, but if I woke up in the 31st century, I'd be a bit disoriented and confused. Poole is predictable and a flat character. Gone are the the vivid, three-dimensional characters from previous novels. We don't get to see much of what Frank is thinking. Compare Heywood Floyd's encounter with Dave to Frank's encounter. We see what Floyd thinks of his encounter, whether or not it was a figment of his imagination, and how to interpret it. In contrast, when Frank encounters Dave, it's as if he's meeting a friend for lunch. No excitement, no amazement. Frank is just way too credulous throughout this book. Instead of getting good characters and character development, we have ACC's harangues on religion, society, and circumcision. The conclusion was terrible. No plot twist, no suspense. 2001's ending made me think for a while and it was eloquent. This ending just fizzles and leaves you empty. It was as if the book just stopped, and ACC just decided to publish it. This book had so much potential, but I am left with unansweredquestions.

0547884591|5.0|Despite the cooking theme, this is not a cookbook. Think of it more as a cooking class, where each recipe is designed to teach a skill (e.g. braising, saut&eacute;ing, knife skills, etc.) and every subsequent recipe builds upon those of the last. The idea is to teach the principles of cooking, so that after finishing the book you can tackle any recipe you come across and, more important, have the skills to improvise on your own.<br /><br />If you've struggled with cooking in the past, this alone is enough of a reason to pick up the book. Not only will it ensure that you have the essentials under your belt, it'll also give you a few crowd-pleasers to dazzle dates and parents alike. But the fun doesn't stop there. The 4-Hour Chef is divided into five main parts: Meta-Learning, The Domestic, The Wild, The Scientist, and The Professional. For those familiar with Tim Ferriss` previous work, these subdivisions make perfect sense. If not, here's a quick rundown:<br /><br />Tim is a bit of a self-made savant, building his career on starting as a no-name, know-nothing and transforming himself into a world-class _(fill in the blank)_. The \\"blank\\" for Tim has included holding a world record in tango, being a champion Chinese kickboxer, #1 best-selling author, etc. The full list of Tim's accomplishments is astounding. As such he's developed a reputation for learning things incredibly quickly, unusually and effectively. In The 4-Hour Chef he unveils the secrets of this \\"meta-learning\\" using cooking (a skill he'd always struggled with) as an example.<br /><br />At first glance I was most excited about the Meta-Learning, Domestic and Scientist sections (I'm a food writer and scientist), and I was not disappointed. In \\"Meta\\" he breaks down the basics of deconstructing problems (e.g. language learning, tango, swimming, tasting, launching companies, etc.) and solving them in the most effective way possible. (It also includes how to say \\"I must eat\\" in 9 different languages. Win.). Long-time Ferriss fans will love this section.<br /><br />Despite having a decent idea of how to navigate a kitchen, I learned a lot from the \\"Dom\\" section as well, and found its instructions far more logical than most introduction cookbooks. He focuses on transferable skills, like learning to \\"eyeball\\" measurements (while clarifying when you need to be exact) and knowing when something is \\"done.\\" There are also dozens of little tips and tricks that'll instantly skyrocket your kitchen confidence, which is half the battle of sticking with it. Though I didn't cook my way through the lesson plan (I've only had the book for a few days), it seemed highly approachable and even a little fun. The first day you'll learn to make osso \\"buko\\" without ever touching a knife.<br /><br />The \\"Sci\\" section wasn't at all what I expected (come to think of it, I have no idea what I expected--I just like science). It turned out to be a crash course in molecular gastronomy, which left me a bit crestfallen at first. While I love eating at fancy restaurants that serve elegant foams and spherical droplets of surprising flavors, I've never had any desire to recreate these things at home; some things are best left to the professionals. But the second I saw his \\"Crunchy Bloody Mary\\" recipe where chipotle infused vodka and bloody mary mix is transformed into a gel used to fill mini celery sticks, I had a change of heart. Reading the science behind all the culinary magic of restaurants like Alinea and El Bulli is fascinating, and I picked up a few parlor tricks to impress my friends. This section is a great way to feed your inner food geek.<br /><br />I didn't expect to be as impressed with the \\"Wild\\" section. Catching city pigeons in the park with my bare hands? Thanks, but no thanks. Yet sure enough, I was roped in after a few pages. The recent devastation of Hurricane Sandy really drove home the importance of this section. Though he dives deeper into shelter building and arrow carving than I probably need (Tim may beg to differ), this section is an excellent lesson on the value of life, the importance of life skills, and even a few things you'll use on a more regular basis, like quartering a chicken. To my surprise, I found myself enthralled by the details of cooking a squirrel over a fire and removing pigeon (aka squab) breasts from a whole bird (feathers and all) with bare hands. Yum.<br /><br />The \\"Pro\\" section was another surprise. As I've said, I've never aspired to cook like a pro at home. I just want simple, tasty food. And the quicker the better. But this section is essential for transferring the skills from the rest of the book into things you can use in the real world. It also covers some essential \\"classic\\" dishes, like roasted chicken, that weren't covered in the \\"Dom\\" section. Most important, this section teaches you the basics of kitchen creativity, and how to branch out and improvise on your own using the techniques from the earlier sections.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Chef is an incredibly ambitious book, but it is clear from the beginning that the goal is always to simplify and distill the essence of any task to its basic elements. It teaches the principles of cooking (and learning in general), not one-off recipes that you may or may not get around to making. I anticipate using it for years as a reference, whether it's to find restaurant recommendations in NYC or as a reminder of the essential few ingredients that define a specific ethnic cuisine. I've flagged dozens of pages to revisit in the future.<br /><br />I also love that Tim revisits life philosophies in this book, which I loved in The 4-Hour Work Week, but missed in The 4-Hour Body. The 4-Hour Chef touches on several invaluable life lessons, including why it is important to not waste food (especially if it comes from an animal), and how cooking is a path that brings you closer to love and life. Feeding ourselves is one of our most basic human needs, and is at the root of our life, our culture and ultimately our happiness.<br /><br />(Modified from my original review at Summer Tomato)need (Tim may beg to differ), this section is an excellent lesson on the value of life, the importance of life skills, and even a few things you'll use on a more regular basis, like quartering a chicken.

B001IYVUEW|5.0|This was an excellent, must see movie for all you Dark Knight fans. The storyline answers so many questions about Batman's origins and the ghosts that drive him toward redemption. Liam Neeson and Christian Bale know how to mesmerize an audience.<br />And what would Batman be without Michael Caine.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|When my step-son was about 3 years old I would not let him watch Jaws.  Now that he is 30, I thought it would be ok so I bought him the set for Halloween viewing.  He loved it.  He told me he watched it three times and just raved about the movie.  For those who have not seen it, or who want to relive the &#34;dum-dum-dum&#34; thriller, I would highly recommend this movie to them.  I had to have the movie sent out of state and it arrived promptly and in good condition.
B001BANK32|4.0|As always; an enjoyable read. King will always keep you turning the pages without stop. Looking forward to my next King book. Fortunately there is still enough to go around.

B009GEAPYW|5.0|As a fan of the original graphic novel, I was amazed at this feature length animated adaptation! Peter Weller is definitive as the older Bruce Wayne/Batman & the fact that they've split the novel in half (part 2 to follow next year) allows an almost frame for frame matchup of the original story with this new version! I agree with the decision NOT to reproduce the 'noir' style voiceovers (it was distracting & mostly unnecessary in the first BLADERUNNER & this was proved when it was reissued) & the visual style is very faithful as well. As with Frank Miller's BATMAN YEAR ONE, Bruce Timm & the DC team have created another fantastic Batman feature film!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone and I DO!!! If you have any fears about the hereafter or even the present, READ THIS BOOK.. That's all I can say. Read it all the way through and I'm sure it will change your life too, since that's exactly what it was meant to do.

That's pretty impressive that a star would go to that much trouble learning the song in Hungarian ( even if he looked at his palm a couple of times). I think after Live Aid and Montreal this is right up there.

The original is wonderfully restored.  The remixes are brilliant.  The DTS 5.1 audio is breathtaking.  It will never get any better than this presentation, but only because it can't.  There is no more room for improvement.<br /><br />You are just 3 clicks away.  What are you waiting for?
B006YTTVHO|3.0|As a former wall flower, I was able to read this not so much to apply now but to look back and raise why I have had problems in the past with talking to new people.

I feel that all the songs on Purple Rain were great; and that usually is rare with any musician. If anyone loves listening to those 80's hits like I do; checkout the Purple Rain SDTRK from Prince. I know you will not be disappointed :).<br /><br />THX,<br />-Kris L. CocKayne-

B002N4DZ58|1.0|This recording exists for one reason and one reason only: as a vanity project for Placido Domingo.<br /><br />That vanity means a whole lot of splicing and dicing of Domingo's contribution to the recording. This is, after all, a role that is simply TOO DIFFICULT FOR HIM to essay live on stage in an opera house. And that's why this is a vanity project - it allows Domingo to fake that he could actually sing this role. He can't. He has never sung the role on stage, because he would have never made it through the entire role in an evening, and it shows.<br /><br />How do we know that? Well, for one thing, anyone who has had the chance to hear Mr Domingo in any of the hundreds of roles he has sung onstage (and having sung them anywhere from competently to very well) will have a reaction similar to mine: ie: I've never heard him sound like that in the theater. By that, I mean that the engineers have spliced together snippets from this take or that take into what they think sounds like a cohesive whole for Mr Domingo. Well, it isn't. It sounds faked, the same way you would know a video tape was a fake if it looped a 100-yard-dash video for an hour without break. You would look at that and say, \\"sorry, but no human being can run that fast for that long a period of time.\\"<br /><br />And that's the thing about Domingo's fake Tristan - it is obviously faked for this recording. And you can say that based not only on the way Domingo actually sings in a theater, but by the way any tenor who has ever sung Tristan in the theater approaches the vocal challenges of this role. In fact, that's the biggest giveaway that this recording is a fake ie: the fact that Domingo does not have the kind of understanding of the role that comes from essaying it on stage to know where the singing should rise and fall, where the energy should be turned on or lessened, and where one needs to find a way of singing that keeps the voice varied and interesting. It's telling that in Domingo's case on this recording, the application of extra energy serves to make the voice SMALLER, when it should be expanding and soaring (check out the \\"O diesse Sonne\\" section in Act 3), a sure sign that a singer is pushing, rather than singing, the same way that a young pitcher is \\"throwing,\\" rather than pitching.<br /><br />I guess it comes down to how much fakery you are willing to abide in a musical performance. Would you, for instance, find a recording of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata satisfying if you were told that the pianist playing it didn't have the chops to actually sit down and play the thing, but that they COULD play the right hand and left hand separately with no problems, and so the engineers went ahead and recorded the hands separately and spliced them together into a recording that appeared to be \\"normal\\" otherwise? No, I think you'd think, \\"hell, even I could do that.\\"<br /><br />Once we're past Domingo's fakery, the obvious question is: would you buy this recording with this cast, this orchestra and this conductor if the Tristan were someone other than Domingo? And, the answer there is most likely, \\"are you crazy?\\"<br /><br />So there you have it. Perhaps we can look forward to Andrea Bocelli's Tristan in due course as well.ecording, the application of extra energy serves to make the voice SMALLER, when it should be expanding and soaring (check out the \\"O diesse Sonne\\" section in Act 3), a sure sign that a singer is pushing, rather than singing, the same way that a young pitcher is \\"throwing,\\" rather than pitching.<br /><br />I guess it comes down to how much fakery you are willing to abide in a musical performance.

B007THA4FI|2.0|Loved Rowling's Harry Potter Series.  Not sure I can continue on with this one.  Trying to.. not sure what the plot is - all over the place.  The Middle School age sexual bits are too frequent.  Assume all the intertwined various stories will all make some sense in the end... hoping.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Had bought a cheapie from China that never did work. Got this one and it worked properly from day one.
0307591549|4.0|I will begin this review by stating that I am 100% in agreement with Mr. Achor's central thesis - specifically, one needs to be happy in order to fully succeed (not the other way around).  This concept is not really original (see 'Power of Positive Thinking' and about 10000+ other books) but Mr. Achor does a good job of discussing the various studies and stories that support the thesis.  The book is well-written and reads very quickly (I read it on two airplane rides).<br /><br />My major critique is that I keep feeling I have read a lot of these stories before - Mr. Achor rehashes a lot of stuff you will find in other books (note: if I read another book that references the study done on the brains of London cabbies, I may scream).  I realize no book is ever truly original but I kept thinking \\"I've read this elsewhere\\" numerous times in this book.  I will also add I didn't like the constant personal asides about his time at Harvard.  I realize people who went to Harvard always seem to want to remind you they went to Harvard, but I found it really took away from the flow of the big.  But, overall, I enjoyed the book - and fully agree with most of the principles in it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Although &#34;Catching Fire&#34; advances the theme of &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; I feel the pace is much slower. Even though the characters develop the plot is somewhat predictable. In retrospect I would purchase and read the book again.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Even more fun that on Showtime/HBO. Blu-ray really shines through and the CGI/storyline make it all worthwhile. Glad I bought it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Ok I gave it 5star because this a really good ending for the hunger game books. I think everyone will love it such as I did. I really really liked it. It is one of my favort books (besides the other to) and I love. I swear Suzanne Collins is a genius.
0547884591|5.0|A revolutionary piece that will get you rethinking your approach to life and how you live it. From building fires to cooking to speaking other languages, Tim has extracted the essense of goal-focused learning and action into a thick nectar of insight and direction. This book is THE firmware update for the human mind.

B00633W614|3.0|I have read several of Jeffrey Archers books and always like them.  This one started great and held my interest - loved the characters.  But I thought it fell apart toward the end & the ending was terrible.  In fact, it didn't actually end - just left the readers hanging.  Maybe there is a sequel but I haven't found it yet.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Lots of action with a good story.  Both Denzel and Ryan make a great combination.  Developed Ryan's character too fast from a first time in action character to a hard ass.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|oh god the new album sounds hard and great,,,well,,, kiss always sounds like this,,, freak, back to the stone age, shout mercy, out of this world, hell or hallelujah and take me down below, i think that are the best.

0316232955|2.0|I read Chris's first book and it was great so I ordered this without hesitation.  I read it in a few hours and it was just not a good book.  It was predictable and seemed like it was written by a twelve year old.  The idea behind it was great but the execution was not.
1449410243|1.0|I ordered this because I liked the poster by the same name and was hoping for more cute cat humor inside. I had also read some of the humor online previously and liked it.<br />This book, however, is a huge disappointment.<br />The majority of the book are illustrations of cats farting, killing birds, and talking about farting and killing birds. The middle section of the book is a segment of The Bobs- 2 cats who work in the office, harass humans, and...you guessed it...fart and kill birds.<br />The same material re-sketched over and over.<br />With the exception of the How To Pet a Cat and How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You which is roughly 11 pages, only because the drawings are huge, it is a giant waste and a flop at humor. Also notable is If We Treated Cats How They Treat US. 10 more pages.<br />Take for instance...cat love hairpieces because once stolen...instant mustache. Not funny.<br />Pass on this book- it isn't worth the few funny moments...unless you like the kind of humor I just described. In which case, you are most likely very irrationally angry that I dared NOT love this book full of your favorite kind of humor- and you are taking it as a personal insult. In that case, go right ahead and buy it after your tantrum ends...
B00498TQV8|5.0|Simply one of the best directed and acted movies you may ever see. This film is so well done you may think it's a documentary and not a Hollywood flick.

I tried to play an amazon instant movie and then comcast movie on demand from my iPad and only managed to get audio to play.  No video.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|The sound of the Tibetan singing bowl is the perfect complement to my meditation practice. I also find the pink noise through headphones at work blocks out distractions from neighboring cubicles and increases my productivity.<br />The sounds are all well recorded, and the interface is intuitive and easy to use.<br />I've tried other sound apps, and this is my favorite by far.

B0007VCZ50|4.0|I had taped this off of Bravo or another channel back in the day, but have not watched it for years, especially since I haven't owned a VHS player since 1998 or thereabouts. It's as good or better than I remember, especially in our modern world of 5.1 sound. Definitely an interesting look into the making of an album and the controversial (at the time) change in direction for Sting. The person who decided that the credits should roll OVER Sting while he does a solo performance of Message In A Bottle during the encore should be locked in a room with one donut and Rosie O'Donnell. Seriously?? There's not enough space on this flipping DVD to roll the credits on a black screen?? You gotta do it over arguably the most iconic song in modern pop history? Good looking out, producers...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. It makes it easy to jot down those moments of genius no matter what device I'm using --whether its my iphone,  kindle, or PC.
B009VLXMJA|4.0|Taylor Swift offers some good break up songs and insight into life as a star. Her music is still fun to sing to =)
B0041KVZ1S|1.0|While the audio quality of the music on this album is outstanding, the pressing of these albums leaves a lot to be desired.  I got two copies of the record, and both had popping and crackling between songs, and several songs had distortion in them that was not caused by the studio tape.  Capitol Records needs to examine the pressing process to see what is the cause of these defects and correct the problem(s).
1574216988|4.0|We have a few zentangle books now and this is our favourite one.  It is a bit bigger and has more substance than many of the others and it is easy to find a new idea when quickly flicking through it.

0143119680|5.0|When I read this first novel,  I liked it so well that I bought both it and the 2nd novel.  It is a well-developed paranormal with witches, vampires and rather suprising demons (no wherewolver, yet).  It is also a mystery and a love story which begins in the Bodelian Library at Oxford University.  What could be more auspicious for any reader?  An intricate and well developed story line (with occasional holes to make nit-pickers happy).  Can't wait for numero tres to be announced.  However,  don't forget to bring your willful suspension of disbelief to this paranormal novel.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|He is just so sarcastic-and I love that about him.  The interaction between characters keeps you guessing as what will happen.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|I won't review the actual film, if you're looking and haven't seen it, just buy it please, it's near unmatched. The disc is all good, comes in a case as it should, yada yada. Great stuff.
B0058W74UY|2.0|Doesn't play a lot of my video. Very disappointing. Not as good as flashplayer. I don't know why Amazon got rid of flashplayer. This is inferior
B005NQ5LQ4|4.0|This isn't a DOnnie Yen \\"Ip Man\\" movie, so don't expect it to blow your mind like Ip Man and Ip Man 2 did. This take on Ip's life is a bit more accurate with dates to point out actual events taking palce but the entire feel of the movie is kind of cheesy. I get the impression this film is supposed to be cheesy and face-palm worthy in some scenes but it's also really funny because of that. It's a movie your kids can watch and sleep well the same night. Has many of the same actors from the original Ip Man films but elaborates on Wing Chun techniques and Principles :)<br /><br />Good movie added to my collection!
B00632HWOG|1.0|this app makes me want to cancel my Yahoo mail account. I am on my third install because it keeps crashing or not retrieving new mail.
B004I1AGTC|4.0|of the 2, I definitely liked the first one better but this is still a really great movie.<br /><br />It makes a lot more sense if you've watched the first - it helps so so much in understanding reprising characters roles and relationships together.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is the case for all DVD's, but I ordered this one from Indigo and the English subtitles made a mistake in the end fight when Ip Man tells Sammo Hung to punch Twister in his Biceps. Instead of saying biceps, it says 'ribcage' which was disappointing when I had my friends over to watch it and they never seen it before. I had to stop the movie and tell them about the mistake, then continue watching. Other than that - the movie is fantastic - flows really nicely (it has the same run-time as Ip Man 1 but feels shorter when you watch them back-to-back). It's funny, enjoyable and has a lot of whoop-ass from our very much loved Donnie Yen - definitely one to add to the collection
B0049VZ222|4.0|I wasn't sure I'd like this series, because it is really gory.  There is enough drama, and the actors are really good to get me past the extreme violence, and now I'm hooked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun. Every one in my family has it. When my family play the game it is quiet. You should really get it. It is good for when your on a plan.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of the older versions of this story, but this one is great - worth watching several times in order to catch all of the nuances.
B00684J49U|5.0|I was totally happy with my purchase of Gray's Anatomy season 8. It arrived as expected. It's has to be my favorite series.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I had a Kindle Fire and Facebook worked great. I now have a Kindle Fire HD and the Facebook app is barely worth having. All the posts aren't there, I can' like or share anything. Overall this app is terrible - I am now going to my smart phone for Facebook.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|This app has lots of good features which will appeal to those who like making things look good. It is easy to use.
B005QUQP76|5.0|I tried the Logitech gaming mouse first and it was just too big for my hand. My hands are on the small to average size, and this mouse feels much better. It has just the right amount of extra buttons for me; I don't need 20 extra buttons on my mouse. The Corsair strikes the right balance.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Gave this 5 stars ,its fabulous viewing ( for obvious reasons) bit slow to start but eye candy more than makes up for it,bring on the next one. Great music too
B008LVCKH6|2.0|A waste of time, not a plausible story line. It tried, but failed miserably to be a historical fiction book.  Don't waste your time or money.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|These headphones were perfect for what I purchased them for, at home. Incredible sound quality across the spectrum and extremely comfortable. I also found it really cool to watch the How It's Made video for these headphones.<br /><br />The only drawback is that they allow a lot of sound to escape into the room you are in. Not a problem if you are using headphones to keep sound from escaping into another room (i.e. from a home theatre vs. these headphones), or if you are using headphones just for the superior quality. However, I now work in a shared space, and the sound escaping these headphones could be enough to annoy those who are only a few feet away.<br /><br />I rated these 5 stars, because they are truly perfect for what they are. Just be sure that you don't have someone (especially if they don't have headphones on) sitting beside you while you are listening.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I couldn't believe this book I was unsure of who did it up till the end. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Because of this book I have read all of Gillian Flynns books.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|Good movie, very cheap fast shipping.<br />My kid love it. I'll recommend this movie to everybody. It's funny.<br />The only part I don't like is the mean guy :P
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Love the whole series.  Would certainly recommend this book and the rest of the series.  It was well written, interesting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this Flow Free! My grandchildren like to play it, too.  But be careful, Flow Free is addictive!!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|... the crime scenes, the lab and the slab, in the court room - in short: She is back to the roots! Back to the basics we liked so much about the true Chief Medical Examiner.<br /><br />A fan of the Kay Scarpetta series since the first book, I was very disappointed when Patricia Cornwell changed in the third-person-modus and didn't let her main character tell us her story any more.<br />There it went down the tubes I suppose. Long-time readers do not easily forgive a change so essential in the writing, cutting off almost every possibility of identify themselfes with a strong person like Kay.<br />O.K. - that has changed, and very much into the better!<br /><br />The storyline is rather fast to summarise.<br />Where the Red Willow and Wapiti Rivers merge in the Grande Prairie Region of Alberta, Canada, 70 millions of years ago a catastrophe of immense extend took place. A herd of migrating pachyrhinosauri, hundreds of them, perished all on a sudden and all together crossing the river while a flood overpowered them. This is how the Wapiti Bone Bed was born. And there the young paleontologist Emma Shubert vanished into thin air about nine weeks ago. All that remains of her is a video clipping of a sunny day on the water with the disturbing shot of a truncated human ear attached sent to Kay Scarpetta's email account - from a fake email adress.<br />Later that day Kay should go court to testify about an other woman, Mildred Lott who disappeared half a year ago without leaving any traces but a video of her last appearence in her home garden. Also this time an email plays a significant role, because it is the only argument for the Prosecuter to accuse her husband Channing Lott, multi-billionaire, of commissioning her murder to a third party, him being safely out of reach in Tokyo.<br />But the fate has different plans for our fearless heroine.<br />In the Boston Harbour something like a critically endangered species of giant turtle, a so called Leatherback, the last surviving dinosaur on earth is in serious trouble because it's hold by lines, tackles and - a dead body, presumably that of a woman. So Kay has to recover the body herself, putting on the diving gear like she has in the good ole days. But the recovery turns out to be quite a difficult task because the killer fixed the corpse in a rather devilish way. And Kay is also filmed by a big, fat chopper hovering all the time above her head. And his will have serious repercussions on the trial of Channing Lott.<br />Which will be a debacle of the worst kind thanks to Judge Conrey and the Defense Lawyer Jill Donoghue, a big, white shark if I ever have seen one...<br />And will put our heroine into another whining and rather misogynic attack.<br /><br />The body in the river is identified very soon as a woman called Peggy Lynn Stanton missed by nobody until the current date. Yet she has been out of sight since Labor Day, but twittered cheerfully with a person very near to Kay until two weeks ago...<br />Then everything merges to shambles, Kay is desperate, privy of persons she can rely on and who are urgently needed for the investigation of now THREE vanished or murdered women.<br />Her husband Benton is seriously harrassed by a female colleague who wants to see Scarpetta fail in her work, her marriage - and is already ready to take her place!<br />Our poor Kay enters in what I would call a mild case of pre-menopause depression, considering her chances with younger men, feeling herself inadequate and asks herself about her sex-appeal! She also developes a rather bad case of misogyny.<br />On the other side, Benton is jealous even of her co-worker Luke Zenner, last relative of Kay's old, now late Austrian Dr-friend Anna Zenner, accusing her of maybe giving in to attempts to seduce her!<br />Marino and Lucy have segrets of their own. Marino twitters with devastating consequences, Lucy hunts down pig farmers who illegally release their detritus into the river on her chopper and wears aheavy golden ring which apparently came out of nowhere.<br />Then a forth person - seemingly not attached to the death or vanished women - is found dead, and with the post-mortem of his corpse, examining him with every possible means the whole confusion begins to unravel...until it's finally showtime!<br /><br />The book is a very good read for the lovers of the old kind of Kay Scarpetta thrillers, because it really brings our long, sadly missed heroine out again.<br />OK, there is still some fine-tuning to be done - for that reason only 4 stars.<br />For example to eliminate the whining out of Scarpetta's thoughts. Because it sounds a bit too much like self-pity. To put some things right in her marriage, now that the first paces in the right direction have been done.<br />To get Marino out of his loneliness and mental seclusion - but also there seems to be a very nice start, You will learn!<br />Lucy is on the right way yet, we will realize with great surprise.<br />And Benton has to trust his wife a great bit more than he did in this book.<br />But - we all are hopefully confident in the writing skills of Ms Cornwell that the follow-up's will be as a minimum as good as this thriller - hopefully also better, to finally climb to the 5-stars-evaluation where she belongs!<br /><br />Kay, welcome home! We missed You!!!heavy golden ring which apparently came out of nowhere.<br />Then a forth person - seemingly not attached to the death or vanished women - is found dead, and with the post-mortem of his corpse, examining him with every possible means the whole confusion begins to unravel...until it's finally showtime!<br /><br />The book is a very good read for the lovers of the old kind of Kay Scarpetta thrillers, because it really brings our long, sadly missed heroine out again.<br />OK, there is still some fine-tuning to be done - for that reason only 4 stars.<br />For example to eliminate the whining out of Scarpetta's thoughts.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I downloaded this informational book and followed its instructions, and it all came together. I was able to get all the way through with minimal efforts, there was no re-editing at all except for the art work size. This area could use a bit more explanation relating to achieving a proper pixel size.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you are a John Corey fan, you will love The Panther. You cannot help but laugh out loud at Corey's wit.<br /><br />The story takes a while to develop and the plot is not as complex as other Corey novels. The character of the Panther is not as well developed as the Lion, and this is where this story suffers in comparison to Lion's Game, which is my favorite. Still a great read. Four and a half stars.
B00846REIS|4.0|I have read so many books over the summer and to date that I wouldn't know where to begin. Of them all, I loved Note to Self by Valentine deFrancis, Guilty Wife, and now Bared to You. I don't like giving away storylines but I just believe that 50 Shades had nothing on Bared to You. I loved it. I read all three 50 Shades and I liked them, not loved them. Read my other recommendations if you're divorced and starting over.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|If you need a fun game to pass the time for a trip then Dungeon Hunter III is the game to choose!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I scrolled through many reviews and saw that many people didn't care for this book. I was hooked on the sample chapters and bought the book. I found it real, engaging, yet a tad drawn out in the beginning when they first move, but I still enjoyed it. I've also read other great books that I\\"ve been recommending. Note to Self by Valentine deFrancis, if you're divorced and dating. Total must read--fun, smart, and a great ending. Also read Bared to You by Sylvia Day.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|That series is awesome, i recommended so far!!! Spectacular action, special FX, is a classic!!! . . . . .

B007SGM084|5.0|I liked, but I think the third one the weakest. Although, when she finishes the book with his vision was the best thing that she could do!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a great story!  I'm about 3/4 of the way through and can't wait to see how it finishes up!  As usual Sai King's writing is wonderful.  The story grabbed me by the throat in the first chapter and hasn't let loose yet.  I keep looking for chances to sneak away and get one more chapter in and should be finished in a few days.
0316228532|5.0|I finished this book with a glass of wine and a box of tissues. My tears fell for the characters in the book, and their injustices, their pain, and the knowledge that real-life people are going through the same, and worse.<br /><br />This isn't the first time J.K. Rowling has made me cry. Her themes of respect, friendship, and death are as apparent in The Casual Vacancy as they were in Harry Potter. The Casual Vacancy opens with the death of Barry Fairbrother, a member of the town council in Pagford. Just like with Harry's mother, Lily Evans, we learn about Barry mostly through the way people speak of him. He is kind, perhaps to a fault. He is generous. He is smart, works hard, and cares for people less fortunate than him. People like Krystal Weedon, a high school student from the poor side of town who Barry takes under his wing.<br /><br />The tale that follows Barry's death is full of gossip in a small town, and how it affects the city council election for Barry's now open spot. There's gossip, bullying, drinking, drugs, affairs, and sex. But also HOW that gossip, bullying, drinking, drugs, affairs, and sex affect the people involved. Through Rowling's beautifully crafted characters, you learn about the bully and bullied. You see both sides, and Rowling poses no judgement. She leaves that to you.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book, and the Harry Potter series, is how Rowling illustrates respect. Harry respects living creatures, no matter how small or insignificant. He sees what's in their hearts and not the purity of their blood. In The Casual Vacancy, almost everyone does bad things. But who is a bad person? Is it a drug addict prostitute mother? Is it a man who cheats on his wife? Is it a teenager with every privilege who harasses people for sport? Rowling finds humanity in all of them, and in doing so, she reminds her readers to do the same.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Wonderful App Ii Love It This Is Definitely Worth My Time Of Downloading It 'Yuu Should Get It Too . Its Very Entertaining!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It's basically an S&M version of twilight. It's okay as a guilty pleasure read but definitely no build up of characters or plot.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Each character brings his/her own texture to the wonderful tapestry of a Flynn novel.  LOVE Vince Flynn novels ... and Mitch Rapp.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|The book is an easy read and is quite funny.  Although it has some interesting sci fi ideas and human relationships, it does not explore these in any great detail.  Just good fiun.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Bought this for our older cars without built-in bluetooth. Got tired of the in-ear headsets. This is so much better.<br /><br />Got it paired easily following the directions. Sound quality on both ends is great.<br /><br />Battery life is great. Charges via micro usb (which you probably already have for your cell phone).<br /><br />I initially had it on my visor...but it flashes the entire time it's connected...so whenever my visor was down, I was looking right at a flashing light. My solution was to put the clip up on the hand hold above the door. The clip fit perfectly on it, and then when I put the unit on it...I couldn't even see it! Great way to get it out of your line of sight.<br /><br />Only other issue is that the bluetooth connection is really strong...and depending on how far away you park your car from the house...it CAN stay connected even when you leave your car. The solution is really to just turn off bluetooth on your phone, or to turn the unit off. I don't know if there is a way to limit the distance it connects...but 10 feet would have been better than the typical 30 feet. If you park far away from your house though, this won't be an issue.<br /><br />And really, for the price, I can live with that one issue.
B0098460O4|4.0|When I first heard them on Britain's Got Talent I was entirely enchanted. I still am so although I gave them an okay critique, the reason is my own preference. Why do they sing everything in Italian? It is Britains got talent and when I heard the intro to The First Time I Saw YOur Face, I was so excited. Then, in Italian. I felt the same about Paul Potts. Everything in Italian and some of the songs I really love in English. The words mean so much to me and I couldn't understand them. Why do they do that? Thank goodness Susan Boyle sings mostly in English. I am not sure I would have purchased the CD had I known it was in Italian. Some were most appropriate and others needed to be recorded in their native tongue. They are beautiful together and I know Jonathan relies on the calm and support of Charlotte. However, I tend to think he wil outgrow her in terms of his incredible voice. He will have to learn that there will be some aspects of his amazing talent that will require him to sing alone. I hope it doesn't happen for a long time. I truly believe it will eventually. She has her own genre and yes, I see they complement one another at this point. He is 17 - astounding. He has to learn that just singing isn't enough. He has to look to his own confidence when he performs. I know it will be a wrench for him and perhaps he will never perform without her. However, if the entertainment idustry is as I believe it to be, the challenge will be there. I don't always agree with Simon and when he said Charlotte might hold him back, I mused on that. Maybe not now - but later. I know she can have her own career and she sounded lovely on the CD. It will probably be his decision, to stay or to go. One day at a time. I wish them well. Absolutely inspirational and could be just as so, in English
145210655X|5.0|If you're a Star Wars nerd, and you have young kids you are trying to share that with...this is a wonderful book. So many great jokes in it that only a Star Wars fan would get. Luke wants the Jar Jar toy and Vader is trying to convince him not to. Greedo shooting first fiasco. Love it. Absolutely worth it, and 100% appropriate for my 4 year old son.

B00A2H9NCC|4.0|\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" (2012 release; 122 min.) brings the story of Pat (played by Bradley Cooper), whom we see at the start of the movie leaving a state mental institution after an 8 month stay, having been diagnosed as bipolar and having beat up his wife's lover violently when he accidentally intrudes on them. He has lost everything: his wife, his house, basically his life. He moves in with his parents (played by Robert de Niro and Jacki Weaver), determined to win back the graces of his wife, whatever it takes. Then by chance, he meets Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence), the younger sister of a family friend. Tiffany has plently of her own troubles. Since there is a restraining order against him, Pat cannot approach his wife directly, so he asks Jennifer to deliver a letter to his wife. Tiffany agrees but only if he does something in return, namely to be her dancing partner in a dancing competition she desperately wants to enter. Pat agrees. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience. Will Pat reunite with his wife? Or will he fall for Tiffany? You'll just have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />Several comments: this almost feels like two movies into one, as the first hour of the movie centers around the difficult readjustment Pat needs to make in the real world after his release and still dealing with his bipolar condition. It is difficult to like the Pat character because it is difficult to like the outbursts and ups-and-downs of someone being bipolar. In the second hour of the movie, the centers shifts towards the interplay between the Pat and Tiffany characters and the movie then becomes more of a rom-com. Yet it all works just great. One of the biggest surprises for me in this movie is the performance of Jennifer Lawrence (yes, she of \\"The Hunger Games\\"), who brings an astonishing turn with an emotional depth that blows away anything she has done before, that girl can act! But the other performances are top notch too, certainly Bradley Cooper but check out De Niro in his best performance is YEARS. And oh yea, Philadelphia sports play a huge role in this movie, Eagles fans will love the many scenes set in Philadelphia and surrounding the Eagles.<br /><br />David Russell, who adopted the novel for the screen and directed this, certainly knows a thing or two about bringing dysfunctional families to the big screen (Spanking The Monkey; The Fighter, just to name those) and here he does it again, perhaps better than ever. This movie is already garning serious Oscar buzz, and it's easy to see why. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!dley Cooper but check out De Niro in his best performance is YEARS.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie almost describes me to a T. I can relate with everything she goes through. Like the others have said, this is a great movie for mothers and daughters. I can feel this movie deep in my soul as if I were Merida.<br />See we DO NOT need a man to survive, but if you want one then go for it. I am happy by myself. Like Merida...<br />I saw nothing wrong with this movie, scary, nudity (It was their butts. Get over it. Nobody complains when the women show their breasts.) or otherwise. If you think there is you have something wrong with you.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />I'm a really big Rihanna fan and own every single one of her CD's so was really looking forward to Unapologetic, I bought it first thing on the 19th and let me say, this album does not dissapoint!!!<br /><br />It's more of a grown up style for Rihanna and has more of a mature sound. There are people complaining because this CD apparently has 'too many ballads' but they're my favourite part of the CD and I'm glad I've got so many to choose from! :D<br /><br />Every song - Get it over with excluded - is a winner in my eyes and I have no complaints. Although it's packed with ballads, there are also the usual Rihanna-style club bangers and there is a song for every mood.<br /><br />Phresh off the runway - a song I didn't really like at first as I found it hard to get into but after a few listens I couldn't get 'fresh off the runway' out of my head. It's annoying addictive and I love the big hip-hop beats and a good'un to blast out at full volume!:D 9/10<br /><br />Diamonds - a lovely, relaxing ballad and a really meaningful song. Not my favourite Rihanna song but I still like it and it paves the way for the rest of the CD. 7/10<br /><br />Numb ft Eminem - this song has got mixed reviews from fans/critics especially with it being compared to the duo's previous massive collab. but personally this song beats Love The Way You Lie. I like the hazy tones and knew all the words on first listen (probably something to do with Rihanna repeatedly telling us 'I'm Going Numb' a million times!). I think Eminem's verse is solid and is gonna be on repeat for a long time. 9/10<br /><br />Pour it up - a gritty club-banger from Rihanna. Was addicted to it on first listen and is one of my favourites off the album. 9/10<br /><br />Loveeeeeee song ft Future - even though the feauture is auto-tuned to the max, this is also one of my favourites from the album. I love the slow R'n'B feel and it sounds like something off of Loud. 10/10<br /><br />Jump - it's chorus is a cover of 90's classic 'pony' and Rihanna does the cover justice. I love the big dub-step beats and it's my favourite fast track off the CD and I hope it's gonna be Ri's next single. 10/10<br /><br />Right now ft. David Guetta - I like Right Now but it's one of my least fave tracks off the CD and I prefer her and David Guetta's previous collaboration, 'Who's That Chick'. But I still like to blast it out and have a dance! :D 6/10<br /><br />What Now - The 8th song on the CD and it takes us into the slower half of the album. An powerful ballad with amazing vocals from Rihanna and I love the lyrics. I'm obsessed with the song and this is another one that's gonna be stuck on repeat. 10/10<br /><br />Stay ft Mikky Ekko - A gorgeous, stripped back ballad with astounding vocals from Rihanna and Mikky Ekko. I think the two's voices really compliment eachother and it's the best song on the CD in my opinion. 10/10<br /><br />Nobodies Buisness ft Chris Brown - ever since the tracklist was released a few weeks back this song has been grabbing the headlines - but for all the wrong reasons. I'm going to base the review of this song solely on the song itself and I love it! I love the throwback to the 90s beat, I think their voices are gorgeous together and it's just a lovely song. 10/10<br /><br />Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary - the ambitious seven minute song is not my favourite song on the CD but I think it's a very strong ballad but I just wish Love Without Tragedy was longer. 7/10<br /><br />Get it over with - the only song on this CD I don't like. The song was hard to get into and I though the swearing was unnecsessary. 3/10<br /><br />No love allowed - going back to her original bajan roots with No Love allowed this is a winner in my eyes. I love the reggae beats and also think this should be released as a single. 9/10<br /><br />Lost in Paradise - the final song on the track and Rihanna sings her heart out on this Labyrinth produced tune and another favourite of mine. 10/10<br /><br />I really think Rihanna has raised the bar on this one and this, along with Rated R, is my favourite CD of hers.
1932100660|5.0|If you ever have suffered from chronic illness, or been close to someone who has, then you might find The China Study very interesting. This is not for the faint hearted or \\"ignorance is bliss\\" crowd, this book challenges conventional thinking based on fact and poses a lot of tough questions about the fabric of modern society we accept as the way of life. However, if you've ever questioned the effectiveness of modern medicine, been frustrated with the lack of a holistic approach from doctors, or wondered about the effects of \\"plastic\\" foods we so conveniently consume then you can't pass up this read.<br /><br />Written by father and son Colin and Thomas Campbell, this book takes a look at some of the most devastating chronic illnesses which affect the western world such as heart disease, diabetes, cancers, obesity and autoimmune diseases. Specifically, it takes a close look at the relationship between nutrition and disease by drawing conclusions from some of the most well known and largest population studies (including the \\"China Study\\" which looks at the differences between diet and disease between eastern and western populations). The approach is from a medical research perspective, it does get deep but all the concepts are explained step by step such that I was able to follow along fine not having a medical background. The book was heavy, but I found the conclusions of the studies so fascinating and unlike anything I've heard in the mainstream it was easy to read on.<br /><br />The author also provides some amazing insights into how the food industry operates at the government level in relation to nutritional recommendations, some of the stories here are truly eye opening.<br /><br />I'll admit I'm not typically one for reading non-fiction, in fact I find life pretty busy I reading through a book has been a rare occurrence over the last few years. After my wife was watching some documentaries on organic food, I heard reference to this book a number of times and thought I'd check it out. After reading the sample from Kindle I kept reading. It has literally changed the way I think about food.<br /><br />Concepts in this book have real value in making tangible differences to the impact of chronic disease in our world, but they challenge conventional medical thinking, they challenge the billion dollar food industry, so you'll never hear about this on the 6 o'clock news. I'm writing this because reading this book has been like being told a secret, and it's a secret I want to share. You might read this and be challenged to change like I have, or you might read this and throw away the ideas and go back to your life, either way you will have a new appreciation for the importance of nutrition and quiet possibly never think about chronic diseases in the same way again.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is quite a read.  It's more than a biography on Steve Jobs.  It's a tour of the history of modern computing.  If you have any interest in technology, this book is for you.  It details the rise/fall/rise of an amazing man and also the rise/fall/rise of how we view and appreciate technology devices.  Jobs's insane commitment to detail and fusing art with technology inspired modern works of art.  It changed what we expect in our personal tech devices and really how we view these devices.  Their products changed how we communicate and relate to each other.  That's a pretty big deal and knowing the history of it all is very satisfying.<br /><br />Steve Jobs inspired us to be more committed and quality oriented in all that we do.  Apple's latest products are like a work of art and people just like being a part of something great.  I love how their philosophy encouraged the entire industry to put quality and innovation over price or just releasing a new product.  Apple has raised the bar on everyone and Steve Jobs spearheaded all of it.  With, as the book will explain, great minds like Jony Ive.<br /><br />The book goes into incredible detail about Jobs's entire life and at times may even be too detailed, but if you are into the subject matter it's really hard to put down.  He wasn't a saint.  He wasn't a man without flaws.  In fact his tale is part success story, part cautionary tale.  He was so committed to detail and quality that he became obsessed with the tiniest of details.  He often had trouble enjoying life at all because of his crusade to make perfect products.  He also was very hard on people around him and drove them to insane levels of commitment.  The book is incredibly honest about his strong points and his flaws.  Jobs commissioned the book to be written by the author, but Jobs had no control over the content.<br /><br />It's an inspiring book that is very well written.  Isaacson deserves high praise for his writing.  It pulls you into the technology crazes of the 80s/90s/2000s and takes you back to those years for a great ride through what on the surface may seem like a boring subject but turns out to be a gold mine of incredible stories and excitement.  I think a part of all of us likes to read about those discoveries of incredible fortunes.  Jobs and Gates became millionaires overnight... more than once.  It's amazing to read about.  And I think most of these guys didn't care that much about money.  They just wanted to make cool products that they could tinker with.  And they turned out to be on the cutting edge of consumer demand; over and over again.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this book, but rest assured if you have any interest in computers, Apple, Steve Jobs, or even bananas for that matter, go buy this book :P...  or download it on your Kindle or iBooks app.  Mr. Jobs would probably have appreciated that ;).

I have to say; this album has blown me away, I absolutely love this album and it made me fall in love with The Killers all over again. I am not a huge music buff but Brandon Flowers has an wonderfully amazing voice and I just can't get enough. This album reminds me when I first heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" so many years ago and was star stuck, I had to soak up and listen to every song they made/had. Maybe I am a little bias because I love The Killers and I am a huge fan of them; but if this album was the first I heard The Killers it would make me a huge fan!

And I'm not generally a big fan of Will Ferrell at all, so that's saying a lot! The cast is definitely not the greatest, and yet somehow the movie still makes you laugh, makes you smirk, makes you ponder the meaning of Christmas and all those deep things you're supposed to give some thought to during the holiday season. A great movie the whole family can enjoy - but parental previewing would be encouraged for those who are concerned about PC.

Read this story if you ever need encouragement =)
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers is the most awesome movie of a year boasting the finally oh the Dark Knight Trilogy, and Beginning of The Hunger Games Trilogy. Earths Mightiest Heroes fend off an interstellar attack by Loci, which after decades of not looking very good in the comic books are finally well rendered on film. In fact almost everything gets a near perfect screen rendering, including giving Captain America a Very Golden Age makeover by building his armor around double breasted SWAT armor,<br />The plot is great, and the action is just the right mix of spy thriller and Hulk Bash. The movie also has the best oneliners of the century and a feeling of we will win because we're the good guys that has been missing for decades.

B009SKPVO8|4.0|First let me say that my present camera is a Canon 60d with a battery grip and my walk-around lens is a Canon 18-135.  In other words, a very large camera mass.<br /><br />If I still had my Canon SX10IS super zoom or a point and shoot camera, I believe this strap would be a much better fit, or even for an SLR camera like mine without a grip.<br /><br />But for a SLR camera mass as large as I have, I think most will find the usual camera strap the better option.  What I have is just too bulky to work as well as intended.  But for something less, I think this is alternative to consider<br /><br />The product is  from Case Logic, a company with a good track record with camera cases, backpacks and slings.  It seems well made and the attaching device is solid and screws securely into the hardware mount on the base of the camera or battery grip.  I do not have any reservations about the swivel hardware that attaches the strap to the camera.<br /><br />The shoulder pad is large and comfortable and the strap itself is very adjustable.  Any size photographer should find an adjustment that works well.  Adjustments to strap length are easily made and should not change by themselves once the desired length is determined.<br /><br />I found that I had to have the camera riding about at waist level in order to keep the padded portion where I wanted on my shoulder and not up against my neck.  If you want the camera to hang on your right side, you put the strap over your head so that the padded portion in on your left shoulder and after putting your right arm through the loop the camera is on your right side.  The opposite if you want the camera to hang on your left side.<br /><br />Because the attachment hardware screws into the tripod mount, the camera immediately wants to hang upside down with the lens pointing forward, making it very awkward to bring it into position to take your shot.  However, after playing around for awhile I found i could get the camera to ride in a position more comfortable for me and better able to be brought quickly to my eye.<br /><br />If when you go out to shoot you carry your camera ready for action and not in a sling bag or backpack, this is an option to the regular camera strap to consider.  Although truth be told, if you have a SLR and a comfortable strap that attaches to the two top corners of the camera, on either side of the view finder, I can't say this is a better alternative.<br /><br />I don't recommend having both this quick sling and a camera strap attached to your camera.  It should be one or the other.n more comfortable for me and better able to be brought quickly to my eye.<br /><br />If when you go out to shoot you carry your camera ready for action and not in a sling bag or backpack, this is an option to the regular camera strap to consider.

B008GXHOFW|3.0|I was very happy to see this game price finally get reduced to 99 cents there was no way I Was going to spend seven dollars on a game. My boys enjoy playing it for the most part though it is honestly a bit glitchy to the point where the fire just freezes up and I have to do a hard reset. It does take up a decent amount of memory but I knew that going in and got rid of a couple of things that weren't be used and be prepared for the eternity that it takes to download.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|These are some of the noisiest vinyl albums I've every owned.  Once the music starts the rumble and hiss will get somewhat covered up but in the quiet passages (Because, I Will, Julia, etc.) it's quite noticable.  Last night when I put the needle down on the lead-in I actually thought I had missed the record it was so loud.  I certainly don't expect them to be as quiet as digital files but they are really over-the-top noisy.<br /><br />I found one minor scratch but it's not too bad.  One disc is somewhat warped (With the Beatles) and some of the edges are not smoothed down very well.  The packaging was also rather banged up including a smashed corner on the White Album cover.  The discs seem to not have been damaged though. There is a labling mistake on side 2 of Magical Mystery Tour.<br /><br />Having said all this, the book is magnificent!  I hope it becomes available outside the boxed set for everyone else to enjoy.  But it's not worth $319.<br /><br />I'm on the cusp about returning the set.  I'll finish playing them all and see if they're tolerable but it's a pretty disappointing pressing.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this album for my girlfriend and she loves it.  To me it's more of a chick album though
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Finally, a story like she used to write! I am a Histotech, so the terminology is something I can understand. Pathology is an interesting field. Not like you see on TV with CSI tho!!
B000002URV|4.0|I liked this album better than Le Roi est mort, Vive Le Roi.  This is perfect easy listening music for dinner

B0053O89WY|5.0|It worked well.Everything I expected, at a reasonable price. I recommend this product for other people wanting to buy this.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It is a great way to pass time. I havent find a way to get more jems without buying them. This is agame i would recomend
B008M4MB8K|2.0|Closed captioning not available...bummer! Luckily, I still have an older DVD which does have closed captioning. This purchase was a waste of money!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Everybody in the whole world must read this book! It will make you think twice before you complain about something!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can access my computer from anywhere through my kindle fire hd! No bugs yet, it works quickly, and allows me to even do things like ctrl-alt-del. Works as advertised and I'm one happy camper as a result.
B004N6369Y|3.0|Hotel Vendome is a quick read - perfect for an airplane trip or the beach.<br />Nothing sensational about this book - it follows the same formula that Danielle<br />Steel readers expect.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book 2 was much better than book 1 it had a story to it. The story made the whole book much more interesting.
B007EECSFA|3.0|This book could have been - in my estimation about 100 pages shorter! It dragged<br />during the middle of the book and at times I wanted to skip ahead to see if the storyline<br />ever really started to move along. Well written but just not a quick enough pace for me.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|got the movie on my kindle fire so my grand daughter had some thing to watch while in the car.  kept her occupied (she is 15 months old).  she loved it and it made a peaceful trip.  well worth it.
B007704HO6|5.0|Beautiful story, I loved the way it was written. I enjoyed all the small details about Bob's life! Cats are so interesting :) I love Bob! Good luck to Bob and James, hope to see you in London sometime.
B006H5120E|5.0|Saw this in regular Blu-ray and then watched again in 3D and loved it all over again. A must see.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|A bit wordy--difficult to stay focused between actions. Clever but grating hum or with a self absorbed hero. Fun though.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Saw this in regular Blu-ray and then watched again in 3D and loved it all over again. A must see.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Enjoyed the underlying love story intensely.<br />Also, the time travel thing was amazing. Very thoroughly planned.<br />And it's a good history fiction as well.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Great movie. Looking forward to seeing Cars 2. Glad this one was available on Netflix. Wonder if there will be
B004QPOVF0|5.0|The order was flawless and received very fast. For the DVD, AC/DC Live at river Plate it was amazing, a great buy. I have watched it numerous times already.
B008476HBM|5.0|Somehow never read Austen as a youngster but decided to read it on my new Kindle!  I'm so glad I did!  The story got off to a slow start, dull and dry!  As I plowed on through a lot of dinners and dances some of the characters became appealing, the plot thickened.  Suddenly I was hooked.  I've become an Austen enthusiast  I will be ordering more of her novels.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome I cant take my eyes off the screen and when I do its because I HAVE TO do something its awesome I love
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read the original vampire story,  one where the vampires are truly frightening; and not sparkling drama queens.  Bram Stoker was a genius!
B009AJDDQU|2.0|Stunning cinematography, terrible story. I was so looking forward to this movie but like most movies today, it was visually striking, but the story had no depth. So much of what happened in this movie didn't make sense from a story viewpoint and from a technical, intellectual viewpoint. A great Sci-Fi is not only visually mesmerizing, but also engaging in it's story.
B0042816YK|5.0|I am a big Julia Roberts fan.  Very few of her films get a less-than-excellent rating from me. Javier is a cutie.  After &#34;No Country....&#34; this was a real departure for him.  He is married to Penelope Cruz....must be his source for the romantic lead part of this film.  The film comes across different from the book, but close enough...films always do this when compared to the books they are taken from.  Good for viewing several times!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am not that good at this game but dang it I can't stop playing.  I recommend it highly! it is fun.  I find myself trying to run a few extra meters or collect more coins to get some power up in the &quot;store&quot;, I always find myself just one more run!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Belly wheat Great information. Everyone should know about your health. The best advice I have ever been given. I would recommend to everyone
B007HU7NBK|4.0|Back in1981, I was trying to be a guitar player. A friend came back from England with some records for me. The first time I heard Faster Than Light, I knew I had to play bass. Move ahead 32 years, I am ready to put music behind me, and read the story of the person who changed my life. The story was told very well, but for those who have worked in this  business, it seems like a familiar one. I am glad it has a good ending since there are many who haven't. I enjoyed reading about John's life and the story of Duran Duran. I still have those three records and I think I will keep playing my basses. Thank you, John, again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better than book one.  Book two and three contain more of a story and the characters come alive. Hard to put down.  I felt I was right inside my kindle living the &#34;good&#34; life.  Great book to escape from reality.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read Wool 1 since it was free and I got totally hooked!<br /><br />Hugh Howey creates some strong characters and an even stronger setting for his Wool stories. There's some good twists that keep the suspense going and keep you wanting to read more and more!<br /><br />It's a very good take on dystopian society and I can't wait to see what he delivers in the rest of the Wool series.
B009JCL58G|5.0|I didn't really care for the movie overall - it might just be that I'm too dumb to really appreciate it? - but I really like the music. Definitely recommend checking it out, and it's hard to beat eight bucks.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|I love Friends.  It is my favorite sitcom of all time and I couldn't wait to buy it on Blu-Ray but they decided to release it without the extended versions I will not be buying it. This is pretty pathetic; they should have extended the episodes even more than the DVD versions because it's more expensive.<br />High definition is awesome but I'm going to avoid buying this until they release a complete version.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Super way to tour the GC if you haven't had the opportunity to go there. The 3D is marvelous. The footage is complete.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|This was the first time I have read Banks, so I wasn't familiar with the grand vision. His writing is brilliant--witty, and full of ideas. This is especially evident after just coming off reading the puerile \\"The Rook\\", in comparison. Daniel O'Malley should sit at Banks' knee for 20 years before trying another novel.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed in the conclusion however as it wasn't clear to me that knowing <that which was discovered>, while being interesting, would have any bearing on whether the Gzilt would decide to proceed. As I got closer to the end of the book, with only a few pages left and the characters still racing around shooting at each other, I  thought uh oh, the resolution to all this is going to be treated in about five pages, as an afterthought. This seems to happen a lot unfortunately, with novels and TV shows too, as if the writer lost interest by the end. By contrast earlier in the novel we get many examples of authorial energy such as extensive and elaborate descriptions that though well done are not particularly on point. Pity some of that energy could not have been used for a more robust ending.<br /><br />I thought the implication was that sufficiently evolved civilizations recognized that devotion to a particular holy book was a stage in their development that they typically transcended, similar to say, believing that your planet is the center of the universe. This evolved realization, that one's world is not in fact unique, and that your particular people are not in fact \\"chosen\\", and that instead you are typical in this belief, allows such civilizations to move beyond this parochial devotion. Recognizing that your holy book turns out to be simply yet another variation on the transparently self-serving affirmation that \\"you are special, you are chosen\\" would render the concern about the true origin of the book moot, I'd have thought.<br /><br />Banks justifies the fact that the Gzilt maintained a devotion to their holy book longer than usual by making it be unusually accurate in its predictions. But that seems rather too obviously a plot device, designed to raise the stakes enough to justify all the racing around and shoot-em-ups. Yet this device undermines the novel's own explanation of the evolution of understanding that sublimation-ready species seem to typically go through. And the novel's own conclusion verifies that--the Ships decide that the knowledge didn't actually matter enough to tell the affected parties, after all.<br /><br />I was hoping that the revelation would have more to do with the sublimation itself, like that it was a big hoax for example, or somehow otherwise not what the Gzilt expected. (Isn't it even a bit suspicious that there is no first-hand information about it? It's a lot to take on trust.) Then there would have been something actually at stake--a real reason to pause. As it is it seemed much ado about not much, ultimately.<br /><br />Still, for sheer breadth of vision and literary skill, this novel is well worth it and motivates me to read some of Banks' other work.
0439813786|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter and she loved it. I might start reading it after she finishes it .
B007XNAOS0|5.0|I've been a fan since the Red Album, seen them live, and this one is just great. Love both sides, green has more songs I'm really into but overall I love this album. I'm a music student getting my bachelor's degree in composition and idk what people are saying about the songwriting because these guys are doing it right. Listen with your ears not your ego. Great Album.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The premise of this sounded too dark, but the love and humanity that suffused every moment of pain left me grateful for having met these beautiful characters.
0596007124|5.0|I was blown away by the examples provided. Very elegant explanations. I referred various other books but lost interest halfway through since they were too boring unlike this one. Even though examples are in java, I highly recommend this book to C# programmers. You could easily implement, test & understand the examples in C#. The book is a bit bulky. It would be great if authors could provide in core languages like C#, C++ - just my thought. Apart from that, the book is awesome. Value for money.
B0041D843M|3.0|Although I found it to be interesting, I still have my doubts about how the statistics were used.  It is rather boring reading at times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. So many unexpected twists and turns, right up to the end. The hunger games seems so brutal and barbaric..... but not entirely impossible even in our world.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Not happy at all with this app.  It locked up my tablet for 20 minutes.  Even a hard boot was difficult to get.<br />Deleted it immediately upon restart.

IF your gonna waste time buy highway rider<br /><br /> Palestream of Ivyclan
B005G5PPGS|4.0|As an avid baseball fan, I would recommend this book to any one that has a 'love for the game'.  Very interesting read about the athletics approach to fielding a low budget competitive team.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I had never heard of the Piano Guys until I saw them perform on Katie Couric's show.  I went on the computer and heard more of their music. Then I was sold!<br />The CD puts everything  in one spot.  They are quite talented.
0307591549|4.0|I saw Shawn on TV and really found his presentation great . I wanted to read the entire book and I like to re-read as many times as it strikes me to do so . His work is filled with no -nonsense information and downright good humour . I would recommend this book to anyone as a must read .
B009N9C76E|5.0|this item is WAY OVERPRICED for amazon1 because at walmart it is 24.99 which is more like it though. the set its ecxeptional i like how it has the halo 4 chief. but in my opinon dont by it off here by it walmart
B00005ONMP|4.0|If you're bound and determined to assemble a comprehensive set of Mendelssohn symphonies and overtures in quality performances, this is the way to go. Abbado and the London Symphony turn in solid renditions that on average outstrip the competition. To be frank, I'm not terribly keen on much of the composer's music -- among the symphonies, for example, I really like only the Nos. 3 and 5, which are wonderfully rendered by the London Philharmonic under Bernard Haitink. If, however, you're more of a Mendelssohn enthusiast than I am, then this set should be perfect.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was curious to see how the writer would keep the story going in this serise.  Usually, with love stories of this type it's the same book with slight variations on how the two characters are working through their relationship.  Although, there was still plenty of, ahem, love scenes the twist of adding in the dark past of the step brother was intriguing.  I was aware that the step brother was responsible for Eva's mistrust and dysfunction in past relationships but was not anticipating the impact that he would have in this book.  I gave the book 4 stars because I thought the resolution at the end was highly unlikely and far fetched.  I can't elaborate because I would hate to spoil the ending for those who haven't read it but I think the author could have thought of something else and possibly carried it into the next book.  Overall a pleasant read and I am eager to get my hands on the next one.
