B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am amazed at the information that I get and help finding what I need to access information, websites, etc..
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|It is awesome and swagtastic<br />I luv it and I make swaths christian rap mixes boyy<br />This awesome<br />I'm speechless wow this is my favorite app
B001NMAFXQ|5.0|From beginning to end a great record.<br />This is ADTR at its best in my opinion. All the songs flow very well together. Great song writing and great performance
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not image going through what this man has gone through. He is a true survivor. It breaks my heart that people in North Korea are suffering.
1118109791|4.0|This is the only version with Integrated Reasoning portion (online access only though), which is a new question type added to the test in 2012.
B0091X2K0A|4.0|Classic Stanley Kubrick! Still have to see Clockwork Orange but the bathroom scene with Mathew Modine and  Vincent D'Ofrio is forever etched in my mind.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  Excellent.  I also recommend the first book and the 3 books about the building of the cathedral in the middle ages.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I've been busy reading about the Ancient Mysteries, the Lost Word & Robert Langdon. Yeah, it's been interesting around here. Not Rome or Paris interesting. This a whole new level of interesting and it's called Washington D.C. (leave it to Dan Brown to find a perfect setting). Langdon's journey on the Old Continent was 2 books long so the timing for some good action on American soil was perfect.<br /><br />Dan gets a big big like for this one (also every other one of his books for that matter). Again we encounter mysterious symbols, the Masons and Robert being called to decipher a very old symbol. What great mystery will he help unveil this time? You know I won't tell you. Read it and find out. Once you start turning the pages...you won't be able to stop until the very end when the \\"secret\\" is revealed. I'm looking forward to hear what you think.<br /><br />Rating - I'd give it 10 stars, but the Goodreads maximum is 5 :)<br /><br />Who would I recommend it to - Dan Brown, Robert Langdon & thriller fans, everyone who has already read Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code.
B009NX409M|5.0|A beautiful romantic movie with no cursing or violence. Great stars. Must see if you are in to good down to earth love stories.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I just finished reading Digital Fortress by Dan Brown. To say I liked it would be an understatement :) Interesting, exciting, mysterious and a whole lot of other adjectives can be used to describe it (all of them positive of course).<br /><br />Will top secret NSA files stay safe facing the threat that is Digital Fortress? Well, I won't tell you. Read it and see for yourself.<br /><br />I will tell you, however, that I loved David Becker . He is  handsome, smart &  he can speak lots of languages (I study languages btw). Susan is awesome too. She can break codes (cool, cool, cool). I intend to research a little bit more about the science of cryptography. I am a very curious person you see.<br /><br />Rating - do I even have to say it? Of course it's five stars. (Just like Angels and Demons & The Da Vinci Code)<br /><br />Who would I recommend it too - Anyone who likes thrillers, Dan Brown & anyone with an interest in cryptography.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading another Dan Brown novel. Stay tuned to see which one will be next :)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app!  I like the &#34;night&#34; sound.  I turn it on at night and my dogs and I fall asleep right away.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|If you are a fan of music, watch it. It's amazing. Dave Grohl has put together some of the most talented minds in music in this film and created something magical. The album is also amazing.
B007SSF3O0|4.0|Very cute clean movie for family. It can be a little slow at times, but all and all fun to watch.
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|The character Steve Carell plays is the same in each movie I've seen with him.  He's kind of a jerk, who transforms, but somehow it still makes a character who is not very interesting.  He's too unreal and still a jerk.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse arrived on time and looked great. Plugged it in and was faster than anything I'd used before, so I had to change some settings to make it work for me. The weights weren't necessary, but a neat feature. Best part is that it's ergonomical, plenty of hotkey buttons, and the awesome blue anchor glowing at the center. I'd recommend this mouse to anyone, great item for a very good price.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|It is like watching 3 stories in one without getting lost on what's happening in either, and I like it!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|love this app.  Even my 85 yr old mom got into it!!!  great for elderly to occupy their mind and exercise their hearing, kinesthetic and memory.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is fun to play when you have nothing to do. Good to pass time. It works out your brain to guess the puzzle. Overall this app is fun to play when your bored.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Like this application... better than checking emails, facebook or texting while waiting for a friend to arrive, ah! and rewarding exercise to the mind!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|What a great CD for someone like myself who misses the good ole country music we grew up with. Vince did it again.
B00DJC4JEE|5.0|I first thought I would not like this movie because of the outline story but it was funny and very entertaining and I could not keep my eyes off of it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Does just what I want it to do... it is quick and easy to learn and ready to go as soon as you load it!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|If you love the graphic novel you will love this animated version. Both this and Part II are very well done.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good game, good graphics. Fast space and for the cost of the game it was worthwhile. Will try to get<br />game 2.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I can certainly identify with this bloke and his finding a new life because of his relationship with Bob. It is good that he wrote the book. He put it much better than I could have. My dog did the same for me. It is also good that he wrote of his getting clean also due to Bob's influence. This book really spoke to me on so many levels. Thank you. Best wishes to you and Bob.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Madmen the series has me reliving my youth through this series. Their attention to details in the environment and how attitudes are evolving and changing give a realistic view of the work place and where the good old boys network was and evolved into adjusting to woman and minorities joining. I love it. It is honest and thought provoking!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|My daughter loved this book. She thought it was so funny. She gave the book five stars. She is excited about reading the next book.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|As a fan of the Sound of Music throughout my life, I thought why not invest in this collectible. And I'm glad I did. The packaging and presentation is incredible. I can't wait to put it under the tree for my granddaughter at Christmas and share this classic family story and journey!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|\\"Spirits of the Western Sky\\" is the long awaited follow up to the 1996 cd, \\"The View from the Hill\\"; and what Justin shares w/ this release is roughly 47 years of life's experiences. The more facets of himself he reveals, and allows us to see in his music, the better understanding we have of him as an artist; and a glimpse into the personal. I appreciate that it isn't a MB release; that we are treated to songs we might not find performed by the band. Personal favorites: \\"In Your Blue Eyes\\", \\"The Eastern Sun\\" and \\"Lazy Afternoon\\". If you are a Justin Hayward fan I recommend this latest release; and don't think you'll be disappointed.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I have never watched a single episode. However I read Rob Lowe's book in which he describes his acting career as it lead to his role in West Wing. He absolutely loved his character on the series and spoke so highly of it in his book, I thought, why not.  So, with his recommendation and my admiration of him, I purchased this box set and am looking forward to watching every moment!!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I got this to listen to cricket in England, and I am now using it for the BBC World Service in the USA.  No complaints at all.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|great clock app.  I can't understand why the kindle doesn't have thistype of app as standard. but its frustrating that it has intrusive ads.  continuing my search for a weather /clock combo app.
1439156816|5.0|In this book, a sincere guide to young writers e veterans in the art of writing , the  whole process of writing, from text elaboration to publishing, in  compreensive and friendly stile.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Me and my husband have been slowly falling in love again and learned alot of things from this book.Buy it!
1479148466|5.0|Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel. I love the large print, as it makes it easier to read (I plan to read it multiple times). The price was good and the book itself is beautiful.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I LIKED ALL THE EPISODES OF DOWNTON ABBEY, FABULOUS ACTORS<br /><br />SUPER STORY , GREAT COUSTOMS  FOR THAT PERIOD.<br />MAGGIE GREAT ACTRESS. CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 4
B00CISC2DA|4.0|Most of the time I get a new album it has to grow on me, and it's doing that. I just wish it could do so faster, since other BoC albums stuck with me very quickly. That said, it is still a 4 star album because it's still great. It's just not hitting with me completely yet.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter wanted me to download this app for her so I did. Now we both play it all the time. It's very addicting!
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I guess the review title states it in a nutshell, just wouldn't download onto my android device.I will attempt to download again later if it stays free
B007MCTTHY|3.0|I downloaded this for my daughter and it wasn't something that could keep her interest. I played with it for a few minutes and found it to be an OK app. I can't say anything bad about it!
B00004RFFS|5.0|Plz if you are a Brad Pit Fan or a Tom Cruse fan  you will enjoy this great dvd for many yrs to come one of my fav. horror movies .
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app. Have not had it long ,but very easy to use and love the large display on the 8.9 HD.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|The language of the book is beautiful. Well written, captivating. I definitely recommend this book. The worst part was when it was over!
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This little app is incredible. The idea of making<br />games without having the hassle of creating content!<br />The first night I got it, I stayed up until 2am, playing<br />it for about 4 hours longer than intended. It is fun. Buy it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|For a show set in the 20's it's quite interesting. I can't wait for the next season to start. A show worth watching.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed \\"The Misrembered Man\\" for the most part.  It was well-written with pretty good character development.  The one exception to that was the character of Lydia; while Publisher's Weekly indicated she was a 'primary' character in the book and while she did play a key role, she was really background to Jamie's story.  Rose and Paddy's characters were delightful and added wonderful humor to the tale.  The author did an excellent job of interspersing tales of Jamie's horrific childhood with his current life, and detailing the effect his childhood had on him.  The book was slow-moving in parts, but it's definitely worth reading.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Love the move great cast and action would watch again and best of all it was a amazon prime free move!!
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|The movie was a bit confusing as to what was going on at times. The main characters spoke American slang English while the setting was the middle ages in Europe. I found it quite boring and lost interest quickly. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this movie. There are much better choices.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a movie that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again.  I always fell in love with Richard Armitage.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I did enjoy the adventure in the novel.  It enticed me to look forward to the next Sylvia Day novel.
B006OB3K56|5.0|Shame is a pleasure for all of the senses. Dark and disturbing sex scenes that are wonderfully choreographed. A somber soundtrack that highlights the emptiness of the film. Brilliant performances by Fassbender and Mulligan. The film is a slow burn, but for those who enjoy movies that you need to be sucked into then you shall enjoy Shame. The film is erotic, but hollow and you'll understand the hollowness by watching the film. Overall it is a stunning movie that should be enjoyed and appreciated.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great series with just the right amount of adventure.  Keeps your interest so that you look forward to the next book in the series.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. The only problem is your free daily credits don't go very far and its kind of expensive to purchase more.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't get enough of it! I had the hardest time putting it down. I may even read it again!
B0053O89IS|5.0|How to say more to the seventh season of a so wonderful TV serie?<br />Nothing: just take it and enjoy! :)
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really fun game, lots of things to find. Hours of fun and a great way to work out you brain with puzzles.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Got to level 9 with several dragons and more waiting to hatch. Next time I opened it it crashed and I had to start over again. Not sure if I will bother.
B00DF92E7U|5.0|I was anxiously waiting for this album to be released...and it was WELL worth the wait.  The combination of talent it has never stops amazing me....I'm giving it 5 stars only because I can't give it 10!!!
B0081HLM2E|5.0|As my review title suggests: weird, but interesting! The plot & intensity of the characters kept my girlfriend and I intrigued throughout the film.<br /><br />Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) is intense & just awesome. Period.<br /><br />I'm sure that Aksel Hennie is unknown in North Americas, but... damn, he is awesome. I am looking forward to watching him in Max Manus: Man of War. I'd love to see him in more and more films
B0040HO01Y|5.0|If you like Downton Abby, watch this! It is a fun show and reminds me of the characters and drama of Downton Abby.
0451191153|2.0|This book is loooooong! I found the character's detestable, the prose tedious, but I kept reading all 700 plus pages thinking there would be some pearl of wisdom at the end. I was sadly mistaken. If you want to learn about Ayn Rand and Objectivism look it up on Wikipedia and skip this long tedious read!
B00E8TVHBA|3.0|I ordered it for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She loved it!  Not really my kind of movie but, I will give 3 stars for an average between both of us.  She would probably give it 5 stars.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|Like someone said, there should be a level editor to create levels. But besides that, great app. Pretty awesome!!!!!!!! I found it for  the day after Christmas.
1439102813|5.0|As the daughter of an &#34;Alice&#34; mom, this hit very close to home.  Very difficult to get through at times but really gave me a better perspective and the &#34;view from the other side&#34; so to say.  I have given it to several of my friends with Alzheimers mothers as well and they all appreciated.  Highly recommend.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|JEWELS STAR is my favorite game right now.  It is a matching game and has great graphics and sounds.  I can't seem to put it away, day and night.  It also has many levels, with each level a tad harder.  I made it to level 21, and I've been trying so hard to get to level 22.  What a challenge this game has become.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazingly fun for everyone in the family my 5 year old loves playing this game it's fun to race friends
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a feast for the imagination; looking forward to Season 4 as the dessert!  Now if only U.S. TV could catch up.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Opened, but in like new condition. Can't wait to give it as a gift. Right price for the right person and shipped as promised. What more could I want! Thanks!
B00EM764ZC|3.0|No issues with the app. It's a basic map function and works as advertised. It's worth a look to see if it would work for your needs.
0811826848|5.0|Unwrapped copy in like new condition for a great price. What more could I ask for! Thanks for delivering it as promised.
B00B2GK4KW|1.0|I bough 4 four of these puncher for my friends. And I own of them but everytime I punch, it is always not a clean punch. Same as the other 3 circle edge punch, they face the same situation like mine.<br /><br />Maybe it is the catridge has become blunt. Luckily other catridge desgin can be bought separately and use with the same starter kit base. I want to test with other cartidge later.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game. Not sure if the permissions changed... This is the first time I've noticed a faotd reposted though. Why not one of the other Cut The Rope versions? Yes this is challenging and addictive.<br /><br />I highly recommend it. Many levels. Increases problem solving skills. Easy controls. No bugs. I really have nothing bad to say about it.<br /><br />Other than, this s***'s fun. Swore to prove I'm not a fake review. Enjoy.<br /><br />Edit. They censored my shat. Grrr
1587143879|5.0|the book is very easy to understand. i'm sort of addicted to reading it everyday. i recommend it for anyone who wants to write the CCNA routing and switching test. it has everything you need know to excel in your ccna
B003A3NEIO|5.0|I liked that Michael Buble included his family in his event.  He puts on a good show and the events leading up to his final perfomance were interesting.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|This is an interesting word game.  It makes you think and helps keep the mind working. Fun for all child through adult. Very tasteful pictures.  Challenging at times but not so difficult you cannot come up with the answer.  The help factor and being able to purchase more coins if needed increases the enjoyment.
1451626088|1.0|Here I am, again, giving a book one star.  And I'm very uncomfortable doing so.<br />But, I am not a fan of historical fiction and don't know why Amazon kept recommending this book to me.  Regardless I bought it and read it.<br />I know that people married at a much earlier age in Medieval times, so that didn't bother me.<br />I think what I found so absolutely distasteful about this story was how jealous all of the women were of each other. That's #1.<br />Then, there's the fact that when one hear's \\"Kingmaker,\\" it sounds as if it would be a fairly honorable person, yet I found the father to be governed by his own whims and desire for power.<br />And then there were the many treacherous characters.  Oh, joy.  How uplifting.  Not!<br />These people behave abominably toward one another.  When Isabella died, I didn't think a faraway queen had poisoned her, I thought her husband had.  But this comes from someone who has no knowledge of this particular time and place in history.  Maybe it would have been better if I had.<br />I'm also not a huge fan of the idea of royalty.  The idea of all these people scratching and clawing their way to be kings and queens just strikes me as unrealistic.<br />Overall, I was just bored by this dreary book that supposedly looked into the lives of these people, who once actually lived.  And dreary doesn't begin to describe how desolate it is.<br />I've read how many people really like this author's other books, but unfortunately I am not willing to waste any more of my time finding out.<br />One book was enough.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|TF2 Fans want portability so here's a game that is Fun and Funny and also awesome! MUSIC IS GOOD! GAMEPLAY AWSOME! BUT NEEDS MORE MAPS.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My boys and I are die-hard Boston Legal fans. This may just be the replacement we were looking for.<br /><br />Well acted, great dynamic between the actors/characters. A great balance between wit and heart.<br /><br />Looking forward to many seasons to come.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Gave up on it after 2 days of reading.  Too many characters, too little character development, unmemorable personalities ... confusing and not compelling.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft Is the best game ever!!! I will never uninstall it and I will keep creating houses or mansions! I can't wait for the next update.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman is the lat­est adult (or young adult) novel by this pro­lific author. Admit­tedly, I am long time fan of Mr. Gaiman's work and have been look­ing for­ward to read this book.<br /><br />A man returns to his child­hood home in Sus­sex, Eng­land. The man finds him­self in a farm which is down the road from where he lived. As the man sits by the pond, he starts remem­ber­ing events of bygone years, a sui­cide, a stolen car and dark­ness unleashed.<br /><br />As a boy, the nar­ra­tor encoun­tered Let­tie Hemp­stock, her mother and pow­er­ful grand­mother - 3 mag­i­cal, yet com­fort­ing crea­tures. The story is unfold­ing as the man sits by the lake, which Let­tie insisted was an ocean.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman is a sim­ple, yet sophis­ti­cated, super­nat­ural novel . As always, Gaiman does a fan­tas­tic job writ­ing a mod­ern fairy­tale with all the ter­rors, delights and themes which are uni­ver­sal and accom­pany sto­ries of old.<br />I enjoyed this book on sev­eral lev­els, I left the best part for last.<br /><br />Much like many other clas­sic books, this one is about chil­dren, but not for chil­dren. The world Mr. Gaiman cre­ates is not nearly as com­plete or allur­ing as he did with the Sand­man comic books or Amer­i­can Gods novel - how­ever the world is addic­tive and it's dif­fi­cult to put the book down.<br /><br />This novel goes back to the theme of gods and super­nat­ural beings liv­ing among us, speak­ing and inter­act­ing with us. Even though it's not mar­keted this way, I felt that this is a heroic tale, not because the pro­tag­o­nist is brave, but because he isn't yet he fights his fear on every page.<br />But this is not the best thing about this book.<br /><br />Who are these mag­i­cal beings, in this case the Lemp­stocks or their neme­sis, the \\"fleas\\", never gets resolved. There are clues in the book to who these beings are, so maybe this book would need a closer read­ing the sec­ond time keep­ing in mind the ques­tion above. I did like the fact that these beings were \\"play­ing\\" at being human, and all that comes with it.<br /><br />This is a short book, but it is very well writ­ten. I'm not a big fan of fan­tasy but I was delighted to read this book. Sev­eral epic bat­tles take place between these page, the bat­tle between inno­cence and myth, child­hood and adult­hood, real world and fan­tasy (although which world is real and which is fan­tasy is also chal­lenged). The bat­tle of grow­ing up, when the world stops mak­ing sense, magic makes way for sci­ence and you do not know, nor do you accept, that maybe, just maybe, you'll never under­stand every­thing.<br />But that is not the best thing about this book.<br /><br />This is a good novel, well writ­ten and tight - the novel should get 5 stars and be on everyone's \\"must read\\" list just so they could study the struc­ture, tone, deliv­ery, drama and focus cor­rectly.<br />But that is not the best thing about this book.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that, after years of beg­ging, my wife finally read a Neil Gaiman book and liked it a lot. We spent an evening dis­cussing the book, some­thing we haven't done in a while and for that, Mr. Gaiman, I'm eter­nally great­ful (at the time of this post, she is read­ing The Grave­yard Book and I'm look­ing for­ward to another engag­ing evening dis­cussing  Mr. Gaiman's fas­ci­na­tion with para­nor­mal crea­tures named Hemp­stocks and girls going to Australia).to who these beings are, so maybe this book would need a closer read­ing the sec­ond time keep­ing in mind the ques­tion above.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Well when my cousin showed me this game I thought it was going to be the worst game ever but after a few weeks I fell in love with this game!
B003V4AK8E|4.0|First the Good:<br /><br />I loved the feel and size of this controller. It felt much better than the Dualshock 3, especially the buttons. The Dualshock 3 is made far more cheaply and is flimsy by comparison. Which is ironic considering the Dualshock 3 costs a lot more.<br /><br />I should also point out that Dualshock 3 can't take heat at all. I put a Dualshock 3 in the closet with the rest of the AV gear and on a very hot day it reached over 130 degrees inside the closet. The membrane for the face buttons inside the Dualshock 3melted and the face buttons all broke. The Pro Elite was sitting right next to the Dualshock 3 and worked just fine.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />I had to return it anyway.<br /><br />In my video setup all of my AV gear is in a closet and cables are run from that closet to the speakers and monitor. In this scenario the Pro Elite didn't work at all. As soon as I closed the closet door communication between the dongle and controller died, even from a few feet away. The Dualshock 3 worked perfectly and it is the ONLY controller that I've found that worked in this scenario.<br /><br />I should also point out that I'm using 2.4 GHz WiFi in the closet as well, so it's far from ideal conditions for the dongle.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Good game w with lots to do a real fun time fun and very affordable housing market research I love you for the beautiful game of the beautiful and looks at how proud of them ready to get tips
B0026KX6TY|5.0|This movie makes you wanna play chess! It makes you pull for Josh against his nemesis ! It has a lot of action for a movie about chess!
B008AT9XOC|5.0|This original version is fantastic. But to see the way it was initially shot, well, that is so cool. The only way this disk would be better is if they had both versions on this disk (if it is there, I didn't see it).
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It is unusual for a second season to be as successful as the first, but the creators of &#34;Suits&#34; pulled it off admirably. The characters are just as  enjoyable, the writing just as smart, and they never resort to cheap tricks or violence to get market share. The energy and clever writing is so great that it can keep you up at night, so a caution is in order to firmly limit the number of episodes to watch in a night, otherwise one could very well wind up staying up way past bedtime, as happened to me on many a night. Streaming quality was first rate throughout as usual from Amazon.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Peter Jackson has done a great job adapting J.R.R. Tolkiens' books to the big screen. Previous efforts have all failed to come close. For books this rich in detail you are always going to miss a part that you liked but there is only so much that will fit in a movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. I couldn't put it down. I don't want to leave any spoilers, but you will need tissues while reading this.
1608871819|3.0|I love the front page and but I found many interesting topics are missing inside the book.  I didn't see how the superman suit was developed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I like to read Grisham's books because their just plain good reading and have suspense & interesting stories to keep one interested.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer never disappoint me !!!<br /><br />I found the music and scores are really from acadamy award winner.<br /><br />Great !!!
1616551607|5.0|Bought as a present for my husband. What a great collection of video game art and in a stunning fabric box.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD. Their version of House of Cards was fabulous. The mellow twangy version of Houses of the Holy was interesting. Buddy Miller was great doing Somewhere Trouble Don't Go as was Darrell Scott doing A Satisfied Mind. For her number I would have preferred to have Patty do one of the songs she has written, and she has written many wonderful songs.I always loved Led Zep when they were at their most folk rocky and Gallows Pole was one of my faves of theirs. The intensity with which Patty Griffin sings at the end of Gallows Pole is stunning. Being a Fairport Convention fan, the insertion of the beginning of Come All Ye by Patty and Plant, in the middle of I'm in the Mood was a touch of genius. Rock and Roll had a great almost 50s sound to it. Wonderful concert.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|My husband and I are enjoying this book together.  It's self-centered and always honest, a true Sedaris trait.  It's well-written and can make the most simple situation enjoyable because he takes the time to notice details.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My friend showed me this game and I absolutely loved it. It's so much like subway surfers, but better because there's so much more. I loved this game and I play it constantly now
1623431182|5.0|This photography is simply fantastic I like the mini just because I drive a truck but every time I look at these pictures it cracks me up. If you love dogs water and remembering federal holidays this calendar is for you.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Fantastic tale of Gods, demi-gods, and other magical characters of mythology.  Loved all 5 books and the 2 movies.  The books of course offer more detail and are quite a bit different than the movie version.  Highly recommend the series to young readers and adults alike.
B001F6TXME|4.0|Works just fine but it is actually much more difficult (and thus slower) to locate and plug into your camera (especially in low light when you are most likely to need it) than the old screw into the shutter release type. That is actually probably more a crticism of the camera itself rather than the remote release. Other than that it does what is supposed to do.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Great movie, action packed, great actors. This movie is really exciting and also had some funny parts too rocky is a great actor
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its pretty great, and there's really nothing you can hold against it! I got it RIGHT b4 it updated though, so I thought it was broken till my kindle asked me 2 update 4 free. I have just started but I'm already on lvl ten. One strange thing though: If Nightmare Moon is back, how can you get Princess Luna in ur town, becuz Nightmare is kinda evil version of Luna...
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game is fun, it has decent entertainment value. But when they don't help with complaints, it is frustrating. So yah, I am so so with this one.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I hated the annotation (underlining) by Oprah. What she thought was important wasn't necessarily what I thought was important. Is there a way to get rid of the underlining?
B007THA4FI|1.0|The story is not well developed. The characters are introduced in such a way they confuse the reader. None of the characters is developed into either an agonist or protagonist. It is hard to get involved in a story when you feel no investment in the characters or story line.
1476733953|5.0|I don't know if I've ever written a review about a book before. Although there are books that I've absolutely adored (The King Killer Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss being two of my all time favorites), this one takes the cake.<br /><br />It takes a true artist to create the story he created. It's original. It's fascinating. It's a million different ways of wonderful.<br /><br />However, a lot of people have great ideas. The difference is that it takes an absolute mastermind to transfer that idea-- the story, the setting, the characters-- to paper in such a beautiful way as Hugh Howey.<br /><br />I love his writing. I wish I could create a talent-zapper and transfer all of his writing talent to me. Or maybe just a fraction of it.<br /><br />Hugh should join the ranks of the great writers-- not only in his genre, but of all time.<br /><br />I finished Wool around one a.m. last night (a feat for anyone who knows me... I turn into Cinderella's pumpkin at 10:00 sharp) and it took every ounce of me not to immediately start his next book, Shift.
B00CM03H4C|5.0|This is my favorite album to put on whenever I am doing something that doesn't allow me to frequently change songs. This movie was fantastic, and this soundtrack is almost as good as the movie.
B00821OX98|5.0|I mean REALLY not a fan, but I really enjoyed this series.  I was looking for a full series to watch while I was sick and am so glad I happened upon Falling Skies.  Not a lot of gore, just a good story.  Aliens invade the US, we hide, we fight - not a new storyline but nice side stories and even a few laughs.  A nice surprise for an easy watch!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This has to be the best Star Trek movie ever! I'm more of a TNG dude, but this was exceptional. So when will we see a new TNG movie with actors acting like those guys? I'm waiting!  :o)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love that this Author's stories are written about the people and their hardships/accomplishments and not about the politics of Afghanistan.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Very bloody, filmed in same stunningly, beautiful cinematographic technique as &#34;The 300&#34;.  Tons of sex and shockingly ruthless politics by women as well as men of the era.  You won't be able to look away from the gore, even when you want to.  Put the kids and teens to bed before watching...this series is for adults only.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|it is very well written and no less than I was hoping for. It is concluding a wonderful fantasy series that I have thoroughly enjoyed.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|Is there anything Meryl Streep cannot do??  Same for Kevin Bacon!  I guess not.  Grab some popcorn, get comfy and hunker down for a Wild ride!
B009LDD54K|5.0|I loved the first two seasons and this third is every bit as good. I can't wait for the forth.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|Love in the time of Nigeria's civil war:  a story of relationships set against the background of the Biafra misadventure.  Interesting to read a native Nigerian's views of African families, customs, war and the background of Europe and USA.  Adichie gets better with each effort; I look forward to her next novel.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is essentially the self-told story of a good and decent man. Most is how he would converse with you, anticipating your questions, about his upbringing, how he got involved, and how he made the most of it. One unanticipated factor was the entries by his wife. The man and the professional are, as you would expect, very complex; she is none the less. This is Family and Values with no polictics; only the practical application of very necessary skills. His as the killer; hers as the core of their family. Read... listen to the Team... enjoy your time there. I certainly have. (Peace)~ww.
B00B78AIV0|4.0|Intriguing story about events in Nigeria, fun read but shallow and not memorable.  Good effort by a new African voice.
030758836X|5.0|I read this book in 11 days along with going to school full-time and working... it was THAT good! I couldn't put it down. It was suspenseful, articulate, had multiple aspects (marriage, differences between men & women, facade's people put on in varying relationships, etc); it was just a great read. I found myself wondering the outcome several times.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone!
B000V8A95C|5.0|Recently saw the show in NYC. The music is terrific and the performers are top notch.  I HIghly recommend it.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|I show this in my high school health science course and my college mental health nursing course! It is just an awesome movie!!!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great actors, great story. Heartfelt and a little sad at times, but a well-rounded plot and a sweet ending. It's amazing how things were only half a century ago.
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|not as action packed as depicted on previews. Way too long. Wasted over two hours waiting on lackluster finish. Attempt at being a love story fails.
B001W63DXC|5.0|I can't believe that Bruce has still got it. Considering the voice is the weakest instrument in any band, Bruce certainly has staying power. Still hits those high notes with abandon. Such a great band. Such a great tour. And such a great record of it. The band itself, it's like nothing has ever changed, except for splitting the $$ 6 ways instead of 5!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Cute game, even for adults. I think it is almost funner than the movie. Can be a bit tedious though since there aren't many mini games like kung fu scrat, and then all there is to do is wait for your animals to grow, etc.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love it- All the songs are great. I  Cant wait for the second series to start and to hear more new songs
B0015DWJX2|5.0|As one who enjoy British stories, this book provided a very special treat in its format: A story through letters.  The story of the German occupation on the Island was very informative for someone interest in WWII.  Describing the ordeal of the people on the Island through the unique story these letters presented keep me motived to continue reading to see what would happen next.  A very good story and a very interesting way to present it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chromecast does exactly what it is advertised to do.<br />I can flawlessly stream Netflix and YouTube videos from my iPhone and iPad. I can switch between the iPhone and iPad for control without interruption.<br />This product allows me to stream movies to my non Internet connected TV.<br /><br />Roku and Apple TV may have more featues but the chromecast meets my needs.
B004TNGLW0|1.0|Digital copy that expired at the end of 2012 in a flimsy humidor for people who have never smoked a cigar for more than $200.00???
B0092S4WLY|4.0|This game has definitely kept me busy during my most boring days at work.  I like it and waiting on more levels
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I loved this book and Piper's sense of humor.  It was a fairly quick read and I found myself shirking my responsibilities in favor of reading.  I've recommended both it, and the Netflix show to many.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game.  The graphics are really good,  the game play is fun. The games are challenging especially when you are forced to play in flashlight mode. I recommend this game.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed is a very brave woman to take on such a monumental task all alone.  I kept waiting for something big or horrible to happen and was relieved that it never did.  This was simply a book about a brave woman who set out to find herself and did.  She has my deepest respect.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|Great story. It was great comparing it to the movie. The book made the movie make more enjoyable. I would recommend seeing the movie first than you must read the book. It is like you are getting the behind scene information.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I went into this movie with no pre-knowledge of the Dredd storyline, or knowing anything about this movie.  There were a couple things I would have done differently, plot wise, but I thought that all the main actors brought something to the table, there were some very interesting ideas woven in, and I thought the art direction on the city and the buildings was both plausible and had a unique flavor.  Before I knew that it was a thing in original storyline, I thought it was both very interesting that you never saw more than the chin of the main character, and I thought it completely worked in context of the movie.<br /><br />I thought it was well worth the watch, and I would see it again.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Lots of fun ... Kindle version doesn't have some features of iPod version but still fun to play.  hopefully they will soon update the Kindle version too!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just as good as the other seasons. Can't wait for the next! The characters have depth, humor, I can't get enough. Love it.
B00DYVUBYM|5.0|I am a huge Sophia C fan so of course I love this movie. However, I really felt this one especially captured the moment (again). If you haven't seen Virgin Suicides or Lost in Translation you are missing out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|better than floors you have to do more to get out of the room.  I liked the how you have to figure out codes to open stuff
B00A83075M|5.0|I love it - it pays homage to some of the best classic games of all time.  It's a geek's dream come true.  And it makes me a little &#34;faclept&#34; with the sappy stuff.  Great job Disney!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read SLAMMED a while ago, but I have since read EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. of Colleen Hoover's books, teasers, extra chapters, alternate POVs, etc. Yes, I'm probably bordering on stalking Colleen Hoover's career at this point - I eat up every little morsel she throws at her eager readers, always wanting more!!! And after meeting Colleen in person last April, I was SO happy (but not surprised!) to find that the person behind all these life-altering amazing works of literature is just SO wonderful and warm and real and down-to-earth and with a sense of humor that just won't quit!!!<br /><br />The fact that SLAMMED is Colleen's first novel and how successful it's been should tell you something... Colleen's talent is just breathtaking! The characters, the story, the poetry (HOW did she write all that?!), The Avett Brothers (if you're a fan of them like me, you've found a kindred spirit in Colleen!!!) - ALL of it just makes for an unforgettable, mind-blowing, life-altering reading experience that at the same time feels SO real and relatable, you'll feel every emotion, every high and low so deeply that it'll take your breath away! Lake and Will still live in my head after all these months (and two other books, both of them just as AWESOME, you might as well get them all at once!!!), as near and dear to my heart (and almost as real) as a great friend would be (yes, I KNOW they're fictional, but believe me, you'll WANT them to be real once you've been introduced to them by the incredibly talented Ms. Hoover!).<br /><br />Go read SLAMMED and ALL of Colleen Hoover's other books - NOW!!! It'll change your life, I promise you that!!!
B0006HBZXS|1.0|The image is grainy and color not natural. Whoever copied and made this video had low quality process. Amazon should sell this video.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game brings back fun memories...  Really enjoy the classic remake...  Wish I could save at the level I am on though...
B005544TRQ|4.0|Somewhat contrived storyline, but, love the characters and varied plots per each episode.  Rivals within the firm are quite entertaining and Lewis is oh-so-devious.
1742200508|1.0|I suppose if you are a drunken college student who only needs a book that points out pubs in a few towns and like the disorganized nature of this book, then you should buy  several - throw away as much money on it as possible!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app every night and I have gotten some very good sleep.  I set the timer and drive away.  Would love some more sounds, but until then, I'll keep experimenting and creating my own relaxation mixes.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I was having trouble with the regular yahoo mail.  This is much better.  No problems. I wish more apps adjusted to kindle fire.  Like scrabble,  can't play with friends on it.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|GREAT SHOW! Went throught the first season in less  than a week. Funny and orginial. Great cast and plot, always funny.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|By the second season, the phenomenon that is Sherlock really hit its stride; Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman became international stars in their own right, as did Andrew Scott, who portrays Moriarty with gleeful, deadly zest. The entire world waits breathlessly for the next season (sometime in 2014?), Mssrs. Cumberbatch and Freeman have become movie stars along the way (not just for TV, kiddies!), and the show's meticulous attention to detail and use of present-day London for the setting are a total joy to behold. Hopefully, this newfound fame won't deter these gifted actors from continuing their collaboration.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Just read it, it's one of the best books I've read about religion. You are there before, during and after the origin of Christianity.
B004132HZS|5.0|This show and its incredible star, Benedict Cumberbatch, are my passion and my obsession. A true masterpiece! None better in quality and respect for the original creation. So beautifully realized it leaves the viewer breathless. Literally.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great special effects and character work. Star studded and worth the time to watch. I thought it would be cheezy but it wasn't!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I watch Goonies when I want a fun reminder of my childhood. I loved watching this adventure/journey movie with my little brother growing up. It is full of challenges of childhood and adolescence and the work that can be accomplished with a group of friends. I will forever remember my brother's love of pirates and &#34;One-eyed Willie&#34; after watching this movie. Get a big bowl of popcorn and introduce this movie to your kids now so they can develop a love for this wonderful 80s movie.
0345472322|5.0|This book is a great read. In the first chapter, Dweck explains that people have come up to her saying how they read her book and immediately thought &#34;this is me! I do that!&#34; I felt the same way. Not only is it a very interesting read, but the techniques for developing a &#34;growth mindset&#34; (as she explains in the book) have already started to make a positive impact on my life. Read this- you won't be sorry!
B00DE76PM8|2.0|need to purchase maps eventually. Won't do for travel guide or casual reference use. Once in a map it seems to be pretty good
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is awesome, the way he plays is mesmerizing! and amazing to whatch. this is a must for your music collection.
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|I have had problems with this DVD as there is no main feature on the disc.  It starts with the coming features and then it is blank.  What should I do?
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|A very fun read.  Typical Dan Brown novel with a number of twists and unexpected turns. I can easily recommend this book
0679805273|5.0|Dr. Seuss has such great words of advise to someone as young as a pre-school grad to a mature college senior!  We presented this book to our homeschool pre-school and K grads and we will use it through the years filling it with encouraging messages from us or other influential  people in their lives. It will be an awesome senior grad gift too that guests can sign and write encouraging words in to the guest of honor.
0307895475|1.0|The book has a bunch of dogeared pages, pages that are torn and looks like had a little water damage and there is a poster that is missing that someone took out. Honestly I would have just paid more from Target had I know the quality would be this bad. Ehhh.
1742119557|5.0|We used this puzzle to go along with our Dr. Seuss theme Oh, The Places You'll go for graduation.  My son age 6 was able to make the puzzle but my daughter age 4 found it a little challenging since the pieces can fit together but not necessary belong together.  They need to visualize the puzzle to make it all come together.  It is quite large and we used it as an accent for our d&eacute;cor too!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Once I got pass the download issues, this game was so much fun &amp; addicting. Startedplaying &amp; before I knew it low battery sign popped up. Plugged in charger &amp; kept playing. Kids want their turn but it is my turn FOREVER!!!!
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|I really enjoyed this prequel to the first 2 Ip man movies. I'm not familiar with the lead, but he was pretty good in the role.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I purchased this for my girlfriend, as she loves Taylor Swift. The CD came shrink wrapped in original packaging and played all the way through without skips or anything. I would purchase from this seller again.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I read this book because as a professional working woman, it seemed required reading. There is also a book club at my organization which discussed this book. But personally, I didn't think I would get out of it. But I was very surprised, even shocked, because in many instances, it sounded like she was talking about me, my feelings, and my experiences! It was very thought-provoking. One situation was exactly as she described: I decided not to apply for a management job 2 weeks ago because I didn't meet all the criteria and I didn't want to start working overtime and going to the office on weekends, which I did when I was a manager a few years ago. (I had been a manager, then decided to take an opportunity to take a year-long sabbatical.  But when I came back, my job was gone and I had to go back to being a workerbee, which in the end, I didn't mind.)  However,  based on what I read, now I'm sorry that I didn't apply for the management job.  At least I would have seen if I would have been competitive or not.<br /><br />Now I'm very happy and satisfied that I didn't opt out and have kept working for almost 30 years, except for the few months I took off when my kids were born.  It's a practical reason.  I now have 2 kids in college and while other families struggle to finance their kids' college educations, my family is able to afford it with no problem.  And I'm proud to know that's because I persevered and kept plugging away all these years to save up for their college, although it hasn't been easy sometimes.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because some of the other chapters weren't relevant for me.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I purchased this CD  and it came exactly as described. In original shrink wrapping, with the proper CD inserts and everything. The CD played all the way through without issue. I would purchase from this seller again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm heartbroken with the tragic ending to season 3 and I'm looking forward to season 4. Now I know why this drama has won so many awards. I enjoy the story line and the series has a great cast of characters; the acting is superb.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I never played Mahjong before but not I'm addicted.  It's just fun!!  I just have to limit my time though
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I don't care what kind of reader you are, everyone needs to read some of the classics at some point. This is no exception. Very nice edition.
B002N1AF7C|5.0|When you consider the immaturity of the MOOG SYNTHESIZER at the time of this multitrack recording, EACH SOUND had to be generated on a separate Track and MIXED-DOWN. They MAY HAVE HAD one synthesizer each, or there may have been turns on the single one.<br />Like Mike Oldfield's TUBULAR BELLS multi-track recording, the overall concept-transition points-and Key structures had to be lain clearly before the start. Now, with Multi-synth sequencing, they can re-create this monumental effort LIVE!<br />As you twist and fold through the (okay SOMETIMES CHEESY) Sound Effects, Vocals and Musicality of the 25 minute Title Track, one can become mesmerized by the unexpected and hip tempo shifts. It Takes Up ALL of Side 1 on the LP Vinyl.<br />Side TWO: With Tunes like Morning WALK, and Comet Melody are a little heavy on the (Cheesy) Sound Effects, but the  SOARING MELODY of KOMMETENMELODIE (Comet Melody)  far surpasses ANYTHING on Side One's Infectious title Track. VERY FEW Foreign Language Hits were on 1970's American Hit Radio (Eres TU from MOCADEDES comes to mind) so for the 7\\" (if You're luck enough to locate one) to get airplay was an honest coup. For mainstream people to be  singing/humming \\"FAWN FAWN FAWN Indy Otto Bon\\" not even knowing the meaning, is a true testament to the Infectious Lyrics<br />We are Driving Driving Driving on the AutoBahn<br />Before us is a huge valley<br />Grey Ribbon, Green Edges<br />We turn the Radio on<br />Out of the Loudspeaker spills<br />We're Driving on the Autobahn.\\"<br /><br />So by Now I hope \\"AUS Dem Loutschprecken Kling est dan, Wir Farhn auf der Autobahn!\\"<br /><br />A True Electronica Masterpiece, to be revered every bit as much as SWITCHED ON BACH (...if you're into that sort of thing.)
B00CATSONE|4.0|I enjoyed reading this short little free book on (1)creativity and (2) the life of Nikola Tesla (as an example of a creative life). As other reviewers have pointed out, the book is not really a detailed biography of Tesla's life. Instead it uses Tesla's creative track record as an example of an inventor who had a wonderful imagination. (Despite Tesla being screwed over several times by Edison, JPMorgan, and others several times during his lifetime.)<br /><br />The book contains lots of inspirational quotes by other people, touches on other ideas of success and mastery (eg. the concept of 10,000 hours of dedicated practice, the birthday lottery from Gladwell's Outliers), and talks about creativity in general.<br /><br />I see another reader was unhappy with the author's reference to his other books and products, for example this other Kindle book: [[ASIN:B00BERNZ4G Awakening Your Inner Genius]]. I certainly don't blame the author for including a reference to other work. Every author and publisher has (legitimately) been doing that for hundreds of years. I liked this little book so much I immediately went out and bought the follow on book above for $2.39.<br /><br />I recommend this free book to everyone.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a must have helps me keep my kindle fire running smooth and fast love this app and the best thing is its free.
B00000612G|5.0|Bought it for my wife n she loves it. Richie is her favorite in Bon Jovi. She saw them five times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You made a great game and I have an idea for the new update<br />, jukebox, levers, buttons, iron Golems , iron Doors , piston<br />And Redstone but for now keep them coming.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|More Castile. Misha Collins is so perfect for this role, he really brings that needed 3rd element to the Sam, Dean combo
0393339882|4.0|Einstein-Podolski-Rosen Paradox gave me a lot to think about. This great debate is not yet over. Entanglement is not completely understood.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Digging the pics and anomalies. Items needed to put collections together are hard to win like they're hoping you'll cave and buy some crystals.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|very much like the hunger games. A kid risking his life for no good reason. Great King characterizations as usual. I enjoyed it a lot.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|Very interesting true story and well produced I thought Ben Afleck was good as an actor and director Can not understand why he did not get more recognition at the Oscars.
B000FC2ROU|4.0|Not through reading yet but it is an intriguing  book. there are two interwoven  stories about a young man and WWII
B007REV4YI|3.0|Not as good as previous movies and disappointed M got it this time, always good scenery and is good to pick out the landmarks.
1449433251|5.0|I, quite simply, would recommend this complete issue for anyone who needs a break from the reality of day to day living.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This book was wonderful.  Great story with some surprises.  A very nice read.  I have found a new author and have read several of his books this summer.  I would read anything he writes and know I will enjoy it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator it works its easy to use what more.could you ask for.  I haven't found any bugs or problems with it yet nor do I expect to.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Good story about life and times in other countries.  good insight into adopted families. How the melting pot United States has changed  over the decades.
0140186395|5.0|I bought this because it's one of my friend's favorite books, and it does not disappoint. It is possibly my favorite now, too.
B001TXWJ4M|4.0|This is a pretty intense show! Shows the raw side of the situation. No sugar coating. And leaves you in suspense and wanting more!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun I mean if my mom would let me stay up all night I would and play this game
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|We really enjoy the movie for the entire family.  The acting is good and it is a good twist on a classic theme.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I just love this app. Hours of fun especially if sitting at Dr appt or on a long boring ride.
B00005JO20|5.0|From the moment that I saw the movie in the theater I knew that I had to add this version to my movie collection.  I truly appreciate the cinematography with the version made in 1976  but with the use of today's technology they were able to recreate this masterpiece.
B00DBQ0AV4|1.0|If the look of desperation on the cover of the CD doesn't warn you, then nothing will. Other than an almost too lovely high Db at the end of the Macbeth Sleepwalking scene, the rest of the singing sounds like labored sight-reading. The voice lurches from one register to another, some of the trumpeted high notes are only approximate in pitch, what passes for coloratura/leggiero singing (e.g. Vespri) is clumsy at best,  and there isn't a characterization to be heard. I don't know who or what convinced Netrebko that she can sing Verdi roles any heavier than Violetta, Nanetta, or perhaps some of the very early lyric roles at this point in her career. This sorry album is more a tribute to Ponselle, Callas, Caballe, Price, etc., who were really qualified to sing this music and portray these characters on stage or in the recording studio with far less effort and far more credibility. This voice and this art form are both in big trouble, based on this recording.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Tlhis is a great book just like the others.  I am sorry there will not be anymore. Suggest you read all three,
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a beautiful book.  I finished it a couple of weeks ago and I'm still thinking about it.  It's too easy to give the plot away by going into detail but I cannot recommend it enough.  Well written, thoughtful and just so good.  I really haven't been able to settle to read anything else because so far, just nothing else compares.  Click on buy now as fast as you can - you won't regret it.
0553584537|2.0|For the first time in a long time, I stopped reading a book right in the middle and deleted it from my Kindle. Agree with the reader who said it was so depressing that everybody has a tortured past. The \\"hero\\" Bobby makes some of the stupidest decisions with a lawsuit pending against him and shows no brains as to how to get out of his funk. But the last straw for me was when, immediately after having discovered a dead body - with it still in the house no less - Catherine makes a sexual play for Bobby and he seriously thinks about it. Jeez - so dumb I stopped right there, no longer even caring how it ends.
0553062182|5.0|Full of great information that explains a lot about how I experience the world.  Clearly written and easy to read.
0767817478|5.0|I mean what additional good comments can I give about the Godzilla remake.  Love this movie, my youngest child enjoys watching it with me.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So many apps out there where they are short on the promise to deliver.  This one delivers with all the functions you need.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John gets several artists to cover some of his old tunes, and HE PLAYS AND SINGS SUPPORT. He doesn't seem to influence the style the covers are presented in, and it makes the whole experience fresh and new. I especially liked Bob Seger on &#34;Who'll Stop the Rain?&#34; You won't regret picking up this album.
140006922X|5.0|There is nothing outrageous or far-fetched in this book.  Tries to understand Jesus through an examination of the historical context of the region and the prevailing culture. Well worth reading.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I also hate the ads in a paid app but the game its very well built and lots of fun. Well worth the dollar.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|I'm not a gamer, not tech-savvy in the least. The games I play are pretty basic, straightforward games.  It's what I like.  Don't interrupt my play, don't keep asking me to buy this or that, don't give me a lot of 'tasks' to complete before the game moves on.  This one is coming off my Kindle.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Enjoyable and diverse but some things could and should come with a little instruction.  Awesome graphics.  I would recommend this game.  Not just for teens and tweens.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love this series and can't wait for Season 3.  I was so happy I could watch it for free with my Amazon Prime accoutn.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I am new to this story as I never had the opportunity to read the book.  I liked the twists and turns the film took as it kept me guessing how it would all end.  Highly recommend it. Leonardo delivers a powerful character and is very believable in his role.
B005ES0YKO|5.0|This is the perfect knock about shoe. It fits great and is fabulously comfortable. Very happy and I highly recommend this shoe if you are in to comfort.
B009Y61ZMI|4.0|This One was over looked summer movie that should have been a classic. good film just watch and see it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I watched this when it aired and then discovered by father had not seen it.  Next year at family gatherings, he'll at least have some idea what we're talking about when references to Tyrion and Joffrey are made.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|this is a good and fun app for people of all ages and i highly would recommend this app !! :)
1609611543|4.0|This is very interesting, it will make you re-think eating bread.  I appreciate that it arrived when I was expecting it - even sooner.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|My kids love this movie. My daughter could watch it over and over and over. I even found it to be be fun too.
B006PAV1XO|4.0|Ever troll the internet for a movie to watch?  Find little to nothing?  Well here is a neat little film to keep you going, especially if you grew up in 80's.  Wasn't expecting much but watched til the end.  Even though the main actors are the ever-arrogant Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, this film works on its own merits - an early teen coming of age movie that has lots of good actors in it and a decent girl meets boy boy loses girl then gets girl story.  No huge explosions or car crashes just a good story and moves along nicely in a nice John Hughes sort of way.  It's hard to find movies these days which are even watchable let alone one that brings you in and you want to watch til the end - this is one of them...
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app is actually a lot of fun I downloaded it for my niece and I play it almost as much as her
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fun read!  Fast, exciting and kept me guessing the whole way through! Took it with me while on vacation and it was the perfect choice.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game keeps me and my brother occupied on so many occasions. It definitely is addicting to play. The app itself is very nice and runs and opens smoothly.
B005544V6A|4.0|Some fun plot twists, nothing too disgusting (murder, sex, drugs, violence), can be clever.  Good all around enjoyable show to watch.  I like to be entertained after a long day so this fits the bill.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I loved this movie and the combo Blu-ray, DVD and digital version is great. I love that you already get the digital version. I loaded it and put it on my ipad for a recent vacation and it was awesome.
B00DB624GS|5.0|FLEETWOOD MAC-THEN PLAY ON (DELUXE EDITION)  For anyone previously unfamiliar with this album, it is long overdue for you to become acquainted with its musical mastery. it is the 3rd and last album Peter Green appeared on, of the band he formed and named after his rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, post their participation in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Green's vision and participation is great, but for me it is the addition of young guitar prodigy Danny Kirwan that really makes the lineup incredible. The mostly absent contributions of guitarist Jeremy Spencer are not much missed as his work led Fleetwood Mac in quite a different direction than the enticing intriguery presented here.<br /><br />\\"Coming Your Way\\" composed by Kirwan gallops open the album, sonically illustrating the gorgeous cover art of Maxwell Armfeld--a delicately-chiselled, wildly naked youth, with airblown flame-red hair, escapes on a dappled grey pony prancing forward through a blazing autumn forest of change, while glancing back over his shoulder on past pursuits (or pursuers; the blues follows behind and who knows what lies ahead).   <br /><br />There are so many obvious references into the mix that make this album so unique. It is not just a rock homage to the blues. It's quite apparent that Green and Kirwan lovingly admired and embraced the work of Santo & Johnny, the creators of the classic melancholy note-bending slide guitar instrumental \\"Sleepwalk\\" that was a big hit in 1959. Also, the surf rock theme of the 1966 movie \\"The Endless Summer\\". There are echoes of the spaghetti western music of Ennio Morricone; the boogie of John Lee Hooker emulated by similar Brit. bands of the era like Ten Years After and Savoy Brown; the mournful vocal style of Skip James; the classical Spanish guitar of Andres Segovia; strains of Japanese koto; bayou taboo and even snakeoil tent revival shows. All in a mixture of melancholy ballads, voodoo, tribal rhythms, blues rock, psychedelia, equine and train rhythms, jungle drums, minor key magic and mystery. The anthemic quality of the hit single \\"Oh Well\\" seems to foreshadow the coming of Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". So, this album is both influenced and influential, and unlike any other Fleetwood Mac before or since. Both the voices and guitars of Green and Kirwan master the art of harmonic pairing and gorgeous sense of melody as well as the balance of masculine and feminine.<br /><br />I must have had about 5 versions of this album, as it's my favorite rock album of all time, despite its being mucked about by various labels and pressings. The latest version is a re-ordering of its original UK vinyl release, plus bonus tracks.  I'm not particularly an audiophile, and there have been many complaints that the previously issued version was poorly mastered. I have avidly listened and adapted each and every time to the sound quality and reordering of tracks including missing tracks, different sequencing, adding of tracks and bonus cuts. This time is no different. I will learn to love it in its new version all over again. No matter how it's diced or tossed, it's a grouping of songs that's so utterly amazing that it's pretty hard to ruin.   I haven't listened to the previous version and this newly remastered version side by side, but while finding this pleasing to the ear, I find nothing in the new remastering that is such a revelation as to knock me on my ass.<br /><br />  One minor complaint I had is the disturbing break-in to the closing of the track \\"Underway\\" with the abrupt opening bars of \\"One Sunny Day\\". It just sounded so unexpectedly intrusive to my ear and I would rather have enjoyed a few seconds fadeout of the first before embracing the second. But, then I read various notes indicating that the original UK version was released this way and the abrupt shift was intentional (an element I didn't recall being that way about five variations and forty years ago). After several listenings, I am already getting used to it.   As to the bonus tracks added onto the end, I think we've all come to expect that \\"Oh Well, Pts. 1 and 2\\" definitely need to be present in the lineup whatever that lineup is, and in this, we aren't disappointed. However, the addition of \\"The Green Manalishi\\" and \\"World in Harmony\\", while a joy to some, would not be my particular choice. I find much of this album more in keeping with the sounds of haunting tracks like \\"Black Magic Woman\\" and \\"Albatross\\", and as such, those are the tracks I'd have added as a bonus, though they would have rankled many, having appeared on earlier albums. I do think their sound is more in keeping with the recording sessions that bore this album than the bonus tracks ultimately chosen. But, one never knows. there may yet be future variations of this amazing classic to resurface.<br /><br />I urge anyone who does not own a copy of this album, to either download it, or run right out and purchase one. I don't think I can recommend any rock album higher.ngs, I am already getting used to it.   As to the bonus tracks added onto the end, I think we've all come to expect that \\"Oh Well, Pts. 1 and 2\\" definitely need to be present in the lineup whatever that lineup is, and in this, we aren't disappointed.

B00AA7O6QC|3.0|As much as I love my OLD action heroes.. It appears there is a time to hang up the guns. Nothing new, old jokes. Now I know why Jet Li didn't do \\"2\\". Would NOT purchase to add to my collection. Time for the old crew to retire!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I never thought I'd have shared thoughts and feelings with someone of the level and background of the author, Reza Asian.  This book is wonderful.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Very realistic and tastefully filmed. Made us all cry . The Brothers will never forget the anguish in there young lives learning whats important in life at such an early age.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I wasn't expecting to finish the movie, just thought I would give it a try.  Ended up enjoying the film.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Loved this SHOW SO Much. Totally Hooked and could Not stop watching. Can't wait to see the Next season<br />waiting impatiently
0446520950|5.0|For only his second thriller, this was a book that was hard to put down. Baldacci's way with details makes you want to &#34;dig deeper&#34; into the story of mayhem and murder and discovery. A must read for anyone who loves &#34;a thriller.&#34;
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Enjoyed the game, got frustrated with the stone door for a while.  I look forward to the next one!  Challenging without hitting the point where you give up.  Hints decent but some missing.
B004GYY714|4.0|This has many stations to choose from. I chose a station that does not have commercials. It's an oldies station that brings me back to the good old days. I would of given it 5 stars but it crashes too often. Maybe it's a glitch that they will fix.<br />Linda in NJ
1407213326|5.0|Love the book, so much more to it than the movie would have you believe! Both are awesome and different enough to be interesting.
B0084AZXKK|1.0|This book was horrible. It was boring and very hard to understand. This is not a good book for a high school because it is just so difficult!
B0053O89XI|5.0|I love this show and can not wait for season six to be released!!!!! I think every character on this show is perfectly cast!
B003OPUZYY|5.0|One of my favorite bands from my early teen years ,.... If  u into them &  don't want to buy all their stuff again , again , May  be a good purchase 4 ya !
B00C2IJJLO|5.0|Have always LOVED this film and am glad to have the DVD at last.<br />It is a superb film from top to basics.<br />All involved are at the top of their form and game,<br />One of those films you can see over and over as it is so very rich in all detail.
B00A6WSTIW|2.0|The movie was kinda ridiculous. Maybe they were trying to match JAWS. Not even close. I guess it's ok if you like &#34;B&#34; movies.<br />Linda in NJ
0345529057|5.0|I can hardly wait for book five. It's like reading about an alternative earth and something new in every chapter.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|The series is wonderful, I was just disappointed that a few of the disks in the set skipped repeatedly (it made the viewing experience frustrating).
B0052AC8C6|4.0|My son loves all the different types of animals in the movie and the mariachi owls crack him up. Great family movie
B006S043TA|4.0|Thought this was a fun and exciting movie!!! Don't know what took me so long to see it, but very glad I did!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this app is the best app in the app world :) you should get this app well if your a girl because a boy wouldnt want to dress princesses up so yeah get this app ( girls )
B001VFTYWI|4.0|I liked The Last Precinct written by Patricia Cornwell. As a  matter of fact I read  it twice by mistake. I had evidently read it the first time it came out and when I saw it listed again I got it. Although parts were really familiar, some I was able to read twice and it was like reading it anew. The character Dr. Kay Scarpetta is a great character. She is many- faceted, with a family of interesting characters and friends.  Her scenes are intense and the sinister characters are chilling. Although I might read it again (hope not as the really familiar scenes will be too much) I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I don't want to forget her detective friend and often pain in the butt, Pete Marino, he could have a book of his own.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I've read a lot of persuasion and communication books. This is the best one I have read for &#34;battle-tested, on-the-firing-line&#34; techniques that anyone can learn and that work really well.  Not a lot of flashy, hocus-pocus stuff.  Simple things that won't call attention to themselves.<br /><br />I say that because a lot of persuasion stuff, while sometimes effective, does not constitute what comes across as &#34;normal&#34; behavior. This defeats the purpose of truly effective persuasion, because it can create suspicion, even distrust. Mr. Deake could not afford to take those kind of risks with the high-wire negotiations he conducted in his professional life as an FBI agent.<br /><br />As an instructor and coach myself, I also appreciate the clear, simple step-by-step way he presents his information, while still keeping the material interesting and even entertaining at times.  Something you would necessarily expect in a book like this!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|It is a good way to kill a lot of time. It is just challenging enough to keep my attention.
B00BEIYH6U|3.0|This film picks up a few years later. Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson )joins a Justice League of misfit crime fighters. Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) has promised to stop crime fighting as she stuffs dollar bills into the swear jar. Our bad guy (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has taken on a name not worth repeating. He has started his own league of criminals.<br /><br />The film is let down. Kick-Ass has taken on the looks and persona of Harold Ramis. The film is filled with awkward swearing, i.e. lines read by people who don't know how to swear. The Justice League of misfits should have been a solid spoof, but instead was written rather lame.<br /><br />The film had potential. It opened with a re-do of my favorite scene from the first film, but since I have seen that film, the element of surprise was missing, making the scene a bust. Hit Girl as Mindy suffers from teen angst as she fails to fit in with the kids in high school.<br /><br />The plot was bad, characters were shallow, and the humor was a yawn. Yet there are aspects of enjoyment to be found in the film.<br /><br />This is aimed at the young adult audience who have to lie about their age to see it.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs, nudity.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown is an example to all. Life is not meant to be easy but if you are determined, positive, and dedicated with a clear goal, one does not have an excuse not to try and try again. I believe that his life is meant to help many in overcoming obstacles big and small and providing an example that no matter how complicated, helpless or remote a goal might seem, with persistence, tenacity and resilience it could be achieved one day. A must read for teenagers as well as parents.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such an amazing series...the books just keep getting better.  I haven't been able to stop.  Best thing I've read since the song of fire and ice boss
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Matthew McConaughey at his best. I really enjoy his acting in a serious movie. Really enjoyed the story in this movie.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Loved this film. After watching it, I immediately reached for me guitar. It's great to see so many musicians come together and make some music. Hard to believe this all came about because of a mixing desk.
B008J34466|5.0|What else do you say. It's pink she rocks. delivered as advertized and in good condition no cracks or scratches
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is awesome to play my kids love it and so do I. thank you and keep up the great work on the app
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|From the lovely opening to the shocking ending, there is never a dull moment at Downinton.  Who would have ever imagined that an upper class British family and their staff could hold even my husband's attention?
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I had a hard time staying focused. There was something missing maybe the author had a personal bias ? I would not recommend it to a friend.
B0097HC8MK|5.0|Awesome movie love movies made in Vegas, cast was great loved the drama. Very well put together all the way to the end.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Play it through over and over again.  Fun way to spend time.  Does not hang you up at any point.
0451232852|5.0|Great
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a very good game. You have to keep playing to get upgrades and playing the old levels again will help you gain coins to get better weapons and armor
0545586178|5.0|Do yourself a favor and buy all three books, the first one was slow in the beginning maybe 180 pages but after that you are hooked to quite a story. The second book had no lulls what so ever. Glad I read the first book before the movie and have seen previews of the second movie  and they can't compete with the book.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|True Reacher form.  I like the author's style so I am not disappointed when I read a book that is very similar to the others, as this one is.  My personal opinion is that the ending is a little weak, but so what.  It is a fun read and the good guy wins...just the way I like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Tons of fun and just love minions!Best of all its free :). For recommended from daughter and now we race. Of course I can't win yet but easy to get hang of!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Looks into all the involved people and you think you know the killer and then they go to somebody else and you think they are the killer.  Everybody is real and everybody has their issues.  Good suspense

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|The songs were great & I and my wife really like the tracks and looking for his next release, great and we hope only the best in health & his song choices,
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I liked it because it was Star Trek... but the end seemed not as triumphant or upbeat as I would have liked for some reason... even though they made it and were setting out on their next adventure... it seemed not as witty as the series or as the first one in terms of dialogue...
B003VANOFY|5.0|Purchased these as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves them, says they work really well, great sound no issues like some of the other reviews. Buttons are easy to use and they do great job of blocking other sounds out. If you don't want to wear them the ear pieces fold flat to lay on the table and act as speakers.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This might be the best book (and movie) ever written. The mini series, in 4 parts, is unsurpassed in story line, acting and total entertainment.<br />It is a western inspired by the actual cattle drive of Charles Goodnight and his being the first rancher to drive 2500 head of cattle from West Texas to  rail-heads in New Mexico, then on to Montana. If you have read the book, you will be surprised if you watch the movie. This is one time a movie, based on a book, will match it in every way. When a producer asked Robert Duvall to act in the sequel, he refused and said: \\"You can't improve upon perfection.\\" I agree.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BJ7V1YC The Nacogdoches Trail]]<br />Author: Robert C.

1935707590|5.0|This book is excellent. I'd imagine that this book is equally good for getting basics for GRE and SAT, and other standardized test with Math. A friend and I completed this book in 10 days, 1 chapter a day, while working full time. Approximate hours to finish 30 hours. Completed every check your skills questions, and practice problem.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* thoroughness<br />* large # of questions<br />* excellent explanations<br />* Kindle version has better formatting than Digital Editions download from MGMAT website<br />* Ability to have two cloud Kindle viewers open and be able to check answers quickly<br />* exercises work well in drilling important concepts<br />* builds confidence (half the battle!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />* occasional errors in Kindle version, the digital editions PDF from MGMAT website had these correct when I compared with a friend (Wrong Answers in Kindle Version: Check Your Skills Q11, Chap 8; Q48, Chap 8)<br />* important information is nested in the answers to practice problems, thus, beware, do all your practice problems, or at least reads the explanations to them!<br /><br />Overall excellent excellent book, definitely read it.

Completely recommend to anyone who suffers from overanalyzing or mental prisons, if you have just moved to a new city, or are in a situation you aren't fond of. Years of issues out the door with this read.
B0030DHPGQ|3.0|Understand the point that the author was making but found the book boring and confusing, however my study group loved it!
B00AHDXTIK|2.0|The cable is nice in the durability and length. The problem is that it isn't fully Apple certified even though it says it is. I have an iPhone 5 and when plugged in it switches from 'charging' to 'not supported'. So while I had high hopes, this was not a great purchase.
0393316041|5.0|Book was incredibly dope. I loved every moment of reading it. Feynman's writing was compelling every page. This is a must read.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|The look and feel of this version is authentically Austen. Everything from the acting to the costumes, pacing to the score was excellent.  I adored Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightly, and I didn't think anyone would match Jeremy Northam's performance, but I would call them equal.  Romola Garai is lovely in the title role; The rest of the cast turned in strong performances.  I don't think it will disappoint, but judge for yourself!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|The only problem I had with the book was it's length, when it ended I was wishing for more LeCarre.

B00EOO55GW|5.0|Get this album now! You won't regret it. These guys are keeping rock and metal alive for the masses. This might just be the album that they are remembered by for all time. I have been following them since their first album and have been there through all the changes. This is as close to a perfect record as they have done so far. No filler here! Just ten solid hits! In the past there may have been a song or two on each album that maybe should have been left as a b side. This is no BS straight up American heavy metal! Best songs are \\"Planets\\" \\"Acid Rain\\" and \\"Shepherd Of Fire\\"
B001BR3P0S|5.0|You have to see it! It is a classic and part of the American culture from the 80's. Love it!

B00D9PUXQY|2.0|I've Been A Fan Of Devildriver Since Their Self Titled Album And I Really Like Their Style. Fury Of Makers Hand, Last Kind Words And The Very Brutal Pray For Villains Were All Good But This One.....Eh Not So Great. The Only 2 songs That Are Memorable In My Opinion Are 'Sail' The Awolnation Cover Which Is Amazing! And The Bonus Track Shudder. The Dvd Is Really The Best Part Of This Purchase Honestly. Pick It Up You May Like It But I Wouldn't Say It's Something That Will Really Live A Mark. Im Giving It 2 Stars :(

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|wow, i didn't even expected to like that book, but it was on my list from the best of a year, so i picked it, boy was i impressed, i couldn't put it down. One of the best books i read.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Saw this in theatres with my dad we both liked it! What makes this horror film good & different is the fact that its set back in 1971 & its based on a true story (It shows real photos at the end of the family this story happened to) the film is scary & has a 70's style to it with the music & clothing! My dad even liked it & hes not really a movie person! The acting was good & we had a fun time going to see it! Excited to find out the release date for the home media!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Loved this game as a child and I still love it as an adult! Me and my daughter enjoy playing it
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Didn't care for story line. Special effects were nothing special. would not recommend. glad i had this as a promotion and didnt pay out of pocket.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|I was inclined to buy it because I just wanted to have it. However, I am not sure if I will buy another Kanye Album. To me 10 tracks on a album is not enough.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Great item! Just like the picture and matches the description fine. It was of good quality. I would buy one again.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fantastic album!  My whole family enjoys and along with my friends.  Very inspiring and I would definitely recommend looking at the music video!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|this is a great show. very entertaining and really pushes you to your mental limits. i wish i woud have started watching this show years ago
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Entertaining movie. Lots of action, plot is thin but this is a movie about action characters. Move along quickly, rarely get bored and the action is not totally unbelievable. Good entertainment for an evening.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|oh my goodness! I love this game! I don't download very many active games, I usually stick to puzzle, number, and word games. I thought I'd try something different with the minion rush game and I became addicted pretty fast. Very enjoyable and also very time consuming.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Every track on this album is great and even if they were not. 'Crooked Smile' is an anthem tune! My favorite track is 'Born Sinner'.
0345529057|5.0|Great item! Just like the picture and matches the description fine. It was of good quality. I would buy one again.
B00E1L9N8E|1.0|This is the most over-rated film I have ever watched.  The price $14.99 was extremely high and out of line for a poor movie!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|There are a lot of characters with unusual names however, if you like period pieces, this book is great.  Love it.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Plot and conclusion is a little hard to believe. Some scenes a bit too gory. Main characters a bit stoic and single minded. But for an evening entertainment a good action movie to watch. The bad characters in this are really bad, and the good guys not a whole lot better. But it's fiction.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|It is a pleasure to read a Nelson DeMille book.  Almost like having a meal at a favorite restaurant.  The enjoyment in the spin of the tale, the characters involved made for a fun adventure while on a cruise ship in Alaska this summer.<br /><br />Thanks Nelson for another good adventure story.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|The game is so much fun. I can't stop playing it. Thanks for coming up with the ideal games says
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Great item! Just like the picture and matches the description fine. It was of good quality. I would buy one again.
B00637D114|1.0|Only anger and disgust can come from watching this film. Everything from the script to the &#34;acting&#34; and animation is shockingly bereft of any merit. I am very sorry I purchased it.
B00486UF52|5.0|This book is written by an anthropologist, and it is a treasure-trove of information, but it is never dry or boring.  I was actually sad when I finished reading it, I enjoyed so much!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I use a Nook for reading but was traveling with my new Samsung Galaxy S 4 phone and decided to try reading a book on it. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to see the pages on a small screen.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Reminds me of that excellent mini-series, The Top of the Lake.  Very good acting, believable characters with really intriguing issues.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|When will the developers update the app here? There have been two updates on play store! I guess i will have to wait.
0761169431|5.0|Great item! Just like the picture and matches the description fine. It was of good quality. I would buy one again.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|If you like metal, this is for you!  Heavy and melodic, a great effort that belongs in your collection!  Buy it yesterday!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|If you've never heard of or watched this show, you need to.  Amazing acting and writing, and the story keeps you hooked through all of the episodes.  Can't wait for Season 2!
B002TXZRNQ|4.0|This is the first book that I have read from start to end in a day in such long time. It has such a simple and powerful message: accept death so you can embrace life. The recollection of life lessons and spirit growth are touching, told in such plain word, so easy to read and understand that you just can stop reading andnlearning. This was indeed one of the best teachers I have known so far.
1936891026|5.0|It came just as expected and on a timely basis. Also, good book as inspiration for any artist. Just get it
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn are American literary icons, and this story of their first big adventure is a joy to read. Everyone should read this, and Huck Finn' s adventures too.
0770437400|5.0|Great item! Just like the picture and matches the description fine. It was of good quality. I would buy one again.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Used in repair of laptop processor fan. I  have used this product in past for other processor repairs. Easy to use
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I had to load the game on my kindle in order to play because my husband won't give me my IPad back
1574214276|3.0|Nice to have all the individual books of hers and others in one place.  Nice to have them combined into one.
1616550414|5.0|It's really great. If you're a fan it'll make you squeal like a little girl. If you're not a fan, you'll see all the work built into it.
B00DY951RQ|1.0|Ok i was one of the few people that liked self portrait  the first time around<br />The only unreleased track on this worth hearing is pretty Saro unless you want a load of the same tracks without overdubs<br />if you are purchasing this for remastered self portrait it will be released in the fall in the dylan box set<br />want to know how sloppy this is the back of the box says self portrait was released in 1969 the book inside says 1970 ??<br />It is also titled 69-1970 how when one track is from 1967<br />Maybe this box gives people a reason to actually say they like self portrait now who did not in the beginning
1616550414|5.0|Great item! Just like the picture and matches the description fine. It was of good quality. I would buy one again.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I love the season one the drama is awesome with suspense and action that keep you on your seat an you be looking the next move
B001GCUER0|5.0|We are enjoying the series very much, and our DVD's have been in great condition. Thank you!<br /><br />We are now awaiting season 6!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Fun to play but I really did not have the time to play this. I am not sure if it was the size of the game or the play itself but it didn't leave a lasting mark.
B004US4K2C|3.0|Once I donwloaded it and saw what it did I realized I already had something like this. But if you don't have a launcher program this is a good one.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|A beautiful album from start to finish. Music fans of any genre will enjoy this album. Highly recommended for anyone interested in good music!
1569242739|5.0|I love Isa Chandra Moscowitz's cookbooks.  Her awesomely unique personality shines through the books.  This book not only has great recipes and beautiful photos, but also helpful hints and tips.  I have really enjoyed making some of the more &#34;exotic&#34; flavored cupcakes, including chai cupcakes, green tea cupcakes, and cappuccino cupcakes.  One of my favorites recipes for Fall is the pumpkin chocolate chip cupcake with cinnamon frosting.  I also love the strawberry tall cakes in the summer.  I blame this book for helping me gain 20 lbs after I started making cupcakes every week.  I've slowed down on the cupcake baking, and now when I bake I bring a batch to work or to church so I'm not eating most of them myself!  People who aren't vegan don't even notice the lack of animal ingredients.  The cupcakes are simply delicious.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I love the season one the drama is awesome with suspense and action that keep you on your seat waiting for the next move
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I'm normally not a big Tom Cruise fan, he's a good actor but I think most of his movies are look at Tom Cruise. While this one has that element, it works. The movie is really engaging and the visual effects are stunning.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Bought jinafire several weeks ago as it was hard to find it in stores.  Found this one hard to find as well ad decided amazon would be a great place to purchase it again.<br /><br />My daughter loves it NF has been playing with it for 4 straight days now.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|I had to buy it because once I heard it I couldn't get it out of my head! You can sing the whole song with just the six words in the chorus. It's no B double O T Y but it's close.
1416972250|4.0|Purchased book because the series has been fun to read! :)  I'm hoping my niece will read it afterwards but ya never know. Happy w purchase and looking forward to reading the nect book.
B008PZZUTS|5.0|What a great Deniro movie  suspense and great turns and twist-- Loved it!!  Hold on to your shorts it will keep you on the edge!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love this game, but u have to practice jumps &amp; rolls bc its not as easy as it sounds, especially w/ quick moving objects, etc., so practice!!  Also, it takes WAY too long to collect the GruTokens, which is very frustrating.  I'm sure I'm not the only one, but no matter how many times I try, I can't get more than 2-4 seconds in to Vector Battle, only to get squashed!  Provide a few less Vector Robots at the start of that section!!?  It makes it funner to get farther, as opposed to dying constantly, for those of us not savvy in gaming!
B004HMQ7AE|4.0|hadn't watched this in years, was as good this time as it was first time I watched it. good movie.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I watch this show, no matter how many times I have seen the episodes, I love all the ones with Ziva in them.
B008Y6TXDC|5.0|Even though the story line is not  overwhelmingly  different,  the characters and the setting  are  great and really bring you into the story.  The highlight, of course,  is the music and singing talent and the way the are blended into the story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very excellent weather app. Compared to the weather channel app which is now bogged down with advertisements and had a horribly unfortunate design update, accuweather has a clean design and is easy to use.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Fun game,very challenging the further you go into it.If you like a challenge,you will love this game.Play it now, and get with the challenge
B004XN3FHA|2.0|I had to return this flashlight 2 times and the 3rd light started having issues. The LED on the first one was way off center, the second one was having issues almost right away with the power switch not working properly. If it wouldn't just turn on, it would turn on and off once real quickly or it would go into strobe mode. I finally replaced this light after a year and a half with a Nitecore EA8 which is a superior light in my opinion for less money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wish there were more trains to dodge but this game is awesome can stop playing!!!! wish chacters were more cheaper. but great game
B000IXUOP0|5.0|I could watch each episode over and over again, no matter how many times I have seen them, I will watch them anyway.
B00509OFE8|5.0|Stargate Universe was a very good show!  I am sorry it was cancelled after only 2 seasons, as there seems to be endless possibilities for this ship and crew.  I would have liked to see how relationships developed, if Col Telford ever got back to Destiny and ultimately what the transmission was.  Since the crew is in stasis for 3 years and the series ended in 2011, perhaps next year SyFy will pick it up again??  That would be nice.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a great game, but on World 3 - 1, when I spawn I fall through the level and die, and I can't do anything about it. =/
B004KKX80A|4.0|It does its job<br />Kids say its perfect and in good condition.<br />Kids love it and they recommend it to everyone.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This movie is a great classic for a family movie night. Has some adventure with some comedy and drama all wrapped into one.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book shows behind essences about what really means for someone to become successful. Reinforcing that by no means successful people come out the blue, neither they fit the typical stereotype where they must come from rich or smart families.
B008602KQI|5.0|Fresh and inspiring, very enjoyable! Get away for awhile easily. Very good acting, loved the plot, and characters. Waiting on the next one with anticipation.
B00402FGEE|5.0|A great series, right up there with Star Trek, and the NEW Battlestar Galactica. A must see for sci-fi fans.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|the big bang theory is super funny. it is a great investment and i am happy we added it to our collection
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|The CD is Phil at his growling finest with an awesome supporting cast. Wish the supporting tour would have come through California.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|In a word.. Snooze! No substance, I had expected more from Mr Affleck. Save yourself a buck and bypass this flick!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|excellent
B00338QENI|5.0|Quite an eye-opening read! Amazing and highly recommended!<br />Her contributions to science has been immense. Would love to know if her family received anything.
B0001GNJQ0|1.0|This DVD sucked I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and it didn't even work for the DVD player or the Xbox 360
B001FB4VXU|5.0|the big bang theory is super funny. it is a great investment and i am happy we added it to our collection
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This has an ok story line but was VERY slow in getting to it!  I liked the idea of a love story/zombie flick, but I'll admit this one came up a bit short of my expectations.
1439153663|5.0|This book is why I love to read.  I actually learned what life was like as slave through reading this. The author used a very creative perspective to get to the point.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|So the 2009 blu ray version is criminally expensive. With being the only movie with the audio option of 192 kh sound at 24 bits, it sounds amazing... in Japanese.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Looks and fits real good.....if you are looking for bling don't buy this, but if you're looking for protection, this is simple, plane and does protect your phone from a drop on concret.
B00846REIS|4.0|Ms. Day writes believably about passion and emotional pain. Her characters involve you in their struggles. I'm anxious to read the next book for more of Eva and Gideon's story, and to see what's up with Cary!
0385523394|5.0|It´s funny and it´s serious. Piper is a lovely person, and a beautifull woman, by all means.I really love it.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Great action flick... decent story line! The visuals in this movie were fantastic.  I loved the new twist on the old childrens story!
B008LFY6NI|1.0|Can't erase so what good is it,thought the granddaughter would enjoy but she is not interested in it after a moment
1455883115|5.0|How startling to hear this information! I feel at times as though the world is &#34;going to hell&#34; & was surprised to hear Pinker's facts.  Is there hope that the people of the world can do even better over time?  The title &#34;better angels...&#34; was a bit too religious for me, however, the info is realistic & hopeful.  I was amazed by the thorough facts & research. I want to listen to this again because it is so thorough! Thanks - Steven
B007SGM084|5.0|The first chapter alone is captivating. I didn't want to put it down at all. Definitely a must read, which I will do again.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Very interesting perspective on how everyone is a salesperson.  I like the analysis of old school vs new school. -BM
0440237688|5.0|The first time I read The Giver I was in middle school and it was required, but unlike the majority of the books we were assigned to read, this one drew me right in. It left such an impression on me that I went out and bought my own copy in college. For all of those who loved the Hunger Games series, and haven't yet read this classic, you will love The Giver.
B00B22MJSG|4.0|Grat sound and lyrics. If you like Fleetwood Mac, this is a good buy for you or as a gift.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!!! Just finished rereading it before the movie comes out, hope Hollywood doesn't screw it up! Now onto Mockingjay :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. So much fun. Can't wait to play it forever. Get it now! Best game ever
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this particular author. My brother recommend it after a conversation about cool but bizarre books. This book definitely has crazy, cool and bizarre traits. The book feels like it is written by a person with severe ADD since it has many different stories that will randomly stop and randomly be brought up again but somehow makes sense. Even though this sounds like it would be confusing to a reader, it miraculously pulls together to form a very intriguing read. If you are looking for an interesting book but lack the time to sit down and read for awhile (kids, work or a spouse who likes to interrupt your reading time to &#34;help&#34; with things that must be done now for whatever reason) this book is for you.  If I had the time, I would have liked to have read it in bigger sections. Either way, a very interesting, intriguing and highly recommended book. How often do you get to read a book written from a crazy person's point of view? WORTH CHECKING OUT.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I usually don't read novels, but I love Khaled Hosseini.  His books are very emotional and makes you fell like you are part of the story.
B00C4QXHP8|5.0|This movie I found to be very entertaining and I adore all the actors. The bonus is the story is based on actual events. I highly recommend seeing this one
B00821OX98|4.0|I think that this is a good show and I am looking forward to the future episodes.  I cannot wait to seem more as I have time.
B00002ND77|5.0|The zoot suit,couched hair and the walk was so real. The situations that existed in Malcolms day seem to exist today. This movie should have people thinking of what to do for our youth.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Nothing riveting but for a movie I waited for on DVD, it was pretty much what I expected. Would have liked to see more money put into the overall production of the film instead of the &#34;slow mo&#34; vision whenever people would shoot up.<br /><br />Could have been much better with a little more focus on character development. But not unwatchable.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The two principle characters came alive, and the wars they participated in were so much more understandable when told through the small details of their individual experiences.  This book is simply great.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|I ordered this dvd for my toddler son and it was delivered within 2 weeks and in great condition! There was a plastic seal to protect the dvd and the movie itself is in perfect conditon! he watches it almost daily! i will surely be ordering another soon!
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|This is my favorite album by either Derek Trucks or Susan Tedeschi. Derek's slide playing is reminiscent of Duane Allman and Susan's singing makes me think of a cross between Adele and Janice Joplin. Maybe not as raspy, but just as soulful! The band is in the same league as Dave Matthews' band. All of them are consummate musicians. Even though they remind me of great musicians of the past, this pair create the best new rock I am aware of. If anyone hears of someone else as good as this, let me know!!!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Interesting read. I will take some of the suggestions & put them to practical use.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the art of conversation.
B009UNH0EM|4.0|I honestly feel like the plantronic headset is the best Bluetooth on the market, the cable holds onto the headset via magnets, so there is little concern for wear and tear where the charger connects. I would still own the original if I hadn't left it in my last truck.<br />I ordered the product a while ago, still haven't received it. I know it's ups's responsibility, but since it's a very affordable part, didn't really complain
B00003CXTG|5.0|The Pearl Harbor DVD was all that I expected it would be. Fantastic! You really see what everyone went through and the devastation that took place.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Like the whole album but the best song on it is not being played here in the US. I'm talking about &#34;Dance your pain Away&#34; too bad. That song has such potential.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|THE TAG LINE for Season Three of AMC's megahit, \\"The Walking Dead,\\" is \\"Fight the dead; Fear the living.\\" No joke. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) leads his extended family to safety within the walls of a federal prison, clearing the grounds and buildings of zombies, only to face a deadlier menace from humans who are only a few miles away.<br /><br />The others, living in the well-fortified town of Woodbury, aren't so much the problem as their leader, a manipulative sociopath, who calls himself The Governor. Played in a brilliant, tour de force performance by David Morrissey, he defines the word \\"diabolical.\\"<br /><br />And we all thought Merle Dixon, Daryl's (Norman Reedus) older brother from Season One, was a bad guy. Turns out Merle, played with redneck panache by Michael Rooker, is working for The Governor. It also turns out that, while Merle seems pretty much the misogynistic bigot he always was, he has become much more violent since meeting Woodbury's boss. Body counts among zombies and humans continue to rise while the brothers Dixon share a tragic story arc. Sad to say, we also lose some characters we've known since Season One.<br /><br />Still, each of the favorites - including new characters - get their moment to shine in these 16 episodes. The high-definition five-disc Blu-ray is the way to go, too. Scenes take on feature-film quality; color is rich and detail outstanding. I've seen these episodes at least three to four times on high-def TV. Now, there is so much new detail onscreen, I wondered if the broadcast material had been extended. It hasn't; it just looks that fresh.<br /><br />The sound, too, is exceptional. A Dolby TrueHD 7.1 immersive soundtrack carries dialogue, gunfire, effects and ambient sound throughout all speakers. I'm from the south and I've never heard cicadas sound so menacing.<br /><br />Extras include commentaries on Episodes 4, 5, 8, 9 and 15, with directors, producers and staff. Newcomer Danai Gurira, who takes on katana-wielding warrior, Michonne, is on three of them. Mastermind and executive producer Robert Kirkland also appears on \\"Made to Suffer.\\"<br /><br />There are six good deleted scenes, the best from \\"I Ain't No Judas\\" with Carol (Melissa McBride) and Merle. It's been making the rounds on Facebook, so you may have already seen it. The scene from \\"Clear\\" with Rick and Morgan Jones (Lennie James, \\"Low Winter Sun\\") from Season One is also a standout.<br /><br />Which begs the question: Why hasn't \\"The Walking Dead\\" received any Emmy nominations outside of Best Prosthetic Makeup, Visual Effects and Sound? AMC has become the HBO of basic cable with shows such as \\"Mad Men\\" and \\"Breaking Bad.\\" James should have received a nod for Best Guest Actor in a Drama. Several cast members, writers and directors should have earned Emmy recognition. Lincoln put heart and soul into a Shakespearean-like mad scene this season that played through several episodes. How about \\"The Walking Dead\\" as Best Drama, ok? The show isn't about zombies; it's about survivors. Metaphorically, it's about people who battle through the worst of times.<br /><br />Additional extras include eight short featurettes. \\"Rising Son\\" tracks the growth of young Chandler Riggs in his role of Carl Grimes, or what's it like to grow up during the Zombie Apocalypse. Riggs packs power and pathos into the role with astonishing maturity.<br /><br />\\"Gone, But Not Forgotten,\\" salutes a character lost during Season Three; \\"Evil Eye,\\" examines The Governor, showing how the character evolved from Kirkman's comic book to screen and Morrissey's take on him; \\"Heart of a Warrior\\" focuses on Michonne and actress Danai Gurira, who brings her to life, while \\"Michonne vs. The Governor,\\" explores that relationship, and \\"Safety Behind Bars\\" highlights the biggest set of Season Three. \\"Making the Dead\\" and \\"Guts and Glory\\" provides a short demonstration of makeup and effects.<br /><br />Give \\"The Walking Dead\\" a chance, if your taste runs to suspense, chilly thrills, and realistic characters to love and hate.<br />Season Four premiers at 9 p.m. Oct. 13 on AMC.
B000V67588|5.0|Breakfast In America and Even in the Quietest Moments round out the other two. There isn't a bad song on here and the remastering was very well done. It turned a brilliant album into a stunning masterpiece! It may be old in age, but not in popularity. The two big hits are &#34;Dreamer&#34; and &#34;Bloody Well Right&#34; and I still hear them played quite frequently today.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the book first and it was nice to finaly see the movvie to put everything together.  I really enjoyed both
031236198X|4.0|Book is easy to read and clearly demonstrates management in a group setting.  Worth reading in all levels of management.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|One of the best &#34;feel good&#34; movies ever! Matthew Broderick is at his best and could watch it every few months.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|The only complain I have is the sleeves holding cd's are just a bit too small. Kind a hard to pull them out. Otherwise it is a nice set.
1419707663|5.0|I'm trying to put a couple of sets in my daughter's third grade, The kids devour the Wimpy Kid books!  Even reluctant readers love these books. I taught school for 28 years, and I have never seen such enthusiasm for any other series of books.
B008I34Y6W|4.0|What are the other nine? I dunno, but this is certainly on my short list! The playing is top notch, The lineup is classic Zappa: FZ, Napolean Murphy Brock, George Duke, Ruth Underwood, Chester Thompson and Tom Fowler. How can you go wrong with those guys? Highlights: both versions of Sofa, Florentine Pogen.and Inca Roads.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've stopped using my older Kindle and using my Galaxy S4 for my Kindle reading. Well worth the free app if you have a Kindle account. It's great!
B00A3AU9KI|5.0|I wasn't sure if this would fit my iPhone 5 but it did.  It works great. The packaging was also fast and clean.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|Endlessly repeating the same things. I did not finish the book. I will most probibly never bother to read any of his books in future.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This makes a little more sense than something like &#34;Revolution. At least we have some logical explanation for the lights going out. Aliens!! And you just have to love it when there is no resolution in sight. Those skitters, critters, whatever, want us out of the way. Something else that makes sense for a good old fashioned all out war.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Got hooked on it that I forgot to go to sleep. It makes you think! Your brain at work and fun. Great graphics and puzzles. Look forward to another game from these companies. Well worth of my time and cost of my sleep!!!!!!!
B001F7MSG6|5.0|What can I say; huge wisecracking Demon as the hero,  who fights monsters from hell.  Amphibious,  brainy sidekick and a love story for the ladies.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I liked this game. The puzzles make you think and the hidden objects are well hidden.  Clues are replenish quickly. Great game.
B004SIP88Y|4.0|I have to admit this movie is beautiful, the people...the scenery was stunning. The story was interesting , so where do I find fault? Well it was just not realistic with the fighting, too much of it instead  of  enriching the characters. Such interesting characters I think if it took three movie about each one of them that would have been a sequel worth seeing.<br />It left you wanting more substance.  It still is a must have for beauty alone, but like most beautiful things with out<br />development one viewing is enough.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Great music!  ELO play timeless music...even appeals to the younger generation of today.  I would recommend the music of ELO to everyone.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Fascinating, but believable!!!  I loved the surprise ending, I would recommend it to other  Harlan Coven fans...just keep up with the different characters.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I thought it was slow at times and repetitive.  Also I thought there was going to be a new slant on the plot to kill the president.  I am not fond of the here and after style of writing..

B00005JPSM|3.0|not as good  as  I  thought  it would be.  it was  ok.  I haven't  watch it  a second time,sorry,  I think I know why I hadn't  reviewed the movies before.  how can  you decide how many words I  use......
B004T6IBNY|5.0|GREAT and interesting game! Fun to play! Was thinking that I'd just play for a few minutes, but three hours later I was jsut saying to myself...OK I\\"m quitting after one more game! Truly addicting and fun! Lots of options to play, I like the Wild West!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Asphalt 8 is one of the best racing games on the amazon appstore (I say one of the because real racing 3 exists). The graphics are great and It is a lot of fun. Some people said it wouldn't open, if that happens just delete It and download it again.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was skeptical upon first watching the show as to whether or not I would like it as the first episode was pretty gruesome but I stuck with it and it definitely grew on me.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|I'm happy STAR TREK, TNG, SERIES are coming out in blu ray. Picture is so fantastic and realistic. They are very popular in my family.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Oblivion is a recycled story with some updated special effects.  Not Tom Cruise's best, but not his worst.  A much better Tom Cruise movie is Jack Reacher.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I enjoyed all of the booksbut this was somewhat disappointing. The plot was ok at best and the ending was a let down.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|For a free clock, it does a lot-- the screen is beautiful, it has a sleep timer with white noise (if you choose!), and the choices for wake holistic are pleasant and crisp. I will say that if you want more than three alarms, you should buy the full version, which also comes with the option of waking up to your own music. Definitely worth it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|i didn't want to put this book down.  it was like a train wreck from which i couldn't look away.  i needed to talk about the ending with others who had read it.
B001OSIV62|5.0|I watched this after I read &#34;Let the Great World Spin.&#34; Very informative on a number of levels! Amazing footage of long before Petit's walk.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm 86 yrs. old.  The only fault with this yarn is (like so many of the otherwise excellent reads) the over worked use of the f--- word.<br />Ordinary folks don't talk this way.  Otherwise it was a very clever and imaginative plot; well written.  Five stars with the overuse of the unnecessary swear words eliminated.
B00821OX98|5.0|Best science fiction TV since Firefly and Battlestar Gallactica. The story arc is well planned with character evolution and unexpected twists and turns. The plot themes are evocative of Octavia Butler - though the content is dark at times there is surprising humanity in spite of it all. As the central characters become more beloved by the third season, some self indulgence creeps in but all in all, very impressed. This is the kind of complex, character driven sci fy series I have long awaited.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app that is the right amount of challenge and relaxing to play. If you enjoy solitaire you'll likely enjoy this version.

B009GED3HS|5.0|Great, great, great!!!!  More of the same crazy laughs generated by these crazy, loveable (even Barney) personalities. So great to simply buy it and watch it and not try to figure out all the scammed &#34;free&#34; viewings.

1455526959|4.0|20 years after Anneke Jespersen was murdered in an alley during the infamous riots in Los Angeles, Harry Bosch, who is working in the open unsolved unit at LAPD, gets a chance to gather evidence and make an attempt to finally solve her murder.  Michael Connelly's book, The Black Box, is number 16th in the Harry Bosch series.  The novel revisits the crime scene, then follows Harry while he pieces together everything that he is able to learn and find regarding the case.  One key piece of evidence that he finds is a bullet casing, ignored during the initial investigation, which leads him to several suspects.  Of course, Harry, who is on the verge of retirement (he is working for five more years due to the DROP - deferred retirement option plan at LAPD and could be fired at any time), is a nonconformist, who shuns modern technology and solves his cases the old fashioned way, with hard work and perseverance.  In this novel, he's in trouble with either his bosses or someone at the top of the food chain, and he works much of this case on his own time under the radar.  Harry's philosophy has always been to stand up for the victim, since he believes every victim matters, so this murder from 1999 has been on his mind for years and he is determined to find the perpetrator.<br /><br />Connelly is in true form in The Black Box, and the book will not disappoint Harry Bosch fans.  Bosch is a unique and amiable character and throughout the series, has almost become a real-life hero who not only battles killers, but also inward demons that come up in his life.  Readers can definitely relate, and those unfamiliar would benefit from reading the series starting with the first.  Connelly, however, writes his novels, The Black Box included, so that they are enjoyable as stand-alone books; they move fast, contain plenty of action, and by the time the novel has ended, leave the reader yearning for more.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.solicited by the author or publisher.

0515153656|4.0|Bestselling British author, Lee Child, introduces Jack Reacher in his novel,  Killing Floor.  In addition, he includes a comprehensive introduction with background and information on this beloved main character.<br /><br />The story begins when Reacher, an unemployed ex-military policeman, who is sort of a drifter, is eating a late breakfast in a diner in Margrave, Georgia, a small southern town outside of Atlanta.  He has just gotten off the bus and walked from the edge of town to the diner, and is arrested for a murder that was committed the evening before, even though Reacher hadn't arrived until 8:00 am that morning.  Reacher knows he didn't kill anyone, but convincing what he finds is a corrupt small-town police department, is not easy.  He is put in the prison across town to be held over the weekend, along with a well-known affluent citizen of the town, Paul Hubble, who was questioned because his phone number was found in the shoe of one of the murder victims (there are two), and has panicked and confessed to murder.  The two are put on the wrong floor in the prison, and they are attacked by a group of violent inmates where Reacher saves them both.<br /><br />Once Reacher convinces the police he couldn't be the murderer, he learns that the identity of one of the bodies just happens to be his older brother, Joe; he hasn't seen him for seven years, and hasn't been close to him in much longer.  Because he senses things are not as they appear in this town, and he knows that the police are inexperienced in actually solving crimes, since there have been no murders in over 30 years, he becomes involved in the investigation, and stays in town.  The investigation leads to evidence of corruption among the town's leaders, businessmen, and law enforcement; Jack's brother had apparently come to the town to investigate the corruption, and during the course of the novel, there are several additional violent murders.  Reacher also murders several persons, in self defense, of course.<br /><br />Child's writing style is easy to follow, and this particular book is told in first person, through the eyes of Reacher.  It is a page turner, and isn't easily put down.  In fact, thriller fans will most likely become hooked on Jack Reacher and will want to read all of the subsequent books; this is the one to start with, though, to get the background on him.<br /><br />One negative on this book, however, is the fact that there is quite a bit of graphic violence - murders, fights, etc., and that violence is described in detail.  Thriller readers who shy away from violence in novels would be wise to skip this series and stick to authors that are a little less descriptive and leave more to the readers' imagination.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.course.<br /><br />Child's writing style is easy to follow, and this particular book is told in first person, through the eyes of Reacher.

B001FVV2X2|4.0|One of the interesting things about the X-files was the idea that &#34;the truth is out there.&#34; The characters handled weird events in the episode, but were always aware of something bigger going on.  Fringe is similar, albeit a bit more graphic at times. There is a &#34;pattern&#34; that the Scully-ish Olivia seeks to find while the Muldar-ish Walter & Son deal with the day-to-day paranormal experiences.<br /><br />I can see why it was popular to the sci-fi and conspiracy fans.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|this hd dvd was a good action movie it fit rt in to the great dredd story line you will be happy with your purchase
B008PZYZH6|4.0|I like this movie and like the cast.  For those annoyed with the casting choices relative to the books, life is hard, get over it.  I understand loyal fans want to see their daydreams on the big screen, but it's not often realistic in the Hollywood action movie making paradigm.  Of course, it is unrealistic, and outrageous at times, but the visuals are fun, the tone is lighthearted, and I would go to another Dirk Pitt movie in a heartbeat.

B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch Rapp is sent to Afghanistan to find CIA operative Joe Rickman, who has been kidnapped; his bodyguards have been found shot to death, and the safe, which contained millions of dollars, has been emptied.  Rickman, who has been the CIA's head of Clandestine Operations in Afghanistan, knows enough US secrets to cause major havoc, and it is crucial for Rapp to find him before he is tortured and forced to reveal those secrets.  Rapp's old friend Rickman has been involved with several ruthless and corrupt characters in Afghanistan while carrying out orders connected to a  controversial \\"reintegration program,\\" the brainchild of Ariana Vinter (\\"She's from State...Apparently she's a real ball buster...very connected and she's not afraid to chew ass.\\") which is proving to be a very bad move for the US.  Anyone who knows Mitch Rapp also knows that he won't put up with anyone with an attitude like Vinter's, so early on there is conflict with her.  Rapp is on edge for personal reasons, too, since he's just learned that his friend and mentor, Stan Hurley, has terminal cancer, and less than six months to live.<br /><br />While working on the case, there is an ambush and Rapp is injured critically.  During his recovery he has major memory loss and it is apparent that he isn't up to his usual super-hero strength.  Irene Kennedy, is devastated, and is trying to use her other men to pick up the slack, but is finding out that everyone isn't as loyal as she expects.  One operative, Mike Nash, who has been on Rapp's team for over five years, isn't willing to help.  To make matters worse, Louie Gould, the assassin who killed Rapp's wife, is involved in the ambush (they are trying to kill him too), and to save himself, sides with Rapp's team and even though he isn't to be trusted, works to help save them all.  Of course there are internal conflicts as well, especially with Joel Wilson, the FBI's deputy director of Counterintelligence and an arrogant narcissist, who is convinced he is the only loyal American out there, and also that \\"his job was the most difficult and demanding at the Bureau.\\"  Wilson is working hard to discredit Rapp, accusing him of stealing US funds along with Rickman; he has proof from Senator Ferris, and takes it upon himself to go to Afghanistan to nail Rapp and Rickman.<br /><br />A few minor negatives about the book:  When Irene Kennedy gives Mike Nash an assignment, he drops the ball and sidesteps the issue, forcing Kennedy to assign Scott Coleman instead.  It appears there are no consequences for Nash; is it an oversight on the part of the author, or will it be addressed in a later novel?  Also the issues connected with Ariana Vinter are not dealt with later in the novel; it seems she just disappears and is never heard about again.  Nor is there a final outcome on Joel Wilson; a reader can assume, but it's lots more fun when the bad guys are cut down and put in their proper places.<br /><br />In spite of the few inconsistencies, this Mitch Rapp novel contains all the danger, mystery, and suspense that is expected; Mitch Rapp has close calls, attempts on his life, and bad-mouths some of the most unlikeable characters as only Mitch Rapp can do.  As usual, there is a corrupt politician (imagine that!) who is working with a narcissistic jerk, several unscrupulous characters on the take, and a totally unexpected ending.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.the only loyal American out there, and also that \\"his job was the most difficult and demanding at the Bureau.\\"  Wilson is working hard to discredit Rapp, accusing him of stealing US funds along with Rickman; he has proof from Senator Ferris, and takes it upon himself to go to Afghanistan to nail Rapp and Rickman.<br /><br />A few minor negatives about the book:  When Irene Kennedy gives Mike Nash an assignment, he drops the ball and sidesteps the issue, forcing Kennedy to assign Scott Coleman instead.

0061134007|4.0|Jo Nesbø is one of Europe's most successful thriller writers today, and sales of his books rival that of the top American thriller authors.  His character, Harry Hole, is not a likely candidate for hero:  he's a sloppy, chain-smoking, alcoholic loner who looks years older than he is, and drives a rattletrap car that only starts when on a hill;  in The Redbreast (which won the Glass Key Award for Best Nordic Crime Novel), it's clear that he's a very skilled detective, but is in trouble in his department and is danger of losing his job.  This book is a police procedural thriller that vacillates from characters who were young Norwegian citizens fighting for Hitler and/or the resistance during World War II, to the year 2000 when the characters are in their late seventies and are being murdered by someone who fought with them during the war.<br /><br />Because Hole shot a CIA agent (who was in the wrong place during a security watch during a visit by the American President and was mistaken for a sniper due to lack of communication on the part of the CIA), Hole is transferred to a different department to avoid any further embarrassment to the Norwegian Police Department until his faux pas blows over.  Hole is ordered to attend a work social to get to know others in the new department, and while he is attending and his phone is turned off, his partner, friend, and mentor, Ellen, discovers information which will solve the murders.  While she is trying to reach him, however, she is brutally murdered; Hole is devastated and works to solve her murder while at the same time investigates neo-Nazis - his assignment in the new office - and also attempts to solve the murders that are being committed.<br /><br />The novel is very European, which makes it a nice change from the thrillers by American authors, but it also makes it a little harder to follow, so this isn't a fast read.  It was necessary for me to go back several times during the novel to get characters and Norway's historical facts straight.  There are also a few loose ends that aren't cleared up by the end of the novel.  It seems that in most thrillers, there is some kind of corruption in high government, in the police department, or in a political setting.  One of the best parts of these thrillers is seeing this corrupt person caught and humiliated.  Unfortunately, the corruption in this novel lives on, and no one is exposed or prosecuted even though the reader knows who he is and Harry Hole has no clue.  Ellen's murderer is found, however the actual person who ordered the murder isn't known to the police and is allowed to go on as if nothing happened.  Whether this is by design or it is a problem in the translation is uncertain.  Hopefully, the loose ends will be tied up in the next novel.<br /><br />Despite the minor difficulties with unfamiliar Norwegian history, which is interesting and worth reading about, and Norwegian names (impossible to pronounce) this novel is excellent and definitely worth reading, especially by those who like European thrillers.  Nesbø keeps the reader in suspense until the very end.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.rical facts straight.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie is amazing! It is very similar to real life and easy to relate to. It's also hilarious! It keeps me in stitches. My husband and I watch it over and over again we love it! The langue is the only bad part, however if you look past that, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. :)
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I love this, I could listen to it over and over. I bought it for a friend and he has become an ardent fan. One of the top cds of 2012, you really need to get it.

B0037VNX44|4.0|WOW!!! Once again - I LOVE Tom Hardy. His body of work is incredible ! In this movie, I totally forgot that this was an actor playing a role. Before I watched the movie, I saw all the trailers from it . In spite of that I still forgot he was an actor. I really enjoyed the movie. It was gritty, violent, and spellbinding. I couldn't look away!
B000MNP2K8|5.0|We like Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. You should watch this, then watch Quantum of Solace, as the story continues from Casino.

B00589AYWW|5.0|every politician should be made to read this brilliant book. Barbara Tuchman was a living national treasure, she gives remarkable insights in this book that help us all whether politico, businessperson or just thinking adult.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Pretty pathetic that she finally &#34;finds herself&#34; and finds people that look up to her in prison. She gloats in her new found popularity and excites that everyone from the hood in prison love her so much. So you're the most educated girl in prison and all the black girls with sixth grade educations adore you. Bravo Piper!
B0043UB0EI|5.0|1. Please see review for Spartacus Gods of the Arena.<br />2. I am not sure when Andy Whitfield was replaced , but I just wanted to say how much I loved his performance. The &#34;second&#34; Spartacus is GREAT, but my personal opinion is that I &#34;connected &#34; more with Andy, and saw and felt a depth to his performance. What a loss.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My kids love this game. The graphics are so cute. There is an in-app purchasing, but that's not a problem if your account is password protected.  We did have a problem with the game restarting itself a few days after I had purchased some &quot;bling&quot; for my kids, but customer service was awesome. They credited back what we lost with no problem.  We're very pleased with the game and with Gameloft.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the first sentence, I was drawn in. I was somehow not expecting this work to be so rich and dark, but it is always imbued with a little gleam of hope, so although it is in the &#34;dystopian&#34; genre, it was also a forward-looking experience. I am happy it continues with Shift and Dust, because I want some resolution!  The end of the Wool series does end well enough if there were no sequels, but there is so much to mine from this vein, I am looking forward to the remainder of the Saga. I have started &#34;Shift&#34;, and am immersed in it now, as well. Wow. I also love that this is such a great premise that there are so many offshoots written by others, and I have read a number of them, as well. I could read Silo stories forever!  You will not be disappointed in Hugh Howey's writing style and ability bring characters to life. Other writers are doing well in this regard as well, but Hugh sets the bar pretty high. Read/listen to these books!
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|The cast is great ( I am a big fan of Mads Mikkelsen ), the dialog fresh and entertaining. I am looking forward to seeing more episodes and seeing how the characters develop. I think it will be very difficult to go forward without copying the original - but  it will be entertaining to see what happens.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I can not think of a better example of why people go to concerts - this film captures all of the power and majesty of a Pink Floyd Concert. From the sound quality to the light show to the camera work, this production has been flawlessly executed. This is truly a must-see for any Pink Floyd fan, or any Classic Rock fan, for that matter.
B000W453KQ|5.0|I have always loved this movie one of my all time favorites it is a classic<br />very realistic and true to life
B005MMYBXI|5.0|I watched most of the Spartacus series when it was first on tv. It was New, Fresh,Shocking, and  each week I couldn't wait to see the next weeks show. I even watched the old show that would play before the new one.<br />Now that I have access I will continue to watch each segment, as many times as I want, and will be able to see and hear some of the things I have missed. There are so many  images ,etc. that to watch one time is not enough to gather it all in.<br />My family likes to wait till we have watched all the parts of a series, and then have &#34;marathons&#34; - weekends where we watch from beginning to end! The Spartacus marathon will be spectacular !!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love this show!  The plot and show are wholesome from the entire family.  I just wish I did not have to wait so long in the states to view the current season.
B008Y6MKSW|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie.  It has heart, a wonderful, redemptive plot, and terrific dialogue.  Take my advice and see it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game it's one of those never stop running kind of games like Temple Run except in its own way.
B0063M22QO|5.0|So far so good.  I Haven't played enough games to really know! But appears to be Avery good exercise for the mind.
B00009UTQD|5.0|I bought this so that I can bring several ND filters with me when using off camera flash outdoors. It's very portable and it's really convenient to be able to carry my filters like this.
B005WBBYXO|3.0|It will take me months to complete it (it's huuuuge), but definitely worth reading. Better get a good reader cos you will be hooked on this for a long time...
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|This is one of the craziest love stories, Leonardo was awesome in it, it was very theatrical ! Music was great too! So colorful!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome show!! Harvey is a stud (no homo) and Rachel, I would definitely beat it up ;)<br />Overall the show gets u hooked after any episode, u don't have to watch the 1st season (but u should) to get into it..
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Its a great book, but a little predictable.<br /><br />Good read holds your interest from start to end.<br /><br />Would recommend you read it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Can't begin to describe how delighted I am that I took a chance on an author I'd never heard of before. This series of books is absolutely wonderful. Excellent story and extremely well-developed characters that I grew to care about very quickly. Definitely worth the read! Don't hesitate to get \\"Dust\\", the Silo Saga as well.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Enjoyed the show. Will watch season 2 soon. I had no issues at all while watching all episodes of the 1st season.
B00CQTKGY8|5.0|Great book for the &#34;Intro&#34; to the Go Pro.  I liked how the author explains the settings and under which circumstances you would change resolutions, etc.  Probably a bit too much on the mounts, but great information all around.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Boston Legal was a favorite of mine and Suits is the latest version with a similar story line.<br />Can't wait for season 3.
B0068RQ85K|5.0|I had one of these with only two mandrels, so I knew what I was getting with this one with more sizes to coil. This one also has the attachment for temporarily fastening it to your work table, so If you don't have a large enough workshop to be able to screw it to a table and keep it there, you can put it all in a bag or container and keep it in a drawer or on a shelf when not using it. It's a space saver. The one I had before would have to be permanently attached, or hand held in order to be used, and I found I really enjoyed the freedom of being able to have the stability this one offers.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thought this show was awesome. Sometimes it make you think if that can really happen in reality but who knows what will happen in the future. The suspense of constantly think you could be eaten was crazy I even felt apart of the show lol.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|This camera bag is both economical and functional.  Just what I was looking for.  I would recommend this bag to all who are looking for a small carrying case for their SLR.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Another excellent historical novel by Follet.  Will definitely read the sequel and download it from Amazon for my Kindle.  And will await the third book with anticipation.
B003K025V4|5.0|Gonzo x 2 = cool! Yes, Gonzo, yes cool!  Great performance to be sure. Insightful stuff. Tunes you don't forget. Tunes you dream about. The power of the performances is awesome! That's what came to mind after listening to this yet even more ultra timely compilation of, yes compilation, of Miley's songs. The power and the tears are awesome!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this bingo game especially the free daily bingo games where I can get extra power ups, money, and keys! I'm addicted to digital fun and games!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Don't get me wrong, Google has is over most but I don't like the fact that Google shares everything they have on you. And they seem to celebrate everything and everyone (liberal) except America. Whats up with that??? I wish there was an alternative that doesn't share their progressive liberal one sided views. And whats really disturbing about it is that no one ever calls them out on it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|use it to enjoy lossless format of my collection. much detail revealed and much wider range than the others that I have tried.
B000005ILF|5.0|I purchased this album to get \\"Valparaiso.\\" It is featured in the closing of WHITE SQUALL. However, \\"Valparaiso\\" is not included on the soundtrack album for WHITE SQUALL. \\"Valparaiso\\" is an incredibly moving song and Sting's performance of it is powerfully poignant. Thus, I purchased Mercury Falling. I was also very moved by other songs on this album, namely: \\"The Hounds Of Winter\\" and \\"I Hung My Head.\\" This is a rare find and a rare way to find other songs by Sting.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I have good internet it work for everything else. But if it does lag and if you wait for it to load it lags 5 seconds later. It has a good set-up but not very helpful
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very dependable and I'm able to use it for a night stand alarm clock. I would recommend this to everyone I know who has a tablet
B0058YPILY|5.0|She just love's this series and could not wait for it to arrive.  She was not disappointed and is now waiting for season 8 to release!
B002VWNIAY|5.0|never tire of watching this...probably could recite most of the lines by now.  a true classic.  dvd in good shape, arrived promptly, reasonably priced.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because it is like having my own horse! But sometimes it is a little slow because of the WiFi, but other than that it's really fun!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent, as all of Follett's books are.  This one had a little too many war details than I'd like.  It was a great read.<br />4 stars
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|For as long as I can remember, reading a Georgette Heyer historical romance has been a wonderful escape into a time long passed. Her characters are humorous and clearly above average. In this book love takes the Rocky road between the \\"green\\" girl and the \\"rake\\". But as we know roads do lead us home again.  Loved the little brother.
B00003CXRM|5.0|dvd arrived promptly, reasonably priced.  geoge clooney is great...good acting all around, and lots of good humor.  the music is fine too.  i recommend this movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Not a bad game to play when waiting for other things to mature or grow. For free it is really a good bargain.
B00992CF6W|5.0|man I know what minecraft is but I cant get it becase it is to expensive so all I'm asking for AMIZON is toy make it at lest 1:00$plese at lest for 1 day please&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|My boyfriend and I enjoy this so much. It's very addictive. Helps pass the time when we're waiting in long lines or appointments.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|dvd like new, great price, arrived quickly.  have watched this movie many times and always find it entertaining.  the dude rocks!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Very inspirational, unlike anything you've ever read before!<br /><br />Couldn't put it down...<br /><br />Thank You, Tim! For all the selfless, great advice! (And for the crazy experiments... :)
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|It's very difficult to fill compartiment battery inside the mouse.<br />If you need to remove the battery , you will spend hours to get success, probably because<br />the compartiment is very tigth.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Genius script, actors, production. A must have for the mystery comedy buff,  Marvelous fun to see the new interpretations of the famous detectives.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|The first thing one notices is the instructions are written by someone who does not speak English as a first language.  &#34;Match the jewels until the board transparency, the Jewels star will appear.&#34;  &#34;Eliminate the jewels quickly can get extra scores.&#34;  These are just 2 examples.  Additionally, when one plays the game and is unable to make any further moves, the words &#34;No More Move&#34; come up.<br /><br />One learns to play it through experience.  Just start making chains of 3 or more of the same jewel and learn what the effects are and how the points are scored.  After playing a few times, one can ascertain the best ways to score.  Just don't count on the instructions!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Having seen the movie, was interested in filling in the story - this book did not disappoint.  By the time it started, found I couldn't put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter loves this game.  It really keeps her attention on long car trips.  The sound effects in the game are a hoot for everyone else in the car too.  I love it!
B005LAII4E|1.0|This \\"movie\\" is more like a \\"let's create a way for Dewayne Johnson for to screw up another iconic role.  The entire premise and story line of the original GI JOE move (and comic book history) was ignored for one reason only.  Dewayne needs another box office smash.  Well... it didn't happen.  This sucks.  This spits in the face of the intire GI Joe franchise.  And it spits in the face of the millions of GI Joe fans.  Please delete its existence.  Apologize to )the GI JOE fanbase and bring another movie (with original characters) that actually makes sense with the earlier movies.  Did I mention that DJ sucks as a GI Joe replacement character?  If you wont' to make another movie, resurrect the original hero and thrill us with his exploits.  Don't even mention the loser that you interjected into the franchise.  We will quickly forget that loser's attempt to become a GI Joe.  He ain't.  He'll never be.  As the Scorpion King, he's okay.  As a Joe... not.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This Is a book that universal and extremely wise... I recommend it for any and everyone!<br />5 Stars without a doubt!
B00DY951TO|3.0|I share most of the positive feelings generated by this latest addition to the magnificent Bootleg series, BUT as a confirmed vinyl addict its \\"here we DONT go again\\". Bob and the music come out great but Sony the company rip us off again. The vinyl version (12\\" x 12\\")fits nicely with the previous 9 volumes on the shelf as opposed to the smaller packaging of the Deluxe CD set. However the Isle of Wight concert we have been waiting for is omitted. Shame on you Sony. We vinyl people already pay over the odds to feed our habit on new releases and a little imagination could have made it the perfect box set. So to continue my record collecting you want me to buy the Vinyl box set AND the CD Deluxe set. Shame, shame on you again Sony. Corporate greed or lack of imagination- not sure which. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels like this.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|To my film knowledge this seems to be an original story well written and well directed.  The plot isn't mind boggling, but still entertaining.  I would suggest this for most Sci-fi genre fans.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed these books, they were great summer reads. I found myself truly caring about the characters and what happened to them. It had a good twist and an ending that actually resonated with me instead of just a simple wrap up. If you are looking for an intriguing series to read that's gritty, harsh yet poignant and thought provoking then I think you would like these books.
B008MM9630|4.0|just started the game. I like it so far. cute and a great way to pass some time when you are waiting.
0316067598|5.0|I can't say much about this book that hasn't already been said in the hundreds of other positive reviews. It's an incredible story of brotherhood, love, and survival. Marcus Luttrell is a true hero and this book definitely does a good job of telling his story.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great read, well written, excellent for a Book Club.  As much as I did enjoy this and did not want to put it down between chapters, I too often would forget with who each child belongs/ed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am absolutely hooked on minion rush..it's support fun and a great way to take a breather from all the seriousness of life.
0345529057|5.0|It's in great condition plus they are fantastic books. Not to mention. it's super cheap. You will not be disappointed.
B00138KI00|5.0|No matter what these guys touch turns to gold they're amazing! I can't pick a favorite but I could put Unmistakable on repeat and not get sick of it. Lets not forget Everything but mine makes me dance around my living room :)
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I did not help at all.  Ended up going to UTube to find what I needed.  Not worth the time to download.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|Perfect, shipped fast, movie was good for this type of movie. Was bought for my daughter and she was happy as well.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|i wasn't sure if i was going for i7 so i decided to get this proc because it was a good buy and it's also graphics ready ( for those who aren't ready to get a good graphics card or for later project)...
8866135879|5.0|Moleskine  IS THE PRO 'S SECRET do not tell your friends how you keep your life in order make them discover these fine products on their own..  the quality and functionality  of this line far, FAR,  exceeds  the price..  JOIN THE WINNERS
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have kids who play on their tablet while it's plugged in.  This cable has done exactly what I have needed it to do...not break or fray when kids bend it.
B00BESKTMG|2.0|I am a big fan of the old karate movies from my youth, but this one was a little too weird for my tastes.  Action was pretty cool, but the acting was horrible.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Easy game to take care of dragons.  Doesn't need a lot of friends help to achieve goals.  Love the flexibility of playing for a few minutes or longer.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Of course this is a fierce CD I had it and lost it years ago so it was good to see amazon sell it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|After reading other reviews on this book I was convinced to buy it. To be honest I wasn't expecting too much, I have been An avid reader of fiction for over 20 years so have been exposed to many writing styles and types of fantasy fiction, most of which I can take or leave.<br />This is Not one of those books.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone one who wants a story that draws you in from the first moment. Realistic characters that have full depth and a world that is fully developed. The writing style is such that before you realise it you are partway through the book with no intention of putting it down.<br />I would rate this among the best I hAve read. Comparable to George R R Martin. For character depth but focusing on one character instead of a world full.<br />The only disappointment is that I have to wait for the next book to come out. I will certainly be reading this author again.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|mr. child has written another good action thriller about ' the man', jack reacher. jack always keeps you entertained wondering what the next adventure is going to bring to the reader. reacher is kind of a modern day Sherlock holmes but with lots of muscle, well able to take care of himself and other characters involved in his adventure. i have enjoyed all of mr. child' s novels, they are well written and keep the reader engrossed with the detective work and physical ability of reacher. but, in this particular book i was a little disappointed in the change of the story line towards the end of the story' it just seemed to me that mr child turned a different direction for some reason, he didn,t connect the story line together. still a good read but for me not quite as good as the previous twelve or fourteen novels. if you like jack reacher before you will go back for more.  c e brew
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There are no adequate words to describe Downtown Anny. Everything from the story line to the acting and directing is Superb! My only complaint is that we have to wait for it to come out after the UK.
B0016JBCJW|5.0|All the usual Wes Anderson quirky character types and familiar actors.  I very much enjoyed it and would highly recommend if you enjoyed Royal Tenenbaums and Moonrise Kingdom
B00280LYIC|5.0|I have been reading light fantasy for 30 years now.  This was one of a random set of books I stared at on a book shelf that caught my attention.  There aren't many books these days that will catch my attention enough that I say up late finishing them.  This is one of those books.  It kept me engaged from start to finish and the characters are fleshed out really well.<br /><br />If you have ever enjoyed fantasy books, I simply don't think you could go wrong with this series.
B000JZ68GG|2.0|Show sucked, J.F. was sexy as hell.  Too bad she disgraced herself back in the day.  I'm sure her dad was proud.
B000N3ST7A|4.0|I just ordered this C.D. because someone wanted me to learn how to sing the song &#34;Silver Springs&#34;.  However, I was impressed by the quality of the C.D. and the promptness in sending it to m.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|it is time we have candy crush saga on the kindle fire!!!

PLEASE listen to everyone and put candy crush saga on the kindle fire!!!!
B005H9B2CE|1.0|some humor when he comes to earth but otherwise boring. Lack of script. If you have nothing else to do then watch it
0385336950|4.0|I've just started reading the Cloud Atlas, but already I can tell this is going to be a good read.  And it will surley help make the movie make more sense.  You get pretty lost in the movie until you've watched it several times.  So I'm hoping the book will help me understand the characters much better.
B0060D2QR6|4.0|My niece wanted me to see this movie.  I thought it was going to just be a &#34;chick&#34; flick at first but then after watching the movie decided it had a valuable meaning.  Yes I would recommend it to others.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|It's really bad and it sucks really hard.  Don't get this game, under any circumstances; it really sucks a lot
B00000612G|5.0|With the release of Aftermath of the Lowdown, I started looking for his previous CD's & couldn't find this one.  I am so glad I purchased a second copy!  He really is a talented singer, songwriter & guitar player.  I'm especially enjoying the title track, but I know current & future fans will enjoy the CD in it's entirety.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I just finished the free trial and so far it's pretty good. Graphics are pretty awesome and I like the fact that I can zoom closer into a hidden object scene. Will most likely purchase the full version. Really enjoy BFG.
B007C3TVNA|5.0|This was used for a presentation example of conduct disorder turning into antisocial personality and the behaviors.  It was very well done.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|OMG I was hooked great job....I loved it. Funny show, it deserves more point stars! If you haven't seen it give it a try. Plus maybe you will get a insite how your teen might be or maybe their friends......good show!!!!
B000001DV2|5.0|I had this on cassette back in the day & hadn't listened to it in years.  Saw a You Tube video for &#34;Have you ever need someone so bad&#34; & knew I had to have this in CD form.  Take a trip back in the time machine - you won't regret it!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I chose this rating because it came fast & it was in very good condition. it plays well to. Its also a good cd
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was easier to follow and made more sense than the movie did. The movie strayed to far from the plot. If you liked the movie you need to read the book.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Really nice movie and it definitely counts as a adult movie. Don't be afraid of watching it if you think that's a child movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put these books down.<br />I was so upset when i finished it.<br />Although 1 and 2 were great the 3rd book was my favorite.<br />Christian Grey is an unbelievable character.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Ok the cd is AMAZING and GREAT BUT THE FAME MONSTER IS THE CLEAN VERSION NOT THE DIRTY VERSION!! AMAZON NEEDS TO MAKE THAT KNOWN. Other than that its a good cd! #Artpop
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was the best book. It showed growth in the characters and gave a new view of why people get in to things they do.
0374214913|4.0|A very interesting book. The title made me curious and the book began beautifully. Though the end was not what I expected, and slightly abrupt and disappointing, the book still kept me intrigued till the end and that in my opinion is a good book. The writing is great and the characters are memorable. The character and place descriptions are well written. Overall a wonderful book and I would love to read any more books that the author would write.
6304698623|3.0|It is what she asked for and I guess she was happy with it because she said she enjoyed it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The godfather collection is the best trilogy every. the first 2 movies are two of the best movies ever made. The restoration of these 3 films looks great and worthy of repeated viewings. Great purchase on my part.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|James is a great writer. It is too bad people/reviews only focused on the fetish part when describing the book.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|My 5 year old daughter loves this game.  It is just too bad that every gameloft game requires lots of real $$$ to do well.  It is frustrating for her when she wants to get something and I have to say no.  Do people seriously buy coins for $99??!!!  I think that Gameloft is taking advantage of people and it is kind of disgusting.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Weird wacky and scandalous!  This is not my normal kind of read, but it has led me to an unexplored fascination with a style that keeps you entertained and longing for more from from this author who made such an impact.  I recommend all three books!<br /><br />Liz's
B000B5XOXY|4.0|This movie is a mix of dark and light with different version of Gotham City and it is nice to see the introduction Robin.  I like Jim Carrey's Riddler.  I do HATE the car though.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|So many characters to pick a favorite from or to hate. A little graphic and multiple plots, people to follow.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I was so taken with the Netflix production of Orange that I bought the book.  I was not disappointed.  It contains an even richer set of tales, some found in the TV series, most not. I was fascinated by what the movie writers picked to work with and what they left out.  It helps one understand how the shape of a TV story can be so different from the shape of a memoir that reads like a novel.  I recommend this well written story of a woman's self discovery and transformation through a year's incarceration in a low security prison.  That we both graduated from Smith College gave me an extra sense of Piper's life before and during Danbury.
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|Different is good too. Unique sound compared to their previous albums. Greg's vocals somehow become better with each record. Crossburner is the highlight song on this record, epic vocals/guitar work. Get this.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|If you like the first movie, you will like this one too.  It still has Tim Burton's darkness to it and Danny Elfman's score, which was lost in versions that followed.  Michael Keaton will always be my favorite Batman.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Arrived fully working and in good condition, arrived promptly also.  A great film, really enjoyed it as I am enjoying the whole Marvel film series.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Got it in 2 days - AWESOME product!!! Nice work...worth the extra fee rather than waiting...have I said it's AWESOME!?!
B003CIG7AE|5.0|By FAR their best album to date. Compared to their other albums, this one just feels a lot more 'genuine'.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Scary movies are enjoyable to watch, but when it's over, that's it.  Very few scary movies have stuck with me after it was over-this one has.  Unlike other horror movies this one is not gory.  It is very well written and it is SO creepy.  I'm also a fan of Patrick Wilson so it was part of the appeal to see it originally.  I highly recommend this movie.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|Arrived fully working and in good condition, arrived promptly also.  A great film, really enjoyed it as I am enjoying the whole Marvel film series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and straightforward, a very useful app! The calculator has made my budgeting much easier! I highly recommend this app, best I have found in the app store.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|Back Down South is quite possibly the best KoL song ever written, in my opinion. I am a huge fan of their older work like everyone else is, but get this album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful! I loved it.  I did not know what to expect from Colleen Hoover, now l will read the rest of her books!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Arrived fully working and in good condition, arrived promptly also.  A great film, really enjoyed it as I am enjoying the whole Marvel film series.
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|I hats this game don't ware your money the controls ducks this is a total rip off!!!!!! I wouldn't get this game even if it was free!!!!!!!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|It's great, albeit a tad too short. You'll be binge reading this, no doubt, and you'll love it as well.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Overall I am very pleased with the game. It is very addicting and changing.  Recommended for ages 6+. To earn all five stars I would recommend being able to play against your friends and try to best their to scores.
B00005JPS8|4.0|This is as advertised, arrived quickly and in good working order.  The film itself is very good, enjoyed it a lot.
B004KPLVV8|4.0|This movie is a classic and we purchased it for our grandson.  He loves movies that have a lot of special effects.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|I was never able to anticipate what was going to happen next. I like that. A great cast, the reason I chose to watch it in the first place.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|awol nation is a different type of music. he puts on a good concert... bought this as an mp3. so no shipping etc...
B00CD7ICBW|5.0|I loved Rue in this film so much it is painful to see her get hurt like she is. It makes me wonder if it is right to bring kids of that age into a book full of so much violence and poverty. But i see the struggle that the kids face in this movie as well as the book as very real. it reminds me that many people are without homes and food and in times past the government was asked to provide all of that to us. We must all remember not to take what we have for granted as the people in these districts 1 through 12 do not seem to do the people in the capital are selfish and out of touch with the real world. A true symbol of the division between the vary rich and the poor classes. is it fair that one must kill others that are so young to become wealthy like the rich in this book I wonder at the morals of the adults portrayed in this film i loved it over all a true master piece it is no wonder it got an academy award.
B000AL730O|5.0|I have always been a fan of Paul McCartney, and this CD is my second favorite CD.  I checked this out from my local library, loved it so much that I purchased it for myself.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|What can you say? It works. My primary purpose in getting this app was so I could watch Youtube  videos/movies and it does a great job.
0345803493|5.0|this series was all the rage and i got tired of being on the waiting list from friends, so bought it myself., they are a fast read, probably a 7 on the smut level, but good read and gets your mind going ;)
B008D563IC|3.0|why the hell is there a kid in an adult scene like the movie opens with that is just weird and is not likely to happen in real life lock the dam door. Besides that i like the fact that most of the original caricatures seem to find closure in this movie i would not want to watch another one though unless it is there children as teenagers. this movie had it's time when it came out but that time is over and most of it is no longer relevant.this movie is ok with me but i would not watch it more than once.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Not bad, your typical Mahjong game but with a summer twist. The only draw back is the sound is very low on this. Or at least thats how it came up on my Tablet. Still a good game though.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I'm new to hidden objects-types of games so I am having some problems.  Overall, the graphics are colorful and I seem to be a little addicted to it.
0307276902|5.0|The book hits pretty close to home, and i remember when it came out and  then when Oprah revoked her seal of recommendation, but if you can get past the heavy repetition, the very detailed accounts of drug use and alcohol abuse and vomiting, i really liked the book. i was a little bummed to hear it was all a lie, but ignoring that i like the book.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I love what Disney did with this movie and the action in it a real step away from there unseal child movies i hope they can make more in this series there are quite a few books in the series 3 for sure and several more that are good as well.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun but zumbae is better yes I know I am the best gamer ever for a mile and a minute. Yeah
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book in a day. I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I learned new things, new meanings and I most definitely cried. One of the best books I've read in a long time. And some people may think oh, you know, people just say that. But honestly, it is a very well written book and it makes you think about a lot of things. Buying a physical copy to add to my collection of book.
0062060562|5.0|book was a little beat up upon arrival, but really rally enjoyed it. also have heard a rumor there will be a movie made in 2014. should be good
B00AKFG15S|2.0|In a nutshell, this book is about Archer riding on his fame and the sucess of the previous books. The so called trilogy started superbly, got worse with book two and hit a low with book three. Very weak plot and clearly the author is just looking to cash in on his reputation.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I loved reading Orange is a New Black. Some of the reviews here on Amazon made me hesistant on reading it but my love for the show won out. As stated, it's a memoir on Piper's experiences in prision, therefore it also involves her experiences with other inmates so there is some jumping around but it's not hard to follow. I felt like I was there with her while reading this book. I recommend it and the show on Netflix to everyone.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Great writing, incredible story, loved to hear how the bands were all inter-related. Give it away Give it away Give it away now.
0345803485|5.0|this series was all the rage and i got tired of being on the waiting list from friends, so bought it myself., they are a fast read, probably a 7 on the smut level, but good read and gets your mind going ;)
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I am a completely unskilled photographer that is trying to expand my skills with use of flash. This speedlight REALLY helped do that. The moving lens allows you to use your flash without washing out your subject matter and with the lens pointed forward really extends your reach with the flash.<br /><br />I need to plug kenrockwell.com and thank him for the recommendation because this is a solid purchase that I'm sure I'll be able to use for a long while.
B000FC1192|5.0|It is almost impossible for Mr. Gaiman to write anything, as far as I am concerned, that isn't well written and entertaining. As an adult, I had no desire to see the film but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I guess I'm not part of the following that this game seems to have taken on. I never played any of the others. I was not impressed with the gameplay. It was also my first time playing. I found it to be confusing and rather boring.
B007MU85D0|5.0|really like their music. its nice to have a little variety these days, also bought this as an mp3, no shipping or condition
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|As usual the Ryan novel is a great read. My only complaint is that since Clancy started using co-authors, a bit of the detail and technical shine that hallmark his books is sadly lacking. Any Clancy fan will still enjoy the book but the difference is noticeable. Fortunately for the author 2 generations of Jack Ryan (Sr and Jr) fans will most likely forever be dedicated and eagerly await the next installments.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is a great movie.  My family could watch this movie over and over.  It is a sweet movie about the power of love and family.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this if they need a white noise generator. I would recommend using this with external speakers as the phone's built in speaker will not do this justice.
0345803507|5.0|this series was all the rage and i got tired of being on the waiting list from friends, so bought it myself., they are a fast read, probably a 7 on the smut level, but good read and gets your mind going ;)
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|The best book I have read in years. A plot so well crafted I had great trouble putting it down and going to work. My only complaint is that this is Mr Hayes first book I want more more I say more. Just brilliant!
1451696191|4.0|One of my favorite coming of age stories out there. This book was, in my opinion, perfect. It was about growing up, learning about both yourselves and others, ideas and social situations that very often happen in high school, and discovering how wonderful it was to figure things out about not only others, but yourself.
B000V6738U|5.0|this collection give you a few more songs that aren't on the greatest hits album. I have always been a steely Dan fan and a Jeff skunk Baxter fan and I always will be.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was really skeptical about this game but the more you play the more you unravel. And in there lies the fun. The tone fits perfectly and makes great use of tons of the Kindle features. Plus it doesn't hurt this game looks great graphically, has an open ended story, and once more a feeling that makes you believe you are taking part of a mystery. Another review says this, but follow the advice, don't use the clues. The puzzles are much richer if you don't and self satisfaction is rewarding. This game maybe short but there's layers to be unlocked here. Just look underneath...
1433537427|5.0|I picked up the personal size trutone leather ESV study Bible and absolutely love it. The size us perfect. The pages are pretty thin, so that might bug some people, but I don't mind it. The articles and notes give great context to the scripture. The maps and illustrations are stellar as well. Can't recommend it highly enough...
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I rated this app with 3 stars because if you are listening to Pandora and decide that you want to listen to YouTube your music won't turn off automatically like it would on the website. But you can watch videos that you can't watch on YouTube.
B0057UAE54|4.0|I was never much of a Peter Frampton fan when I was younger. But I have listen to this album and I believe that it deserves all the accolades that is received.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love all of the songs in the album. He is a really great singer and writer. I especially love the song &#34;Gone, Gone, Gone&#34; :)<br />I would totally recommend buying this. You won't regret it.<br /><br />However, if you aren't a country listener in any sort of way, maybe reconsider buying this. ;)

B000FA5SMK|5.0|John Corey is a capturing character that you would like to hang with in real life. DeMille hooks you from the start. A totally enjoyable book.
B002KVCA1O|3.0|The Rolling Stones are awesome. But there a better collections of the music out there than this one. emotional rescue is still one of my favorite songs
B00BTHV05M|5.0|They are one heck of a band.<br />I used to just like one or two of their songs (i.e. Good Life and Secrets) but when my friend played a song or two from this album, I fell in love with it.<br />It's pretty cheap too, at least when I bought it...
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My hubs and I love this series. It's great for a relaxing 20 minutes to end a busy day. Yes, it's for kids, but it has a lot of hidden adult humor.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game stops the desire of me wanting to go to real bingo love playing the slots and special room's
B001BIMYXQ|4.0|music is art. the Eurythmics really put together some music that has a lot of variety and is skilled fully put together. I bought this album for only a couple of songs but I did enjoy the whole album.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game had a good story line and challenging and different styles of .searches.<br />Looking forward to continuing my game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is really wonderful!!  Season 3 is right up there with season 1 and season 2.  Can't wait to see season 4!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|please bring back the older version or something similar. I am tired of getting videos of things I do not want to watch when I hit the radar map. I do not need the full content of the website. I need weather, radar, and forecasts.  I do not need the extra stuff that crashes the app and causes me to have to do a hard reboot on my kindle fire. please change this, otherwise I will stop using this and weather.com completely
1934429821|5.0|I was delighted to find a version I could afford.  I buy his calendars to give as gifts, but this is MINE.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard so much about this book. I am glad I read it and willingness the others but have to say that the sex scenes were not as steaming as Laurel K Hamilton's Anita Blake's series. But a good read and finished it in four days.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Suits is hilarious. It's like White Collar meets Psych.<br />I love the accuracy of this show, when it comes to factual statements such as laws, court cases, or anything like that, they more than often are dead on, if not a bit off base, the important part is that the writers don't just make things up for the purpose of the show, instead they did their research :)
B00785P2QC|3.0|The Facebook things are annoying. I don't really care about what else to say it's free so just try it out.
1416550550|4.0|Interesting mesh of the present and the past.  Gruesome radiation experiment and the aftermath. Wanted to know more about the repercussons of the solved mystery.  I bought for gift(had to read first--make sure it was worthy) and I don't think the recipiant will be disappointed.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I've always enjoyed playing UNO and this is the first UNO app to where you can actually play with live people. Its so much better than playing a computer because that becomes predictable. I would say that I wish you didn't have to wait so long to scratch for more coins but that's minor.
B00CJGP116|5.0|LOVE THE MARC ANTHONY CD.  HE CAN NEVER DISAPPOINT HIS FANS. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT AGAIN. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Terrific film, great story,  well acted. and a very good supporting cast. Can't ask for much more than that. See it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best series I have watched.  The acting is first rate, the story line is engrossing. I love the way the story line changes from character to character and is sometimes unpredictable.  The series also does a nice job of educating you on the history of England and Scotland in the early 19 hundreds. I can't wait to see what will unfold in season four.
B000FAGGWQ|2.0|I was disappointed that it was only the bonus Disc, I thought it was the trilogy and bonus Disk. That the written description been clearer, i would not have bought it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The Zealot was a great historical perspective of Jesus of Nazareth. I have read many books over the years that gave you similar information, but Aslan puts it all together in one place. I really enjoyed this book.
072325804X|5.0|Well made. Good price. I bought it for my daughter who is 2 months old. These are stories I don't mind reading and rereading.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I loved it. Thought it had a great message. It makes you think how important water is to all of us. You should know that it starts real slow then it gets really interesting. You will be glad you watched it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is an endearing show full of people that you absolutely fall in love with! A must watch!  The characters keep you thinking about them long after you've finished watching.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I've yet to be good at pulling ideas from my head. I do my best work when I follow an example. I always worried about the finished work not being my own when it came to painting at least. To realize what was quite obvious has been a wonderful feeling. I now see that the work is much different because of my own style. I used to be obsessed with perfection but this IS MY perfection. Perfectly unperfect, which is beautiful! Penicillin drawings are different for me though because I usually draw faces and they have to be near enough to perfect that I capture what the person looks like otherwise its just a picture of someone who resembles the original picture. LOVED the book. It's given me the missing piece i needed to expand my painting and continue on with more confidence. Thank you Austin, more than you may understand!<br /><br />Celina Stallings<br />Oklahoma
B006CR2ON6|5.0|Out totally came early! I love me some smallville! This is a great buy, I'd recommend it to anyone. Two thumbs up.
B003U0AHBO|3.0|Very different from the conventional Robin Hood story.  This version is pretty egalitarian and is freeing people from the mold.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|We watched the first episode and we were hooked!<br />We set our TiVo to tape the entire season, but one episode failed...Amazon Instant made it easy to get the single episode and watch it commercial free quickly to keep us up to speed.  Great quality recording and easy to watch as our TiVo started to download the episode as soon as I purchased it.
B005H9B44A|1.0|The sets and costumes were downright silly.  The plot had nothing going for it and there wasn't much that could be done with the performances.  This is likely only worthwhile if you love the comic book or comic book movies in general.
0765348276|3.0|The ideas presented were quite intriguing, but the plot line was more of an adventure/first person shooter video game than deep science fiction.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It doesn't do as advertised. It was a Waste of effort and time. You can not download videos that you select.
B004X75RK4|3.0|Mildly entertaining, but a predictable and tired story.  Unnecessary sexual references.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Good Alaskan scenery, though.  Would love to live in the Paxton house!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great! Large numbers and very easy to use! My eyes are not getting younger. The large numbers are a blessing.
B00C8USQEM|3.0|This is a strange British version.  If you do not have a newer Blu-ray player, or do not have international disc playing capabilities this may not play in your Blu-ray player.  The first episode is fuzzy, poor quality, but the rest of the disc plays well.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Action packed, great story and some casting risks. I really enjoyed this movie. Cumberbatch is great. Pine's performance was slightly better in Unstoppable, but then again he was next to Denzel Washington.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It was a very predictable, shoot-em-up movie with corrupt government officials.  When will somebody come up with an original story?
B000000OU0|5.0|The eagles tunes are timeless and have a great sound. Listening to them live is like listening to all there songs for the first time. Highly recommended . Hotel California is better live then the original. Stop reading and buy this know if your a fan you will not be disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS I have ever seen!!!!<br />I AM NOT A TV PERSON BUT I made an exception for this series.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Hardly helpful at all, could just use google and get better tips for specific levels than you would using this app.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|It was packed with action,very interesting plot,I would recommend it to all my friends. The ending really intreged me.I didn't take a break.
B00CATONCA|3.0|Very disappointed in the floating head cabinet.  Had to return it twice for the same problem.  Battery door screw won't come out.  Waiting for a resolution for the 2nd return.  Although I love the Blu Ray DVD set, upset over spending 100 dollars on the cabinet.
B009QW85ZU|2.0|This film is a remake of Thunderball with some changes to add more high-tech (for the time) gadgetry. Unfortunately, some of the changes make the plot less plausible than the original, not that plausibility is a requirement for a Bond film.<br /><br />One noticeable difference is how much Bond's womanizing ways are toned down. In the original film he gropes  his physical therapist, and eventually blackmails her into having sex with him, which is uncomfortable for someone with modern sensibilities to watch. In the remake, she becomes the aggressor and seduces Bond.<br /><br />The bizarre thing is Sean Connery starring in a remake of his own film, in the same role. I'm not aware of any other actor having had this opportunity. But it's pretty clear from the formulaic script and lackluster performance that he was in this for the money or to revive his flagging career.<br /><br />It's one of the weaker Bond films; even worse than some of the Moore films. It makes me wish he had said never again and left the series on a high note.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|Works for me.product receive in excellent condition. Tested on several games and im a shooting pro now...haha..go get it. You will love it.
B0000UJL96|4.0|For starters, I'll give a rundown of the technical stuff on the DVD.  The case is solidly made and will protect the DVD inside of anything short of dropping it off a cliff, setting it on fire or running it over with a car (and if this happens, you're really doing something wrong), so that's a definite positive.  They really should sell more DVDs in cases like this.<br />The DVD has many features, though I haven't watched all of them yet, but what I have seen is good.  The commentaries are especially interesting.  Lots of neat tidbits of information from the production side.<br /><br />As a movie . . . well, let me put it like this: I'm not a trekkie.  I've tried to get into Star Trek, both the original and TNG, but I've never really been able to enjoy more than a few episode of either.  That said, I love both this movie, and Wrath of Khan enough that I had to add them to my personal collection.  Shatner's acting is, as always, strange, but weirdly engaging and a solid counterbalance to Nimoy's  calm, dry performance.  David Warner's brief roll as Klingon Chancellor Gorkon adds a lot of emotional weight to the film, and Christopher Plummer's General Chang is one hell of a compelling villain: fascinating and complex, not necessarily evil, but, like many of the characters in the plot, caught up so badly by the fear of change that it drives him to do terrible things.  He's the kind of bad guy that you can really believe people would follow.<br />The plot is vastly superior to the garbage J.J. Abrams is putting out, in that it knows that you a lot of action and some random boobs does not a good movie make.  You have to build the characters and work an intelligent angle into the character drama.  In this case, Undiscovered Country is a fantastic exploration of prejudice and the difficulties people face in overcoming prejudice.  It has a few moments that don't work perfectly, a few jokes that fall into sitcom level humor (complete with the sitcom musical cues), but the parts are never bad enough that it spoils anything.  On the whole, the movie is a success and well worth watching.ts are never bad enough that it spoils anything.  On the whole, the movie is a success and well worth watching.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The details are enjoyable and it is fun for the whole family.  My daughter first saw it on her Grandma's game, now my husband and I can't put it down.  It is fun even for my four year old.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Cool, current and convenient! I am updated with my interests in a blink of an eye. I keep in touch with family and friends anywhere and everywhere. Anytime.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game my little girl loves to feed and groom .. Great for any child to teach how to take cc are of there pets
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|What a great way to showcase the amazing history and music the started at Sound City. Whether you are a music fan or not, this movie is enjoyable. Makes me want to take drum lessons:)
B003GX5CWY|5.0|great movie classic ..never gets old. Loved it growing up and still do. I would love new movies to have the same typr of action best predator movie made.
1439152802|5.0|I did not want this book to end!  The twists and turns - I couldn't read the pages fast enough.  The ending actually made me gasp and I was thrilled.  I ordered a copy for my cousin in Ireland and can't wait to hear what she thinks.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|If anyone has ever played in Dungeon's and Dragons console games this is very similar. Controls are funky at first but you will adapt quickly. Challenging but playable with or without using RL cash.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I know MahJong has been around forever, but it's new to me.  It's interesting and fun.  Highly recommend for a not too difficult game.
B00CC1JXYE|3.0|this case does not hold the phone in an upright position it slips down and has to be picked up on a regular basis if it had a groove in the inner cover like other cases it would've been sweet.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Characters are well-developed and intriguing. Drama is realistic, even if you weren't raised in a small castle in the English countryside.Can't wait to see Season 4.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I play this regularly when I have the time and enjoy it.  It is different to the normal Mahjong which is a good change.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|my son loves legos and minecraft. this was a no brainer when it came to a bday gift. best of both worlds. these are micro pieces, so super tiny pieces but worth it. lots of stuff to do here. he loved it!!!!
0880796863|5.0|I lost my previous deck to a flood. They were well worn. They have so many choices now!  I try to stick with easy reading cards, this deck is very nice! Would recommend to all who are interested in tarot!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|What's great about this book is that it is results assured; you won't get lazy and quit working out because you will see results in a month whlch only motivates you even more! I have a friend who has been working out for five years and he asked me what the hell I was doing in the gym. Specifically, the author of this book doesn't load you up with a bunch chest exercises. He recommends only 3 (bench, incline bench and dips) instead of 5 or 6 like other trainers I've encountered. In fact, you almost feel you're cheating because your workout session is less than an hour. The author also stays in touch with you via email and answers any question you may have. It's like having your own personal trainer, but doesn't charge you $50.00 (or more) an hour.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book. Buy it and shock yourself and impress your friends!<br /><br />Alan<br />Katy, TX.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game.  Easy to play and quick to access.  I have been playing it on my Kindle fire for over a year without problems.
030789701X|5.0|Nice hard bound book.  Gives lots of details about how to play the game and achieve everything you need to.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|The app is great and easy to use, but after a couple uses it crashes and doesnt work, so I have.to.constantly.delete and download it again. Other than thst, then it works great!
B005UG542S|4.0|Wasn't the greatest movie and as an avid book fan I don't feel like I did the book justice but was still enjoyable to watch
B003TOMAPC|4.0|This should be offensive, and I am sure many people think it is, but I really liked it.  I did not give it 5 stars as I feel morally obligated not to give a movie with a prepubescent assassin such high marks. (secretly she was my favorite character).
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is one of the beat books I have read this year.  What would I do?  I don't know... I thought I had the answer but the surprise twists changes my decision. Very thought provoking.
140006922X|5.0|Who says a Muslim can't write anything about Jesus?  This book is amazing and should be read by anyone who has a curiosity about Jesus the human being.  It's not so much about the divine Christ but about the human man who lived and died 2000 years ago and impacted humanity like no other.  I found it to be rich with background information, real time substantive ideas and a wealth of facts I was unaware of.  There are numerous controversial ideas but the author backs up every claim; in fact, the end of the book is almost as comprehensive as the entire story with more than umpteen references and support for what he writes.  Anyone who is a follower of Christ or simply has questions should find this rendition enlightening and well worth the time to absorb its amazing revelations.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome!!!!!!<br /> I would highly recommend this book it is  amazing!!! I think it is better than the first book
B00D5XYY4M|5.0|I took a photography class this summer and really enjoyed it, but I knew I needed more practice to get the lessons to stick.  This app helps me to reinforce what I learned in my class - and I'm learning new things too.  Very nicely done!
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Great Show, hated that it was over. Would have watched another season or two. Love Chuck and Blair. I like the way it ended.
B00271B752|5.0|Awesome movie Al pacino at his best movie blew me away really enjoyed it hope this helps you on deciding to watch
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed this book and think it will help many scientific people to to consider the possiblity of God and heaven.<br />Dr. Alexander's quest to share his experience with others is wonderful and he has a unique opportunity to<br />touch many with his book.  At times, it may be difficult for some to grasp, but overall his emotions as well as<br />his objectivity come through.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this period piece with the attention to detail.  This a drama but it is heavily influenced with romance.  I adore all the characters and my only frustration with this series is when one of the main characters is killed off from the show.
B004S5FWEC|5.0|David Baldacci has to be one of the best crime authors in the business!  I have read some of the King and Maxwell books before, but this is the flrst one, so now I know how they started off together in business.
B00064VR0W|5.0|This is a great DVD. If you have never seen him in concert, this is the best. Very warming, talks to the crowd. Perfect!
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I understand people wanting endless sequels to Mayer's Continuum album. I loved that cd, and it's when I started to realize John's considerable talent. That said, Mayer is way too talented and creative to do the same record over and over again. It takes a lot of guts to make non-commercial albums that almost certainly will never be embraced by the masses. John Mayer did it with Born and Raised, and he's done it again with Paradise Valley. I respect him tremendously for following his heart, rather than strictly pursuing commercial success. At first listen, I wasn't sure if I'd like this as much as Born and Raised, and I resisted doing a review until I spent a fair amount of time with the album. I can honestly say that it's growing on me more each day. There's a little bit of everything here: radio friendly - Wildfire, Paper Doll, and Who You Love. A country number called \\"You're no one 'Til Someone Lets You Down.\\" A nod to JJ Cale with a cover of his classic song \\"Call Me the Breeze.\\" But the real heart of the album are the five more introspective, Born and Raised type songs: \\"Dear Marie\\", \\"Waitin' On The Day\\", \\"I Will Be Found\\", \\"Badge and Gun\\", and \\"On the Way Home\\". They show tremendous depth and maturity. In my opinion, there's only one mis-step here, and that's the second \\"Wildfire\\" filler track. I feel it disrupts the flow of the album. Despite this very minor issue, Paradise Valley is a keeper. It's an album that grows on you and hooks you more with each listen. In this age of commercialized musical garbage, I'm thankful to know there are still true singer/songwriter performing artists out there. John Mayer continues to expand his musical horizons, and I definitely recommend this high quality piece of work.<br /><br />UPDATE: It is now October 6th. Having had this album for roughly six weeks now, I wanted to update my review. I have come to admire this body of work even more. The only negative for me remains \\"Wildfire\\" (track 8). I feel it disrupts the flow ofthe album, and just doesn't fit with the other songs. Only my opinion, but I feel it detracts from this otherwise great album. Now the updated positives, which are many. These songs have a maturity and depth that is very refreshing. Many of the songs are on the mellow side to be sure, but they are in now way boring or lifeless. They are instead reflective; John is obviously growing as a person and (hopefully) leaving behind his shallower existence, in favor of a simpler, more authentic life. And it shows in these songs. The other thing I wanted to touch on was the maturity in his playing. I love a blazing, bluesy guitar solo like the next person, but the sign of a maturing guitarist is one who does more with less. Mayer's guitar playing on the album is definitely subtle, but that subtleness makes it all the more powerful. Almost every song has some kind of guitar hook that is very memorable. I've listened to this album for six weeks, and I continue to anticipate the smallest of guitar licks/fills. It's a case of a little equalling a lot. Much as I loved Born & Raised, I think Paradise Valley is surpassing it, and I never expected that. After Continuum, I too wanted to see more of the bluesy' John. After these last two albums, I can honestly say that's not the case any more. That's just one facet of Mayer, but it's way too confining for such a talented musician. I admire him as an artist, and for following his heart, all the while knowing that commercially, he won't reap the reward$ that he would if had repackaged Continuum five different times. Done like a true artist. Good for you John Mayer!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. Building all kinds of realistic businesses makes this game interesting. I like that it continues without you.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|The game is pretty good and I enjoy it my only issue is that I can't get the quality of the graphics past low
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Judge Dredd is the definition of bad a**. This movie is pretty gory but that's how the comic was perceived and I'm not complaining. Through out the movie Dredd's weapons and actions make you get excited and bumped every time he does something. I'd recommend this movie to my guy friends.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Memories of the watch I had in Viet Nam, with the quality of Seiko now. Keeps perfect time, waterproof, same cloth band as the old original.<br />This would make a Vet a great gift.
B000P407K4|5.0|Possibly my favorite movie. Hilarious and profound. Satire that stays on the right tone every minute, every scene, of the film.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like the game but I wish that they would give you a list of what you have to pair up in the pairing scenes and a little bigger light source for the night scenes
B00BSBUZPK|3.0|First let me say, I was so excited about getting this DVD.  I grew up with the Eagles and am a long time fan.  Overall, it is a great summary of how they formed and the changes the band went through.  There are also some really great photos and video clips of the band.  I just adore a lot of their music and LOVE the harmonies.<br /><br />Of course there is much more interview time with Glenn Frey and Don Henley which I guess is to be expected but I would have liked to hear more from Timothy B. Schmidt and some of the older members like Randy Miesner.<br /><br />I read the book of Don Felder's last year and expected more details about the friction in the band and what the disagreements were about.  Felder paints Glen F. and Don H. as kind of bullies that pulled some shady stuff from a business perspective.  None of that was really touched on.<br />At first I was disappointed with the lack of detail on the problems but then I realized that it was the History Of the Eagles and was supposed to be about the band not one of those tabloid-like 'Behind the Music' videos.<br /><br />I gave it a 3 only because I wanted more interview material from other band member but if you are an Eagles fan, you should get this.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I love anything with the Greek Gods in it .Even though it is basically kid's movie I liked it I plan to buy more of that series.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really neat game.Since the frist time I got it .I love this game.<br />When temple run 2 Came out i was really exctied but my sister took that game so good thing i still have this one.!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Fast, convenient, and easy to use. Helps me with my math and I haven't had any experience with any bugs :) definitely an app worth installing.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|It is a fun product to play on your spare time I like the glowing of the colors. The sound is good also.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is a fun game. It is just difficult enough to be challenging to the average human without being mindless and boring. I finished the first set and am now working on a second set which is tougher.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Avenged has done it again, great CD every song is awesome! Hail to the king is the best song on the cd
B003O86FMW|5.0|A fantastic read! Would recommend it to everyone I know. Now on to the last one. Hope the movie is just as good.
1780721676|5.0|So far so good! I just completed the second day of my second week and am officially down 5.8 pounds!! I actually hit the under 200 mark, which made me want to cry! It has been over 3 years since I've been that small and I will continue doing this until I hit my goal weight, then I will just maintain. The fasting isn't that hard, and like another reviewer- I enjoy feeling a little hungry. It's a sense of accomplishment after each day knowing that I did it, and I've also noticed that I almost do a small fast every day because I don't really have anything other than green tea in my stomach until lunch time.<br /><br />I've been on a weight loss kick for about a month now so that helps me keep on track with this, but I hope if I lose momentum with watching everything I eat, I still stick with the fast two days a week.. it would honestly just be stupid not to!! :)
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|This dedicated app is much nicer than going through the default browser (or Firefox).  Pages are presented with some thought to the reader and it is easily the same as (or better than) accessing the site on a full browser.  Way to go Amazon!
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Smart and interesting show. Great actors and it doesnt get boring. We also like that there are strong male and female characters.
0307477479|5.0|I loved this book. A month after reading it the first time, I read it again and loved it even more because I saw connections that escaped me the first time. Egan's facility with different voices is amazing. I'll be standing in line to read whatever she turns her talent to next. (I loved the Keep and Emerald City too, but this is her masterpiece so far IMHO).
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Started playing and couldn't stop! Needs more mini games in it but it's a fun game overall. Definitely would recommend it
B003L7DK74|5.0|This series is truly, truly weird. It's not exactly what I'd call laugh out loud funny, but it's weird sort of in a Seinfeld type way sort of. It's just extremely odd. I can't quit express how odd it is. That's a good thing in my opinion.<br /><br />The show is two singers from New Zealand trying to make it in America and their manager. They are generally poor and get into odd situations. There's one where they get mugged and end up sort of friends with the muggers by the end. They also have their one fan who is something of a stalker. The show also intersperses some of their songs which are generally intended to just be funny. Somehow it all just works.<br /><br />If you like shows that are just a bit eschew and not quite normal, then you'll like this series. I'd kind of recommend you look up a few clips somewhere to have a better idea before you commit to buying the series, but it's quite enjoyable.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I love this series. I have the first season and the second season is a good as the first one.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|After reading so many glowing reviews, I decided to try this app on my ASUS Transformer Infinity Tablet.  The first step in setup is to download your language pack.  For me, the download continuously fails.  The Swiftkey support site has two resolutions for this and following both, I was never able to download a language pack.  Apparently, this is a problem for multiple users.<br /><br />Both articles state that you should have a 'very strong' wifi connection.  Why would this matter?  Even with one bar, the file should download, albeit slowly.<br /><br />I finally uninstalled the app.  I guess I will never know what I am missing.<br /><br />Update:  After reading a comment from another reviewer I downloaded the tablet version of Swiftkey and it works as expected.  So the takeaway from this is to make sure you get right product version for your device type.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great game for a quick fix of nothing to do. does get pretty hard so upgrade quickly and repair often.
0738212415|5.0|this book is excellent  and teaches necessary skills for drawing in an easy to understnd format and I would def recommend it!
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I have all the seasons and I would recommend this  series to everybody that loves to watch medical and human interacting.
B009AP4MGE|3.0|I liked this season enough to watch it but don't LOVE it like I loved the first couple of seasons.  There are WAY too many characters to have a real story and there's just too much going on.  It's also super corny and too much &#34;Trying to teach a lesson&#34; and trying to be too politically correct.  Still love the songs tho.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Good back pack for SLR Camera for me!<br />It's very convenient for me to carry on all of rens & cameras,etc.
0143036270|5.0|There is no substitute for reading this book yourself. You need to understand the philosophy on a personal level. Recommend.
B00013RC8O|4.0|Have not had time to watch yet. However I have several friends that have seen it and its great for everyone to watch especially if you like fast driving
0544002318|4.0|I'm a weekend warrior trail and middle distance runner, and I enjoyed this book, while placing it in context.  Some reviewers rated the book low because it did not have enough \\"how to\\" or instructional content.  I never thought it would, and always expected it to be a personal narrative, not a coach-in-a-book.  Any memoir or autobiography is bound to be author-centric.  Of course it was about his accolades.  I appreciated Scott discussing his failed marriage, and hopefully temporary falling-out with Dusty, in reflection without violating privacy of the parties involved.  Regarding his veganism, I thought it was well balanced from his point of view, and discussed well how HE came to that life decision.  Some in that lifestyle are obnoxious proselytizers; Jurek did not come off that way to me.  I wasn't looking for coaching, just a satisfying story about a hobby/passion of my own.  I found it.  It did provide motivation to keep pounding out the miles, and to be mindful of my own diet, omnivorous as it may be.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Had its funny moments, and good pointers for everyday life and relationships. Good read, i will definitely recommend to friends.
B00EABEHF4|1.0|This book is very incomplete and does not have any information on large areas of the Philippines.It fails to even mention several provinces. For example no mention of Surigao Del Sur and next to nothing about the huge southern island of Mindanao.<br /><br />Some nice photos and some information on major tourist sites on Luzon and elsewhere but little more.<br /><br />My advice is don't bother getting it.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|It's a epic movie that's worth at least one watch. There are many aspects to this film, not only the naval battles, but music and culture  are interwoven into the story.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game.  Everyone in the family likes to play this game. Even the four year plays every now and then.
0143124544|4.0|I just finished the Game of Thrones books and needed something light to start over with and Me Before You was the perfect book.  Like others who've reviewed here, you can guess what is going to happen at the end but when a book makes you laugh and cry at the same time it is worth sticking with and finishing.  I enjoyed this book and will probably read her other book as well.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy has kept up the highest level of great story telling in Threat Vector.  The nearly 900 pages seem daunting<br />at first opening but move along very quickly.  The two Jack Ryans keep their place as American Patriots the likes of which we could use a few more of in today's badly broken government.<br />y
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I am not sure I would have become aware of this work had it not been the flap about the FOX news interview with the author. This work puts the origins of Christianity into a cultural and historical context which makes sense to me. I had intuitively sensed that a story such as this was more likely than the myths surrounding the early Jesus but this reasoned work put it all together. A must read.
B00C061HZY|4.0|I really Love this album, but the Vinyl LP don´t come with the bonus track Horizon, song :( this is so sad...
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Great little device, seems reasonably accurate on the distance, so so on the elevation change. The sleep feature is pretty cool, but I'm not sure what it is good for.<br /><br />The case has a couple of minor scuffs from my pocket so I'm deducting a star, otherwise a 5-star product.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Really enjoy.  Every song is good - not just the three on the radio.  Definitely worth it for under $10.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I have no idea why I watched this movie tonight. I assumed it would be akin to me watching a 2 hour cartoon... i figured I'd have it shut down within 15 mins. but, instead I had a really great time, start to finish. My sweetie and I LOVED LOVED LOVED Michael Jackson's &#34;This Is It&#34; movie/documentary and I would never have expected to enjoy this one nearly as much. Can't wait to &#34;force&#34; my guy to watch this with me...little will he realize that he will love it. I never realized what a major talent Katy is. Her lyrics are truly thoughtful and incredibly intelligent. Love this girl and all those around her. Good for her... :)
B002R27J1W|5.0|First time I saw this movie with my sister-in-law, we scared each other when we both screamed at the same time when the bad guy jumped out of the darkness. If you haven't seen it yet... have fun!
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|This was a cool movie but it seems like something was missing at the end. Entertaining nonetheless. Cool special effects.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game brings the fun of bingo to you. I play on both a tablet and a pc. Try it, you will be hooked!
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|I don't understand Amazon attaching Jack Ryan in parentheses next to the book title.  Jack Ryan has no part in this novel other than a very vague, background mention.  The primary protagonist in this novel is Jack Ryan's previous CIA body guard, John Clark, along with his protege Domingo Chavez.<br />Regardless, Tom Clancy has written another very good book.  To see two very good reviews of this book scroll back to the top of this web page and read the Editorial Reviews, from Amazon.com Reviews and From Publishers Weekly.  Both are spot on.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|the game looks amazing but I have one problem I really want to play it but I let it load for 15 minutes and it was still loading so if it a glicth they should fix it or are kindel is slow or its just on the first time u play
B000FCKIFU|2.0|Interesting story which could have been written better with good editing.  I may read the next  installment  but not soon.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|The packaging is beautiful - color coordinated DVD for each season , labeling of what is on each DVD<br />and the best of all 'Columbo' - there were re-runs on TV many years ago -no more, so having my own library is great!<br />the only thing I am not sure - I do not think the DVD are in HD . HD would many it even better.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love cut the rope! when i saw that it was the free app of the day i shreiked!! omg!!! get it!! its soo addicting!
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Didn't feel caught up in the story.  Acting was stilted/mediocre.  Movie leans on CGI to pull in viewers.  Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's great game that's really simple just don't let the incoming missiles hit your buildings. The best part is that it's simple and provides endless fun and entertainment. I highly recommend it for kids.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I suppose that birth-death is life's grand theatre in a nutshell, but the theme was hard to handle in Season 3. Matthew's death, despite outside issues, was very hard to justify after the earlier birth mother's death; this one seemed way to forced. The end of this Season made the show feel like a century-old soap opera.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Better then the original. It had a good pace, and awesome fight sequences. Better then the original. It had a good pace, and awesome fight sequences.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Dave Grohl has outdone himself with this engaging story that traces the history of Sound City studio. Legends like Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, Nirvana and many other iconic American musicians over a twenty year span all owe this building a huge debt with its state of the art mixing board.  The studio may not have been pretty,  but the sounds it produced were amazing. A must have for all musical fans.
B005PK553C|3.0|08-30-13<br /><br />I was there, and I was interested, but it didn't last.  The storyline was interesting at the begining.  I kept watching each successive episode but then I kept seeing the same acts again and again that it began to interfere with the attentiveness to the story.  To keep it short, I got bored to the point that I no longer cared.  I seriously doubt if I will go back to looking at the show.  If you can stick it out, go for it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|downloaded for my grandchildren but am having a blast myself.  cant wait 2 see how they are going 2 like it.  good tunes 2
B004T5R2HQ|2.0|Will not work on my Galaxy S4. I am not doing anything different, it just never processes the images.<br /><br />Can we get an update?<br /><br />UPDATE: I have the license through Amazon and you can run the version from the Google Play Store that actually works with my device. The app is great, Amazon just needs to get the updated version in their Appstore! Come on developer!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game so far but the bad reviews claim it has malware and ads begin to show up after five days so I'm a little worried. Will update...
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very suspenseful with lots action. Shows lots of blood and gore so be prepared! Leaves you wanting more each episode!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Beautiful location, interesting characters, attention to period detail make up for the implausible plot and stilted dialogue.<br />It is very watchable and entertaining
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a fantastic time playing this game. It's a truly wonderful puzzle. I can't wait until the next levels are released.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|The show was great BUT I COULD ONLY GET THE FIRST TWO SHOIWS WHAT HAPPEHNED TO THE REST OF THE YEAR???<br />How do you get a full year of a show???.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Love the large profile, very easy to use and easy on the eyes; the default decimal function is a bit annoying, but otherwise a great product
140006922X|3.0|It was interesting to read and I did agree with parts of it but also did not accept other parts. I think that it is impossible to know what the life of Jesus was like because there are no eye whitness written accounts of his life. None of the gospels were written by people who knew Jesus. It seems that the author did as best he could with the little he had to work with.<br />  Norm Russell
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am in love with this game not just because it's fun but because I'm obsessed with unicorns and the fluffy unicorn power up is amazing!!!!!!!!! But one thing that confuses me is who is Meena????? She wasn't in either of the movies!!!!!!<br />  UNICORNS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Arrived on time and as described.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have all the versions and never get tired of trying to beat my score. Lots of fun and a challenge.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It was very short but an easy reading book.  My grandma bought it for me and I really like the wimpy kid series.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie is amazing.  No, I didnt' see the live plays and to be honest, never knew the story before I saw the movie.  I am glad I saw it in the theater first...something about seeing the faces of the actors.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The girl on fire, consumes the Capitol. Anymore would be a spoiler, but what a mind trip this final book is.
B00846REIS|5.0|Fast paced gripping story, couldn't put it down.  Great read on my vacation.  Can't wait to read more from this author.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I have always had trouble writing things down, lost so many songs from my head trying to find pen and paper. But I am a song writer and a story writer. This little app is huge on the inside. What a relief to just turn it on during prayer when I start hearing the song in my head, then singing it for our house church when the amens are done, recording it. It has been a blessing. Thank you, Amazon.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so incredibly well done.  I can't believe how much effort they put into a television show!  It will be around forever.
B002N7RAH4|5.0|I have seen all three films in the &#34;Cornetto Trilogy&#34; and think this is the best of the bunch - yerp!
B002U0KHMY|5.0|This story will hook you from the very first episode. Give it a try. It is AMAZING. You will fall in love with the show and the cast. They are all awesome and have great chemistry. Matt Bomer is one amazing actor, actually the whole cast is. I love this show and recommend it to everyone I meet!
B002361MLA|5.0|This is an amazing book. Not the story format that Paulo Coehlo has but the message is incredible. This book has the ability to teach you how to bring peace into your life.
0525953728|5.0|good book. get it for my husband's birthday.  he loved it. will read it when he get done with the book.  good job ebay<br />  thank you victoria
B00006CXSS|5.0|great set to have. makes a really good gift for anyone interested in a good show. would buy again .
B008K9SG9K|5.0|So many great songs and lyrics put onto one cd. I cannot get enough of this band. They are amazing. All the songs are great. If you're into any of their songs you've heard on the radio, or this genre, you will not be disappointed by this CD. I recommend this to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the hunger game trilogy! Every book is exciting! This last book is very suspensful but very good and in the end it makes it all worth reading! Hope u will read also and enjoy as much as I!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am totally obsessed with Angry Birds.  I know it has been out for quite awhile but it's new to me.  I love the graphics and the picture comes across so great on my Kindle.  This game is addictive and frustrating when you can't clear a level but well worth the money and time you will spend playing this game.
B00ERFCX04|5.0|I was shocked to find this at Wal-Mart on my way to work as everyone said it was being released on 9/13. Needless to say, I picked up 2 of them for $23 each and my daughter went through the roof with joy. This is a very nicely designed doll - meticulously detailed, and as my wife said, the dress is \\"fabulous\\" and the boots are \\"va-va-voom!\\". What's not so great is trying to remove the doll from the packaging - that was an experience. Tip: cut everything from the back of the package, this way, you will minimize the likelihood of cutting something off the doll. I highly recommend using krazy glue to hold the microphone to the doll's hand as the microphone falls off easily and can get lost. All in all, a very nice doll. Your daughter will love it.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fantastic band, fantastic music and although I love them myself, I bought this as a gift to my husband and he LOVES them. He won't stop playing this cd. The lyrics are great. I recommend this cd to everyone who enjoys the band or bands like Fun!
B0036S4C6G|1.0|Mundane, disjointed,  a memorial to the vacuous  &#34;me&#34; generation and worthy of a thumbs down by the Pulitzer rejection committee.
1446302474|4.0|I found this book fascinating.  It contains many ideas for use of various fabrics which I hope do use  to use when making my crazy quilting pillows.  The directions are clearly demonstrated with pictures and diagrams.  I is fun to see how many ways fabric can be used creatively.  My skills are not nearly as expert as those of Ruth Singer, but with the clear demonstrations provided, I hope to try to incorporate some of them in my work.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites that Clint has done.  Clint did a excellent job acting and directing the film.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|West is always challenging, sometimes annoying with his language, but he is a musical provocateur in the best of that sense. I recommend this to fans of hip-hop.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app gives the photographer lots of control<br />over the editing and final look of his / her photos. Illike it and recommend it.
B003U4ZQRK|3.0|Seasons 1-3 were so awesome, we got hooked, but seasons 4 and 5 are just ridiculous. Season 6 is better.
0764137433|5.0|Excellent reference.  Easy to use.  I used it to look up words as I used Rosetta Stone and found it extremely helpful.  Excellent supplement.  I found it useful when I was new to the language, but now that I know how to conjugate verbs, this book is even more helpful.  It was difficult to use as an absolute beginner but still useful.  But as an intermediate user, which I am now it is incredibly useful.  I can lok at the conjugations and see the patterns clearly.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Interesting, but extremely long for the content.  Was hard to get through at points, but I really enjoyed it at other times.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love this movie and I love that Amazon Instant Video made it available to me even before it was out on DVD/Blu-Ray
B009JZSFUY|4.0|Most  of the plots of other Star Trek movies are filled with violence and subterfuge leading to destruction of one or more ships.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This is one of the best mob movies ever made in my opinion. The soundtrack is entertaining as well. I can't believe I waited all this time to see this film.
B000NY12LO|3.0|Was excited to read this, but it turned out to be very similar to two other books I already read.  The story line is kind of played out.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|if you liked the first one this one will def be worth watching great movie with a lot laughs i recommend to anyone.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|This is a very good series that will appeal to fans of &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; and &#34;The Wire.&#34;  Many have traced the trend in male anti-hero TV dramas to &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; and  &#34;Mad Men&#34; but this series pre-dates both of these.
B001NLKWLW|2.0|This author left plot lines unresolved, jumped around too much, plopped in characters, and meandered too much.  This book is not wot
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Great to read if you are in a relationship and want to understand your mate more thoroughly.  Encourage you and your significant other to read.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|After much ado about the movie I decided to read the book everyone was talking about. The book is chalk full of fantasy, demons, and unbridled teen sexual tension. The movie however, is lackluster and 'loosely' based on this story. Read the book for $4.99 and save yourself the $10 movie ticket and bring to life these characters in the comfort of your own home.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|Cool try but it Just wasn't fun but I like the idea i found it to be very boring I cannot recommend buying this game.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great characters. Somewhat repetitive in descriptors and phrasing, but overall a fun and intriguing read. Would definitely read other books by E.L. James.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I had no expectations when I purchased this book, I found that it was a pleasant read with some great messages.  I will watch the for the work of this author.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Thought the fairy section was a little long but the book is one of the best I have read in a long time.  Loved book 1 and can't wait for book 3.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Wonderful mac laptops - that don't have optical drives nor ethernet ports.  So my daughters both have a sleek machine with cables sticking out everywhere.  But this review is about the adapter :-) which worked without fail.  Just as you'd expect.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I have been waiting to see if it would go on sale and it payed off.  Phillip has a sound all his own and I love it.  What more can I say.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Since the service and the fast delevery, highly recomend it!!!!<br /><br />If you need a cable for your kindle dont hesitate to buy it.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is a hit, silly with heart!  It made the whole family feel good, I would recommend it to anyone.
0553106635|4.0|The dialogue and detail of the settings is a joy. The attention to detail makes it interesting and intriguing<br />I would recommend this book and the other 4 in this series.
B0036EH3U2|1.0|After watching the entire Battlestar Galactica series I felt an acute need<br />to express my revulsion. It's probably too late for anyone to ever read<br />this review, but if you are out there - Save yourself!<br />Read on and put the remote control down.<br /><br />This series is not ruined by plot holes so much as it is nothing but a<br />super-massive plot hole riddled with fractal plot holes seamlessly<br />descending on ever-smaller scales down to the smallest observable<br />level. Whereas many good stories are ruined by glaring plot holes,<br />Battlestar Galactica is more plot hole bonanza made all the more<br />irritating by occasional glimpses of interesting plot concept. But fear<br />not, Dear Viewer. All morsels of quality are wrung out of the show by<br />the later seasons arrive.<br /><br />Early on in this reboot we encounter some big plot holes, but they are<br />the sort of thing we can overlook if they lead on to good<br />story-telling. For example, the Cylon \\"skin jobs\\" are said to be<br />indistinguishable from humans even under medical examination such as<br />X-rays, CAT scans, DNA tests etc. Yet the \\"skin jobs\\" can communicate<br />with one another and their base ships with some sort of radio<br />transmissions. (Which, by the way, travel over interstellar distances<br />immediately.) This is just to name one super-power which they do w/o<br />any detectable special organs or mechanism to accomplish such feats.<br /><br />OK, fine. We can overlook that sort of stuff if it leads to a gripping<br />drama of what it really means to be human vs robot or some other<br />interesting slice of life. But we are not allowed to do so, because<br />this series commits the fatal sin of having plot holes shoot dead other<br />existing plot holes. If a scene in an episode needs a \\"skin job\\" to<br />overpower a human, the Cylon does so. Pow! Of course the Cylon has<br />super-strength ... they're machines! But if the next scene needs a<br />drag- out fight suddenly human and \\"skin job\\" strengths are evenly<br />matched. Because ... well ... you weren't supposed to ask that<br />question.<br /><br />The refugee humans have only five nuclear warheads left in one episode.<br />in another the humans rain them down on the Cylons. In one episode<br />ships are \\"built to withstand nuclear blasts\\" and do so several times.<br />In another a single nuke blows up its target as well as 2-3 nearby<br />ships for good measure.<br /><br />Well, you get the idea.<br /><br />Now apply the same flaws to character motivations. Never agree to play<br />a drinking game where you must chug every time a character pulls a gun<br />on a fellow crew-member or friend. If you watch an episode where a<br />character stubbornly insists a certain thing must be done, be assured<br />at at the 38 minute mark that character will abruptly decide to do the<br />opposite thing. Keep an eye on the DVD clock and amaze your friends.<br /><br />Most every single character the writers needs the viewer to like, isn't<br />likable. It's not the fault of bad acting - usually. There's enough of<br />that to go around, but mostly it's the fault of cheesy writing and the<br />aforementioned plot lurches. Put simply, these characters are idiots.<br />How they avoid piloting their ships into a star is a mystery. Actually<br />by the time it's all wrapped up they manage that too.<br /><br />But the worst part of all is this sci-fi story has no sci-fi in it at<br />all. It does not even qualify as science fantasy. As the series goes on<br />the finite number of monkeys hammering randomly upon their finite<br />number of typewriters rely more and more upon visions and divine will.<br />It's hard to stay mad at the monkeys. There was really no other way to<br />extract the series from the preposterous mess it had become.<br /><br />One of many odd, perplexing, gratuitously violent and annoying vanity<br />cards runs after the end credits in every episode. These providethe<br />perfect wormy cherry to top off every excruciating viewing experience.<br />Which allows me an opening to praise the production team. They miss no<br />opportunity to be bad.<br /><br />What's that? Praise from me for some aspect of Battlestar Galactica? We<br />must be at the 38 minute mark in this review. Were your friends<br />impressed with your predictions?
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It wasn't what I expected, but I really liked it. I couldn't imagine where it would go and how it could possibly end with any kind of resolution, but suddenly, it did. I thought about this book for days afterward. How people can be frail and make mistakes, but how the love of your family can get you through. Beware though... the resolution is not delightful. I particularly enjoyed the Epilogue. It is interesting how seemingly insignificant details can have monumental consequences.
030758836X|5.0|Really enjoyed the book, it was exactly what I was expecting when I placed the order. Good read.  Recommend to all.
0553801473|4.0|This entire series kept my attention...and I was sorry it finished.But...the author left an opening for the series<br />to continue...and I hope it does. Well written and interesting.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Every student and teacher must read this book. It should be required reading at all schools. One of my favorite books ever.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I laughed out loud, enjoyed the several twists in the plot, and felt good about a buddy-buddy relationship. Smart and fun.
B003Y6EL5W|1.0|You would think the support at Amazon Instant Video would be able to provide the support you need. After calling and them trying to help my problem tried to fix it but didn't get it and just hung up. Later I got an Email that said he fixed it and when I looked to see if I could get it. It was still the same and I never got anything in my Library. Amazon has gone Down hill and I've switched my streaming to redbox and netflix.
B002L5GQGY|1.0|the CD has no music on it..completely blank.  Tried to play it on several players and there is no music on either cd<br />what a waste of money....hate buying on line sometimes when things like this happen...
0316017930|5.0|Well written and concise. It is a required reading for all who want to change their outlook on life. I highly recommend it!
174179918X|4.0|I will know definitely how much I could depend on the guide when I have finished my trip, which will be next summer/fall of 2014
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is definitely one of the best games on the vita and is well worth the price you pay for it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love these books. Great writing from a fiction writer. This is not normally my thing but I thoroughly enjoy these books and look forward to reading the next one.
140006922X|5.0|love what the book is about.  love how it's written.  would recommend it to friends wo are interested in that subject.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|I think it was overrated. I visited the copper canyon last October and did not see one Tamahuara Indian, only women and children.<br /><br />And they look all very unhappy. When I asked the guide: &#34;Where are all the men?&#34; The answer was: &#34;They are drinking tequila.&#34;
B00EDF43MY|2.0|I thought I was downloading a time management game, but no. It's exclusively for children with the exception of all the pushing for ratings. Maybe that's what the dev intended. If so, that's a cheap move.
B000001ELL|5.0|I don't care what ANYONE says, this album has some awesome tunes on it and I can listen to them ALL from first to last with ease! I loved the album when it first came out and all my friends hated it and I love it to this day, MANY years later! I love the tunes by Gene & Paul (as usual) but I love the tunes by Peter AND Ace even more! Sure Peter was on his way out and Anton Fig played too much on this album but with the way things were going with this hugely popular band, it just wasn't in the cards and the fact that Peter didn't play on it enough is the LONE issue I have with it! I could care less about the whole disco vibe that everyone who hates it tries to bring up but the trend effected just about everyone in music during that time, so it's not surprising that it made it's presence known in some of these songs. I actually like it, because it did help KISS come up with a little different sound on the album, which is a great thing after they put out so many albums that basically sounded exactly like all the others. Now don't get me wrong I loved all those albums to but I'm just saying there is nothing wrong with mixing things up every now and then, especially when the songs still rock, and imo these most certainly do!! Stand out tracks include: Dirty Livin', 2000 Man, Hard Times, Sure Know Something, Charisma, and of course the mostly hated (except for me) - I was made for lovin' you! If you have spurned this because of all the negative reviews but you love you some KISS, do yourself a favor and give it a good listen, especially know that it is out in a remastered form (which I have yet to hear but all the other remastered albums I own from KISS sound amazing). You just might like it.......
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Waiting for the first cool and cozy weekend to have a Harry potter marathon.  Had all but the last 3 movies on DVD.  Wanted upgrade when I purchased the last ones.  Great deal.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Good action and subtle humor, first movie in a long time to hold my interest.<br />Hope they make another just as good.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played.  I relax and love match games with a purpose.  Please come out with a a second one.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great Read! And I loved taking my kindle for break times at work!<br />Easier to carry and slimmer then the actual book!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|How can you go wrong with Vince Gill singing Merle Haggard and Buck Owens Bakersfield sound.  Back to basics with good old traditional Country and Western
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is a taut thriller in the great style you expect of Lee Childs. The twist halfway in the plot that ultimately drives the story is really interesting and at the same time, has something to say about our country these days and the kind of thing that I could easily see happening on my more parinoid days.<br /><br />Had a hard time putting it down!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a big Stephen King fan!<br />That being said I would have liked this book no matter who wrote it!<br />I just couldn't put down.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Great book. This book is a great for pre-teen girls, teen girls or even women.  It takes one back to childhood dreams.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|This game just totally bored me.  Maybe it's because I'm 40, guess this is more for the kiddies??? Oh well.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I love this movie! The whole movie is very well done. I introduced my sister to the story using this movie.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I don't like to play any games on my kindle, but this one I enjoy. My daughter had it on her kindle and I have it on mine. Our levels are kept separate and it is fun to compare. My kindle was stolen and I am sad to have to restart the levels again after getting a new kindle. I thought it would have saved.<br /><br />Definitely fun and creative for all ages!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Hidden objects plus!  Nice to have little puzzle games as well. I am looking forward to unlocking all the world's and like that you can play each level several times as they keep changing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've tried many bingo game and this is by far the best. Just wish you didn't have to buy so much content with actual money. That being said it still is the most entertaining of the Bing games I found.
0316776963|5.0|There are times when you want to hate him but you can't because you love him so much. This is a witty book. Not for everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My three year old loves this game and so does my husband!  Easy to use,and it has many different levels.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I gave it five stars because it was the best book I've ever read on this subject.  I can't wait till I'm at the seminar!! Thank you!
B003ES61EE|5.0|This product works as well as can be expected.  It hasn't scratched or harmed my lenses in any way.  I like that it is dual tipped.  Would recommend.
0307341550|5.0|This book has a good twist ending. I can usually guess the murder within the first half of the book. I didn't see this one comming.
B00EEDJM2Q|1.0|Cannot seem to open this app.  Not sure why - it just does not work.  Perhaps this is the reason it is FREE!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the different challenges it offers and the different minions you can bump up to!  My kids love playing it too.  They all had to add it to there various electronics
B00338QENI|4.0|Interesting real life story Henrietta Lacks and her impact in the medical field. Unfortunately Henrietta didn't receive the credit she deserved.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Would recommend to all. Typical nerve racking Clancy. Also informative from an insider perspective as to how things work on the government side of our lives.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An inside the head look at how someone sees his own war. A personal look at coping with the business of killing in an unpopular conflict and how it affects one man.
B00000JBFW|5.0|Not a huge fan of Deep Purple, but had this cassette in the past given to me from a friend. I love every song on it, especially the title track. They are a great band and every song on this album rocks and sounds great. I may eventually get all of their albums.
B003Y5H5AG|3.0|I really didn't care much about the Smurfs in the Saturday morning run of cartoons, this is a little better but not much.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Keeps my brain active, always thinking! Lots of focus and determination. My grandkids and everyone who I introduce Flow to loves it.
0060775858|5.0|This item is really very good, and I like it very much! It was really useful for me, thank you!
B00CXQL828|5.0|If they put out another album, I hope they play maybe a slightly different style of music so they can show off a little bit more. The album is great, but one might expect a little bit more of their virtuosity. You have three rock gods together in one band. They definitely held back a little on this album. I would definitely buy their next album if they were to put one out though.
B005F3XV62|2.0|I think my subject pretty much sums up my opinion of the movie.  Kind of like Mr. Popper's Penguins...it was a disappointment when I actually watched it.  Went into my collection to be viewed again sometime in the next 10 years or so.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Classic Tarantino. I enjoyed every moment of this movie, the story is well written, Jamie Foxx, DiCaprio, and Jackson nail their roles, it was bloody violent, and just well written... I was thoroughly entertained!
068987751X|5.0|This item is really very good, and I like it very much! It was really useful for me, thank you!
0061122416|5.0|It is a great book, and very fast. It's for my English class, the professor recommended this book to us.
B004EPZ03E|3.0|This one just didn't do a lot for me.  I'm thinking that this should be the last of this series, but who knows.  #1 and #2 both were better.
B008XTVWHK|5.0|At the turn of the century, in a sleepy Mexican town, a Wild West show struggling to make ends meet, makes a discovery of the coming century when they acquire a tiny creature called an Eohippus,a \\"Dawn Horse\\", and make plans to showcase the little wonder to the world in a new act. The problem is, for such a tiny animal,he manages to bring a huge bag of trouble for his owner, Miss TJ Breckenridge. Enter Tuck Kirby, a man who seeks a fast buck, and TJ's interest seeking to buy the horse she has in her featured act. The other man in her life, Carlos, is jealous and quietly seething at Kirby's return and the fact that he has walked in so smoothly.In the meantime,Kirby sees the little horse, but doesn't realize its significance until his young guide and friend little Lopez leads him to make the acquaintance of Professor Bromley.Throughout this Tia Zorina,an old blind Gypsy woman comes upon them at times threatening them that Gwangi's curse hangs over all of them unless they release the little horse back from where they got him.When they refuse, she takes matters into her own hands and with the sly professor's help, she has the gypsy band kidnap the little horse.<br />In the chase to get him back, the circus hands discover the Forbidden Valley and one surprise after another, none of them really good.When they try to capture an Ornithomimus, they discover the true beast of the valley, an Allosaurus.Several attempts to catch it fail and Carlos is killed as they try to flee from it. It manages to knock itself unconscious in a rockfall and they finally cage it to bring it into town. When the old Gypsy appears again, she repeats her curse and during the opening act, she again takes matters into her own hands once more, this time to truly disastrous results as the freed creature goes on a rampage through the town. This was a rather unusual movie with a western theme and HarryHausen's effects were never better, especially in the fight with the elephant and earlier, the Styracosaurus back in the valley. This is one of his best, a true classic, along with \\"Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\", \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and many others that brought viewing pleasure both in the theatre and at home on Movie Monster nights. This is a collectable gem with a great story. The Eohippus and Gwangi have never been livelier.urus back in the valley.

B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Guitar work is superb, keys, bass and drums top notch as expected.  Steven is even is fine voice for the most part - a couple of little hiccups, but hey, I couldn't do it!  Thanks guys!  Memphis Loves Kenny Wayne Shepherd -- but he knows that.  Steven -- you have to come back to town soon!!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Talk about colorful and with the storyline, you'll pretty much forget you're watching a CGI movie...though you know what you see isn't possible in real life.  Just a fun movie to watch all around...I'd rate it up there with Monster's, Inc, and Cars.
0618526412|5.0|Easy read. Book was mentioned in the movie-love song for Bobby Long and was described as a book about misfits. I agree with the description.  It was a book that could have been written about any place in America, at any time. I enjoyed it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Good time waster I am enjoying the graphics. It I s not often that I find a gr8 game that's free, based on a movie, and appeals to both me AND my sons. Awesome
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I love Downton Abbey so when we saw all of season one and two I was bummed. Then I saw Amazon could stream it and was delighted. Then I found I had to buy it. Well, ok, I bought it reluctantly. Then I find the software does not support hdmi or Apple TV. So we have to watch it on the iPad. Bad deal. I would wait to buy it until they get their software upgraded to watch it on a regular sized tv.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|I'm sort of a cat fancier and did like the Puss in Boots character.  Very charming movie and it's one I'll watch from time to time.  No, don't have any kids...it's just for me.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|It keeps you wanting more. I Love it! Best show ever! Hard to wait for the next episode each week.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A page turner.  Keeps interest.  Great characters. Good story telling  Enjoyed the epilogue. Nice touch.  Will definitely recommended to others.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was a great page turner and I have shared the book with 2 friends already!  Perfect for a weekend or vacation.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The print was so small that I couldn't read it so I deleted it immediately.  I am new to Android, so maybe there was a setting to enlarge the font, but I don't care.  Most software programs today are inadequate time wasters and I didn't want to take the time to figure this one out.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|An excellent read. As usual the book as another, excellent, written Novak by JamesRollins. I highly recommend bis books to anyone that enjoys a fast moving, adventures read. Lionel  Bergeron
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I must admit however that I found trying to sort all the different characters very confusing.  That being said I just ordered book 2.
B008UZ7MUI|1.0|The 3D is not much better than using your TV to convert a 2D. I had this in blue ray 2D and bought the 3D expecting it be be same quality as part 2, it is not. Also picture quality is poor and grainy.<br />If you have this in 2D don't upgrade.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I like the fast pace motion of the game. It's very clean with swiping the jewels. I am enjoying it.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love this app. I think all Kindles should come equipped with it but I'm glad I purchased the app because I love taking pictures.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love it.  I play every day.  Its easy to undestand, you canstop and go back later just plain fun.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Ending is wonderful and different.  Enjoy the flying and scenery.  Would not mind having a house, I guess would need to make a whole lots of money.  Still, nice &#34;digs&#34;.
0425263924|4.0|The story is okay....the first 2 books in the series were a bit better, this one is more a bridge to the final book.  If you are reading the series and enjoy the characters you'll like the story.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|As usual King is wordy but as always paints an intriguing picture with an a bang at the end and never disappoints.
B001THZAAI|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It was a great comedic movie and the best part about it is that it didn't seem like it was forced or fake. The comedy seem natural and real.
B0000X2DMA|4.0|Long or short trips, crank the volume up, but watch the speed.  Love the metal and classic sounds while trying to drive.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|Hot Fuzz is a lot of fun. Simon Pegg is excilent and the plot is fun in this comedy Great
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is very addicting and a good challenge to complete each city.  I just wish they would add rooms a little more often.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|The Mission is one of my favorite movies. Not only is the story and acting excellent....the scenery is just beautiful!
B005LAIH2M|4.0|After reading the children's version many moons ago, just wanted to see what the modern version has for me to watch.
B00EOO55GW|2.0|This is a poor attempt by A7X. I mean really bad. I've been a fan since City of Evil, and this is total shit. Heavily focused on M Shadows vocals, and not enough from the guitars nor drums. I hate to say it but Avenged may have died when the Rev did. (RIP)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|really enjoyed this game a lot. was entertained for hours. big fish makes really good games. can't wait for many more new games to come out
B00DLKXF3A|2.0|I received my copy of Hail to the king yesterday in the mail. When I opened the box and removed the protective plactic from the album I noticed that the cover was ripped. I know it shouldn't matter but when you buy something new it should come in mint condition.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|I will take it at face value what occur, occurred.  Just makes one wonder if certain action in real life is &#34;hard to believe&#34; or we just believe too much &#34;un-real&#34; live action on the movie screen.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The legal adventures of Mike and Harvey are very entertaining.  Although Mike's lack of law degree is not fully plausable; (ie: what is his bar number and how can he file pleadings without one) the hugely entertaining stories make you forget those inconsistent details.  In fact, the story would lose it's punch, if Mike was fully legit.  Just buckle up,  and enjoy the ride.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. It is filled with tons of levels. This game is very addicting. I will have to get Cut the Rope Time Travel and Experiments too. This is much better than Feed The Dino( basically a copy of this game) .<br />By the way I'm listening to &quot;I Love It&quot; right now on my Kindle :)

B006ZT47O0|4.0|Love the metal and classic sounds while trying to drive.  Hopefully I would be a speeding ticket listening to the tunes too much.  Makes my foot press harder on the gas.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I am tired of technical things I switch to this game for immediate rest and relaxation. It releases system overload.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I just downloaded this app and its awesome on my kindle fire! It's a little upsetting that u gotta pay for the full version, I recommend this version to everyone.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|My wife had never seen this movie and we made it our movie night. It was hard to not laugh at the hilarious parts I knew were coming up, but I wanted her to enjoy it. :-)<br /><br />Fantastic movie!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Action you have a idea What Mr. Willis will be doing, it's how the action is done is what catches you.  Good (not the best) Bruce Willis movie.
B007AL48UK|5.0|This app is a wonderful addition for your tablet. Great for your mind, memory, eye and hand coordination, and keeping your cognitive skills sharp.  It's a great challenge and loads of fun.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I didn't read it.  My Grandson put it on my Kindle.  Then on my request, he removed it.  I don't care for that type of book.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|The item was packaged well and in great condition. It arrived early and I cant wait to listen to it. If you love FFDP then this is a must buy item. I have listened to a few songs and I am not disappointed.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|This movie was garbage.  The only thing that makes it a \\"Star Trek\\" movie is the use of character names.  There's nothing else about the movie that links it to the original series.  There are also massive plot holes.<br />But that's not the worst part.  The movie just isn't intelligent.  It doesn't say anything except let's blow stuff up and yell loudly.  The opening scene is Kirk and McCoy desecrating a holy relic of a pre-industrial civilization.  What?!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|The movie does indeed kick some ass. Great concept for a movie and well done in most aspects. I only rated 4 stars instead of 5 because it's more a starting movie to a series that hopefully will continue. Yes... yet another trilogy? But it can't be helped. You will laugh. You will cry. You will yell YES! Kick his ass!!
B00DHKKN6Q|1.0|Right after it downloaded my Lockout Anti-virus on my kindle warned me it wad adware, so I deleted it. Just thought it'd be good to let everyone  know
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I'd been recommended to watch this, as a far of Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters... great movie, and a heck of a lot of rock'n'roll history packed into it.
B00ARX2W24|5.0|Herba Alpert goes between quality and just plain pop hits.  This one has both.  The music is some of his best.  And there are a couple of hits that came from this.  The remastering is superb.  Very Clear! His Trumpet playing is both playful and sultry depending on the song.<br /><br />Buy it and you will agree!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I think rick did very well in this book cant wait till the next one :)<br />It is that good
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|Evil Dead returns to its horror roots. The remake suffers from the lack of Raimi or Campbell's involvement. They are associated with this film but their personal stamp of approval doesn't seem to be on it. Raimi's influence doesn't show up and Campbell appears in the end credits. It's almost as if they were hired solely to promote the film. The good news is that it is very gory. The bad news is that they don't take it to the next level. This is not the cabin in the woods I was expecting. The Evil Dead was legendary as a horror film. I can still connect with the original or sequel (you don't see that camera work everyday). It's so much fun and scared the wits out of people in the 1980s (it was the #1 movie rented in more than one country for at least a year). It revolutionized the demonic POV shots that grab you. The remake is fairly loyal to the original storyline. It unfolds almost exactly the same way with different camera work and actors. Some of the best elements of the original are here (e.g. the perverted pencil and basement zombie) but they just seem inserted and not crucial to the plot.<br /><br />Ultimately the remake doesn't offer more story or character development and is much less memorable. It could have been amazing with Raimi's involvement. After all, he made some awesome movies on a low-budget and then became a big success in Hollywood so he has learned so much since the 1980s. Yet he handed the directorial reins over to Fede Alvarez. The teens show up in an isolated cabin before the dead come to life. My main complaints are the acting, props, story and CGI. The cast is mostly forgettable. The acting featured one atrocious scene that reminded me of The Ring. This actress in a blue screen was whispering while surrounded by zombies with the music blaring full-blast. The scene either didn't support her, she was in the wrong movie or she simply lacked direction. The prop for the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) was rather lame. I'm not sure many demonologists use red magic markers to write in an ancient, priceless manuscript when they want a spell on summoning the dead. The CGI hollows out this movie to the point where so much is happening that you can't connect with the characters or action. This Blu-ray has about 39 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary (Director Fede Alvarez, co-writer Rodo Sayagues, Jane Levy, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas). That is fairly light treatment for such an iconic horror franchise. I must admit the Blu-ray picture quality is good and the audio is very good. I would be interested in purchasing an Evil Dead 1-4 box set on Blu-ray. Evil Dead fans deserve the deluxe treatment!ists use red magic markers to write in an ancient, priceless manuscript when they want a spell on summoning the dead.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best series I have seen in many years. Enjoy watching the lives of all the characters as they are played out.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The plot was unexpected and fast-paced. I can't say I enjoyed this book as much as the first one, it is still a good read.
B002MFV0UA|5.0|What an amazing movie, and what an amazing performance by Jimmy Stewart.  And what I wouldn't give to meet my own Pooka.<br /><br />After seeing the movie on TV for decades, this HD version was a shock - so much more detail is visible and the sound is more crisp and clear. A treasured addition to my library.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I have shown the movie to all my students and the characters are well constructed. My students love it. They burst out laughing at some of the scenes.

B00005ARDC|5.0|This is an outstanding first album. Normally great bands have first albums that display a sense of style not yet matured but this one is full fledged on its first inning. A great recommendation for anybody that likes the British classics whether it'd be from the 60s or the 90s.
1781162646|5.0|Excellent novel that grabs you from the beginning and makes it difficult to put down.  No wonder he is my favorite author.  Great story line with credible characters and situations.  Thank you Mr. King for yet another enjoyable read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The author skillfully keeps the reader guessing how the book will end...but the real clincher is the Prologue after the story. Makes the book unforgettable!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I don't like to talk about feasibility when it comes to action movies.  It seems silly to me to expect that the events in a fictional story should be 100% plausible.<br /><br />Instead, I judge them by how well they pull me in.  So, is the movie pretty believable? Yes  Are the details accurate enough? Yes  Does the movie give me a feel for the main character and maybe one or two others? Yes<br />Does the story interest me? Yes  Does it have a good balance between action scenes and drama/storyline? Yes<br />Do the actors do a good job with their parts? Yes<br /><br />The movie meets my requirements in that it's well done and has a good storyline, and not overdone with action scenes.  Tom Cruise performs his role perfectly, and almost every time that happens you get a 5 star movie worth watching more than once.<br /><br />No reason to comment on the picture and sound quality since it's a 2012 movie from Paramount so of course it's excellent on blu-ray
B001XULSG6|5.0|If you like Star Trek new gen then this one is incredible.  One of the best in the series.  Classic.

B008XKSW7M|2.0|Definitely not as funny as it should have been.i I was a bit disappointed. It did have a few funny moments though.
B008GWP2GG|4.0|We watch this movie many times over the years the expierance on amozon was a good one  with very little buffering at the beginning
B009AJD5E0|3.0|I've been waiting to see this movie for the longest time. I bought it for a plane ride to Florida, never got to see. Finally got home and started to watch it. At first the story line pulled me in but towards the end I was totally disappointed. This movie left me confused.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|This wa a no brainer to purchase the whole series of Spartacus.  I was hearbroken after Andy Whitfield passed way, to me he was Spartacus, but Liam stepped in and wouldn't ya know, he was a great Spartacus too!  Only thing that kills me about watching this show, esp with others, is someone always says &#34;Go Sparty&#34;.... well I'm a Univ of Mich grad and they Michigan State Spartans are rivals.  I threaten to kick my friends out of my house if they say it more than once :)
B0096HI226|2.0|Again another movie wanting to see and was totally disappointed. Maybe it's because I am old school! I guess they wanted to show that the main character didn't like his choice profession any longer. No need to show all those naked bodies more then the story. I totally regret purchasing this movie.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|Very interesting and it has plenty of action but can be a little slow at times. Otherwise a fun read.
0316017930|4.0|-----The Good Stuff-----<br /><br />-interesting and different<br />-makes you open up your mind<br /><br />-----The Bad Stuff-----<br /><br />-gets a little repetitive<br /><br />-----Other Comments-----<br /><br />As I read this book it helped me realize that there is more to success then we think. The book gives you may scenarios where people become successful and the book dissects how everything happened. It is a really interesting book, it will make you rethink how you view success in a way. (at least it did for me).<br /><br />Tipping point, Blink, were good books but this book in my opinion was the best out of the three. Gladwell uses psychological research and connects them with events from the past. &#34;Success is not really who you are, but it's where you are and how hard you work.&#34; He has produced a new way of looking at things. It explains that having a high IQ does not really mean you will be successful, it also shows how plane crashed happen.<br /><br />2 thumbs up on this book! Give it to your kids to read it is a great book.<br /><br />Review by Anthony Sarmiento
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|Until they talk about history - it's okya. When they start to show the recording of the new album it becomes very boring.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|As one new to tcg like MTG, Order &amp; Chaos really helps teach you strategies and how to play. I liked the ease of the tutorial. Graphics are awesome. Definitely a great game to try.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This a good movie without a lot of shoot 'em up action throughout. Good story. Really liked this one. Witherspoon in my opinion was not a high point of the flic but the rest of the cast did well.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|truly great fun movie, for all the family, 4 to 44+. watched it twice already, will watch it several more times I am sure.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game, lot's of puzzles to solve.  I've played other games like this and I must say, this is one of the best!
B005OCHOZS|4.0|As a runner training for her 1st marathon, this book was insightful and inspiring. An honest look at the life of an amazing runner
B008JFUO4U|2.0|As with most movies nowadays this started off promising, but then went down the cherry hill fast....<br />I liked the actors in it, but the story was very slow and a bit confusing. This flick dragged on forever as well, trying to take itself so serious but without any fun or inspired action. Nothing stood out. I'm still not sure what the movie is really about?
0061122416|5.0|What a pleasant way to spend a few hours.  A very good story with a great moral. Give this book to someone you care about when you finish.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Picture is amazing.  Good music and a good story.  This is one of my daughters favorites.  She also loves to dance to the music, particularly to the songs at the very end of the movie.  Add this one to your movie collection!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game everyday and I love it. Hope everyone else gets a chance to enjoy it as much as I have.
B004K00NMG|5.0|Watched this with my wife and daughter. My wife said she liked this movie and I have never seen it so I bought it to watch in my theater room.  Like that the movie has a 2.35 aspect ratio so I can fill up my cinemascope screen.  The movie picture quality is good on this bluray disc.  Music is quite good as well.  Not disappointed in this purchase.
B0026IQYEA|5.0|Good movie. lots of violence, but still a good plot.  not much else to says. just taking up space here

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Only problems with this game are;<br />1. Coins needed to play the game are earned by scratch cards every 45 mins (instead of automatically) and,<br />2. If you do not manually scratch the cards every 45 mins, the only way to get enough coins to continue playing is to buy coins.<br /> Otherwise, a great game, and just as fun as I remember as a child! :)
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The drama and fiction are very good. Most of the writing I fantastic. Good writers are worth it if you can hire them.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|This is a band that always tends to please the ear.  Their ACL episode was just outstanding.  I would highly recommend it.
0060516402|1.0|First of all, I'm an engineer and I'm new to business world. Grabbed a few highly rated business books from Amazon and trying to learn. After finished reading Competitive Strategy and Competitive Advantage by Michael Porter and immediately turn to this book. The authors have spent first 100 pages talking about the big objectives/core values of all the visionary companies and rated them how important to successful companies like Wal-Mart, 3M and etc. They also believe that a charismatic leader doesn't really required in a successful company. Even so, I feel that the ideas of this book presented are clearly not substantiated. 100 pages out of about 300 pages (minus off those index) boasting about objectives? While I do believe objective is important to a company but who doesn't know this? And to spend 6 years research to come out this conclusion, I believe this book is overhyped. To me, it is impossible to group all the successful companies which have different backgrounds, different economic cycle, experienced different technology evolution at different stage, and trying to come out a set of common successful criteria! I stopped reading at the chapter called Big Hairy Audacious Goals and decided enough is enough.
0399255370|5.0|Sent this to my 5 yr old grandchild who loves to draw.  Each crayon's letter is lengthy, so I suggested my son read it to her the first time through.  She enjoyed it and ended up drawing her own crayon characters.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Excellent start to a trilogy since it took parts from the first three ERB books. I like the way they integrated the first three books. Need more!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I did not have the opportunity to watch Fringe when it was on TV. A friend asked me to watch one episode and I was hooked
B004MPRWJG|3.0|A few days ago (before reading the novel) I read through many of the reviews on this site, including about half of the 1's. I know there are some legit 1's from people who truly felt the novel was terrible (and this next comment excludes you), but I feel many of them are coming from people who felt it didn't live up to the hype. That's no reason to rate a novel a 1. I think you have to truly believe a novel was done very poorly to give it a one. I would give this novel a 2.5 (if given the option) with the full understanding that how it affected me isn't how it will affect others. I think folks tend to forget that.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought this was an interesting novel. Sebold definitely created a mood with her unique style and she managed to continue it through most of the book. An impressive accomplishment in my opinion, even though I'm normally drawn to more concise writing. I didn't see a huge drop off from the midway point like many reviewers did, although the first half probably was more interesting.<br /><br />SPOILERS. Like many other reviewers, I found some of the actions of the characters unbelievable. For example, most fathers (and mothers) I know would have been all over the lead detective before and after the killer skipped town (especially when Lindsey found the drawing.) The fact that the father had flipped out that one time in the corn field wouldn't have changed that. And any police force in the US would have put intense pressure on Harvey after Lindsey found that drawing, especially with him being a strange man to begin with. That part was handled very poorly. The other huge flaw that jumped out at me was Susie coming back and using Ruth's body to have sex. Not the fact that she wanted to. That part seemed perfectly natural. Yes, as many others have said, she'd been raped and murdered, but that was 7 or 8 years ago (and along that same vein, mentally Susie wasn't fourteen anymore). She wanted to experience sex with someone she cared about. Who wouldn't? The part that bothered me was that she didn't get permission from Ruth. One can infer that Ruth loved her and would have granted it (and Sebold may have thought she'd made that clear), but she shouldn't have taken any chances there. And it wouldn't have been that hard to do. That is where a friend, agent, editor, husband should have stepped in and convinced her to change that. Conversely, many have hammered Sebold for the actions of the mother. While I think she would have been the extreme exception, I didn't find it unbelievable. She simply snapped and she was a little on the selfish side to begin with. I didn't love the way she handled her return but I didn't see it as a travesty either. I would have liked to get inisde her head more than we did.<br /><br />All in all, I found it to be an interesting if not entertaining novel. I'm a little surprised it was such a huge bestseller, but clearly it had something that moved a lot of people. Hype alone didn't sell that many copies.
B009IQG5LK|4.0|A fun,  colorful film with bravura performances all around that deserved the Blu-ray treatment!  Enjoy the terrific art direction, costumes, make-up and watch Al Pacino chew the scenery like he has rarely done before or since!  It's old-fashioned fun that both young and old should appreciate.  And not a single  \\"F\\" bomb dropped anywhere!
B00DW0TFP6|5.0|This is yet another great hard rock/metal album from A7X. This album is a bit more stripped down in terms of style than previous efforts. However, musically it was great. I think I may prefer Nightmare to this by a small margin, but it's a great album.<br /><br />My only complaint is that on my vinyl copy there is a bit of sibilance on the \\"s\\" sounds on some of the songs. I use an Audio-Technica LP120 turntable which is great for audio quality so I don't think it's from my turntable. If anyone has found their vinyl copy also has that problem, leave a comment!<br /><br />But the album itself was mastered very well. There was a lot of dynamic range on the album compared to most modern albums. Loading some of the Mp3s that came with it via download code into audacity, I didn't see any clipping. It's nice to see a modern album not affected by the loudness war. A7X's previous efforts suffered from this, but the vinyl masters were different so were not affected, but in this case, it seems the music was mastered well for both CD and Vinyl.<br /><br />The vinyl also has a special cover that differs from the boring black cover on the CD. Amazon displayed the vinyl art when it was available for pre-order but on the release date they changed the art to be like the CD. This is not the case. I have uploaded the actual vinyl cover so you can see what it looks like. Just check out the pictures.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I can't figure out the intended audience for this book. While I can imagine kids as young as 10 or so enjoying the fantasy world that the author has created, brilliantly, with inference, there are some scenes that are appropriate only for at least 17+.<br /><br />This is a shivery, scary tale, told mostly from the perspective of a bookish 7-year-old. In some ways it reminds me of Fablehaven, another book about not-so-nice magical creatures. I love the childlike acceptance the MC has, age-appropriately, for virtually all the odd things that are happening around him. I wanted to know more about some things that were mentioned...for example, the two children that one of the Hempstock women mentions being with the MC when he came to visit another time.<br /><br />I'm probably going to be thinking about this one for some time to come, trying to assign meaning to the adult MCs motives and life. The writing is exceptional.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|Was looking for a way to pass the time and then low and behold I found this fun game! Highly addictive and reminds me of an old school game I played as a kid of which I've forgotten what is called but thanks for a flash back of child hood!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is so well written!  I would highly recommend it to any dog lover!  I love how the dog is the narrator!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The development of characters was so perfectly done that the reader feels she knows each one intimately. Just when you think not one more character can be entwined into the story the author introduces you to one more that the reader loves even more than all the ones that came before. Ultimately you end up with the most tender story of all that brings the book full circle and the reader more than satisfied.

B00DJWV11I|4.0|I couldn't wait to read this book since I'd read a lot of good reviews on it. I agree with pretty much all of the ones I read, that it felt like it could have very well been written by a man and that it was very funny. It was also a very good Romance since I love the seduction.<br />I read it right after reading \\"Diary of a Dieter\\", wanting to read another funny romance.<br />I should have read Tangled first kind of as an opening act for the other. Sorry if I'm comparing too much but I think I would have enjoyed it more that way. BTW, for those who haven't read it yet, these two books are only alike in that they have a lot of humor in them.<br />I enjoyed having the male POV in this, just a interesting perspective written in such a manly way.<br />I will definitely be reading any sequels for Tangled!

B002K0WBXW|5.0|The proposal is an great film for amusement!! Bossy and mean editor Margaret (Sandra Bullock) and her handsome assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) makes phony engagement to keep their jobs and to avoid deportation. They travel to Alaska to visit Andrew family, along the way they go on adventures and come close leading to love and great comedy. I love the chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, plus Betty white is amazing in this film.<br />It's worth the watch and laughs!!!
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|i expected more action... the hole flow of this movie was very slow... the entire begining was hidious... i realize the importancy of the begining but my family and i thought that it could have been portrayed a lot differant way to give the movie a lot better start. the hole movie sucked... there not even one part that even stands out to memory and i watch it about a week ago.
B00E3VTR1K|3.0|I am a huge Science Fiction fan and can be very critical when it comes to content.  Clouds of Emotion and Life in Prison were my favorite stores. The other stories were just okay.
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|this was a great movie. i can't wait for the second movie to come out. great story line. my daughter and i have already watched it three times...
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Once  I started reading , I did not want to put it down.  I thought Megan`s skittish attitude was perfect.  It reflected what I would imagine abuse would  affect one to have.  I felt for her and did not want her ex husband to show up again.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|As many have said here, the book just straggles off and stops in the middle of . . . everything.  Otherwise, it's as good a book as the first two in the series.  I think just one more chapter would have tied together all the dangling storylines to a point where the book could at least be reasonably paused while we wait for the next installment in the series.  I got the feeling that the author just got tired of writing and decided to cut it off here.  She DOES plan two more, or so we've been told, but the ending of this book is inelegant and simply irritating.  If Day doesn't get the 4th offering out soon, she may find that her audience has also straggled off.<br /><br />My recommendation:  wait for the 4th book and read them back to back.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|This movie is amazing I love watching it. The viewing of this movie on amazon is great! I recommen it a lot.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|The cast in this movie is amazing to say the least! I don't think I've ever read a review of this film and I couldn't care less about some reviewers opinion. To me, the plot, the story, the messages in the movie are priceless. I wish I could have in someway been involved in the production of that film and worked with that cast & crew because there's no doubt in my mind that it would have been a richly rewarding experience I'd have enjoyed and remembered the rest of my life. I truly love this movie and will continue to watch it again and again. p.s. Diane Lane ROCKS!!!

B0067RQYNW|3.0|This app opened and allowed me to edit my Word docs fairly well. I was pretty happy with it until recently, when it started to get a bit buggy. Now when I go to type a word which begins with \\"s\\" it will insert an \\"a\\" before the \\"s.\\" I don't know why. For example, the word \\"simple\\" will change to \\"asimple.\\" And I can't figure out how to stop it doing that.Worked great until it didn't.
B00EDF43MY|1.0|I love dr.panda games they are my favorite but the ones I like the best are the ones that cost money
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I thought the storyline wasn't as book depicts. Too long, stretch story out unnecessarily. I wouldn't recommend the movie. Boring
B00B7Y0206|4.0|You can view any youtube video but slow loading and a glitch is present. But I recommend it to anyone who likes youtube.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|I'm glad I was reading Bill O'Reilly's KILLING LINCOLN at the same time as the two went hand in hand.  What was missing in the movie was covered in the book so the two made a very good duet.  Good points picked up all throughout the movie you may have overlooked in other venues as well.  Well done.
B00D0Z2JR4|1.0|The movie cost 40.00 American dollars... 3,990 Yen. why is everyone charging 100+. not very nice. hopefully someone will sell for less in the near future. please.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|It's hard to believe Clarkson came off the Idol show where so many have gone down in flames. She'll be around awhile if she continues to do it her way.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's a very good game it has strategy and thinking in this game any ways I love cut the rope
B0040GUIAC|3.0|No doubt the voice is amazing. Wanted a soundtrack with more mellow sounds. Hate when they mix it up with &#34;pop&#34;, &#34;dance&#34; music.
B007R21JJK|5.0|They will drop usb 2.0 devices (like my USB sound card for instance) randomly. It needs a software update that is NOT on gigabytes web site. Im not sure if Amazon will allow me to post a link, but here is where I found the updated drivers: [...]<br />I found them by googling VL800 via drivers. I ordered another new board with an I7. The board had been a returned item as evidenced by Thermal Paste and after removing processor cover noticed at least 10 pins bent or broke.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|cute game and an easy way to pass the time. has been a good replacement for nemos reef that never wants to work right
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game it keeps me busy for hours thanks for a good game<br />This game gets five stars in my opion if you like find its then your gonna love this
B000TERDNO|5.0|Great cd for any Billy Idol fan. Includes all the songs you want to hear. Love rockin' it old school!
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Nice to have all in one little space.  Storys are much eaiser to read with control of letter size and font.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I HATE 97% of them.  Never Get through the first five minutes.  However,  I loved this movie.  Start to finish.  Terrific film!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I had done many of the experiments on my own previously but still it was great fun to do them so consciously and consecutively. The writing is like hanging out with a good friend. Pam is witty and down to earth even when talking about things many find other worldly.
B00000I0XW|3.0|not what I thought it would be my fault though<br />  guess I should read further in lineup of tunes before I buy
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Someone else in the reviews mentioned the A team and it really had that style.<br />I was happy to see the &#34;cheesy&#34; cameos from Arnold Brice and Chuck Norris and others .  Van Damme  was the stereotype of evil that deserves to get the end that we ALL know is coming! Also WHO will be killing him.<br />As a Brit I am glad to see Jason Statham earn his &#34;action movie&#34; chops with this star studded crowd.  I still think Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels, The bank Job along with the first Transporter are his best.<br />Exdpendables 2 is Just plain good fun and relaxation a brain vacation,,, no more no less..
B00992CF6W|5.0|Lots to do. Encourages creativity in kids. You can create just about anything by building and adding your own style.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire. You can change the color of the background and the style of the cards which is pretty nice.
B00123AYNM|5.0|Some random fellow and I got to talking about music, and he recommended Porcupine Tree to me.  I am in a state of shock at how much I enjoy this group!  Thank you for random man for the recommendation - and now I recommend Porcupine Tree to those of you who like REAL music!
