B00QMR4ZNI|4|I love these, they are soft and provide environmental protection without being heavy wear or taste. Very good.
B000F4GIPC|5|Yes, I started using this product because my hair is thinning, and also because my sister has been using it for over two years (she totally believes in this product.) It is too soon to tell if my hair will become \\"thicker\\" but the thing I noticed after the first shampoo and condition is that my hair, which is always full of static (no matter what the humidity) didn't stand on end with static when I combed it!!! I've tried every (and I mean EVERY) salon and supermarket brand of shampoo/conditioner just to get the static out of my hair, and this is the only product that has performed, without making my very fine hair look greasy! My hair also looks shiny (which would never happen if I didn't use some \\"shine\\" product . . . which would increase the static in my hair even more!)<br /><br />I will keep using Nioxin 3 . . . if only so my hair doesn't look like I stuck my finger in a light socket every time I comb my hair!!!
B005WTYEYW|5|I've been interested in nail art for awhile, so I decided to get some rhinestones to add a little more dimension to my nails.  In this bundle, you get a huge variety of rhinestones. It's kind of difficult to see in the picture, so what you get is: 1 wheel of silver circles, 1 wheel of silver shapes (flowers, teardrops, rectangles, etc.), 1 wheel of colored shapes, and 2 wheels of colored circles. The wheels themselves are made very nicely, and the top spins so you only have one compartment open at a time, and it spins so smoothly that you don't have to worry about it getting stuck, or jerking it open and spilling the rhinestones. The different colors/shapes are separated almost perfectly, so you won't need to dig around with a toothpick to find what you want.
B001A43ELC|1|First of all i had to heat the wax for WELL over how long it says just to get it somewhat melted. it did get messy but doing it yourself its gonna happen, but it is ridiculously hard getting a grip on it and keeping your skin taught all while trying to rip your hair out. Also that oil stuff that is supposed to keep the wax from tearing off your skin you have to put enough on but not to much because if you put too much it wont take the hair off. I tried this product well over 3 different times and each time i had to go over the same area because spots were missed. Honestly id rather pay someone to do this because at least then id know it was done right! Dont waste your money!
B003IU3AWY|3|I received this product in a timely manner. I was not a fan of the scent. It was very powdery and fruity. I did not smell the frangrance in a department store prior to purchasing this item, so I did not know what it smelled like before buying it offline. I am not a fan of this particular scent.
B003U83I5I|5|Love this product. I have very dark circles under my eyes and this works awesome.
B003EH6MH6|5|Purchased these for a home permanent.  Had daughter do perm while I was visiting in June. These rods from Amazon worked grea.  Great summer hairdo.
B005IUKUAC|3|THIS CLEANER is great because it's organic, however it dries out my skin. I think it would work great if you have oily skin!
B00CLYH9WK|4|I like these brushes as they are so compact and i put them in all my purses. I got a set of 2 and the mirror fell off one very quickly, but handy brushes anyway.
B0018DE69O|5|I use it everyday as part of my beauty regiment...my skin is soft and healthy...wouldn't trade it at this point for any other product. C
B003EIDODA|5|Bottles were perfect for my needs.  I saw some reviews that said the neck of the bottles were too narrow,  but they seem pretty standard to me (and I own almost 400 bottles of polish).  The brushes are soft, even and pliable,  too.
B000G7AWIM|5|I really like this comb. It was a smaller than I expected but this is not a negative. It fits in my pants just fine. I love that it's stiff. I got a larger foldable Kent comb and found that it was too loose to be able to comb my hair with. I use pomade in my hair and need the comb to go through my hair in one sweep. The larger kent comb got stuck and folded a bit. This comb is slick. Small. And feels really solid.
B001SFMPTU|3|I ordered the large and the jumbo rollers, unfortunately, these rollers were the same identical size. I wish they had been described better with their actual sizes.
B0027LSEPS|1|Really pretty junky.
B00112XIVE|4|As much as I hate to review a product that I wasn't able to try, I wanted to give all the other pregnant moms to be a heads up on this. Even though the product description says use sparingly during pregnancy, the box itself says clearly \\"do not use during pregnancy\\". I looked on the manufacturer's site and it didn't say anything about pregnancy, so I called them. They recommended only using during the second trimester and to only put on an area less then an inch wide. Not wanting to risk it, I'm going to return this product and try it again once I'm no longer pregnant. I'm giving it 4 stars based on how much I love this company's youth glow product but deducting a star based on the conflicting info that this manufacturer has on their product.
B00JG9M44G|1|Packaging and tools look good, but tools did not do yhe job for me.  Acne Extractor from CVS works better than these tools for me.
B00BB5YI0Q|3|Doesn't cut well and it cuts into the skin.
B00014H8AK|4|I like it so far! It's the second bombilla I've had and the first of this particular style. Both my husband and I tend to choose this one over the other one when we drink Yerba Matte.  I will say, however, that I actually don't like the look of it. The gold bead-looking thing with the red dot look really cheap and silly to me and I would have appreciated a simpler look. That's the only reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5. Great bombilla!
B004CASKMO|2|These are pretty rough on one side . I am disappointed and and now have a cabinet full of rounds I'll likely never use.
B0084OJR3U|4|This is a very attractive and functional badger brush.  I had been accustomed to using a Tweezerman boar hair brush (inexpensive, stiffer bristles than badger, and very reliable brush) and wanted to try a beaver brush but always had a hard time jusifying the expense difference in the two. I acted on a great Christmas sale and bought the chrome base badger brush.<br />At first I was troubled by intitial shedding of bristles and the smell - much like my german shepherd after a being wet - but both concerns were mitigated after a few shaves. But for the &#34;break-in&#34; period, this brush has been very functional, provides a better oeverall lather than the Tweezerman, and I use it every day.
B00GSZNT04|5|I love this scent but the pumps always break is it just my dumb luck?
B002XW00U8|1|DANGEROUS! There's a reason why Minoxidil (Rogaine) is only sold up to 5% (extra strength)!  DO NOT USE THIS CRAP!  Anything higher than 5% can cause heart failure. Minoxidil was originally marketed to lower blood pressure, but they found topically applying it to the head opens the blood vessels thus bringing more blood to the hair follicle and helping it grow.   I've tried this 15% stuff and it made me light headed dizzy etc. I tried to give blood and was turned down because my blood pressure was down to 88/46!!!! Normal is 120/80. I was practically not even alive. This stuff is very dangerous and anything higher than 5% is dangerous and should not be allowed to be sold on Amazon, anything higher than 5% is not FDA approved and will damage your bodies.    This stuff is exactly the same as Rogaine except it includes that acid for better absorption. It is way overpriced and I am leery about this company since they also offer 10% and 15% minoxidil bottles which is illegal, and/or fake. Anything more that 5% can cause your blood pressure to drop to dangerously low levels. Even using 5% my blood pressure averages around 108/55 (normal is 120/80) anything lower than 90/50 and your body will be like in slow motion and it's no good for your heart and organs. I would suggest to all of you who use this stuff to go and buy the Kirkland Signature 6 month supply (6 bottles) for like 30 bucks or less. as oppose to one stupid bottle from this company for 20.00 or more. I tried this stuff and I noticed no changes. Save your money and get 5% Kirkland, its safer and probably more effective--and definitely cheaper. Just stick to the dosage and within a few months you'll see improvement, within 1 year results will be very noticeable.
B001AS18MK|4|Tired of soap that dries out your skin? This product is soapless and does not dry out your skin, nice scent
B001F51QHK|5|Good product, can't be found in Belize, Which is where I live.
B001OMI9AQ|5|it is the one I always use these days
B00R6P72JO|4|Good product
B004GXZOEO|3|I expected the bags to have more layers of mesh, but they are okay for my purposes.  The colors are nice.
B0068R3V8C|3|Gets the job done. The pen bleeds out once on skin so tap lightly. as far as the spray its okay, ive been trying to figure out the perfect application of it...turns out different each time. but in my opinion i rather use than a stick for germs n stuff
B000141KY0|4|I meant to do the 5 star,  because I love that stuff! I use it all of the time!
B000980PF8|3|I really like scrub and eye cream from this kit, definitely, will buy them again. The scrub cleans pores and removes dry skin perfectly. Eye cream really nourishes and moisturies my undereye sensitive areas. However, the active moisture face cream is awful for my combination sensitive skin. It really burns on sensitive areas. Toner and cleanser are good, but do know better choices from other brands, will not repeat them.
B003CTU5MO|5|i have multi-textured negro hair. (4a-4c) i'd lost a lot of hair around my hairline because of self dye jobs and over styling with brushes and alcohol based gels and forcing my curl pattern by over twisting for YEARS!!! it'd gotten so thin, i thought my hairline was receding and that it'd be permanent. depressing and embarrassing! i saw a youtube video about how black castor oil helped a sista with locks grow out her edges and decided to buy this product after reading a few amazon reviews. i use it to oil my scalp a few times a week;  after shampooing/spritzing with water.  i also use this to seal my ends. I'm almost done with the first jar (lasted me about 3 months) and my hairline has thickened noticeably. i can no longer see my scalp through my hair. i no longer get fairy knots and my ends are much smoother. i'm ordering my second jar today!<br /><br />s/n it smells like old school hair grease, but a little herbal, earthy. i prefer it to the heavily perfumed products out there.
B00JFV5X3E|5|I have been using this set for 2 months and it works great. I'm a construction worker so dirt and oil are nothing out of my norm. This works well to keep my skin clear
B00S39R9JU|3|Ok
B004BCVBN8|5|love it
B000068PBT|5|Nice & Sharp
B00EOB0042|5|I'm really impressed with how well this product works! I have no bad smell and have had less wetness since I started using this product 3 weeks ago. Definitely well worth the buy.
B004Y9M81W|5|its great it even gets my small lashes longer, the ones near my tear ducts, its fantastic maybelline keep on doing what you do
B000OFNDOQ|5|I just tried this product for the &#34;cucumber tea&#34; name. It turned out to be a good product as an eye gel. The muscle under the eyes feel fresh after application. Will buy again.
B00A8XOQLS|3|very strange<br />doesnt last long
B001NSUGF2|5|My favorite shampoo of all time. A little goes a long way. I wash my hair every day and these products really help keep my hair shiny.
B001GZ75UQ|5|I bought it for a friend and he's very happy.  I think it's the shiny red color that really sets the product apart.
B001A38Q52|5|Good quality.  Tub came all smashed up.  A little disappointed about that as I bought it specifically for storage, but the pins are thick and that's really what I wanted.  Good quality and thick for my thin hair.
B004M7WKKK|5|Thanks for the fast turnaround, receive this pretty quickly.  Love the colors, consistency, able to apply very thinly with a concealer brush and not have pores obviously displaying.  These are cream based but not greasy, and do not add to my naturally oily skin's shine from my own sebaceous glands.  I have used the green, lavendar, yellow, and various skin colors for shading and highlighting, and really like this product.  I always use a dedicated sunscreen first on the skin (face and neck), let it set up 15 mins, then blot with a flattened kleenex, then use this palette for color correcting and shading, powder with a puff or brush to set the concealer application, then apply foundation thinly, powder over that to set the finished foundation, then continue with the artwork of eyebrows, eyeshadows, bronzer/ blush and lipcolor.  These are good.
B002SVNCJK|5|I'm using this Sham,poo in conjunction with a laser comb to combat thinning hair and I'm very satisfied with the results.
B002H950DO|5|Great product!
B007M81B5Q|4|I bought this product for my mother and shipped it to her. She immediately tried it. She says since beginning to use this product, she notices a difference in her skin. Her complexion has improved and some spots on her face seem to have improved. Furthermore, it's nice that she doesn't have to worry about putting on makeup since this has the tint incorporated. The only thing is that she has to wear additional sunscreen with it.
B009OF5O6C|4|Smells great, lasts with out having to take a bath in it.  Got mine at KMart for $4.99.
B00KLT0BF4|5|Cant live without it! Great delivery time, great packaging. Definitely recommend it.
B000BIZSVC|5|I have never been a fan of the sticky, crunchy hair that is created with hairspray.  But, I LOVE this product.  It smells great (most scented hair products make me sneeze) and it works wonders to provide light hold and smooth flyaways.  It's the only hairspray I've ever liked and it's wonderful!!
B002WTC38O|1|This did not work for me as my skin seems to be too sensitive. I had pulled out lashes in the middle of my eye and I was hoping that I could hurry the process of regrowth. I used it for two weeks even though I could see it irritating my eyes..... finally, my eyes swelled so much, I could not ignore it and had to stop using it. It has been two weeks since my last application and my eyes are still showing swelling, dryness and itching.... though they have improved much. Having experienced all of this.... very thin lashes have grown in. Was it the serum or natural.... who knows. Note.... I gave the serum to my sister and she is using it with no skin problems.... though she has not used it long enough to tell if it has helped her lashes to grow.
B001UHN0NG|3|I purchased this iron on the advice of a friend after using a Rusk for years.  My hair is VERY thick and kinky and I found that this iron just doesn't get hot enough to handle it.  Also I need something wider.  So I'm returning it and going back to my Rusk.  That being said, if you don't need an iron to go over 400 degrees, then this is an EXCELLENT product.  Does a great job of getting close to the roots too.
B0009R354M|5|I bought this mainly for its antiseptic properties. When it came I shaved for work and used it and noticed the aroma was just that very antiseptic. After a few minutes the vanilla kicks in and it's light and very pleasant. It does what it says and smells like it also. This will be my go to daily aftershave.
B00CLGXC10|5|Just getting into the &#34;gel&#34; products. This is a nice polish and a very pretty color.
B0084G1V82|1|Knockoff.
B004BPVF7W|5|I purchased this as a gift for a young girl. The variety of colors and the enormous assortment was a giant hit. I bought this item to complement her mother's gift to her, a bedroom vanity.
B003JK4MW0|4|The Zeno Hot Spot is a wonderful little gadget...  I have suffered from occasional pre-menopausal/hormonal   acne breakouts around my chin - for the last several  years...this product has helped keep my blemishes  under control - LUV IT!
B000MQ6X8A|4|It's great
B0094YPUJY|3|So I am one of those people that I love waxing and I love when it is done right. I do like the mechanism (the roll on) as that is what my cosmetition uses to do the waxing but I do not thing the actual wax is good. From a first experience I noticed that it does not take the roots out but just breaks the hair which means in a week I need to do it again. while when it takes the roots out it takes like 40 days for me to be ready for another waxing. So I will give it a second try and may be wil change the actual wax catridge.
B005S5ZSW2|5|Before my daughter was born, I was very committed to the idea of using cloth diapers, and searched high and low for a diaper rash cream that would be effective at protecting her skin, and that would not compromise the absorbency of the cloth diapers. I'm no longer using cloth diapers, which opens up my options to many other diaper creams I could not use otherwise, and yet I'll be sticking with this one. I didn't realize how handy the spray format would be for one. This in and of itself makes me more likely to use it frequently. The formula itself is excellent. I've tried the regular CJs BUTTer Spritz in the natural mango mint scent, and while I prefer that one for fragrance, this one wins for effectiveness hands down. My daughter's rash cleared up within a day or two of starting the &#34;plus&#34; version, and I've continued using it at most of her changes for prevention. Her bottom looks happy and healthy. For the period during which I tried cloth diapers, this did not harm them at all. Now, even though I don't need the cloth-friendliness of this butter, I'll be sticking with it just because of how well it works.
B0039NMCPG|5|love this product...I can see a difference already and it has only been ten days! Will definately recommend this product.
B001ECQ4TO|5|Everything is perfect
B005BOQH70|1|This epilator breaks the hair and it does not remove it from the roots. I had a five years Philips epilator which was working greatly but unfortunately I forgot on one of my trips. My old Philips epilator is by far better than this one.
B002SS06G0|5|Love the richness. Works great for dry skin and love the smell.
B000GDDKJY|5|I had bad back acne and nothing ever worked. I went to the dermatologist and she had me try a whole heck of a lot of things that made it worst including chemical burn in my back. This product with a sulfur cleanse helped my back acne and now I am still using it as maintenance to keep my acne at bay. The bottle's sprayer is nice since you can turn in everyday and product would still disperse
B000GHYWCY|5|Excelente
B004Y0RKNW|5|The Pirated of the Caribbean colors are great.. This color on Mermaids Tears is almost a Mint or Light green turquoise color.. Really nice summer color!!! also the product was fresh!!  5 STAR  SELLER  fast shipping.
B00BD3RQVE|5|Mary Kay's extra emollient cream is phenomenal. I have a friend who put this cream on her convertible leather top to keep it from cracking. It worked. If you want supple and soft skin use it at night. When I do that I put a towel on my pillow and it's incredible how supple your skin becomes with this cream. Nothing comes close to Mary Kay's extra emollient cream.
B001EAYZEW|5|I have had this epilator for about 4 years and I still use it semi-regularly! I've never had any issue with it and it was worth the money, in my opinion. Comes with a carrying bag, a brush to clean it with, and a protective cap as well as a loofah and a massaging head which I have never used. I chose this one over the corded one in case I ever wanted to take it with me somewhere but so far I've always been able to plug it in for use while traveling. I find epilating in general more painful than waxing since it goes so much slower but pain-wise I feel like this one is as good as it's going to get. I prefer to wax, then touch up and use the epilator in between waxes, it works great that way for me. I searched epilators on Amazon to see what's new out there but I guess I will keep this one a few more years!
B00008BQVM|5|Fast delivery...easy to find on your site and no stress I did not have to go to several stores.  Love the auto ship!
B004AZZ0QK|5|I had recieved a sample of this product Nd am some what of a make up lover. This product is expensive but worth it!
B002XQ1X4G|2|Just ordered it since I'm a fan of Paco Rabanne (classic green bottle) which is more woody and spicy but I was a little disappointed since this is really very sweet and I was expecting something with similar notes.
B003YCAQDC|1|This is not worth buying.  When I  opened, the wand was just a glob of mascara.  I was very disappointed.
B0048IGBD0|5|GREAT PRODUCT I REALLY FEEL MY TEETH CLEAN !<br /><br />I JUST STARTED USING  AND THE PLAQUE AROUND MY GUMS FEELS  MUCH LOOSER TO REMOVE WIH MY FLOSSER AND  PIC  THANSK
B0046HLSZE|5|Love Obagi products! This is exactly the same cleanser that I used to buy from my esthetican, but much less expensive. I highly recommend this purchase.
B00099XKZY|5|perfect. in perfect shape
B000VOMZOY|1|smell was horrible
B000JL3OYE|1|I have used this product for years and was excited about the reduced price so I ordered 2 bottles. No wonder the price was reduced because the product must have been old.  It stinks! I would definitely not recommend ordering to anyone.
B0032FSDOA|5|The lovely spearmint made my scalp & testicles tingle! Superb shampoo!
B00DTPZXLY|5|Very impressed with nail polish it only took one coat to put it on and it lasted for a good while love the product
B0092MCO88|5|I mainly use this hair dryer when i apply deep conditions to my hair and its great. I have the hot cold high and low settings which is all you really need and your not trapped under thos big bulky dryers unable to move. i can still move around with this dryer since its sort of like a huge hat. Its easy to clean and easy to put away. Love the little case it comes in as well!
B003X1BMF0|5|These are great wedges for makeup or even applying other creams to your face. I make mine last by using all sides of it before tossing away. I think that's the most sustainable thing to do, aside from using your own fingers for application.
B00CPZW376|5|Love this color.  I chose this at my nail salon the last few times, and then bought it so I could make quick touch ups at home.
B001E174L2|3|It makes my skin feel a bit too dry, is good for the body but not that good for the face
B003983I1S|5|The razor was provided to me through a program by Gillette.  I can start off by saying that I when I  shave, I had to use an electric and regular shaver.  My beard is very thick...well, I put the battery in the Proglide power and decided to see how well that would go.  I actually got through the shave, without any problems.  Easy glide, smooth shave, no razor burn, and no electic shaver.  This is a great razor.
B00IW58KEI|5|I have been using this for two weeks straight and I have not seen any major difference yet but it's very moisturizing. And I feel that this could work if I continue to use it everyday. This would probably last me a month or two with persistent use. It's easy to apply and it does not take long to spread the lotion on the skin. This might work best for less severe stretch marks. I would recommend this product to future mommies.
B007Z8ZQAE|3|I don't hate the product but I'm not in love with it either... I'm not sure where the pheromones come from in this product ... It smells really good for the first half second but there is something in it that has a strong after smell that is not very appealing . Bc I can't stand that after smell I dab a drop of my pumpkin patch essential oils on top of it and together it makes a nice light sweet yummy smell .<br /><br />As far as effectiveness goes... I can't really say ... I don't have a plethora of men coming at me but I haven't had a single bad day since I started wearing it . Considering I work in a retail pharmacy I'm use to dealing with the public and sick people which can get tricky and people can be grumpy ... So whether or not it is coincidence I can't really say but it will update this later on the longer I wear it.
B005MZED7O|1|Love yourself as you are!
B000C2370G|5|Great price and wonderful scent!
B003MYXOVS|5|Wonderful shampoo...love IN
B005ZHR7CW|1|I have very dry mature skin that is also sensitive to breakouts.  This cleanser is harsh!  It is very drying.  After one use my skin felt tight and looked parched.  I got up the next morning and it was not hydrated at all! Certainly would not buy again or use again!
B007FMXL52|4|I have been swimming for exercise in the winter and the pool I go to has a weird chlorine mix with softener salt that is really messing up my hair. It took a couple washings to get rid of the smell completely and after two weeks my hair is relatively back to normal. i need a trim to get the bad ends cut off but overall its good as new.
B00CGBI2E2|4|The name reminded me (not fondly)of a usage from a time long past--but this was recommended as a solution to my dry scalp. I expected it to be thick and it is but it is also quite easily absorbed. Felt good on my skin so I use it anywhere my skin is dry. It is thick, which I like, but you may want to add other oils to thin it out or add fragrance. Enjoying its benefits and would recommend it.
B0049LUI9O|5|Hey, it works!  It's inexpensive!  I could even understand the instructions: put in battery, turn on, cut hair!  I'm happy!
B0012XYVN6|5|This scent makes me feel very girly.  It smells sweet and fruity.  The creamy body wash is just that creamy.  It feels like it is very good for my skin.
B0026IJ1IG|5|I love this product. I am already pale, so I use it as regular foundation. It pretty much gives me this perfect flawless coverage and it also kind of makes you look like your glowing. Not in a weird way. It just makes you look I guess fresh. But that is me as being pale. My niece was a vampire for Halloween so I used it on her and so she was able to be perfectly pale without having all that gunky paint on, so even though it wasn't real it looked for like the pale you would see in Twilight minus the sparkles. It's great I would recommend everyone to get it. So yeah hooray for being pale!!
B004UKSJWW|4|One - I didn't think this trimmer could match my old Panasonic that finally quit on me after many years.  Two - the somewhat uneven ratings did give me pause.  Three - This Braun trimmer operates a somewhat slower speed than did my Panasonic.  Nonetheless, the Braun has proven to be very satisfactory for both cutting down my dense beard and trimming my mustache.  A nice ergonomic feel, a beard length adjustment mechanism that stays where I set it and a handy push-button on-off switch on the middle of the handle cap off the review.
B002U6PG06|3|What can I say, it's a Q-tip dispenser. I have non-brand swabs in there, which may be a 1/8&#34; smaller than brand, but they are constantly crooked and not falling into the slot on the bottom.  I usually have to just lift off the top and grab one from the pile. That pic is VERY misleading. I mean, look how perfect those swabs are - Q-tip perfection on the counter! Not in my case, unfortunately.
B001GS6OB4|2|My mother asked for this for Christmas because word of mouth said it wasn't painful. She used it for awhile and has stopped because it is just too painful to continue using.
B0002KHU3I|5|These are hard to find in stores #1 and then when you do they are very expensive, to find them at this price and to know I can easily just order them makes my life simple! I love how they clean my teeth, I have not stepped up to the Sonic, have other things I need to spend my money on, but these keep my teeth and gums very clean and do a super job!
B000068PBT|5|Works well
B0009MFUPY|5|Well it works well with the shaver's cleaner so how could it possibly be better than that.
B002LZ1MW2|5|The product itself and the delivery were excellent.<br />The dryer is light, small extremely powerful. When you dry your hairs you do not have any issue with the position of the different switches (very often the case). The cable is longer than the average I find that very convenient. I clearly I love this product.<br />However I received some gift coupons and I try to use it but Amazon took the money from my credit card instead and pretend that I did a mistake but since I registered the gift coupons during the transaction I could use them latter to buy something else.<br /> I am really disappointed buy this &#34;technique to force to do another transaction with them.
B007VSVNQO|2|I thought this was going to be a nice little vacuum but it didn't hold up.  I previously had a Dyson which I thought worked very well and was well built but didn't want to drop $400 on a new vac so I thought I would give this one a shot.  Well it worked well for about 5 months then the hose started falling out of the top retention clip every time I would be using the floor vacuum part which is pretty annoying.  I messed around pulling out the extension hose and putting it back in to make sure it was in all the way, turning it different ways and whatever else I could think of assuming I was just not clipping it in correctly.  I guess the clip is just garbage.  The little stair vac attachment that connects to the front of the handle by a magnet also falls out occasionally, I can deal with that because it clips on easily.  The cord is very short which although not a huge deal but seems like something a company that's been making vacuums for many years would consider. The bedrooms in my house are not that big I should be able to plug it in to a hallway outlet between two bedrooms and get them both but can't.<br />So I guess I get to go buy a new vac now because it's really annoying that the extension hose comes out every time I vacuum.<br /><br />I would not recommend this vacuum to a friend.
B001EM1BBK|5|Great buy and great service. Will use again in future
B008I2IKH2|5|just as expected.  Good price.
B005FGQ2QK|5|Works better than I expected. I have a lot of wigs and will definitely get this again. Does not take as much as I worried either. It is a small bottle but has lasted well. I wear a wig almost every day and have had this for some time now.
B003CP12J8|5|Excellent product at a great value price.  I would do it again without any questions.
B00N18RIAS|5|Best curling iron I've ever owned! My hair does not hold curls so I was hesitant. My hair looks as good at the end of the day as it does when first curled- even with clean hair! It takes some getting use to, but after 3 or 4 uses- you'll be a pro. Worth every, single penny!
B001ET7JQE|2|Using this product for about a month, I noticed a sharp increase in tartar formation. I had been to the dentist in less than 5 months for a cleaning and I floss and brush every day, yet my teeth had patches of tartar that seemed to come overnight and my lower gums ached.  At first I didn't connect the symptoms with this product, but while searching for solutions for the tartar problem and considering a product called Periogen, I came across Amazon reviewer comments discussing the possibility that some oral antibacterial products, by destroying good bacteria as well as bad, may somehow lead to more tartar growth. Periogen, apparently, is not in that category, and I plan to try it as a tartar dis-solver.  I don't know for sure if Katz Perio gel really caused the problem, but it seems a strong possibility since I made no other changes. I decided to go back to Tom's of Maine, which I've used for years. I wanted to give this warning in case someone else experiences the trouble I had with Katz.  I should also mention that in the years before I had begun using Tom's of Maine, I always did have excessive tartar formation, so I must be prone to it, but nothing on the level of what happened almost overnight when using the Katz gel.
B00BKONH6Y|4|Worked as advertised in about three weeks for mole removal. I applied the acid full strength in the morning and at night.<br /> Thanks.
B00L342KPU|5|This wig is fantastic! Very sort, easy to style and has great volume. Perfect for cosplay or for fun!
B00019ODAI|5|Great product but hard to find locally. Purchased for my Mom as she loves these and some for me also.  They exfoliate very well.
B00437CA1I|5|Love this. I ordered clear. Tames unruly brows without adding color. Easy to use.  Will purchase again.
B001MP0P5M|4|All the gaurds worked great with my Wahl clippers but the smallest attachment, the one I bought the whole set for (size 1) rattles EXTREMELY loud. It seems like it just doesnt latch on tight enough. It does its job, just sounds annoying.
B003RDG3KI|5|Fabulous prodc
B003H84X0U|5|I like that its a stain and it like a marker it's really easy to apply and and they are very pretty colors! All I do is color my lips with the marker (lol) and then put lip gloss or some lip balm and its perfect!
B00DQDTVW6|5|The picture is almost an exact match in person.  I used this polish on my nails.  No chipping yet & it has been over 1 week.  Super fast shipping.
B002HTREHE|5|THE SMELL IS QUITE NICE, AND IT REALLY HELPS
B005V1ZKGW|5|i really enjoy all my sigma brushes, i have been buying them for almost a year already and i have nothing negative to say. i enjoy doing my makeup with these professional brushes.
B003987CL0|5|Great, great razor.<br />Really great if you have sensitive skin.  No more razor burn.  No more dreading shaving.<br />Super close shave.
B00A9MP3WE|1|I don't think this did anything at all. I got it to work on the blackheads on my nose. The container is cute, but unnecessarily large.
B00H7I13C2|5|love this product cannot find near home.
B0041TXR1A|4|It did what it supposed to do , I probably should have spent a littl emore and get the organic one.<br /><br />I tdid the job , I mixed to make and anti-moquitoes mix in the summer.  Probably should have spent a littl emore and get the organic one.  However, It did the job and  the price was ok.<br /><br />KarlaC
B002TQ4AO0|5|I have been using Braun shavers for years. I replace them only when the plastic catches break apart or when the motor electrical contacts corrode so badly until the motor can't spin.  When the latter happens, I had to press the body hard for the motor to spin.  Taking the shaver apart to clean the corrosion extends its life by another few months.<br /><br />Using this is safer than using razor blades!<br /><br />I chose this particular model as it had a very useful hair trimmer at the side.  There are slightly cheaper models without the hair trimmer ...  It also comes with a very handy stiff brush to clean off the moustache/beard dust from the cutters.
B00CDJAMNG|5|Gave as gift. High quality item.  Very pleased.
B007HTUDFE|5|My favorite eyeshadow base!
B0000DJEJN|5|I've read some of the complaints regarding this razor and I'm not sure where they're coming from. Because Gillette patents things to high heaven, Schick has to do a lot of work arounds. <BR>Can't rinse from the back, well, you rinse from the top with Quattro. It's the reason the cart is open up top. There is zero clogging if you follow Schick's directions to rinsing. In addition, I've used one blade for two weeks straight once and never did the wire break. In fact, in the roughly 100 shaves using this razor, none of the head's wires broke so I wouldn't worry about that. A typical cart seems to last me about 10 shaves. It shaves a little closer than the mach3 turbo but it's really only noticable after roughly 12-14 hours so both do a more than adaquate job in that department. <BR>The differences I've found between the Quattro and the mach3 turbo are; the Quattro shaves slightly closer, nicks slightly less under my neck (but both are far better than anything else I've ever used), and gets my upper lip hairs better. The Turbo shaves with less friction and the handle doesn't accumulate as much of that old shaving cream gunk which tends to pile up over time.<br />Both are far better than anything else out there so I keep both handles in the cabinet and buy replacements depending on which, if either, is on sale.
B006LAFU8U|5|The applicator is very useful because it makes it very easy to apply the Oil on a scalp without it being messy. A little goes a long way, so use sparingly. I use it often and I am just running out after 3 months of use.
B001BR97A0|5|I purchased this because due to a recommendation and found that I really like it. I thought Witch Hazel only came in full strength, but this brand really feels good on my face.
B0006PJTB0|1|On 2 occasions differnet sellers sent faulty product.  Contacted manufacturer about mislabelling.  Generally love this fantastic base coat.  Not here.
B00DS0KP36|1|The toothbrush head is very hard，The voice is  loudly,  and power consumption is very big。刷头很硬，声音很响，  1对南孚电池只能用一个多礼拜！
B00GQ9I9IO|5|Great product
B00BZ8EUAC|2|I like to see lots of suds when washing. This face wash a big zero in the suds department
B000V5BXNM|5|I will buy again excellent quality !
B003VPV7F8|5|I bought this for my blush pans in my makeup kit. It holds four of them perfectly. Very compact and stylish.
B00JZY6OZ2|3|Not as amazing as expected.
B0040VGR3Y|5|these hairdryers make great gifts.  they are pure quality.
B008CNSOF0|4|Its a shame its hard to find and pricey. Great toothpaste though. My receeding gums and weak enamel really benefit from using this. I also hate the tatse of toothpaste however this brand is tolerable.
B00V5YFCXK|5|Love this brushes! Quality is fantastic and no shedding! My one complaint is that I wish they were numbered.
B000VTVA7M|5|nice top coat
B0029XBNAW|4|product arrived on time and packaged  well with instructions. love that it has no taste also very easy to use. Leaves mouth fresh, still using product unsure if will reorder until finished product completely. So far i like kit.
B004HGRPDS|4|I got two of them few months ago. They do their job although they are not soft as other brushes. The quality is not but dough because I've washed them and nothing came off.
B00CTT0XYI|2|These were extremely difficult to use in my thin, fine, mid-length hair.  I have other clips that work better and achieve the same effect.  I think they would work better on long hair.  If you decide to try them, there is a video on youtube that is very helpful.
B001KYTRQS|4|This is great for a primer before you put on lip stick other than that it really doesn't last long.
B003UMNO6C|4|I used this on my overbleached hair after I rinsed out Nexxus Emergencee. I put it all over my hair, let it air dry a little bit, then alternated between blow drying and air drying for awhile before rinsing it out. The Emergencee adds the protein and gives hair life back but it really needs a good moisturizer like this afterwards. I'm not totally sure that this is worth the price but it is very good.
B002VF4MVK|5|Oh , so good; My wife uses it all of the time.
B000G647Y8|5|There isnt a whole lot to say.  Its a brush seems sturdy makes shaving fun...good enough to get 5 stars...it is what they said it is...
B0002V52LO|5|I have been trying to find this product for several years and finally found it here. I bought it in a salon a few years ago and really love it. It defines the layers in my hair just enough.
B00BQTU7OI|5|Not greasy, not too thick or watery, nice mild smell. As the instructions say, a little does go a long way.  I use it every day, and one container last for months.
B004YDIYO8|5|It's amazing. I'd like to explain in more detail, but it's simple: Use it, it's by far the best lotion I've ever found for sunburns. Normal aloe lotions for sunburn relief don't hold a candle to it.
B003654SVS|5|I tried to find this in Sephora and all kinds of stores but it was sold out quick.  I'm glad I found it on Amazon for a good price.  :)
B004PXIR1W|4|If you live and work where you can have a stubble appearance without consequence, then this is the trimmer for you and you will look just like your favorite movie stars who appear on the late night talk shows looking like they just forgot to shave but actually did shave with a product like this!  It allows you to carefully adjust with precision how long you want  your stubble to be.  It isn't a shaver, it won't work if you want clean shaven, it is for stubble lengths only.  Conair makes excellent products and this stubble trimmer has a lot of extras with removable head and easy to clean and adjust.
B003V37Z6U|1|Like the product, but the cost is outrageously over priced. It is priced at $184.95 on December 2, 2014. From reading previous comments, it seems like the price is only increasing. I'd consider switching to a different company.
B0000531GA|5|I chose this product because is the best for me, there's nothing I don't like about this product; I will recommend this product for goung and middle age ladies out there....
B00I3VHKVK|5|Im about to buy this again for a friend.  brushes are so soft.  A bargain  but a good bargain...
B00RXZ0OOM|3|It likely works for some kids, but my little man didn't like it. He stated it was to hard. :/
B003AKHQG8|1|I'm so upset with the fact I order 2 hot toll however I was only shipped 1 item, the trouble is you have no way to get to a person even when they charged me for 2 items and I only recieved 1 item.  I so upset with this company for not getting in touch with me 24 hours later,  and Christmas is 2 days away.
B007J1ZNXM|5|good product at a reasonable price.
B000FGC99O|5|I LOVE this conditioner. I've used it twice and my hair that usually is like straw at the ends and not very soft is now like silk. I regret using drug store and even expensive &#34;luxury&#34; brands for so long!
B002LZRTEW|5|Thes are the best self tanning product on the market,  I am a natural red head with blue eyes and fair skin,  love the very natural tan I get using this product.  Looks great never streaks or turn yellow very easy to apply love them and you will too..
B000QS59ZM|5|I wish I could have picked a color.  I got gray, but that's ok.  It works great and was priced right.
B00027DMI8|5|Have been using this stuff for a long time and love it. Does it work? Have no clue! Maybe I would have a lot more wrinkles than I do now if I didn't use it! It feels great on my face and comes highly recommended by women's mags and I personally feel the cream is of high quality. My fair skin hurts if I don't use cream am and pm. This stuff keeps me comfortable all day and then all night. The wrinkle part is just a plus!
B000CED0VK|5|I only use OPI nail polish.  I am rough on my nail and this seems to last the longest.  Like any other nail polish after you use it several times, it does have the tendency to get thick.  When it gets thick, just add some nail polish thinner and you will be able to finish using the entire bottle!
B000F3Q6RS|5|This was for my father in laws old razor that he loves and refuses to replace. Thank goodness we can still get the parts.
B00MMT8DDI|5|At first, I thought this stuff was kinda expensive. I saw other Vitamin E oils selling for a lot less but that made me wonder why the others were so cheap - so I did a bunch of research and now I know why, because the others use cheap Vitamin E that's not real oil and they mix the Vitamin E in a cheap oil like soybean oil (which I've also heard is bad for you). This stuff is the real deal and real Vitamin E is just better for you! When I use it, my face feels so soft and the dark areas under my eyes are even getting better. To me, it's worth the little extra money.
B00CNOUZE2|5|Works great. Doesn't fog. The reflection is sharp and clear. I would buy it again. The adhesive works better than the usual suction cups.
B000C213ZM|5|My husband wore this fragrance when we first started dating and I still love it after 22 years.  It has such a disctinctive, memorable scent and I never grow tired of it.  It is by far our all time favorite.
B00B1TKY8C|4|I got the brush. It smelt nice and clean when in the package read reviews of a &#34;chemical smell&#34; but once wet the smell was quiet present none the less the brush is very nice and the handle is glass.<br /><br />I believe they used the amonia to clean the fur.<br /><br />I let it sit in watery laundry detergent  for about 30 mins. That did a good job<br /><br />Then 30 mins in watery fabric softener. The smell was nearly completly gone afterwords.<br /><br />And this is a typical occurrence with cheaper brushes.<br /><br />They smell will go away by its self after about 5-6 shaves but I just wanted to get read of it since its not hard at all.<br /><br />The brush is very soft. Lathers excellently and if I didn't know better I would swear they sent my a 50-60$ brush by accident.
B00152TQH0|5|This is a favorite of mine. Good price
B000J3ZMQA|5|I like the product.  It it a big bar.  Skin feels good and I don't need lotion anymore.
B000C21CX0|1|This product is NOT by the original maker; and it doesn't smell like it either.  I threw this product away and purchased the original for nearly $100...and it was worth EVERY penny...
B0082IY8MI|4|I do actually like this BB cream. I just wish it had a tiny bit more color to it. It comes out very light and very grey tinted. It's just so hard to match it to my skin. I know it will fit my skin in the winter though, so I don't think it was a wasted purchase. Using one pump is enough to cover my whole face and then some. the applicator doesn't really get messy either, so I think that is nice.
B0010SXJ4K|5|Is a gift for my girlfriend!!!! She loves it! I will give it to her fro Christmas!! Can't wait! Thanks.
B006G3B90K|4|doesn't have the button to change temp. like my old one. only one heat setting but works fine for me. if you need it super hot I wouldn't reccomend it.
B004I55DP0|3|It was crushed when I got it, and all over the package. But no worries, it works great!
B0046V52A2|3|Good body scrubber not sure if it actually works on cellulite only time will tell
B00117CH5M|4|I really like the smell of this lotion (the reviewers who say it reminds them of Cherry Pez made me smile, because it really does!) But my family (2 teens & husband) thought it was cloyingly sweet, and refused to be around me when I had put it on :-(
B003S6CVIC|5|Great
B001189I3A|5|Good.
B00790PNWE|5|I love this product. I like the fact that it has an SPF and that it doesn't smell. The color is perfect, too. Not orange, just gives you a nice glow.
B00ARF428E|4|Every attachment works really well.  I am lazy when it comes to shaving so this makes it easier.  The attachment for the close shave takes a little longer than I expect but it still works well, it's probably me.  I broke a little piece of plastic something when I was cleaning the adjustable shaver but it woks fine.
B005H8PTR4|2|I CANNOT EVEN GET MORE THAN 2 DAYS (AND THATS A STRETCH) WEAR OF THIS POLISH WITHOUT IT CHIPPING. POOR QUALITY.
B003EMKNPS|1|I'm very upset because I ordered the lavendar scent and I received olive oil and vitamin E bars instead!
B000YZ4MSC|5|Long time user of this product.  Everything shipped perfect and timely.
B00KNEDQ86|5|Good
B00LU1V3JK|2|I don't like the smell
B003FBI9LS|5|Seriouslu a great product. Did my own hair for my wedding and itgave me that romantic soft wavy look. I didnt want curls because i felt their overrated? I wanted a softer look and not to mention this little magic wand help me achieve this for just $20!!! Are you kidding me?!!! My hair do wouldve cost $65 at a salon!!! No thanks!!! Love my wave artist and now all my girlfriends want one :)
B007EHKS1I|5|This is the best coverage I have ever had with the least amount of product application.  I love the light feel and natural look of this makeup. It seems to disappear on my skin and is so easy to apply  - I use it every day.
B001ECQ7G4|4|I like the way tend skin works after one use. It doesnt take long to see results. I used it years ago and resumed using it when I made this purchase. Will order again.
B0014H22B8|5|I like this because it's not messy and goopy like cream.  If I'm rushing out the door (I'm always rushing out the door), then I'm apt to skip the sunblock because it's messy, takes time to rub in, then I have to wash and dry my hands.<br /><br />But with this spray, I close my eyes, spray it on my face, neck & arms and I'm done!  Easy!!
B00GXORHF8|5|My 7 year old daughter uses this to control her body odor. She has sensitive skin, but this doesn't irritate or cause any redness. It also WORKS.
B00QT2Z2U6|1|I just got these to day it was a pack of 3 I only got 2 and they didn't come with mixing balls like it said
B000GCWMSK|5|I've been trying to find this cream oil locally but was unsuccessful. It's what my mom used on my hair when I was a kid. I'm now 65 plus and it is perfect for my type of hair. So nice to be able to find it and at a great price as well. Plan to stock up on it just in case it is discontinued here.
B004SU88CU|5|I get this in stores a lot cheaper and love it. My hair is fine wavy, frizzy, i just put on from the middle down
B0036WTV2C|5|Glad I didn't waste $300 on the custom one from my dentist. This one works great! I know it is cushioning my grinding because I no longer have morning headaches. It was a little tricky to get the molding correct but thankfully you can re do it until you get it perfect.
B001A3HPT0|4|For $10, you can really ask for a better bowl, soap, and brush kit. The price is just not comparable to anything else you can get- most brushes cost upwards of two times the price of this entire kit.<br /><br />That said, the soap is the standard shaving soap found at most grocery stores- it works well, and you can get a pretty good cream with a little work.<br /><br />The brush is the reason the kit gets 4 stars and not 5. It leaves little hairs all over your face and in the sink when you rinse it. Not the highest quality. But decent for the price.<br /><br />The bowl is... a bowl. 5 Stars on being a bowl.
B00G2EEDOW|5|At first I was reluctant to order from a company I have never heard of, but decided the pricing was good and the description of the Neem oil had all the attributes I wanted (organic, cold pressed virgin oil). I am very satisfied with the quality,especially for the price! Description: The bottle is dark amber plastic 2 oz.(no worries about breakage during delivery) with screw off cap and attached sqeeze dropper. The oil is a light golden brownish amber with greenish tint. It is clear with no visable impurities. The smell is the distinctive deep nutty, earthy and slightly &#34;skunky&#34; sulfur characteristic of neem oil in general. The bottle is labeled Neem:  cold pressed pure virgin organic Azadrirachta Indica county of origin: India. USES: I have addeed it proportionately in my shampoo & conditioner, my facial toner and cream, and a drop to my chapped, cracking lips after applying lip balm. It worked amzingly well in the shampoo & conditioner for my baby fine hair and rinsed out thouroughly even with the soft water we have here. The few drops I added to my facial toner and cream have helped to smooth and hydrate my skin (without being too oily- it is rapidly adsorbed) as well as to help get rid of a few reddened spots & acne on my face and it helped keep my lips smooth, too. This is a GREAT find and I will be adding to other products, such as toothpaste, bath soaks and liquid body soap soon. Pre-prepared neem products can be expensive- save your money and spend just a little time to get this great oil to add to your health care products. A word of caution- the smell is strong and you only need a few drops to add to small amounts of another product- mix well. It can be used in a carrier oil, such as almond or apricot, too. I would caution to not use on or near your eyes. Also, do a patch test (best place- on the inside of your wrist so you can easily wash it off with soap & water if you have a reaction. I have extrememly sensitive skin and multiple allergies to a variety of products, but have had no trouble with this particular product.variety of products, but have had no trouble with this particular product.
B001A62JQ6|2|Doesn't hold all my hair
B00WHQNLHY|5|I sat here thinking, am I really going to use this for contouring?.... Yes, and I love it! the bristles are short and soft, but still stiff enough to provide adequate blending for contouring. This brush is also amazing for things like, finishing powder, even foundation!  It's a pretty versatile brush! If your like me, and sitting here thinking. Uhh, is this brush really for that.. yes, Yes it is. It is so easy to use,  my favorite use for it is actually to take a tiny bit of my foundation, and apply it right under my contour to have that cut contour line.  Super easy to clean, and no fallout.<br /><br />Sample Provided
B00JPK2K0Y|5|I am just over 40 I have always drank lots of water and taken all natural vitamins. But do to some health changes and stress my skin was showing that it was always dry and the fine lines were starting to show. I was starting to look older. When I heard about this product I was not sure. Within the first week I noticed a difference my skin did not have the dry look to it. By week two my skin was the same all over no more dry or to oily patches by the end of the month some of the fine lines we receding.  I have now been taking it for 3 months and have no more fine lines and look younger. I recommend it to anyone wanting to help reduce your fine lines or wrinkles.
B009K2BAZ8|1|Didn't work. None of them.
B006Z9UPQO|5|not as useful as I thought.
B004UL0GTK|1|Super strong smell of coconut. Did nothing for my hair. I think you have to have some natural curl to begin with.
B00ATPM82E|5|Bought the bath gel along with the lotion for my wife! She smells wonderful! Great product.... Makes my wife happy! And I get to feel the soft skin too!
B00P91LA4K|1|Can't get the decals off of the paper, any of it. Pretty designs but useless
B00JAOUJ94|5|Vi-Tae is the most wonderful soap I have ever purchased. It is so gentle and mild that even babies would love it. No harsh chemicals, no overwhelming perfume, just pure and clean for sensitive skin. I have allergies and am so glad there are no dyes or fragrances as I have a hard time with most of the commercial soaps.<br />I use dye free detergent and fabric softener, this rates right up there with them.<br />Just can't say enough good things about this product, I love it.
B004EWS5F2|1|It dosnt smell anything like viva la juicy. It stinks and smells like an old lady. Don't buy this! Stinky!!
B008SGIH1W|5|The cocoa butter is what I really wanted. Where I live I can only buy shea butter, which I don't like as much.<br />I sent the combo to my friend she LOVES them both.<br />I've tried to introducing cocoa butter to several of my other friends  but because it's different they are not to hot on the idea of using it.<br />This combo will last me for a while.
B00FH692PQ|3|still shedding alot in the shower
B010XK9MLO|4|I give this four stars because the cream has a different smell from what I am used to, I hold my breath when I put it on. Besides that it is a wonderful cream that has helped my sensitive skin immensely. I have extremely oily skin that needs alot of sloughing because of endless flakes... Not a fun combination to have. Plus, at this price I can slather it on my neck and chest and have that lovely creamy Victorian complexion on my chest as well, no one likes a hydrated face and a dry/red chest.
B008CYIVOS|5|Product was shipped fast to my front door.<br />I will continue to buy again in the future.
B004ISU5V4|5|This product is awesome! My hair is straight and silky. It does have an odor but not near as bad as some of the other reviews have claimed. I will definately buy this product again!
B0074EGO3W|5|it looks so cuteeee love it
B00IV0ZI1M|5|This has become one of my favorite Shampoo and Conditioners. I use the conditioner mainly as a co-wash, it works well to get rid of product build up and soften my 4B/4C mid-length hair. The shampoo is moisturizing without stripping the hair. I've since added these two products to my wash routine in the last month, so far so good.
B00AEW8EHK|2|My hair is very coarse and thick. My hair is always slipping out of the brush when I try to wrap it around. Ended up giving the brush to my daughter who has less coarse hair, but she didn't care for it a whole lot either. Back to my quest of finding the perfect round brush.
B0037IESXC|5|This is my first time trying the Sebastian spray gel and I really do notice more volume in my hair. Will definitely purchase again!
B0056B1Y8K|3|It's a soap and not a powder/clay. Probably a good product. I haven't tried it yet, but it's not what I wanted.
B00HTNJL6K|4|it's really close to that what I was looking for. Almost has that mirror effect what the sticker has. only one thing, it comes done very soon, like in a day. :/ it's really for one party, not for every day usage.
B00L5715WE|5|Great product
B0069SQQ2I|5|I use this all the time, for EVERYTHING.  Cuts, in my diffuser, mouth sores, to help my kids sleep, etc.
B0009F3O18|5|I have been using these for years and I feel they are the best makeup remover out there. Works for eye makeup and has never irritated my skin or eyes. The opposite actually: very nourishing. I use half a towel per use, so they last a pretty long time!
B00LLMB3W0|4|I was exstatic to receive this product. The results were pleasant because it did increase the volume and length of my lashes. The application process is simple- logically, the more you add the clumpier it will look. I applied 3 layers of fibers+gel; my lashes are straight and pretty short, so I'm better off appling 2 layers so I have a more natural look. I do recommend this product even if it is not the original. The substance is light and VERY easy to remove especially in the shower. It does not leave stains or residue on your lashes. GIVE IT A TRY! Kudos to the merchant as we'll for delivering on time and packaging nicely.
B009WQH8SA|5|I have tried a great many shave cream / soap / gels over the past 40+ years.<br /><br />Before Creamo I used a &#34;name brand&#34; gel to shave in the shower at my gym and the excellent Bluebeard's / Dreadnaught shave cream to use with a brush when shaving at home.<br /><br />I purchased Creamo on a whim as I was running out of my usual gel.<br /><br />Simply put I think Creamo is the best shave cream product I have ever used!<br /><br />I believe that anyone who is not getting a superior result with Creamo must not be following the directions correctly.  This is a very concentrated product, and a small amount is all that is required.  You will not get a high volume lather.  Don't worry, this is normal.  Creamo is the slickest shave cream you'll ever use.<br /><br />I get a noticeably closer shave with absolutely no burn whatsoever regardless if I am using a disposable razor or a &#34;hi end&#34; DE razor and blade.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I was pleased to learn that a visit to the Creamo web site will provide new customers with a rebate equal to you purchase price.<br /><br />Good work Creamo.
B010B9MGL0|5|What's NOT to love about these bath bombs?!  First of all they are HUGE...much bigger than any others I have seen.  If you don't want to use the entire bath bomb in one bath they are easy to break into smaller pieces.  Second, they smell amazing!!!  Very fragrant and sweet smelling and the fragrance lingers.  Third, they are moisturizing and do not dry out my skin.  Finally, the most important part (according to my kids) is that the fizz is AWESOME and lasts for 4 or 5 minutes.  Makes taking a bath relaxing AND fun.  They came packaged in a cute box that is perfect for gift giving (and each bath bomb is individually wrapped).  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.
B00V2QLIUW|5|I've tried these as soon as I got them and they really work! Great product!
B001LFEVSK|5|great dye
B000CSDDDG|5|this thing is great.  you want a good scrub down?  well I suggest you purchase one of these bad boys.  The item shipped very quickly.  loved it.  In fact, i loved it so much I am purchasing another right now.
B00NY1GTO8|3|Ok but not the best
B001P7AWXC|5|Love this product!!!!! It gives my face a glow after I put it on. It seems to stimulate something under the epidermis! I have been using this product for years and it is my favorite.
B001CX02C0|5|I have been so happy with this product.  After trying several brands, such as MAC, Boi-ing and others this is the best product.  It is lightweight yet conceals beautifully my dark under eye circles.Looks very natural! When you combine both concealers it gives you great coverage and it is not dry at all.  I have very sensitive skin and this products feels moisturizing throughout the day yet not greasy.  The translucent setting powder is also wonderful, it is light and helps set the concealer. No complains here!
B004FDZMAQ|5|I have been using this product since it first came on the market.  It provides very close shaves and holds a charge for a long time.
B001FB5HEM|4|I ordered this because I have sensitive skin and wanted a facial soap that wouldn't sting or cause breakouts. This does the trick. It smells great and works great. If only it were a little less expensive I would have given it 5 stars.
B003UOVWGY|4|Krew Comb is ideal for Flat Tops, butches, or pretty much any short hairstyle that requires standing up.  Unlike butch wax and some pomades which are often heavy, sticky and hard to shampoo out of your hair, Krew Comb has a light, creme-like texture that easily shampoos out every time you shower.  It also washes off your hands cleanly after you have finished rubbing it through your hair.  A lot of hair products on the market today are very heavily perfumed.  Krew Comb, on the other hand, has a light, clean, soap-like fragrance...not overpowering.  It has a pink colour in the jar, but when applied to the hair, it is not detectable.<br /><br />To use, simply rub a small amount between your palms, then rub in through damp hair.  Using your fingers or comb, style as desired.  To get a \\"spiking\\" effect, you can put a little extra on the tips of your fingers and rub through the ends.
B0090D80U0|5|Color is as shown but, you can't see that it has holograms in it to make it shimmer.  Very pretty.
B005UKT9LG|4|I have been searching for a natural palette that was on the affordable side but still of good quality and I definitely found it in this one! I have seen previous comments about the swatches being broken but that was not teh case for mine. I've even dropped mine on the sink and they all stayed intact.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 full stars because I haven't tried any MAC products so I can't really compare it to that. But I am COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this product. I absolutely love, love, love it!<br /><br />I did see a review that said something about all of the lighter swatches appearing as the same color when applied. I didn't really see that happen with my application of any of the lighter shades. I am Korean so I have a more olive skin tone but even in the winter when I am pretty pale, I could see the difference between each white, off-white, beige, etc swatch. It's a bit subtle but nevertheless there.<br /><br />Overall, I think that this palette is a great product for how many swatches you get and for the price you pay! I also got the Shany 24 brush set. This set is also a steal! :)
B0015TI2ZA|4|They stick well until you sweat and I believe I have an allergic reaction but still using them.
B0011Z646M|5|Using it to ease fit of shoes which were a little small.  Helps some.  I think my feet are just getting old--Inwill be 92 on Christmas Day.m Bobette.
B00DDHHTJM|5|I bought this toothbrush 3 months ago, simply amazing!  My teeth feel more clean and I really like the timer, helps me stay honest and not just brush my teeth for a minute or so.<br /><br />I'm starting to buy them for my family for their birthdays I hope they will like them as much as I do.
B001AGD77G|5|Best power ever
B007SORR3E|5|Greatest thing ever
B00M2DS7AI|3|this product is amazing. I'm a medium dark skin tone and it works on me. it's a gorgeous glow. I would not buy from here it's way to much. I bought mine for 16$ at bath and body works.
B001HS29LM|5|Works very good
B00429DO8K|5|Love this brush. It gives great volumn
B006QB4BSE|5|Cheaper than most but great quality.  I am using as a carrier oil for my esssential oils.  Also using it for a facial and body moisturizer.
B001DXOWA2|5|I have just started using this product so suffice it to say, it's not a miracle cream and I don't see &#34;results&#34; yet, but I do love the way my face feels after I use it.  It feels smooth to the touch and looks softer - for that reason alone, I give it 5 stars.
B004YDQH56|5|Such an amazing product.  I have faithfully used my Clarisonic Anti-Aging Sea Serum (in my Clarisonic Opal) for four months and now I can't imagine my morning routine without it.  I was starting to notice bags and circles under my eyes and when I had a facial one day, the technician used this serum with the Opal under my eyes and I was hooked from that moment on.  Using this product with the Opal is so much better than just patting a product under your eyes.  The serum really penetrates the layers of skin for a much better result and your circles and puffiness start to diminish quickly.  Wouldn't be without this product!
B001707IQ6|5|My wife was totally pleased with this item.
B002TPQPEE|4|It does the job. The shimmer colors are the best. And you must apply a primer before using unless it will fade away and/or look cheap.
B00TEDWJEE|5|There are two things that I particularly enjoy using this for, dry feet and for my hands.  You can immediately feel the softness take over.  What I love most is that it absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave an oily residue.  It has a nice subtle scent so if you use it with your other lotions there's no conflicting scents.  I was very surprised at how little goes a long way--and I do mean just a tiny dab.  This will last me forever and it's easy to use!  Would recommend for sure.
B001PNFFLK|5|I have been using this product for over 2 years.  I was introduced to the product while on a hunting trip and had sore leg muscles from hking many miles one day.  I use it on a regular basis when my arms of legs are stiff.  Also, I have had two back operations and sometimes my muscles in my back are sore.  I keep a spare bottle on the shelf at all times.
B0009F3M6A|5|This is a great product and a great manufacturer.  This is the real deal.  If you have dry/cracked feet, this will help.  I put on socks after applying, which seems to help it work better.  Dont worry about it being just for &#34;feet&#34;.  You can use your hands to apply the lotion without risk of hurting your hands.<br /><br />IT PUTS THE LOTION ON ITS SKIN OR ELSE IT GET THE CRACKED FEETS AGAIN!
B00C61F1C8|5|This helps alot and its plenty in a pack I will be ordering more when I'm out it's a great liner.
B000YPZLJG|5|Nutra-Lift Instant Results Wrinkle Remover is a fantastic product. I could see results in two days. I also received Advanced Maximun Eye Repair(free gift). The eye repair is out of this world. My eye lids no longer droop,and I can see clear again after two days. I will be buying these products again.
B00AE5FF74|5|Great for travel! No need to pack bulky shaving lotions. However I use traditional shavers and lotion at home.
B003GLQVK8|2|I've been looking for flavored but non-minty flossers, so I grabbed a pack of these when I saw them at WalMart. I have a small mouth so the flossers being child sized wasn't an issue. The packaging says \\"thin scrubbing floss\\" but what they really mean is \\"thick fraying floss\\". It is difficult to get the floss between teeth because it is not all that thin and isn't held taut enough by the handle part. This leads to much sawing and pulling with the floss, which gives you nicely shredded floss to try to push between the next pair of teeth. I have to use at least two of these things when I floss because the floss just falls apart. Oh, and the bag smells vaguely fruity but the flossers themselves nether smell nor taste fruity.
B00L9ILA42|5|I really like your product.  I have a sensitive skin and a lot of body washes leave my skin dry and itchy.  Puracy Natural Body Wash does not.  I don't feel  tight and drawn skin after toweling off.  I really like the fragrance also.  The body wash is non drying but not heavy.  Recently I purchased a body wash with heavy oils and I feel like I need to wash off the body wash after showering.  I don't feel that way using Puracy.  I will definitely purchase more and also I will give one to my daughter.
B00NXZK0A4|5|I received a bottle of Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion for the purposes of review. All opinions are my own.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the results I've gotten from the Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion. During the winter months, my skin gets super dry- which means I end up looking much older than I really am. However, with the Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion, that is no longer a problem. I simply put this on my face and my chest (and I've even used it as a hand cream during the day at home)- after I take a shower in the evenings and voila- moisturized skin! It feels absolutely amazing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to add to or even change their current moisturizer.
B00DPTW8JY|4|Really pretty
B00H7NKNE6|5|I ordered this product at a reduced rate as part of group to test this product and write a review.  I love this product.  It is light and does an outstanding job of moisturizing.  I use it every day on my hair.  I keeps my hair moisturizer without feeling greasy.  I also use it on my cuticles and skin with outstanding results.
B001ECQ7G4|5|If you have ingrown hairs and unsightly bumps, you need Tend Skin. Use moisturizer though, it will dry your skin.
B006ZUHRKA|5|excellent product meets its specification and arrived at the stipulated time
B00PV15BPW|5|high quality
B004D13ZEA|5|Great product, well made and easy to use. Highly recommend them.
B001M5H5JQ|5|Perfume was well packed and arrived quickly .Love this perfume!I have worn this since the early 90's , and it is so hard to find. I am so so glad I found it and at a fair price. It smells exactly how it should. THANKS!
B00BOJ92S2|5|Very pretty scent!
B0016N0RZ8|5|5-stars all day! I love this product and I own multiple colors. Today it was zebra, but hot pink, blue and others are in the cache as well. Incredible product.
B004WPWOS0|5|Don't let the size of the bottle throw you! Physical Fusion goes on so sheer. Just a few drops give great coverage and it gives my skin a beautiful glow while giving me great sun protection! I love this product!
B00A6MSYS2|5|I'm very impressed with Rimmel and Kate and I absolutely love this shade and wear it every chance I get.
B001KYQA1S|4|This works great as a setting gel on eyebrow powder. The powder stays put for much longer throughout the day. I only have to touch up once after a day out doing lots of activities (moving a lot, sweating, etc.)
B002F8BSBU|5|Use this on a daily basis.  Aluminum free is why I buy it and it helps keep me dry.
B00NPW16QW|5|Wow, I love this UV Lamp for my gel nails SO much! Works every bit as good (if not better) than the $235 one they use at the salon. The reason I say &#34;if not better&#34; is because you have the choice to set the timer at 120 or 180 seconds, so if you're like me and feel that 2 minutes is not quite long enough for those thicker polishes, you can safely add just one more minute to the routine where you feel you need it without running the whole 2 minute cycle twice or staring at your watch. Plus, they give you an extra light bulb right off the bat. And it's lightweight, easy to move around to whatever angle you need it to be so that you can comfortably rest your hand - or your toes!! - inside without worrying about smudging your polish. Tray slides out so you can wipe it down which is a real bonus, especially if you're doing your toes. :) Trust me, after you shell out $15 to $18 a bottle for gel or shellac nail polish (I use CND myself) you are going to appreciate being able to save $200 bucks on the absolutely necessary UV dryer.
B00006K14U|5|Use this face scrub pretty much every other day before bed and also use the nivea for men face wash on the other days.  i've been using this routine for about a year now and my skin has never looked better.  after using the face scrub my face felt comletely clean and soft.  i highly recommend this product.
B000C1VSJE|5|Love it
B006FKLRIS|5|I love the smell of this! Also works great when putting on right after the tanning bed. Helps keep your skin moisturized
B003Y5W4G6|5|My favorite shampoo ever!
B00AQ4XNXQ|5|Love this product. So absorbable and clean!
B000EVGOQY|4|while new hair growth did not increase significantly definitely stopped hair loss and brought a healthier look.  I use it with JASON Natural Biotin Conditioner. quite happy with it.
B008TT8T5C|5|I would advise some primer or some of the colors won't come out. This has so many different colors the ways to wear your eyes is endless!
B0039UTTHI|5|Revlon colorstay is true to its name. I am now free from lipstick marks on particularly cups. My husband can now kiss my lips any time of the day. I consider this quite breathtaking!
B00BJ9DCVU|5|This product is really good!! Easy to use and creats super good curling style! The shipping is fast, too. Though the weights of it feels a little bit lighter than the one I had before... But in all, good product and good price! Recomend to buy it!
B005MZMET8|2|It does go on lite but I have to put on a second application for it to be real effective...
B00U7O6KAS|5|love it
B000PIPZMU|5|I order this for my husband and he uses it on his beard. He likes the Red (Fox) color and it turns his African-American, naturally black hair a deep auburn. He has salt n pepper in his beard and it turns the silver a bright gold-auburn :) He has gotten compliments and people (men and women) asking how he color his beard. I like that it's natural, halal, and makes his hair healthier.<br /><br />He doesn't use it as instructed but has come up with his own method: he mixes a tiny amount with water in a small container to form a thick paste; let sit for an hour; apply to hair to coat; let dry. After completely dry, just use a comb or fingers to comb it out.  Sometimes he lets it sit in his beard for several hours (or overnight) around the house before combing out. He stores the leftover paste by covering the container and uses the rest again. If it dries out, he just adds a little warm water and mixes to a paste. It works better after sitting longer. He remixes another batch whenever needed and reapplies every few days or once a week. Using it this way, one box lasts him a few months. I'm sure it would go faster using it on your head but I'm sure the same method would work and avoids wasting any.<br /><br />Results are visible after the first use, but the color builds and looks richer after more applications. hope this helps.
B0037HP9OA|1|This product was defective right out of the box.  I followed instruction off owners manual, but noted that the green LED indicator would not go on while charging.  Contacted Philips product support who offered little insight, conceding almost immediately that the shaver must be defective.      I previously owned the Philips BG 2020 which lasted only two years and was used a total of maybe 6 times before the anemic ni-cd battery died and wouldn't take charges.  A defective brand new BG-2040 underscores my suspicion that the entire line of Philips/Norelco bodygroom shavers are lemons.  $29.99 retail for the older BG2020 was a reasonable price.  But asking $69.99 for the Bodygroom Pro that according to other reviews may work for only 3-12 months before dying is an insult.  It didn't work right out of the box.  Pathetic.
B00IJVOI1O|5|As described.
B007W1VUI6|5|Good seller, good product. My son uses when he was born. Continue buying.
B004W9AKI2|5|Thank you so much, I love it.Smells wonderful, got it so fast.  I went more into detail on the other purchase.
B0089GBCEK|3|after reading reviews I thought it would be great quality. It is only okay. It will do the job but nothing spectacular. I know it came from overseas but it took a ridiculously long time to arrive
B001ET7G9E|2|I seemed to have an allergic reaction in back of throat causing me to continually clear throat. It does stop bad breath.
B001ARSVJO|5|Loving this base coat, so glad I purchased it!  My nails have not looked this good in ages.  Definitely the best base coat I've ever used!
B000UK2W4C|5|I've used Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes since they were introduced.  No problems with ANY of them.  This system with the Sanitizer is the best one yet.   No Bulky holder for the toothbrush that gets filled with...and has to be   cleaned weekly, and the compact brush heads are great for smaller mouths  and control when brushing.  Flex care is the best.  All my Sonicare Batteries have held up. I think it may be user specific for those  that complain about the battery The battery has always served me well when I use it on the road.  The noise? All electronic toothbrushes I've tried are noisy.  Without my Sonicare, I'd be cleaning my teeth in a glass.   I'll trade noise, which I hate, for in tact teeth anytime!
B00SE4PK90|5|Just got it today and within about 30min my son went from fussy to asleep. I hope this continues to work
B00L3FP10K|5|good price, fast, high quality but ive learned not to expect anything less from this company :P
B00H78NTBA|1|By the end of the first day, it had several holes and tears. Its very cheaply made
B001PHFVPG|5|I heard about this from my sister and bought the product line.<br />It is great for curly hair and keeping unruly hair looking great<br />It also gives longer live to my perm<br />I LOVE DEVA CURL products and that's pretty much all I use now
B004FQGLQC|5|Love the smell of it.
B0018A32XS|4|It's a great little shaver. I have sensitive skin and every time i shaved with a razor blade, for a week or more i had a rash all over my legs. My husband got me this lil shaver. It works great, I hardly have any rash after shaving. Now i can use it every day. I use it wet and dry. I don't like the trimmer that is why I gave it four stars. It was pulling on my hair. So i don't use it at all. Don't expect the same close shave as you get from a razor. I have been using it for over a month now and am very satisfied. I bought a second one for my stepdaughter. The battery life isn't very long but can't complain for the price. I am very happy not having any bumps on my legs, especially the bikini area.
B007MKUCCW|3|What is that eybrow thing?  I bought the scissor and after bending it into shape and to reduce it's unworkable tightness I like it. But the eyebrow thing seems to be a torture device. I threw it away.<br /><br />The cutters on this scissor is a separate blade on the handle. And that is perfect for tight trimming. It came with the blades very tight and misshaped. They are easy to bend, though finese is important to get them correct without ruining them. I like a nice curve and easy feel I got that.<br /><br />These are so cheap, I would by few as I expect them to wearout after a time (my last ones, very similar lasted a couple of years).
B0023XF60Q|3|Can't really tell if it helps or not? Doesn't hurt that's for sure, but....<br /><br />I've discovered though, that it does work well to keep the blade oiled between uses, and I've used it for a few other random items that needed oiling. Kind of a nice, multi-purpose oil to keep around.  If everything locks up in another six months I'll update my review, but so far so good.<br /><br />Still not sure if it makes a bit of difference to a shave though.
B00GWBNS64|4|Nice shampoo and conditioner.  Has helped scalp itch and dry skin decently.  Smells great and keeps hair shiny and doesn't dull my color.
B0015QQUES|5|My now husband used to walk out of the bathroom look like he and the razor had a major falling out.  He has amazingly sensitive skin.  I worked with him for over a year to create a shaving routine that would reduced the amount of razor burn he would get, but nothing seemed to work.<br /><br />In a local salon, I happened to be looking at a rack of Dermalogica products (I used them for years to help manage my teenage acne and today use many of their products  for my adult skin) and I happened upon this shave oil and the girl behind the desk said he boyfriend had the same sensitive skin issues and that this product changed his shaving routine and his life!  Needless to say she was right!  My husband has been using the Close Shave Oil for almost 5 years and he hasn't touched another shaving product since.  Additionally, I converted my husbands brother, my own brother and my father!  My brother then proceeded to convert all his friends.  You do pay a bit more money up front, but the bottle last for several months and my husband has quite thick hair and a lot of it.
B000C1ZEY4|5|exelente
B000FQUGXA|4|I use it on my child's exzema-prone skin.  We went a very long stretch of time without having any flare ups and not having to resort to stronger medicated lotions, I am very pleased and will continue to purchase it.
B006GQYSGE|5|It is good. It´s water resistant, quiet and it does what is supposed to do. But I miss my old Phillips which was loud, not recharchable, not resistant to water, but it was really fast shaving. I give 5 stars but they need to improve in the speed department.
B000EVIVYW|2|The scent reminds me of clove and nutmeg.  It's pleasant but it lingers a lot longer than I would like.  I think I noticed it a good 10 hours after I put it on.  It does make my face feel great after a shave but I also think the bay oil is causing me to break out. I'll probably stop using it. I should also mention that it took 9 days to get a shipping confirmation which said it was already delivered. It was then delivered 4 days after that.
B00BB8NBL0|5|In my eternal quest for self-tanning products, a friend gave me a bottle of Fake Bake.  As a fair skinned blond, most products left an unnatural bronzy tone. They also had a tendency to make me itch.  Fake Bake goes on evenly with no streaking and by adding to the application every couple of days, a gorgeous tan develops without the chemical smell or the itchiness.<br /><br />Getting lots of compliments on my great tan.
B00197EO1O|5|i've bought six of this irons, because i sell them here in my country venezuela, these irons are like the boom now here, every single barber wants one, the product looks as good as it looks in the picz. totally recomended
B00ACB6HMC|5|This little hot iron is great!  I used it everyday and it by far is great quality for the price!  I would definitely recommend to others.
B00JRPIDJ4|1|the worst purchase I made, sent me something completely different, I'm super annoying!
B002EP9OUG|4|It no joke it hurt but the little hairs on my lip still haven't grown back much and i waxed probably 4-5 weeks ago when i first bought it :) hope they don't grow back at all
B004B0U57S|5|Wasn't expecting such good quality for the price! Definitely ordering again :)
B004BIZBF6|5|So much better than any other eye pencil brand I've used.  The blade is strong and perfectly aligned.  Ironically, I bought it to sharpen the intense liner by loreal and it's so soft, even this sharpener causes it to break off.  Every other pencil I own, is much better sharpened, though.
B004KF1302|5|A great purple if you want to fade out pink. This dye will fade out with co-washes so you can prolong it by mixing some blue dye into it to darken.
B001BAG38G|5|Always a great product.  If you never used this yet, try it, you will love it!!!
B000X9UJM2|5|Lo recomiendo, he comprado este producto a pedido de mi hermana y me dijo que le encanto. Felicito al vendedor, es sin duda muy leal en sus ventas.
B002TDLQOK|1|I don't believe it did anything for my muscle development.
B0093UC02Y|4|great for my boys the 2 in 1 takes out a step in staying clean. The deep clean, does it's job and it smells great.
B001VIXACA|3|Mine are a little dry and don't do much with removing eye makeup. They are very small.
B004495HQU|1|Used as I was suppose to until the bottle was gone. Don't see any difference. I think it's a waist of money!
B0011NR2HY|1|I have fair un-tanned skin ,  it looks like a mid to light Pink Color, NOT THE BERRY AS IT IS FEATURED!!<br /><br />Either I was sent a misprinted lipstick with correct title on Wrong color... or this is A BAD COLOR REPESENTATION IN THE Picture of the berry color lipstick that is shown when u click Marsha ....<br /><br />Love \\"too faced\\" have tons of eye colors as model , BUT Very BAD color SHOWN in image .<br /><br />ITS NOT A Mid to DARK BERRY as Seen, I WANT TO MAKE MY GREEN  EYES POP ON barely there makeup  with darker berry lips , a  GREAT Look I was going for.<br /><br />Too expensive to send back .<br />If I owned GOTH DARK Lipstick,  I  could mix this in a bowl with black Goth styled very dark merlo color and then it may become the Berry color that is depicted here.<br /><br />That is how  light-ish  PINK this Marsha lip color is,  P'd off.
B00PIEKGAC|5|Great product, all ingredients are well rated on EWG. Great find.
B001ET7I6U|1|I completely agree with the reviewers who hate the new formula, I wish I could give it negative stars. I started using this while battling cancer in 2009 and loved it, sticking with it even after the treatments ended. I'm back in treatment now for a recurrence and find that even though I'm not on harsh chemo now, this new formula burns my mouth terribly, it's painful to brush my teeth. They ruined a great product.
B00FS2N3FE|5|Enough can't be said about this excellent toothbrush. Noticeable difference starting from day one. A bit on the pricey side but it's money well spent.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!!!
B00GTC0E1I|2|I have been pleasantly surprised with Suave products lately. I have tried some that really were lovely. This isn't one of them.<br /><br />I love dry shampoo and use it to extend my blowouts. I have tried several brands and found almost all to work well. So I thought this would be a great place to save a little money. But the Suave dry shampoo was a disappointment.<br /><br />I noticed no difference between this and the Morroccan infusion Dry Shampoo by Suave.  They were both abysmal.<br /><br />I sprayed it in and got no benefit. I ended up having to use a lot more than I have of other brands to fluff up the greasies. Then the white powder clumped and flaked everywhere. No amount of brushing would distribute it or lighten it. Luckily for me, I have grey hair. But I tried it on my daughter to see how it worked on light brown hair. You could totally see it. I could not brush it away.
B00JJPMXDO|3|Didn't do much more than keep under eye area hydrated. Hydrated under eyes is important so, that was nice. As for working any miracles. Nope.
B00GTAJB78|5|I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I WAS SO SURPRISED TO SEE HOW GREAT IT WORKS ON DARK SPOTS, IRRITATED BLEMISHES AND WRINKLES.  WOW
B00I5H5Y56|4|I have to start with a confession: when I first read the packaging, I didn't read it closely enough. I thought it said that this product was recommended to be used with *any* Crest whitening product, not specifically with Crest 3D White toothpaste. So I've been using it with regular Crest whitening, not the new 3D White stuff.<br /><br />That said, it still kind of works. Not as well as whitening strips, but I have a hard time with those because my teeth are sensitive. This hasn't caused any sensitivity issues at all. It feels (and tastes) very similar to the polish used at the dentist's office when you get your teeth professionally cleaned.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's not working quite as miraculously as the package (and other reviews) led me to believe it would. I realize that part of that might be because I'm not using it with 3D White like I'm supposed to, but I still think that's a limitation of the product--that it has to be used in conjunction with another product in order to be fully effective.
B001V9X3YO|5|These are so imperative to achieving excellent oral home care. I definitely recommend these for everyone.
B0045U1YWE|3|I really wanted the twin blade swivel type but could not find them.  These work pretty well for me.  And the price is decent.
B00068EXQ8|2|Great value for the money but kind of cheap feeling and very noisy. keep it clean and oiled after EVERY use and you will see much better results.(edit)...I've taken away a star but left two stars simply because I only paid 9.99 for this product. That is still no reason that after exactly one year of use, approx twice a week, the blades no longer cut at all. I am very Disappointed with the failure, however, In the beginning it did a decent job.
B00348KW4E|5|I bought this on a whim at Sams Club because they had a salesperson walking around giving samples to people.  I love the stuff.  It feels wonderful, smells great, not heavy or greasy at all.  I can't understand why the other reviewer on here gave it only one star.  I must have 6 or 7 different kinds of lotions in my house, many which I am very happy with, but this one is the best.<br />Piece of advice:  Buy the relaxing nail kit and save yourself 10 bucks, plus get cuticle lotion and an amazing nail buffer tool that works great.  Same lotion, size and everything, in the kit.
B009A291L8|5|I have been using this cream daily for a week for mild acne on my chest and back. It has cleared or started to shrink most of the spots and the inflammation has reduced, where the &#34;visibly clear&#34; wash I was using before didn't have much effect. My sister also applied some to a spot and 2 days later there is no sign of it.
B00716H7U2|5|This product exceeded my expectations.  If you like tropical, fruity scented perfumes, you will love this one.  My husband loves it too.  This is the best tropical-scented perfume I have ever purchased.  I think I will continue to purchase more perfumes by Escada.
B004H98K2A|3|This was advertised as eau de toilette,  which has over twice the aromatics as eau de cologne.  What i received is eau de cologne.
B009CXO58O|3|Beautiful Vanilla scent---very sophisticated.  Sold here for $75 less than anywhere else.
B0059UOGH4|4|Con: It doesn't have a mirror nor a sponge applicator.<br /><br />Other than that, it is a great eye shadow, I am using Coco Harris and I don't need special techniques to \\"blend\\" the color in,it is very pigmented yet easy to apply.<br /><br />With the eye primer, it wears about 7 hours without having the crease line.<br />I also like the pink and dark blue combination, works great for glamours evening look.
B0037LMS0Y|5|I am very happy with my bobby pins.  I use them when I wear my thick hair in a bun, and they manage to stay in all day.
B003N96A6I|5|It works so much better than a store bought Crest white strips and gets more of the back teeth instead if the 4 front ones
B000RGGOCU|5|Wonderful product! Great value! Awesome service! Highly recommend this product to anyone. This is a life time scent for me.
B0015QQUES|1|I tried this along with some other Dermalogica products.  I have coarse hair, sensitive skin, and use a double edge razor with astra or feather blades.  I've had more nicks and cuts with these products than any other product.
B003TNQG4E|5|Excellent exfoliator!  Excellent company!  I highly recommend this product - it leaves your skin feeling amazing!
B005YRD5PQ|5|Fantastic product—the fragrance is subtle and the pearlescent white color looks great in a clear glass soap dispenser.
B005G9WK8U|5|I purchased this product after I bought a new sonicare and it did not come with a travel case. This case is so much better than the old sonicare travelcase and carries two heads as well.
B000H65W1E|1|Don't waist your money. This thing didn't do anything but get uncomfortably hot against my leg. If anyone has actually gotten this device to remove hair, I'd like to know your secret.
B000EG8HLE|5|EXCELENTE PRODUCTO Y A UN MUY BUEN PRECIO, EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y RAPIDO, RECOMENDACION PARA TODOS LOS COMPRADORES EN COMPRAR ESTE PRODUCTO
B000OWEZVE|5|I would like to buy more, but I can't find it.  I have looked at all the sites<br /><br />who has this product?
B00IZERSF8|5|A great buy , working Vera well
B005CRUS5I|5|This was a wishlist gift for my wife. She's a stickler about quality cosmetics that reduce or eliminate the use of harmful chemicals and substances, a practice that I wholeheartedly support. Tarte's products are known to be of high quality and contain more natural ingredients.
B0095RHBWE|5|Can only find this on line. I used to get it at Wal Mart but they don't handle it anymore!!<br />I have used a lot of different mascara's and this works better for me.
B009S3PZBO|5|This brush, brushes hair.  Long hair, short hair, baby hair, leg hair, back hair - you name it!  No more ttangles for the whole family :) Thank you wet brush!!!
B0012RWNKK|5|I love this product.  The smell isn't overwhelming at all.  It has a soft and calming scent, that I can wear all day without anyone complaining about having on too much perfume.<br />R,<br />Satisfied customer
B00548TZLI|5|Love this fragrance so lite. I use it right out of the shower. Not overpowering!!!
B002QY86BI|4|Great shine but if your nails are 'ridgy' I'd use a regular buffer first to smooth out and then use this one. As others have stated, it doesn't last long as the surface wears out quickly - I'd order one to make sure you like it and then order 3-4 at once if you buff regularly or do both nails/toes.
B001PTFV72|5|Back in the day, I loved a Patchouli fragrance. I was excited to read the positive reviews here (and other sites too) so I order this. Great move on my part! As others have indicated, it gets better the longer you have it on. Changes from the initial smell to a subtle alluring fragrance after a while. Enjoy!!!
B001JK6N3I|5|Use it for long runs, works great no chafing at all. Good product
B00TDMHELE|3|I love the shampoo but the lotion/cream's scent is too strong.
B001RQI512|3|The product is OK--as others have mentioned, the smell is not great but you use very little of it so it dissipates quickly.  I think those who complain of the smell and greasy texture days later are simply using way too much.  My main concern is that this is a TINY bottle....less than one ounce....for $8.  There is no way the shipping charge should be another $8, essentially doubling the price.  I need to find somewhere to buy it over-the-counter.....
B007LANY2S|5|I got these to play around with colors and they are wonderful!
B00DSK6NRS|5|work great to keep sanitary
B000SDTM3A|5|Love it!!!!
B00021VI3A|5|I ordered the wrong color I guess
B00CBZ0I90|5|Excellent! I have a full set of these years ago! Wish I had kept them! Yet, now I'm replacing them, going back to the herbals that treat my condition much better! Take your time and it works out just great. Read the complete simple instructions, many times if necessary, it's not that hard to do!
B00FH692PQ|5|Normally, I worry about using shampoo frequently, as it dries my hair out, causes split ends, and creates dandruff. Even more, I was becoming concerned with the fact that my sensitive hair could become permanently damaged as a result of sticking to more conventional shampoos. This shampoo did a good job of thickening my hair, as well as boosting volume slightly. I wouldn't say there is a need to use it everyday, but if you have sensitive/thin hair, this might help a little with boosting the feel and fullness of your hair.
B003GWVERC|5|Clean, non-irritating, odorless. Does the best job of adding lubrication missing during any day of the month. easy convenient packaging perfect for travel as well. Won't go without it.
B0013QOIGC|4|This is a nice cream. It is a little greasy.Put on a little at a time and let it sit
B0030GFXMG|5|i have thick but fine texture hair and this is the only shampoo that doesnt weigh it down and make my hair feel oily by the end of the day
B004MZVS9Q|5|Really cute containers....and FABULOUS lip balm.  Makes a great gift for anyone. I make sure to keep several on hand for \\"whatever\\" gifts.
B00A78TEAM|3|Smells good and seems to work okay tanning
B000N773K0|5|This stuff really works!!!! I ordered 6 bottles and I am going to order about 20 bottles more.  I am African-American with natural C4/C3 hair. My hair was extremely damaged from bleaching, stress, dryness and it was literally falling out when I would run my fingers through it.  In addition to using this product I also clipped my ends, had a deep conditioning, and stared a vitamin regimen and it has stopped my hair from breaking.  The Coconut Milk leaves your hair feeling soft and strong, it does not leave a residue at all and it has really strengthened my hair. I recommend it. It works better then all products I have used in my hair combined.  It really will stop you from getting split ends and it will stop your hair from breaking especially if it is damaged from bleach, dryness, and stress.  BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!
B007NQQJ7C|5|Great stuff. Bought this for a friend even though it's quite expensive. It's definitely nice, and an elegant gift for a birthday or holiday.
B00BI2CIVS|5|I have tried them all, gels, creams, and other oils from the best available.  I keep coming back to KOS, its really the best available.  If you have never used an oil, beware that you must wash your face with a good face cleaner after you shave to remove the residual oils, I use Kiehls, it works great for me.  Also they recommend you to wet your face first... while this is true I find it better to use a wash cloth to remove all but light moisture before applying the oil.  Shaving in the shower is absolutely the best if you can do it.  Your going to think just a few drops cannot possibly be enough, trust the directions, its plenty.<br /><br />Also you might see KOS offers a bit larger bottle of a hybrid type oil, I have not had nearly as good of success with the hybrid.
B00GFBWWWC|5|This serum is amazing! I love the way vitamin C makes my face feel, and I enjoyed using &#34;The Body Shop&#34; brand which has okay results, but always made my face feel hot after application. This serum however doesn't, and I'm glad, especially since it is affordable compared to other serums of it's kind! It's just what I was looking for. It's lightweight, smells great, non greasy and keeps my skin feeling rejuvenated. I highly recommend!
B000050B6D|4|Easy to replace, a bit wasteful on packaging.<br /><br />A general complaint that they don't last too long so I have to be extra careful about cleaning, drying, and being efficient with these blades.<br /><br />But I guess I'm stuck with them unless I buy another machine.
B008FZ562E|5|Great product.  Had used before and so I knew exactly what I was looking for.  This is the one for me.
B008HODSQE|5|Amasing comes fast cheep and just perfect color great coulity work and just amasing deffintaly ivwill sugest this to many others
B00DQBMN6E|1|Doesn't work, not sure what the lady in the video used because several of us tried it and nothing. Waste of money.
B00IFX8A88|5|This Shower brush is near perfect. I like the rope around the handle. It does help keep a grip with soapy hand. The bristles are not set into plastic like other that would fall apart. Is medium from brush and just right for me. What would make it perfect? Add 2 inches to the length of the handle. Although it is adequate , extra length handle would make it easier on you. I highly recommend this one anyway.
B008U5QLQY|5|I have used most of the colors and I like the green, gold and shimmery pink the most. B. E . Makes long lasting shadows w rich pigments and this pallet is no exception. Safely and promptly shipped.
B00CZAEUEA|5|Okay, I officially love this oil blend. I have fine hair, some grey and it is also permed. I needed a much lighter oil than what most products are. I needed it not be heavy and weigh my hair down or worse, make it greasy.  This oil works beautifully. I rubbed some on the top of my hand and it soaked right in, no oily build up.  It soaks into my hair the same way. You don't need much and it smells so amazing my husband walked by and said, &#34;Hey, you smell really good&#34; - it was the oil. Not a strong scent but is nice.  It helped my hair look soft and not brittle, and kept fly-aways down.<br /><br />I liked this oil so much, I promptly bought more so I can have one in each bathroom!
B00FU7PZ3K|5|Love these little scrunchies (which are now back in style, yay!).  I have fairly fine hair and these are just the right size.  I twist them around three times and they hold very well.  I really needed black and some neutral colors also.  Hoping they come out with a more colorful variety in the future!
B005HJ3GZU|4|I read about this product in a magazine and thought I would try it out. I had just removed my eyelash extensions and I literally had little nubs for eyelashes. I actually used to have long, thick eyelashes but after my pregnancy and work stress, I started to lose them and I was willing to try anything to get them back. I must say that I was pretty impressed with the results of this product. It took about 3-4 weeks before I noticed a difference, but my lashes got really long and pretty strong. It doesn't necessarily add volume (which is what I really wanted), but it's nice to have the length. It was also nice because it prevented my lashes from falling out from normal 'wear and tear.' However, after about 3 months of using it, I noticed that it seems like the serum stopped working a bit. My lashes are still long, but it's taking longer to regrow. I have also noticed that I've gotten more compliments on my lashes since I've been using Rapid Lash and my family has noticed a difference. If only they could make this add volume, it would be PERFECT, but it does lengthen your lashes, it just takes a while :)
B00JZFB13G|5|Great product for a great price!
B003IXJ6FG|5|Noxema in a pump dispenser is very convenient and you still get the same excellent product.  I have exclusively used Noxema since I was 16 and look a good 20 years younger than I am.  The eucalyptus in it helps repel mosquitoes and gnats but is not perfect for the job.
B003VZPTAC|2|Greasy.
B00NQBRYWC|4|This smells a little like grapefruit but it's mild. The scent does not stick or stay on you. This is very thick. It reminds me of a body wash more than shampoo. However, you do not need much at all. I just used a quarter size in my palm and it was perfect. It lathers up very nicely and quickly, and it rinses, clean. My hair felt clean afterwards. The only thing I would change is the scent and I would have liked the scent to stay on my hair throughout the day but it does not. I have only used this for two days though. I received a discount on this product. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer's standpoint.
B00HU8Z1KE|1|This eyeshadow claimed to also include a base.  It didn't blend into my eyelid very well.  I am in the aging skin category, so it might do better on younger eyelids!
B001DJDP7C|5|thayers leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, and it lasts a long time. The unscented formula is undetectable unless you put you nose directly on the bottle, even then its still faint. I like to apply after a nice shave. I like it!
B00N6IMQCS|5|This product is amazing! Anyone with balding spots, won't believe the results!<br /><br />Great service with very fast shipping.
B003TMK3N0|5|Great stuff
B003JP90EU|5|After I straighten my hair I can put the silky smooth product in my hair again and it leave my hair feeling soft moisturized and smelling amazing all day long! I love this product I'm so glad my hair stylist used on me!
B007737HCM|3|I love this, but was excited to be able to wear it right now. I painted my nails black with this on only the tips (awesome effect) but it felt like Christmas! I will only use this polish around the holidays due to the RED RED RED glitter. It looks different from the picture. Definitely a high quality polish and I do love it, but the pictures do not clearly show the color.
B007SZCG0C|5|This product My name is Lisa Rosario, this shampoo is great it gave my hair more volume and made my hair more thick, it also added shine, excellent.
B005M1S68U|2|This product did not meet my expectations.
B00BEJKXBW|5|I do a lot of shaves!  This is the best razor!
B00756HQNQ|5|Awesome for Rough feet or dry skin feet you will love this product you wont be sorry u bought it
B008XLN1AE|4|I have been applying this product to 3 dark spots on my cheek for the past 7 weeks, twice a day. Both my husband and I feel the spots are fading, but I should have taken before pics!
B003EMVVMM|3|I really can't tell a big difference from the regular and proglide.  I do think that they proglide may be sharper and give a better shave for the first 1-3 shaves but then they seem the same.  I also think the proglide did not last quite as long but can't be sure.  I usually got 2 weeks from the regular but only got about 10 days with the proglide.  Reason I can't be sure is I skipped shaving and it had to deal with a 2 day growth twice and that may have \\"shortened\\" the use.  I just wish I could find a razor that was more economical.  I had gone electric but suffered from irritation and when you figure the purchase plus the 2x a year blade replacement (yes electrics need blade replacement too) the cost came out the same.  When the 5 blade razor first appeared a news story did a comparision with the 3 blade.  There was no noticeable difference in the quality of shave that the review panel could feel.  I may go back to the Mach 3 or try a Schick product.  I have always used Gillette razors.  I would give a 4 for quality but knock it down to a 3 because of cost.
B003SZ4C1W|3|Better than what you could get at the dollar store.<br />Good for the price but not the best.
B004KMQLCA|5|Odlican proizvod , lako se nanosi, malo isparava sve zavisi od kolicine kose koju radite i koliko je kosa ostecena...Na ostecenu kosu reaguje drugacije , malo se teze fenira kada se nanese keratin jer postane suva ali kada se tretman potpuno zavrsi efekat je odlican sto je i najbitnije....Ja sam zadovoljna..Hvala puno...
B00JMDPK8S|3|Update:  I am lowering my rating to 3 stars because of the difficulty and expense of finding and buying replacement heads.  I couldn't find any for quite some time.  I've since found some online, not on Amazon, but from a low of $19.99 (but out of stock) to more than $25 for a single head.  The difficulty and cost makes buying this brush too impractical, which is too bad because I like the unit.<br />~~~~~~~<br /><br />The toothbrush I reviewed is the similar model, EW-DE92.  I was taken to this page when I tried to post my review.<br /><br />First, and most important, I love the way this brush cleans my teeth.  Using the \\"white\\" mode, they feel nice and fresh and thoroughly cleansed.  According to the owner's guide, some people can feel that slight electric charge, the ionic feature, when using the brush, and I am one of those people.  However, it is extremely mild and not the least unpleasant.<br /><br />I like that there are various settings on this brush although I use \\"white\\" most often.  The gum brush may be useful but I don't use it as routinely as suggested because it just doesn't feel like it is doing much for me.  I do like to use the little pointy rubber head but again, not as often as the regular head.  I do like the tongue cleaner on this brush.<br /><br />Which brings me to one of the drawbacks.  I cannot seem to find replacement heads for this product.  I looked on Amazon and I went to the Panasonic site with no success.  I went to the same model toothbrush on both sites and there are no links to the replacement heads.  I wanted to order some in advance so I would have then when needed.  Perhaps this is a new model and replacement heads will become widely available, but this toothbrush is expensive to begin with, and much more so if heads cannot be found.<br /><br />Compared to my basic but rechargeable Philips Sonicare toothbrush, this one is nicer to hold because the handle is much slimmer.  The Sonicare seems to have a more robust brushing action, but this one seems to get my teeth just as clean, perhaps marginally cleaner.<br /><br />The charger seems to work well.  I took the brush on a 10-day trip and chanced not taking the charger with me, and I had no loss of power during that trip.  It seems to hold its charge quite well.<br /><br />But there is a downside to the charger too.  According to the manual again, the lithium battery lasts about 3 years.  When the battery is dead, I am supposed to \\"Contact an authorized service center for repair.\\"  Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service costs.<br /><br />One more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  This set comes with a little stand to store the heads, but none of the heads have a protective cover and the storage stand does not have a cover, so the heads are sitting out in the bathroom air, something I don't like at all.  The travel case holds the handle and one head but not the extra heads.  My cheaper Sonicare has a plastic cap that comes with each head to protect it.<br /><br />While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.  At current prices, this one costs more than twice my Sonicare, and while this one has more bells and whistles, I don't believe the price difference is justified.lean, perhaps marginally cleaner.

B00JKUJGWO|5|This product does the job.  I put the 2 capfuls in the water and soaked for about 20 minutes and the pain in my legs went away and didn't return. It really works.
B00158J0EI|1|Got them on time but I still have to glue my plate in. Was not happy with it done exactly what direction said.
B00L9RWWYA|2|So packaging is great and quick delivery, but for me glue did not work and gave me severe eye watering and redness. I have used many glues and dyes over the years, but this really itched and hurt.
B00AB7KN0E|1|This product is hardly big enough for a small hand.  With no heat controls, it burned me when heated.  Give more detail about size and heat control.  Very deceptive.
B00BFZHW50|3|I like this product but wish I would have known it would have to be refrigerated. This is difficult where I wanted to keep it.
B00684DV08|5|I've used many, many hair products and this is the best, by far.  It is definitely worth the price.  It can actually straighten your hair.  It repairs your hair, smooths your hair and helps your hair to grow.  This conditioner smells great, and it only takes a few drops.  I gave a bottle to my sister Phyllis, and she uses two drops every day.
B009JK2UV4|2|I'm a full time stylist. On average, I use trimmers on 25 or more customers a day working an 8 hour shift. I have owned 4 Babyliss trimmers (the black one's) in the past and have never had any problems with them other than the blades when dull. I seen these were 50 dollars cheaper then going to the supply store, gave these a try. They work very well other than they don't stay charged for more than 4 hours of use. That's cutting someone's hair, then putting them back on the charger, so there being &#34;charged&#34; between customers. Also because of the light color, and the trimmers texture, hair sticks to them very well. These trimmers would be great for home use or if you work at a much slower salon.
B00BFVASJ6|5|Love this stuff!
B0000WUR7E|3|My wife found that these curlers hold heat for a while helping to curl hair, but winding hair up in these is slightly difficult seeing as the glue doesn't hold the ends on very well.  They pop right back on which is good but she wouldn't think that this should happen her 3rd time using them... She would go with a different type of curler.
B002X0FRCG|5|Everything was excellent!
B0094GHGQM|5|I have a real problem with raccoon eyes after hours of wearing mascara, even with powder under my eyes. Cover Girl has always been better than the rest. I used to use the orange one, now I'm hooked on this one. Goes on nicely even with one coat. Washes off easily with cleanser and water, which is important for me with my contact lenses.
B009STWPE8|2|This set says it includes Soft Candy Refreshing Hair & Face Mist, Soft Candy Vanilla Buttercream Lip Scrub and Soft Candy Jumbo Lip Balm. I got the mist, lip balm, and some sort of souffle....I'm not happy about it. This is a gift for my daughter who wanted the lip scrub which has was sold out back in May. I'm returning it.
B00FYY741U|5|I have been using this project for several months and use it several times a day.  I love the smell and the tingling feeling it leaves.  It certainly helps in the morning when you need a little pick up around the eyes and it is great to use after being on the computer as I am for several hours a day.  This is one item I wish was in a larger version.
B00BRDEANW|1|to hard
B001SRBTCM|1|I just received this comb and the teeth have splinters.  I tried using the comb but it pulls and catches strands of my hair.  I'm disappointed and will continue looking for a quality comb to replace plastic ones in my home.
B000C1VVQO|1|The pafum is very nice. But the one I got fades quicky, the aroma is a bit faint and not lasting.
B00016RLZ0|3|It's a good brush and attractive but hanging it in the shower now I have to glue it back together.  It's not as if it was sitting in the wet but I guess just having moisture around was not within its capabilities.
B0077LAJT2|5|price is great, work well. They dont stay as sharp for as long as the other brand I use, but these are cheaper. Go for it
B002QA31SU|5|I have waist length hair so hair ties are a big part of my life.  I have purchased this brand in many colors, I reviewed [[ASIN:B0045H854W B0045H854W]] earlier and I'll say it again here.  These are great, hold their shape, have no metal and I have tried to 'seed' my life so there is always one or two around
B00387F42Q|5|I love RoC products. Very good results everytime. I other RoC products work amazing! One of the few products out  there with excellent price  and Real results.
B00FZESMKG|5|Great product! I have acne prone skin and wasn't sure this would work for me. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. If you're looking for an organic cleanser that works, this is the one! You won't be disappointed:)
B001ETX86O|4|This item is great if you have a very tight budget and are looking to find out your fat percentage. The only reason why I could not give it five stars is because it is hard to read the numbers, but defiantly doable.
B00BNM8WY0|5|All good things...
B000I6P466|4|I bought these for my mom (late 50s) and she LOVED them.  She said they're so comfortable and nice. I plan on purchasing more for Christmas gifts.
B004I94DF2|1|Good things:  The colors are great.  Bad things though will make me never order this brand again.  The polish is thick and clumpy.  The brushes lose their hair almost immediately.  This polish ad says that it is &#34;chip resistant&#34;.  FALSE!  I have huge chips on multiple nails within 24 hours of application.  And I wasn't doing anything that should have chipped my nails.  This brand is terrible.  Would not recommend this brand to anyone. To bad, because like I said, the colors were so pretty.
B000EZYKTS|4|This is my first experienece with epilating and I must say it is a bit painful for me even after three times of usage. This despite the fact that I have been getting my body professionaly waxed every month so it's not like I have  a low pain threshold. I love the fact that that this device has a light that makes you see hairs that you would otherwise miss, and yes, the pain is getting better with each use but I have two problems with it:  I don't know if it's just me, but I have been having more ingrown hair on my legs after using this machine than I ever have.  Second, Although the manual advices against using it on very short hair (I mean hair that's not even reached it's mid length), I like to use it on very short hair or medium length as it eases the pain. Anybody else had a similar experience? Is there any problem with doing this?    I can't say if the machine is better than others, but definetely worth your money as it saves you the money you'll spend on waxing.
B000GFWIOU|5|My favorite hair spray!
B0058SY1XQ|5|Perfect for traveling and battery life is really good.<br />I've been very happy with this pair of clippers and the motor is nice and powerful.
B0006BDO5G|5|This masque feels great. It's really smooth, and I could see an improvement after using it just a few times.
B00CQ7XQY2|4|I don't think this is necessarily the magic potion it claims to be but it definitely helped calm a bad burn. Unfortunately, the damage was already done so I wasn't able to test it on a brand new burn, I was half a week into my sunburn when I discovered this. I did find that I had to do multiple applications during the day as unlike a lotion the oils don't necessarily stay on your skin for several hours. I did like that it was a spray bottle though as it makes application quick and easy. Definitely a good maintenance moisturizer in the summer, but not a heavy duty moisturizer.
B0001EKRDU|4|I bought this for a tattoo. I knew I'd be getting a big area done on my arm. So that day I applied the cream fairly thick to my most of my forearm and wrapped it in suran wrap. I did this 3 hours before my appointment to get full potential from it. And yes I kept my arm wrapped the whole 3 hours. Let me say, it made this session of ink more bareable. I say it works, use my method and you will see that it helps for sure.
B0027URH3E|5|I've had this product in my makeup kit for 17 years, and it is the best! YSL got it right with this one. It is creamy, blends beautifully and comes in great colors. (I use the lightest shade. It covers and still provides a youthful fresh look.) Tip: Your concealer should be two shades lighter than your foundation in order to highlight the eye area. Radiant Touch is perfect. And, for those of us who need it, it has light deflectors in it, so it works to hide fine lines. They just disappear. I always feel terrific when I use this product! Oh, and Amazon has a great price for this product. It is much more expensive at the mall.
B002R7ZFHC|5|Exactly what I was looking for! I was looking for this in BEBE stores and couldn't fine it. Thank you!
B00BZY86JM|5|I purchased this for my sister so I don't know too much about it but from what I saw, it's exactly as advertised, cleverly designed, and fulfills its function perfectly. Glad I got the last pink one.
B00FYJOQG6|3|It's a little sharp for the scalp, but pulls my beard hair. Fits well in my saddleback leather wallet, but has been relegated to emergencies only.
B00I9YI2KO|5|Basic tote. Very cute design.  Lots of compliments on it.  Doesn't wash well though...at least I didn't have good luck with washing it.
B00EVB1U9O|3|Works fine, but you get what you pay for vs. the Clairsonic name brand.  The head didn't fit completely tightly to the base so it rattles a bit when you use it. Also, it seems to smell &#34;old&#34; much faster than the name brand.
B00IDU1FNU|5|I swear this is the best value and by far the best mascara I've ever had. Honestly it's truely amazing, who needs fake eyelashes? When you can get this bad boy. It looks THICK and LONG. What better can you get? Buy it, Just buy it
B00GRDHIKO|5|I am so happy with these clippers!  In no time at all my toenails looked nicer than they have in years!  Regular clippers had become useless on my thick toenails.  I will purchase another one for my Mother.
B00FX4BJNU|5|I liked
B007QCI1II|5|Thanks to Blue Novelties, I have received the HSI professional Argan oil. (Thanks!) This oil is amazing. You need about 4-5 drops, rub through hands, and evenly distributed. It absorbs easily and adds a wonderful shine and health to your hair
B0051PLB6Q|1|Not impressed. Not easy to spread. Turned my skin orange with uneven coloring.
B0007IPATQ|5|I just received my perfume and I am extremely pleased!  Not only did the seller get me the product in great time but the product itself is just wonderful!  I can't stop smelling myself and my husband absolutely loves it; he can't keep his hands off me while I'm wearing it!  I love this perfume and I plan on buying more. I'm happy I decided to go ahead with it because I would have been missing out on a great buy.  Thanks PWorld; I'm a customer for life!    Tricia L.
B000LTIJB2|4|Works as advertised. Although it does dry out after a while. When used on a sound that is left inserted for a while it seems to get sticky making withdrawal somewhat problematic.<br /><br />Will continue use it however.
B0000532A2|5|These work great, they are a perfect size, do the job they are supposed to, and now my eyebrows always look great!
B000XE6336|5|I used to wear this fragrance as a teen.  I loved it's fresh and &#34;true to the flower&#34; scent.  It was eventually taken off the market and though I searched periodically couldn't find it.  I was thrilled to find this fragrance again and received it promptly from the seller.  It was well packaged and in a lovely glass bottle, different than the one I remember as a teen.  The best part is the wonderful fragrance!  I am going to order another one before it disappears again!
B007K6K0IY|4|Thanks to Secret I was given the opportunity to try this deodorant for free through a BzzCampaign. I haven't tried a gel deodorant in years due to that wet, slimy, sticky feeling you get on the under arms of your shirt because the stuff just never dries. I must say this deodorant does dry within a few minutes and does not leave white marks - tested this by putting my shirt on after apply.  The smell is nice and it did last a full 24 hours before I felt as though it was wearing off. The con for me personally is I have pretty sensitive skin and after 4 days this started to make my skin itch a bit.
B002LFLPV0|3|Ok Thanks
B00BQYYMQ2|4|This wig is amazing!😁😁😁😁it's super long and soft...it comes with few tangled but it's nothing a wire brush can't fix. It's a small wig so if you have a big head, like me,you might have to pin it down to stay comfortably. But for the price the quality is really good.
B000V2ACH8|5|This was perfect, I've been using it for 2 weeks days now and it holds amazingly throughout the day. It smells amazing and it washes off in the shower quite well unlike most greasy waxes that you get at the store. It gave me a matte dry that didn't look like i was trying to hard, and that's the first rule to being cool.<br /><br /> It will probably be used everyday for the next month too and still have enough for a few more days! This is a great value, and i found myself using a whole lot less product than my other Gatsby products (preferably the pink and green jars), it just gets a little tough to wash out because of the extra texture, but all good it still washes out easy overall.
B00LW1K68C|5|IN LOVE!!
B003VMZTCI|5|I LOVE Bella's Vampire.  It is dark... not too purple, not too black.  I am a huge fan of \\"Black Berry Cherry\\" and found myself wearing it almost all of the time.  I bought this hoping to find something I liked just as well.  It is beautiful!
B00I5QGDWA|4|Good if you're looking for a medium hold.
B00464EYX0|2|I wanted to like these but to be honest the scent was a little too 'old' for me. Needless to say I will be donating these.
B004WIUNBW|5|Great product for the value. I use to every time I need to trim. I have not used it in the shower as a wet shave, so cannot attest to it's performance there.
B00FQ0QVDY|2|This product didn't work for me. It didn't curl my hair at all. I'll stick with Kinky Curly for now.
B000R29ZI4|5|Like the color
B0018A32XS|4|I recently suffered my third bout of blood clots in my leg and was put on blood thinner. Previously I had been told I could not shave my legs and when I did I bled. This time the instructions I was given were use an electric shaver. This does not shave as close as a razor but no blood. I still need to shave at least every other day. It is not a good as I hoped but better than the alternative.
B00GXF4QHY|5|Wife loved it and it arrived ahead of schedule.
B006CREM3Q|5|Infinite skin cream makes your skin so soft even after one use works good also on your hands, I will be back for more!
B00TKU1G9K|2|Maybe my sense of smell has change.  I loved this scent and used it in my 20's but this Joy, I'm sorry to say, did not compare with the original.
B00H53ESCQ|4|The product is great. No problems. Workmanship is good. The only problem I had was the time it took to receive my merchandise. For me a month is a bit long to wait for anything. Other then that , the product is good.
B00M1E5F1W|5|Works better than the RQ12 head
B00BBCW6FS|5|Love this flat iron!  Easy to use.  Great results.
B00OJX5GJY|5|This tanning lotion works amazing! Deffinitly recommend it!
B004MOH1ES|5|Perfect! 10/10
B002RBF1PO|1|A dangerous tool! I have had to stop using this device because I come away from every use with at least 3 major cuts on my face.
B00JM80IDK|3|The bag is cute & large inside
B000EMWHD2|4|It curls.  Nothing wrong with the product.  The &#34;shape&#34; (curve of the product) doesn't fit my eye; oherwise, i'd give it 5 stars.
B003YCH216|5|I have used this skin moisturizer for many years.  I like it very much.  It's not greasy, and has very little fragrance - only a light natural fruit scent that quickly dissipates once it's applied.  I tried 3 other moisturizers when Walgreens stopped carrying Merlot brand, but didn't find any that I liked as much.
B00JENBCVU|5|Smells great...going to use it in soap
B000FJ17Y4|1|Whatever happened to product integrity ?  NOT the old Ace combs per what I have been reading<br /><br />I guess the whole world is now &#34;buyer beware&#34;<br /><br />Conair is doing the same thing as Ace (cheapening their product)
B0030HNNS6|3|This stuff smudges and smears and I guess I'm just not used to this kind of eyeliner; I'm used to an eyeliner pencil.
B008SAYEEW|1|the cream smelled a bit rancid.
B0054MSCI6|5|I bleached my hair and used this afterwards to condition my hair and it felt like I didn't even bleach it.
B00CXXDZKO|2|I've used this product before and it has always been wonderful!  This time, it seemed old.  The cream was thick (thicker than usual) and was very hard to apply.  It literally wouldn't stick on your head, you apply it with the applicator brush and it would fall back off.  I was very disappointed and had to order from another company on another site.  A monumental waste of time and money!
B000JNQSIQ|5|Works great , Easy to handle .Also not heavy to work with , fits in your hand good . Color coded helps to determent how short you want to cut the hair.
B000H3I1DS|4|This is a good product, but I would like it even more if it had a mirror incorporated. The texture is good (it doesnt cover too much), and the price is ok.
B00BPDFQK0|5|It was great! I used that top coat all time I'm ready to buy my second one. I get a lot of great compliments about it very often. Lol IM WEARING IT NOW! Buy it trust me it's not a mistake<br /><br />One tiny downside<br />It leaves white spots sometimes<br />But it's still amazing
B000VV0APS|5|Never disappointed with this provider
B001MA0QY2|5|It is the best iron straightener my wife has ever used also the delivery was on time. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for good straightner....
B000L596FE|5|my daughter have big wavy hair that knotted up easily, but the wet brush works fabulous dry or wet. No more tears .
B002JDUMFO|5|I use this on my face and hands. It is one of the few things that make my hands smooth. I also use this on my face and it goes on very nice and is not greasy.
B001ECQ3X6|5|This is honestly the best mask I have ever used that isn't from an Asian beauty brand. I have incredibly oily and acne prone skin and this has never clogged my pores or made me even more oily. It's actually stopped breakouts from happening and reduces any redness I have had from pimples. It also has done a wonderful job at getting rid of the marks that remain after acne is gone. My face is smooth and bright after using this and I love this mask so much.
B00BUCNG08|1|Unfortunately, this stopped working during my first spray! I don't mind paying for a healthier/safer sunscreen, but not when it doesn't work and can't return!
B007FFJ7F2|5|Always use after washing and keeps skin clear!  luv it
B00GWZ3X8I|5|i expected to get this wig in a knotted up mess. Actually, though, it was quite the opposite! the wig is soft, wonderful, and way pretty! the shipping was basically 2 days-- so way fast!
B001O6VDBO|3|Order came in reasonable time  But the scent is not very good and doesn't last
B00IQJWU7S|2|Whatever the alcohol in here is, it left my face red and burning.  I got a great shave, make no mistake...  But I couldn't use the product more than a few times.  Each time my face got redder for longer.
B003JJ1D2S|4|This is a beautiful hair accessory for those special events in life..  A little too long for my intened use but I'll make it work..
B00279BKRY|5|Feels like silk. Smoothes any dryness before putting on my foundation
B007WR91KY|5|Works great for my stubborn skin
B00A6O1BF8|5|I chose this rating because there are many colored pieces for a great price but I will admit the package is slighly hard to get into..
B0009OAGZG|5|My husband LOVES it. I got it for him for Christmas. For this price, this is a great deal. Great, Classic smell.
B00CGSLHI8|5|great ,fast results
B00EICOHNM|5|I purchased 2 Lay-n-Go because these are very practical and cute.  They obviously were made with all the stuff a woman can carry in mind.  I would recommend this product and actually will certainly purchase some as gifts.
B0001MKV38|5|Without a doubt the best moisturizing lotion I have ever used.  Goes on smoothly, not greasy and feels amazing. No scent!!<br />Love the fact I could get a gallon bottle.
B005N30FQ8|5|I was so excited not just for the price but the quality and how gas I received the product! Absolutely amazing and I will be a repeat customer and suggest to others
B00518N0GC|5|These are my favorite eye liners ever.  They are easy to apply and last for hours.  I had to start ordering them online because every time I go into a drug store to get them they are all sold out.  I am so glad that I can get these on Amazon!
B000C1W6TK|5|I paid 33, and at the Duty Free it was 65.  Do not doubt in buying it.
B004AVIEOE|4|I am a big fan of this soap. Big, big fan. It lasts a very long time, Smells wonderful (even gives a lasting smell around the bathroom), and it suds and cleans better than many of those cheap store brands. The only reason I docked it a star is because it took a long time to get here and my wife isn't a fan of the smell at all. But since I can't stand the smell of the soaps she usually buys I really only docked it the star because of the long shipping time. I would have only docked it a half a star if I could though.
B0000AFUT3|5|Love this mirror!
B00BQB0W3M|5|Great product came with the main peice, two inside plates and the screws. Solid construction. How ever installing it was a bit tricky. You have to remove the bottom rail and the two sides. The bottom was the hardest. The two set scews are sealed  in so you need to heat it up with a blow dryer first and then unscew them with a star headed screw driver. How ever I tried this method and I striped the screws and had to use a screw extractor. Once I drilled the striped screws I used the extractors and they came right out. After the bottom you have to take the side rails off. Under the srews there are screw blocks on the inside that will fall out once you take off the rails, you will need to put these back on under the new side covers by removing the two front hand guard block pins (one on each side) with a star head screw driver. After there off the front hand guard block will slide foward giving you enough room to insert the screw blocks in and lining them up perfect to screw in the new inside plates. Once that is complete the rest is easy, install the bottom and the rest of the screws and your done. It only comes with one 2&#34; rail peice but for the price I would have like a few more with different sizes.
B003YC4FQ6|5|IT'S JUST LIKE THE ONE I BUY FROM WHOLE FOODS BUT CHEAPER AND IT CAME TO ME INSTEAD OF ME HAVING TO GO TO MULTIPLE STORES TO FIND IT!
B00J7Q1AV6|4|I really like the Clyppi nail clippers.  They are very sharp and work much better than the several pairs that I have bought at department stores.
B00F2JS61O|5|Doesn't dry out my skin as badly as normal acne treatments, I have combination skin and mild acne so I'm not sure if this will work wonders for someone with bad acne but i liked the results that I got with the product.
B00OELU6B4|4|Good price, good product.
B00SWEHZNG|5|I have been using this before my make up to hydrate my skin. It works well. The water is a bit thicker than I would like but it still feels great on the skin . I love the quality of the product and the smell!  the bottle is glass and a very good quality.<br /><br />I did receive this at a discount for my honest review
B005I2MP62|5|I definitely see a difference!  I don't have a lot of fine lines yet, I'm using this as preventative, but the few I do have are reduced after just a few weeks.  I love the way my skin feels and looks, and I notice my pores definitely look smaller.  Amazing results for the price!
B0065LSNPW|4|I like this on as well.  I used this on my hair and it made my hair soft and manageable.  there was still some moisture the next day morning when i removed the twists. I think the combination of this with the as i am leave in conditioner. this smells great too. its pricey i will catch the sale for this as well. I was a bit suprised due to all the negative comments about this product and that my hair does not like the shea moisture milks.  To each his own, i guess.
B0017KHVW2|2|I had a terrible time getting some stamps on my nails, I watched youtube.com for directions but nothing work . I am not returning it because I will loose more on shipping.
B004WTZWNU|5|I have used Norell for years. This bottle was a gift for someone who noticed the cologne that I was wearing. She received the Norell and is now very happy to be wearing it.
B005VDY926|5|I was afraid it was going to be cheap smelling but to my surprise it smells very good. I bought this for Valentines Day for my fiance, since he's a Knicks fan. So even if he doesn't wear it, it is a nice collectable. These will be future gifts for the men in the family.
B00BMLOKHU|5|Month two already have &#34;baby&#34; hair, it worked! Much faster than expected too! Much easier and less expensive than weaves, I'm actually re-growing my own hair!!!!
B001FY52CG|3|I ordered this dryer because I had one that had blown up. I liked it so much and didnt want to have to change the mount. It fit perfect and worked better than the old one. I am waiting but want to buy another one while they are still available.
B00152TVOI|5|I purchased this for my husband and I love the way he smells.  I will keep buying this for him.
B005G8CP54|5|I spent a decade looking for something that would clear up my skin. I tried EVERYTHING from over-the-counter products to Proactiv to tea tree oil to blah blah blah. An esthetician recommended Image Clear Cell to me in 2011 and I saw (and FELT) results quickly. It felt like a miracle. Even after four years of use (always in conjunction with their Daily Matte Moisturizer and sometimes with the Clear Cell Toner when I can remember to be a particularly responsible adult), I continue to be impressed with how this product has improved my skin. I oftentimes think that it's STILL improving - skin tone evening out, general complexion glowing, etc. I sometimes forget whether I'm wearing make up or not. &#34;...Did I sleep in make up last ni- Oh, wait, nope. That's just my AMAZING SKIN this morning. Wooooow~~~&#34; If you have skin issues, please consider giving Image Clear Cell a try.
B0042KWMHS|5|Awesome product.  Leaves my hair nice and soft.  Does not make my hair feel like its plastered to my head.  Stays soft and in place.
B001E96QN6|5|It's perfect for the Summer.  I do a lot of bicycling and I like my legs to have some color.  And the smell is delightful.
B007MHCSMM|5|Great travel bag.  Love the TSA approved attached bag.  So easy to find in your travel bag with the colored zipper.
B00IH1DJGG|5|Performs as expected.
B002HZVOLA|4|This product works great alone or try using it with along with a few sprays of the Illuminate Shine Mist.
B00MPXP8AW|5|Exactly  what  I needed.<br />Thank you so much
B000BBF4KO|4|It's good, but would have been better if it cuts a bit closer. It eventually cuts close enough after u stroke so very many times. If I knew where to go, I would have taken mine to see if they can set the blades to cut a bit closer.
B00IMTIZXA|4|It seemed to make my hair stronger but I used a treatment along with it. It definitely helps.I was hoping it would be much longer
B00QSIR3D0|5|Leaves my hair soft and shiny, love it!
B00CJ1YFZY|5|Too many years in high heels has really taken its toll on my poor feet. I've tried a few foot files, but they didn't work well on hard calluses. I am so pleased I bought this 2 In 1 foot rasp file & corn remover because it has worked wonders at clearing all the horrible hard bits and roughness from my toes and feet. They are smoother than they have been in years and I've finally been brave enough to wear a pair of sandals this summer.
B00AWX5046|5|Nice coverage for &#34;mature&#34; skin. I only wear foundation occasionally, but wanted something with a medium coverage; this product fit the bill.
B007AE0270|5|My girlfriend got the entire kit for Xmas for me and I have to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I normally get my nals done every 2 weeks and they only last 3 maybe 4 days but I like my nails to look nice I continued wasting money. Ladies this is the best gift I have received in a very long time. My nails look prefessional for a fraction of the cost. My friend has a different kit but she admits that she should have gotten the Red Carpet brand. This kit comes with EVERYTHING you need and if you order additional polishes off Amazon they are slightly cheaper than going into the store. I try buy a polish every 2 weeks and I have found some really pretty colors at a good price. Again I can't say enough about this kit. It is a little more pricey than the other kits but WELL worth the price. HAPPY NAILS...
B008CC4FPY|5|This detangler works great for us. My 10 year old daughter uses it on her naturally curly waist-length hair, we use it on our 2 year old's wispy curls that get matted up from bed or his carseat, and I use it on my own hair when I want to tame some bedhead frizz and smooth out my hair. I love the smell, it doesn't smell like a kid product to me, it's a fresh and clean type fragrance--not fruity or floral. It doesn't leave your hair feeling like any residue is on it, either. When I bought it, it was only a few dollars and had Prime shipping. I'm waiting, hoping for that deal to come back before I buy it again from Amazon.
B000S6QGIQ|5|Great product!
B000GBID0M|5|I love this toothbrush! My teeth (and gums) have never felt better. I was concerned that my gums would hurt when I first used it, but it's gentle enough to not hurt whilst still making your teeth feel AMAZING. I also bought the whitening attachments and I swear my teeth are whiter after using it once. There is nothing I would change about this product...
B0062IWQVU|5|Bought this for my Husband as part of his Anniversary Gift. It isn''t until May 29. So .. he knows it is here and I have tried to tempt him with it but he is happy waiting. I know how well the Fusion Razors are. I am excited I was able to get this for him and look forward to seeing him use it and hearing what he thinks about it, Then I will report back , I am a little concerned about hearing about a plastic piece breaking in other reviews and I really do hope it does not break on his. It is after all a gift. Shall report back. I had free shipping on my package as I had ordered other items too. Placed order on April 5 and received April 15. High Hopes and Great Expectations. Its a Fusion after all.
B002B60HF4|5|I have fine oily hair that is also color treated.  Usually shampoos that are for fine hair are not safe for color treated, and color shampoos are usually for hydrating for dry/damaged or coarse hair.  THIS SHAMPOO IS AMAZING!  Leaves my hair soft, and full of volume.  Very lightweight and gentle.  No wax residue so the natural oils from my scalp can slide all the way down the hair shaft.  I can't find it in stores anymore, so It's totally worth tracking it down on the internet and having it shipped.  Love it!
B00461F4PA|5|Works great!!!
B007L1IZRG|2|They claim that it resolves the DHT issue in this formula, yet it is made for women and men. Women do not have the same DHT issue as men. I fail to see which ingredient addresses the DHT issue: Dexpathenol, Eucalyptus oil, SD40 alcohol, Oleoresin Capsicum, Menthol, Vitamin E, Nicotinate. They also claim that this formula resolves the issue of dryness of the scalp, yet it contains SD40 alcohols (isopropyl) which are a petroleum derivative which causes dryness of the skin and not a natural occurring ingredient as their label suggests. I gave it 2 stars because it didn't cause my hair to fall more than before, nor grow either. I wouldn't use it again, now that I know more.
B007BV13ES|4|Does a good job on cuticles and skin on the hands. Smells nice and absorbs easily (not &#34;oily&#34;). I bought this based on someone else's review; I'm glad I tried it. Haven't had an opportunity to compare to the Solar Oil, but I will say I like this enough to keep it on my desk and just swab some on from time to time.
B0057NE6OG|1|Didn't work for me.  Feels super tacky and the smell is a little annoying.
B00P1QC0Z6|5|I have ordered these powder puffs before and am very pleased with them. I replace my body powder puffs with them and use them when the powder box does not include the puffs. I will certainly order them again.
B00354XMH6|5|Great idea and it makes you feel like a giant !
B004YGLSD4|3|Dim light
B00AO379NE|3|Goes on smooth and clear without an overpowering scent. Not a big fan of all of the chemicals in it but most deodorants contain aluminum and other metals anymore. I think $7 is too much for this product. I'd pay $4 to $5 at the most.
B000P22TIY|5|Bought this cause a relative gave me one as a present and loved it, so I bought another when it finished, will be buying again.
B007HC8VGO|5|Love the fragrance of this nice cream
B00B76ALVO|5|Excellent product! I'm stylist and iron works great with all hair style. Its true ceramic. Totally recommended.
B000JWO7JO|5|I think that this product is fantastic. I love how this product makes my hair look and feel. This product is really great for growing hair and making it stronger. It really does stop hair from falling out and breaking off. Thank you so much for making such a great product!
B000052ZBD|5|I love Neutrogena products so I tried this shower gel based on the reviews and it certainly lives up to its reputation. Its very smooth and non-irritating and smells really nice. A little goes a long way ..
B004IUN7JO|4|I used this indigo as a 2-step process following my henna application.  After applying the indigo per package instructions and letting it set, I rinsed my hair with water only.  The resulting color was a deep black and offered good gray coverage.  The color continued to deepen the next day.  However, after my first shampoo following this treatment, the color was no longer jet black, but a brownish-red as the undertones from the henna began to blend in.  Though the gray was still covered, I was hoping that the indigo would not fade after shampooing as quickly as it did.
B005EII2R6|5|The colour and colour payoff on this is lovely, and it works quite spectacularly as a shimmery lid shade. It's very pretty and long-lasting.
B0016AAIIC|5|This is a wonderful product for the professional Esthetician.  SkinCeuticals is the best of the best.
B008HDEX3M|3|The wig wasn't the color that I was looking for. It sheds a lot, and the bangs are a bit crooked, but the wig is soft.
B00CQKWTP6|5|I use this to make deodorant.  Usually the alcohol I use for the deodorant overpowers the lavender a great deal and need to use a lot of oil.  This oil has a strong lavender smell and I was able to use half the oil I usually use.  It’s great.
B00HF3XU8E|1|A cheap disposable razor works just as well
B000OL8P2U|5|I prefer tooth powder to toothpaste. This really cleans my teeth well and is a healthy alternative to toothpaste with added chemicals, fluoride, and artificial sweeteners. I will buy this again.
B0020MM7RK|4|The purchase was worth the cost. Our family is on a tight budget. This purchase created a way for me not to over spend on something my husband really needed. He like the selections that were available.
B004AME6K4|4|This Mizani D'Tangle does exactly what it promises.  I wasn't so sure the first time I used it, but after my third try, I'm sold.
B000IZPSRW|3|Lack of research on my revealed to me that this was not the \\"CHI\\" that everyone was talking about.  That company does offer a pink version that is sold for Breast Cancer Awareness, this is not it.  It does heat up quick, but with some coersion.  I have to test the pulg two or three times before it comes on and sometimes the \\"ON\\" indicator doesn't even come on then.  When its all said and done, it flattens my hair, but I'm late to work by then.
B0000798CT|5|These are so comfortable! I am on my feet at work 8-10 hours a day. My feet used to be killing me at the end of the day. Now they aren't swollen at all at the end of a work day. Best purchase in a long time.
B001AZJVH2|5|I have had minor acne since puberty (now 28) and absolutely nothing has ever given me confidence like this item. I don't HOPE that I don't break out anymore, with this, I KNOW I won't break out. I decided to give this a shot when I saw it due to it's claim to fade old acne spots. I was using an expensive Clinique product before but it was really expensive and I didn't see a lot of results. This product goes on clear and non sticky..I actually think it feels good! If you have a breakout, spot treat and it will be nearly, if not completely, gone overnight. With continued use I hardly break out EVER. I break out in the same areas all the time, so I use a pea sized amount every night in those areas and it's completely preventative. It's so affordable and a little lasts a long time. I really hope this product never stops being made, I honestly don't know what I would do without it! Give it a shot, I think you will love it!
B000VG7GDW|5|Healed fever blisters more quickly than prescription drugs.  Fantastic product.  I would recommend it for anyone who suffers from fever blisters.
B00APR67DM|5|This is the only deodorant I've used that actually works.  Not only does it stop perspiration but it eliminates odor for hours.
B0010JLCVG|5|I just received this blush brush. Its really soft on the skin so its perfect for powder which is what I'll be using it for. Very excited that they threw in a free Kabuki brush as well!!
B003CP12O8|1|Killed my sense of taste, like the tip of my tongue was burned.  And stained my teeth too.  I can't believe this stuff is still on the market !!  Back to Listerine.
B00E6PCD96|3|They were worth an experiment. They may work best on vertical surfaces, as shown on their packaging, but mounted on the horizontal surface under my desk they failed. The sticky pads aren't sticky enough. Wasn't even using the full number of cords they're supposed to support. Even without the sticky pad failing sometimes it was hard to keep the plastic latches closed.<br /><br />They probably work much better when used as shown, so I'm still giving 3 stars, plus the price is right.
B000Z65I74|5|Great to touch up during the day.  Definitely does the job of getting rid of the shine without adding any actual color.  And fragrance free!  Love it!
B001BHOQRO|1|I bought and used Nail Tek Formul II for about a month and a half. The product thickened up so that I couldn't really use it because it took so long to dry. BUT it DID work and my nails WERE getting stronger! I was going to order a new bottle and saw the EXTRA by Nail Tek which made it sound like THIS product would REALLY repair previously unreparable nail issues!<br /><br />I bought some and used it for about 2 weeks. BIG MISTAKE!!! It actually MADE my nails peel SO MUCH WORSE than EVER before!  I bought some of the Nail Tek product that thins out the polish that thickened up and I took off all the EXTRA and replaced it with the origianal NAIL TEK FORMULA !! . AHHHHH...SO much better. I will NOT be using EXTRA again and will order another bottle of Formula II
B000OO2PC8|5|LOVE THE DIFFUSER AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THE AROMA LASTS!!  YOU JUST USE A FEW DROPS OF YOUR FAVORITE FRAGANCE AND THE SMELL LASTS FOR HOURS!!!
B000225ZUQ|5|Therapy is VERY calming and relaxing. The mix of lavender and Citrus is perfect (I was afraid it'd energize me more and keep me awake all the time) together and smells fantastic. Its very moisturizing and makes a great moisturizer and lip balm (I know, i'm strange, but it doesn't taste bad and it makes my lips soooo soft)
B0001TJIYO|4|Seems to help me avoid cold sores when I take it regularly!  I take a maintenance dose of 1 pill a day, and then I'll take 3-6 per day if I feel the dreaded tingling that presages a cold sore.  Usually it works and I don't get a cold sore.
B000277P5E|2|I recently purchased 8 mach3 turbo catridges out of which 2 were defective. The catridges would fall off the handle as their 'indents inside the catridge to hold the handle' were either broken or not of proper size. The other 6 catridges were fine. I have purchased Gillette products before from on line places and never had defective ones till now.
B000OS131S|5|Weleda  is an excellent massage oil.<br /> It has worked well on my lower back which gives problems.,<br />It get deep into the muscles & allows the back to feel pain free.<br /> I use it before excercising & before  bedtiem.<br /> Would recommend this oil.<br />Not sure how it will travel on a plane. Not sur eif it will spill or not so i recommend a double baggy.
B007NHCQQE|5|Ivory soap is pretty hard to get wrong! It works well and smells nice and floats so my kid can find it in the bath.
B000H9ZKK4|5|This tea is one of my favorite discoveries. I'm not a fan of strong tea. This, steeped for 4 minutes exactly, in water which has reached a full boil, is heaven. One caveat: You absolutely cannot ice it, don't even let it get cold. The tea bruises, and becomes most unpleasant. Serve hot with a spot of milk, and a pinch of sugar, it's heaven. This and Lady Grey are my teas.
B000G0GW6K|5|My first Panasonic shaver lasted 10 years.  I was so please with it that I just had to replace it with another Panasonic.  It is so easy to use because it is cordless, it gives good shaves, and it is easy to clean.  I would recommend it to a friend.
B007RBE7C2|5|This clan scarf came faster then I expected especially since it is from the UK. It is a very soft wool and large enough to do a good job of keeping your neck warm on those cold winter days. The colors were a bit darker than depicted here but true to the clan plaid. I like it so much I bought one for my cousin. It is one of the least expensive ways to honor your family roots in the Scottish Tartan arena. Wear it and be proud!
B002TECJN6|1|Loss its spray after using twice.
B004D8T7F4|4|This shampoo and conditioner smells great and it lasts all day. It made my frizzy, dry hair feel very sumptuous and healthy again. The frizz is a hard thing to get rid of so like all shampoos when this one builds up a little (like after 3-4 weeks) then I usually do a stripper like Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo but otherwise it is really good and would recommend it to anyone who wants some moisture or deep conditioning. The fact that it comes with 5 oil packs is also super!
B00DQ90PPC|5|I bought this for the fragrance and love it!  Next time I might switch and get the body lotion.  Pricey, but a nice treat and it makes me feel good!
B000782SQY|5|These are my favorite tweezers and have been using tweezerman for 15-20 years.<br />Don't drop them! The tips bend very easily ---- but if you do, for $5.00 the company will resharpen them for you, making them as good as new.<br /><br />The only downside with purchasing on Amazon is that you have no clue what color tweezers you're receiving.  I'd like to know and have the ability to choose a color.  Ultimately it doesn't matter, but I'd appreciate the consideration.
B00005REAQ|5|Used this for over a year and haven't had any breakouts. It has enough moisturizer so my skin is not dry and the SPF is built in!!! So, I don't have to put multiple things on my skin to protect and hydrate. Bonus! Its natural!
B0014P8L9W|4|Very deep cleaning and loving the way my skin has been feeling lately and also how closed my pores seem to have gotten.
B000GF1E54|5|I will be 60 years old in a couple of months. I've used products (serums) that cost over $150.00 for only 0.5 ounce for 3 months, and didn't get the results that I received from DermaE after 1 week. I've used this product for about a month now and I sometimes forget the night time application (morning and evening applications are recommended), but still achieved great results. Other products failed to reduce the tiny lines above my cheek bones, but this product completely eliminated them. I was amazed. Let's face it ladies and gents, NOTHING is going to remove the skin damage that some people have due to over exposing their skin to the sun, diet, smoking, and other damaging habits people subjected their skin to over long periods of time.  An alternative to using creams is plastic surgery and/or Botox. Plastic surgery is an option but results are not always what you want, and Botox can and has been disastrous to many that have used it. Not to ignore the fact that you have to continue to invest in Botox treatments forever. That being said, I will continue to use this very nicely priced product with enthusiasm.
B00K45B9D8|5|Very good
B00PJ5W8XS|3|Not as potent as what I got from Edens garden.  Works... but works slower.  It's cheaper but that's not the point. I bought it for efficacy more than price.
B000C1Z5FC|5|excellent
B0012BNVE8|5|Great !!!
B00EELSW9M|4|This product does exactly what it's called.  It &#34;Blurs&#34; the look of wrinkles, especially those around your mouth.  It isn't called Reduced or Eliminate.  You use it last.  After everything you put on your face to make it up.  Carry it with you because you wipe it off with your napkin when you eat.  If you don't use moisturizer, foundation, etc.  just pat a tiny bit of Blur wherever you want to soften those wrinkles.<br /><br />It is entirely moisture-free so you have to squeeze hard to get it out of the tube.  Just a half inch is all you need at a time.  Pat it on with your ring finger, which is your least strong finger.  You don't rub it in.
B00005LBRS|1|I ordered this through this seller on Amazon and never received the item.  Amazon gave me credit.<br /><br />So, I went out to the store & purchased it from Whole Foods instead. After using it once, my entire face was bright red, swollen & burning.  I know this has salicylic acid in it, but I do a 30% salicylic peels about 3 times a month without any reaction.  I leave my peels on for 7 minutes and my face is barely red.  I applied this toner for a few seconds and got that bad of a reaction.  I don't know if it's the combination of ingredients, but be careful with this toner if you buy it.
B001CHCF7G|5|I have used this blades for sometime now and I have found it to be far superior to any other on the market. I recommend this product to anyone who is a professional or an aspiring at home barber. The lines done with this product is BAR NONE. It also provides the ability to give a very close shave.
B000A3I2X4|5|I used this hairdryer in a hotel in Los Angeles.  Loved it so much I took down the model number and immediately went to track one down for myself.  Of course, found it on Amazon...........what don't they have?  Great price, but best of all this hairdryer weighs next to nothing.  It only has one slider to control it, low, med, high heat, with low heat producing lower air flow, high heat producing highest air flow power, etc.  Most hair dryers have separate air force and heat buttons.  I actually like this better because I mostly use high heat, full blast, but to each his own.  It does not come with those big diffuser attachments, but does have a great directional attachment to better concentrate the airflow in one spot.  Average cold shot button.  If you are looking for an inexpensive, no frills, light weight hair dryer, this is a great little one.
B003FXVKJE|5|Smells lovely and helps keep my hair healthy
B00JU85TO0|5|eyeliner color is beautiful ... I leave the link of a video which show how to use this eyeliner<br /><br />LINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGIHM1b2J7w
B00MGV01YQ|5|This is awesome if you struggle with dry hair. This is the second product I have tried and all have been great for my hair. I am mixed so while my hair is curly, it can also get quite course. I would recommend this product to others with similar hair who are looking to tame, define, and moisturize.
B00KCKV714|5|They just too long to get here and the cases were smashed
B001CT0954|5|I love it, it's a great price for a bottle this size. I've made purchases in the past for smaller bottles. My all time favorite perfume and it's affordable!
B004WDV2XA|5|Item exactly as described. Very easy to use, even for beginners. I suggest using a pin or two to hold it up if you have heavy hair.
B0065R18TY|5|It smells really nice and doesn't leave an oily residue on my hair.
B004CESX40|3|Why did Mitchum get rid of their excellent solid unscented deodorant and replace it with several less desirable products?  I used the old solid unscented for years.  It didn't  smell weird and it worked really well.  The new gels stink when you exercise -- hot deodorant is not really a better smell than hot sweat.  This solid is okay but not nearly as good as its predecessor.  I am looking for another brand to switch to after having used Mictchum for the last 40 years.
B005EFNXBY|5|Fits in your hand well, has a hook to hand if you wanted to, bristles don't' hurt scalp, and they seem like they will last. Nice weight and size to work on my fine, yet full head of hair! Much better than what I was finding at Target or Ulta!
B00006498N|5|Still using it
B00IOG05HK|5|this product delivers!  It is organic, easy to use, and was so reasonable for the money.  I foolishly purchased this product elsewhere before finding it here and paid so much more.
B0010H77GC|5|Love my nail covers they work great!
B005X8H7ZK|5|Shipped quick and works well. I work in a sandy environment and use this at the end of the day to help remove all the dirt and oils that tend to appear after wearing sunscreen
B000IMJS0S|5|I have been plagued with itchy, rashy skin for about 4 years now. It started all of a sudden, drs said I just became allergic to things. Well I went to perfume, dye free everything (almost). But still would claw myself to death after showers. I don't know if it was the soap I was using (dove) or if it was the water. Well I got this soap for me and my daughter (she has eczema) and I have fell in love with it! Not only has my itchy rashy skin stopped after the first use, but it makes my skin very soft. It doesn't leave a waxy feeling like most soaps do, and makes my legs feel amazing when I use it to shave. I had tried every lotion, soap, and cream out there. The rashes and itching would get so bad I would have to get a steroid shot. This soap has saved my sanity!
B007Z4HJQM|5|I purchased this for a friend who dearly loves the Yankees.  He loved it.  The scent is very nice.  I think I'll buy some myself!
B005YS78JE|1|sugar pills is all they are. wish I didn't order them
B00B86K6BI|2|Web site is quite a bit confusing about Fracas and Petit Fracas and more importantly the volumes<br />$ 118 for a 3.4 Fl. OZ  and not a 8 Fl. OZ from a minor brand located in New York and made in South of Paris<br />seems overpriced.<br />Let your spouse away!!!
B000BJ1CGQ|5|this is a great starter kit for a professional or home use, just be sure you know how to properly wax if you aren't a professional you can really hurt yourself.  For the price, you can't beat this.  I thought this was too good to be true, as the price under 40 bucks seemed unreal for what you get.  This same kit is sold from other retailers  for much much more.  GET THIS.  YOU WILL NEED more wax strips before you know it and you will need to buy wax remover also.
B004AJ1MN6|2|Dont really like it. The liquid is too light and the tip becomes dry out of nowhere. One day its good and the other it gives no color.
B0000DK5LW|4|This does not really work well on leg hair because it's a tweeze action and is slow.<br /><br />However, it is amazing for these hard-to-reach hairs you can't find and tweeze otherwise, with less strain-- just use it as though it was an electric shaver.
B0014NRPUK|1|I was skeptical about purchasing this product and should have followed my first thoughts. I followed the instruction about applying the oil to my skin tags three times a day for almost ten days. I'm told within that time frame the tags will begin to appear to dry up. No signs of that happening. When I called Healing Natural Oils, you don't get an operator but instead you're asked to leave a message. I felt this was a company operating in a home because a rep called me and their number was showing \\"private\\".    I asked for a refund and I got the speech about waiting six weeks to allow the product to work. After insisting for a refund, I was told to mail the product back with a note explaining why I was disatisifed.     I suggest when mailing the item back to Healing Natural Oils to insure the package in case its lost. I hope this company won't give me any problems refunding my money and do so in a timely manner.
B003Z3PITM|5|This cream is excellent!
B000RL81AI|5|As a diabetic I need more vitamin b in my diet so this fills the bill
B000142J18|4|I used this product for the first time tonite, May 27, 2004, and love the results!  My hair is originally blonde, but over the years (and 2 pregnancies later!) my hair has gone to dark blonde-almost a light brown.  I recently got my hair cut short, and there those dark roots were!!  I had to do something about it, especially with summer right around the corner!  Of course, all of the salons in my area were booked for a week - so I decided to take matters into my own hands, literally!!<br /><br />It took some time to pull the hair thru the cap- but I knew it was worth the time, because it would be an even distribution of color that way.  This was the worst part of the whole process.  Nothing was hard.<br /><br />Once the hair is pulled thru the cap, you mix 3 ingredients in order in the container provided.  Everything is provided except for the towels, a hair pin, and the old shirt (just in case you spill).  Once mixed, you put the gloves on & get purple! ~At least that was the color of the mixture I used.  My oldest daughter (age 6) was worried I was coloring my hair purple!! (Well, that IS her favorite color, but I'm just not that good of a mom I guess!)<br /><br />You spread the mixture over the hair on the outside of the cap and then put a plastic bag (provided) over that & keep in place with the hair pin.  20-25 minutes later -you are highlighted!!<br /><br />Yep, it's that easy!  The color turned out perfect for me! And it's even all over.<br /><br />I'm no expert-and this is the first time I've done this myself...I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to do their own highlights.  The lack of a 5 star rating is due to the time needed to pull the hair thru the cap, approx. 20-30 minutes.<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B003639V1W|5|Was sceptical initially but went ahead and bought I have no regrets whatsoever as it is as good as one purchased from Mac store. Smells very nice like any mac lipstick and I'm happy. Shipping was quick 😀
B000YHQLRK|5|My wife called one day and said what smell do you like? I said cotton candy she said no for a perfume. I said bet I can find one, I did and it smells wonderful!! So much better then 95% of the crap they sell at department stores. That's a guys opinion, girls you want to catch your guy off guard get it spray it see if he notices.
B001ET7G9E|5|This toothpaste really works.
B00J91NDTQ|5|I totally love them
B005KRJ81A|4|Seems really nice, goes on smoothly, but the smell is not good.
B005BUNTTS|5|Love this stuff and use it daily now.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Smooth<br />Not Too Strong<br />Tingling Sensation (Tells you something is working? :P)<br /><br />Cons:<br />None!
B0016C1QLS|5|This is great for my son, who has some sensory issues. It also came with a sample of lemon, which I then went on to purchase.
B00IMHN0B4|4|I have never heard of using rose water as a toner until I purchased several products from InstaNatural.  I have very sensitive skin due to over exfoliation and was pleasantly surprised that this product calms my skin down and does NOT cause any redness.  I love the smell of real roses (not the old lady smell).  I use it mainly on my face and neck after cleansing morning and night.  I also want to use a few drops on my hair but I need to transfer some over to a bottle with a dropper so I don't waste so much of this precious water. The reason I did not give it a five star is I wish it would come with a dropper.  Other than that, it is perfect. The amber glass is good quality and so is the product.  I would purchase it again.<br /><br />Customer service is excellent. The seller sent me directions on how to use their products several days prior to products arriving.
B00005JTW8|5|This moisturizer is great. I have been looking for a good one with SPF for awhile. I find a lot of moisturizers to be too thick or too greasy. This one is lightweight and doesn't roll or make your makeup cake up. I have been using it for a few weeks now and my skin already feels tighter and soooo soft. Love this ! Well worth it . Believe me I am super picky w products and I have tried many high and low end and am very satisfied with this purchase :).
B001TAIFZM|5|This is a fantastic product! I saw results in 7 days. The most amazing thing is the vertical lines around my mouth are almost completely gone in 8 weeks. Makeup goes on smoothly after dry down of just a couple of minutes. A must have for us Baby boomers!
B001AJ6QNA|5|I recently made the decision to shave my head (not much left up there anyway) and I wanted a nice, simple corded shaver to keep it shaved. This one looked like the one so I bought it. It does feel a little bit lightweight, not as heavy duty as I expected out of the Norelco name, but it worked right out of the box and the pop up trimmer does an excellent job of trimming my goatee and mustache. I feel confident I made the right choice with this purchase.
B001OCE33I|5|This was the first time I have used liquid keratin and it will not be the last. This conditioner smells so so good! It also made my hair so shiny, I have gotten tons of compliments. My hair is more shiny, smooth, soft, and smells so good after using this product.
B00D3G6JAS|5|I love this product! it defenetly makes my theeth whiter in a matter of minutes, it doesnt bother me while its on or causes any sensitivity on my theeth.
B00KEAKQ6O|5|It works nicely, leaves hair very soft and my skin doesn't smell like chlorine anymore!
B001KYVYFK|1|Does not work as claimed. I purchased this hoping it would help soften calluses on my toes. It was just too rough.
B0053Y3EIS|4|I bought this item a couple years ago, and I had high hopes for it. I read a lot of reviews saying that it was a great alternative for a Clarisonic face brush. At the time, my wallet was not ready to commit to the price of a Clarisonic brush, so I went ahead and picked up the Sigma Cleansing and Polishing tool.<br /><br />My first experience with brushes of this type was with the Sun Body Polishing Tool ([[ASIN:B002P4NQC8 Sun 75843225023 Body Polisher]] Much like the Sigma cleansing brush, it was a device that rotates attachable brush heads. I was a fan of the Sun brush when I first used it. In addition to the face brush, it also had a few other attachments: pumice stone, large body brush, & moisturizer brush. All in all, it was a good buy. The Sigma Cleansing and Polishing Tool is similar in that it's a spinning facial brush. It exfoliates, leaves skin smooth, and comes with a nice storage case.<br /><br />Now, to say that either one is a Clarisonic dupe is just stretching it. Not too long after I purchased my Sigma Cleansing tool, I went ahead and threw some money into a Clarisonic Mia. They're definitely not the same. The Mia uses more of a high speed vibration, and the spin of the brush is quite different. There is virtually no \\"tug\\" at the skin, whereas the Sigma does kind of pull when pressure is applied. Also, there's the hassle of battery replacement (Sigma) whereas the Mia is rechargeable.<br /><br />This is kind of the same comparison that you'd face with a high end Sonicare toothbrush vs. a Crest spinbrush. Crest gets the job done well, but a Sonicare takes it to another level... for a price. I would definitely say to give the Sigma Cleansing Tool a try, though. Your skin will feel clean and smooth after the first use.
B000094ZDX|5|Great product, great price, fast shipping
B002F07RA4|4|The packaging!! When I seen this on my door step I was excited to get it inside and see if it was as good as I hoped. The product itself seems of superior value but the packaging not so much. The plastic jar is cheap and the seller knows this. They put athletic tape around the bottom of the lid to keep critters out and to keep it from spilling during the shifting process that occurs during shipping. To me it make more sense to find a new container that is AIR TIGHT and is able to be used by the buyer. I now need to transfer this to another container so I can be sure it's air tight to keep it's freshness! This stuff has a 2-5 year shelf life if stored correctly!!
B00770YRAK|4|This product really works, previously i dyed my hair light brown and i just want a few highlights without going to a hair salon. So i got this product and simple as spray on your hair and go outside under the sun it did the work. It didnt damage or dry my hair, and the price was really good. My only complain is when i opened the package i found a leak on the bottle,both of them were only the half. They should package in a better way.... Overall im a fan of this spray
B005C1C02S|5|I do my own nails because nail salons in my area are few and far between, crowded, and expensive.  These look great.  I recommend using special tweezers to apply them.
B005UHS6C2|4|This little spray bottle is wonderful.  I use it to apply oil to my scalp and body. What I really like about it is that the mechanism used to pull the oil from the body is sized perfectly so as not to cause the sprayer to get clogged up or malfunction.
B006MMOVOQ|5|Just receieved yesterday.  Put on before bedtime and I could not believe how soft it made my face feel.  Will write more later after using for a period of time, but for the first time use.......impressed!
B00AJFAKAG|5|plastic feels so smooth! I like knowing I'm using a natural toothbrush
B0033AYPXC|5|I love my Z palette and the best part of it was that I got it in the mail  quicker than I thought It would.
B00BDTDSPQ|5|I have been using Mac make-up for as long as I can remember. I saw this brand on YouTube and decided to experiment with it; I was blown away I ended up buying another. This is freakin awesome it goes on smoothly and the finish is flawless. The texture is fine and silky it goes on well with Mac liquid foundation,. Further it is perfect for highlighting even better all over. Do not hesitate to purchase one it is a must have for all makeup artist from beginners to season ones.<br /><br />I love this product I am definitely a fan of Ben Nye.
B002T7105G|1|I purchased this to replace another reverse lip liner that I really found effective.  This one to me was no better than a colored lip liner.  I will not purchase again.
B000P22TIY|4|I have always enjoyed having elegant and manly perfume, but I usually dislike the big punch associated with most of them. This has definitely been satisfying and smooth, and I instantly got a compliment at how I smelled the first time I used this perfume when hanging out with a friend (girl).
B002CLBV0I|5|I have been wetshaving for two years.  There are things yet to learn.  I have tried a number of soaps and creams.  This is, by far, the best one.  I like Proraso and I think Jack Black is good, but this is above both of them.<br /><br />Get it.
B00012NJNC|3|I'm pretty sure this product is helping prevent more breakouts from occuring and keeping small pimples in check if caught early-on, but I don't think it does anything to existing acne. It has a pretty strong smell, but that does go away once dry. There is a stinging sensation when used directly on acne flare-ups.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend it, but only as a prevention product, to be used after cleansing. I would not expect it to cure acne.... at least it didn't for me.
B00AUDXILU|5|thank you
B00GPVQ82M|5|smells awsome
B007N1D9OS|3|It's seem to work I guess!
B0058QFGKA|3|The feathers are really small when you get them and if you have thick hair they are hard to see. The colors are vibrant like in the photo. These feathers fell apart really easily and now there isn't much left to them...I only had them in for two weeks. If I had the choice I wouldn't buy these again.
B00EA6DBU6|5|Fantastic product - Works as advertised.  Will buy again.
B002DPUY5Q|5|Nice scent. Feels silky absorbs quickly and your under eye look so hydrated
B000NVARRM|5|This is my mother's favorite fragrance.<br />Thank you for carrying it.
B000P1S0N8|4|Helps reduce redness with the green tint and serves as a good base for makeup. It can make your skin oily, but after a number of weeks, my skin was able to adjust or use oil absorbing paper/sheets.
B000VV0APS|5|good.
B00IG9KOX0|5|At first I was like...ew why is it so thick but it soaks in your skin leaving it super hydrated. I'm literally watching my skin get darker by the minute and I tanned 30 mins ago. Not a lot of lotions &#34;wow&#34; me but this one...wow. Two thumbs up.
B001BQXUEU|5|I trusted the prior reviews of this product and bought this cologne, without smelling it,  as a gift for my brother. I am sooo happy i bought it. My brother was amazed at how great it smelled and he got complements all day when he wore it. I now plan on buying it for my boyfriend so i can smell it more often.
B00MEX1XSO|5|Rosehip oil is one of the best skin products available and Slice of Nature provides exactly what I'm looking for in my rosehip oil: Beautiful orangish color with warm almost earthy tones that my skin loves.<br />I'm a regular buyer and I highly recommend their oils.
B00C4YQRS4|1|this wallet held my phone but its not made stable enough to carry anything else this is not a good item to order I wish I could get y money back the strap broken in 2-days and the credit card section is not good at all.
B00AD54RFQ|4|its nice for everyday wea, pretty color.
B008YD68NI|5|Not a lot to criticize here. We've been Oral-B users for a long time. These brush heads clean well and work as well as our previous. It's not clear to us that the extra little cleaning features make a huge difference to us vs. the legacy plain-Jane brush heads we've had, but they do work at least as well.<br /><br />We like these and would buy them opportunistically based on price.
B00GT00O6A|5|excellent purchase…glides through wet hair and is excellent styling and brushing dry hair as well.
B00CIYD7WY|5|I love this cream
B00WSEIE5E|5|Exactly what I wanted. I couldn't find it in the stores.
B003CJI71U|5|best toothpaste ever!  be warned, it is very strong.  It's like brushing your mouth with Listerine but without the chemicals!  It doesn't foam up like regular commercial toothpastes so the consistency is a little different but it grows on you after a little while; I cannot see myself using anything else!  In case you're wondering about the cinnamon one, it tastes like cinnamon gum and it's just as strong!
B00C7W7I86|4|Looks red at first but it does eventually come out bright pink! I've heard it will fade and I've only had my tattoo a month and so far so good.
B004UBKNK2|5|This improved my mood, my quality of life, and my relationships. You truly can't life with out this.
B000QYN81I|5|I don't know how it works, but it does. Perfect for those awkward situations that's occur when sharing a bathroom.
B00GNH61VQ|5|These lashes are so much easier to apply than the strips. I will definitely be rebuying them!
B008PJUVUC|5|WOW!  I can't say enough about this product.  I recently found that<br />gel heel socks are very beneficial in treating rough heels.  I've tried<br />around five different brands and overall this product is the best.<br />It works with and without creams and is very comfortable (e.g., wearing<br />all night in bed works fine).  The best reason to buy this particular<br />brand is because they stay clean over extended wear and wash well (on<br />gentle cycle of washing machine).  The other socks I bought showed soil<br />and did not come clean even with stain remover.  The leopard material<br />on this sock not only does not show the soiled spots but it also cleans<br />up like new.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these (I just ordered two more pairs for myself).
B000AQF50Y|5|Light smell, everyone will like it especially those who hate strong perfumes.
B00EDJK5PO|5|Beautiful curved scissors in nice case.  These appear to be very well made.  I use them to trim my Shih Tzu's legs.  They are sharp and of excellent quality at a reasonable price.
B002UD5IY8|5|No other Shampoo makes your hair look thicker. I think what this does is give your hair volume. Once you stop using it, its back to being almost bald.
B000TCXEZC|4|Works really well and goes on smoothly.
B00NB47AB4|5|I got the pink one as it was cheaper then the other colors available from Amazon. This one replaces the one I had for 8 years. I have chin length hair so the 1 inch works well for me. I also got the one inch as it would be lighter to hold then then wider ones. I like the longer cord as my outlet is a distance away from my mirror. Also a longer cord is safer then using an extension cord. If the cord length is too long just wind some of it up and use a wire tie. I have thicker hair that gets lots of frizzes and has a natural wave. This flat iron gets very hot so it flattens out my hair nicely. No the plates are not flat against each other however they should not be. My hair stylist got hers at her shop through a sales rep and none of the plates are flat against each other  Use a little pressure when going through the hair. This allows the hair to flow through the plates nicely as everyone's hair thickness is different. It does have a 4 year warranty.
B00JQ1PFUO|5|Its beautiful!
B001D2ASVU|5|My son never got a rash because I always use Bepanthen on every diaper change. I already knew about it because it is commonly used in Brazil. It is the best for babies.
B001SQMOKE|4|This is a great quality product.  I love the rimless tops that don't interfere with transitioning between close and far lines of sight.  The problem is that I have long hair, so if I put the neck piece under my hair, the weight actually lifts the glasses off of the bridge of my nose.  :  \  So, I have to take them off and on like glasses without a neck piece and put up with the ear/neck piece wrapped around the top of my hair when I have them on.  Not to be worn out of the house.
B0013L3XMM|5|I have used this night creme for over a year. I highly recommend it.
B00Q1BNG6C|5|I ordered the Mousand Pedi File through Amazon.  As usual I priced different kinds of items of this sort and found this one was comparable to others<br />that I had looked at. I decided to order this one.  I am not sorry I did.  I like it and it does what it says.  My feet get so bad that I get holes in my socks with just a few wears.  I've used this foot file several times and haven't had to change the roller yet.  I also ordered some really good socks because my feet are much smoother now.  If I get a rough spot on my foot I just use my Mousand Pedi and it takes care of it.  I'm happy with my purchase.
B0065DLADM|4|This item has two uses. Eye lid primer and eyeliner sealer. I am 35 and starting to see aging around my eyes. Eyelid primer twist like lipstick. Pulls my eyelids when putting on. Also the eyelid primer is flesh tone, I prefer a yellow tint primer. The yellow undertone goes well with my light skin tone. Eye liner is awesome. The sealer side turns my favorite eye shadow into liquid liner. Eye liner is still on after 13 hours!!
B0062K33CE|5|I smell like a manly man
B0010LG7NW|4|I received the Asthma Mentor Peak Flow Meter, my Dr recommended it for me to register the amount of air I am able to exhale. It works for what the Dr. wanted. Able to keep track to help with control of my asthma. Easy to use & easy to read.
B008CEDY5O|3|Did not remove the fine lines on the face.
B00AVUDVY6|5|Love it!!  Use it daily, and sometimes mix it with foundation to give a dewy look.
B00HUVOYM2|5|I love these!!!
B002NI1ZQU|5|THE PRODUCT MET MY NEEDS AND IS QUALITY MEETS ALL COMPARISON OR SIMILAR ITEMS.  EASY TO CARRY AND CAN ANYWHERE.
B00H7M32FO|5|I love, love, love my new Konjac sponge. It gently exfoliates without irritating my skin or using harsh chemicals. I only wish someone told me about this product sooner! I have purchased 5 of them and plan to use them forever!
B00D8G4FJU|2|Blades have not been uniformly sharp, and is not as good as Sensor Excel from Germany.  Will not buy again.
B000G0GW6K|2|On the first day that I used this thing, I couldn't get the pop up trimmer to stay in place - it finally broke.  No worries I thought, I don't need it.  A few months later....oops....it fell in the shower but did continue to work.  Went to use it again recently and now it is DEAD!  I won't buy this one again.  I didn't like it since day one.  The one positive thing about it though, is that it did stay charged for a decent period of time.
B0002KHTG6|5|Wish I had bought this about 100 years ago. Better than expected or imagined.  Wll worth the expense......Get it now ans save money at the Dentist office
B007T0MW6O|5|I bought this epilator based on others' reviews and was not disappointed.  Can't quite believe that it can be used in the tub, but it can.  I like the variety of heads that come with it.  The light is a very helpful accessory, too.  Any epilator will hurt at first, but time and repeated use generally diminish the sting.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it.
B004CQXZCS|4|I have been using this product about twice a day now for a few weeks.  It does a good job washing off my eyeliner, mascara and concealer with out making my face to tight and dry.  It has a light floral-apple smell and just the right amount of exfoliating beads.  Gets the job done.  I pair it with pr o activ toner and pr o activ drying lotion.  As a side note it really annoys me when Amazon or Amazon sellers edit out other brands mentioned in reviews.  They should stop that practice right away.
B000XEB35O|4|I love this perfume, but then I opened the box, it had leaked onto the papers and box. The house smelt so strong.
B005OKYG9M|5|It always blends and works well with all other hair types and brands. Even though the cost is inexpensive it is just as good as the $100 closures. Well worth the money and they do not sell these in local stores where I am from.
B003V37Z9W|5|Great product and Philips Norelco does a great job of planned obsolesce.  I give them a 5 star at designer a product that you must through out and by a new one every couple of years.  I only buy the full razor because the replacement heads for this razor are about the same price of an entirely new product.  So five star to a company that makes you through out their perfectly good product frequently.<br /><br />I also would like to report they have great customer service.  If anything breaks including the plastic cover for the blade heads.  Do not purchase a replacement but instead call customer service and they will send you a replacement for free.  That I like though perhaps they where thinking I would just by an entirely new razor instead.
B000Q7XDR4|5|Works great as a daily moisturizer. My skin stays soft all day. It goes on a little thick, which I like. It smells amazing. And works great as a tan extender.
B00AZ2JXAG|1|This stuff does not work correctly it is for people with very mild skin issues. I guess I would still need my dermatologist to fix my fine lines or moderate pre wrinkles. I also have tear troughs and i thought that this product cold help and overall it hasn't helped with anything at all. This was the biggest waste of money. I wouldn't recommend this product to anybody.
B00NB12JD6|5|I agree with the first reviewer.  This polish is unusual, inexpensive if you get it at Walgreens, and lasts a long time.  Three coats completely cover the nail, making them look like they're plated with rose gold.  It's $2 at Walgreens if you have one near you.  Mine was on a special display for the holidays, so look around for yours or ask the clerk.  I love this brand...great colors, lasts several days with a clear top coat, huge bottles, and great prices.
B000GXEDBI|5|excelent
B00BV7NG7U|2|I love the combination of lemon and lavender, especially after a good yoga practice, but this particular mix smells only of sweet lemon candy. I'm disappointed.
B00AOJB19G|5|This is amazing, it's better than I expect, they are so cute and soft I recommend this. and It's cheap for the quality.
B00641UCY8|5|This is the BEST co-wash shampoo, it smells incredible and it has done wonders for the shine and manageability to my hair.  It does not strip your color and it's just great.  I'm loving my hair!
B0000DK5LW|4|Great product at a fair price.  We should have bought a couple more at this price for backups and/or other family members.
B004KRVENQ|4|The scissors are sturdy, sharp, long and perfect for facial hair. I have a long handlebar mustache and it does the trick nicely. I can't use the comb though, the teeth are so close together that it doesn't go through my mustache it gets stuck in it and would try to yank them out. If you only need the scissors though they're great.
B00CNOUZE2|1|This is a cheap mirror that fogs up the same as any other mirror.  Don't waste your money.
B00BCC2GUM|2|I've been trying out some different organic body washes. I love Eminence Organic's lemon cleanser and I even bought a professional-sized bottle for the shower. However, at $80 for that size, I wanted to see if I could find something I liked just as well for a lower price.<br /><br />I like the Acure Organics shampoo, so I thought I would give the body wash a try. I tried this one and the unscented one.<br /><br />Lilac is one of my most favorite smells in the world.  I didn't smell it in this at all, which was disappointing to me.  It's very minty smelling.  So much so that it's almost nauseating.  It's like washing with toothpaste.  And it leaves that minty fresh feeling in places you DO want to feel fresh but not necessarily minty.<br /><br />Not going to buy again.
B000XEAZ9Y|5|My husband was so happy...
B00103MGF8|5|Love the longer length as I'm more &#34;mature&#34; and didn't like the shorty wraps. The fabric isn't too hot, just right as a cover up.
B00UHS7CGU|5|The Foxbrim Orange Blossom Water Toner leaves the skin feeling clean and fresh.  I added a few drops to my favorite lotion to add a subtle fragrance.  Great product which I look forward to using in my bath and facial mask. Great product.
B0037HP9OA|2|it lasted me a little over a year, but it started plucking hairs a little over 7 months.<br />the battery started crapping out on me after about 4 months, and it lasted a little over 10 minutes before it needed a recharge.<br />find something else
B00146BJ9K|4|i knew this product i had one which was out of order so i bought a new one<br />no problem just the difficulty to find it!
B00NH70RBU|5|This is good stuff. I have had really oily skin all my life, and I didn't think I could combat that by adding more oil. I was wrong. I wish I'd discovered this sooner. I do have acne-prone skin, and even though this was making my skin look and feel great, I was still getting pimples. I've added about 10-15 drops of Tea Tree Oil to this and now it is perfect! It's really clearing up my skin. It's great for fine lines too. It's the only moisturizer I use now. I just apply 2-3 drops twice a day, after washing my face. I've tried many products on my face to clear it up, Proactive included, and nothing has worked like this. I will buy this again.
B004JXFVH6|5|Sottile (\\"subtle\\") is supposed to be the scent of red roses, eventually drying down to lily of the valley.   My sense of smell isn't as sharp as some, but to me the two fragrances blend seamlessly from start to finish into to the single scent of fresh cut red roses, with none of the stale/potpourri notes most 'rose' perfumes seem to have lurking in the background. In a way, the scent is so fresh and real it's almost *too* real; wear it and people will be looking around for the bouquet - not that that's a bad thing! :)  It is a spray parfum so a little goes a looong way. If applied heavily Sottile goes from subtle and sweet to a *very* obnoxious room-filler of a parfum that will give even the most enthusiastic rose fan a headache. I recommend testing on a cotton ball first, as the spray head is powerful.  Definitely not office appropriate, as it's got miles of seage and there are some serious rose-haters out there!  In my opinion, it's an evening parfum for a woman in her mid 30's on, but if you like it, wear it no matter what your age :)
B0047X6RVM|4|I like how it look so light on my skin. I'm not sure about the translucent effect but it does make my skin kinda glow. :) Great on top of make up or just on its own. :)
B00WWV5PP0|2|Did not work, did not take the puffiness away.
B002AMUFOC|5|gentle, smells wonderful..
B00MOL4AIQ|5|Love them! Just wish they weren't so expensive.
B007QUXZA4|5|Wonderful eye patch!  Not only does it fit perfectly ... but is also super comfortable and cute.  Fast turn around too.  Highly recommend!
B002RT70UK|4|It provides shine without looking greasy. After a few hours I need to reapply, but the small bottle makes carrying easy. (I have type 4 hair).
B007OWPWG4|3|While this brush has great intentions, it didn't work for us like we were hoping. My little girl has an extremely tender head that happens to be a hot mess of tangles!! This brush sort of only got to the surface of her hair and not really deep into where the tangles are. We will keep it as a back up!!&#34;<br />It does however work great for my daughter that has super fine hair. I wouldn't recommend for super thick and course hair
B00F550JWE|1|it moves around
B00H93NJLS|4|Just received this a week back and loving it. The skin does feel smooth. I got an email from InstaNatural which is first from any maker for me. They sent a write up of all the good things about this. Looking forward to at least some of those.
B000C2372Y|5|Wonderful scent.
B00KI4QTDU|5|I use it on my Zuma days and Walk/Jog days.  The best part, it helps you to sweat more,especially when you apply the Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser.  And it gives you a nice silhouette.
B0039NMCPG|5|After using this product for only two weeks, it works. Just that simple. I don't know how it works; I just know that the naso-labial lines in my face are diminishing, and so are my \\"chin dents.\\" I didn't even buy it from Amazon (and paid almost $25.00 for it). But I'll be ordering it from Amazon from now on. I'm 51 and for a long time looked way younger than my true age, but all of a sudden time started catching up with me. It wasn't quite a panic, but yeah, kinda. But this product is turning back the clock. It's too soon to say how much it can undo, but I only care that it's working. My skin is hyper oily, with dry spots around my eyes and mouth. This product goes on without a shine, but I do get \\"breakthrough shine\\" in the middle of the day. My remedy? I wash my face and reapply. I haven't used it at night like the directions suggest. I use Olay Definity at night, because it's too light for my skin tone and makes me look ghostly in daylight, but it did nothing for my \\"jowling\\". Maybe it's a combination of the two. Maybe it's just that I found this stuff before things had gone too far.  In any event, I'm wowwed. I'll post before and after pictures once I figure out how. No matter your skin type, I say give this a try.
B0028Q1XT6|5|Great stuff. Both my husband and I use it. We have two different hair types.
B0049LUI9O|5|He only used it once,  but it worked really well! I was concerned because of some of the negative comments it has.
B0012RYDWG|1|Just received my bottle yesterday and wore it today for the first time. It smells nothing like it should. Doesn't smell bad but it's not it.
B001TH8NG6|5|still one of the best liquid eyeliner I could find - might not be for beginners as it does glide on VERY easily, but the colour is intense and it stays put throughout the day. I've tried many different liquid eyeliners and none goes on as smoothly as this one does. Very good value for money.
B00HQCF8EI|1|Doesn't have enough power.
B00GXJFPMA|5|This item comes with a guarantee. I love that it really is precise. I keep waiting for it to fail - and so far it hasn't. The case is very handy to keep them together in my purse. I had to use the splinter one recently and it worked like a charm!  Thanks for a great product that you are willing to back with a lifetime guarantee!
B000052YE0|5|Great product
B00UM5AWS8|5|These are wonderful! They stay in place and my clients have less irritation and burning once opening their eyes as opposed to the collagen eyepads which tend to irritate the eye more.
B00012C02I|4|So far so good. Does not fog up in a hot shower. Do not use anything remotely abrasive to clean (water only). My experience with this product is that it lasts a year or so before surface becomes too cloudy to see yourself properly.
B0031TRZJG|5|Loved this product. It arrived quickly and was very easy to use.
B00MBWWSKU|5|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!
B006L7PL0U|4|A lotion that doesnt get hot but yet gives you an even tan  It does have a slight fragance
B000JWQ3NC|3|I like the fact that this product melts in my hand, which makes it easy to throw in a purse or suitcase with no worries. I've heard great things about this from friends but I've only used it three or four times. I'm fact I forgot I bought it until Amazon requested a review. I liked the light feel but my hair holds odors and I don't want to walk around smelling like a spice rack. Maybe I'll try it as a hot oil treatment since it would be rinsed out.
B0006U81GY|5|I love these combs. They are very well made and sturdy. They have a nice curve at the handle which makes them easy to hold. I love that this set comes with a big one and a mini size one. I keep the mini one in my purse for on the go and the big one for my bathroom.
B0026786WY|5|I have been using this product (Devrom) for almost five years now.  Ever since my gastric bypass surgery, I have had a need for the internal deordant and this product does what it advertises.  I will continue to order it in the future as needed.
B004I94DF2|5|Thank you love these colors and they last a long time on  your nails thank you!
B005Y16YL4|5|I have had this item for almost 6 months and it has not fallen apart. It is not soft or gentle at first but you have to break it in, if that makes any sense. I am just glad it did not fall apart within the month.
B005EHHWPA|3|I love the color, but I think I'm going to have to try thinner coats. I put on two heavier coats of polish, and it started flaking and chipping after only a few days. Jury's still out on this....
B000VOLLKI|5|Great for my toddler. He is trying to be like daddy with his cologne. He thinks he is such a big boy now!
B000NOLZDY|5|Best eyelash glue out there, and I have tried a lot! Love how it dries black. Bottle lasts a long time as well :) !
B003S516XO|5|My favorite straightener. Works amazing.
B00N9D8PES|5|My skin is so soft after using this for the first time.
B00IIWVJ2U|5|I AM AMAZED AT HOW MUCH BETTER MY SKIN LOOKED AFTER USING THE BEST EYE CREAM ONLY TWO WEEKS<br />I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE IMPROVEMENT WITH CONTINUED USE!!
B0037W6PJS|5|great cream! Not greasy at all. I didn't get any stretch marks, not sure if it was the cream or just luck. It really helped with the itching too!
B004DHYZU2|5|I am extremely happy with t his product and also orderes some for my daughter.  This site is about half the cost of other sites.  Great buy.
B004C6O9FK|5|I love this product.  It goes on smooth and covers well without a streaky look.  I also like that it has SPF 20 in it.
B0091L4SS4|4|Exactly as I expected but a bit smaller.  These are like the old-fashioned, soft body powder puffs that used to come in a box of powder.
B000UK2W4C|5|Your Dentist is like your Mom and Dad:  really, they just want what's best for you.  Of course, sometimes what's best isn't always what's practical.  I've had the Sonicare suggested to me by my dentist for a few years now.  At this last checkup, my dentist spotted a problem area where brushing just can't reach:  the very pits of my molars are pretty deep.  When I thought about the price--and complete lack of fun--involved in getting my head drilled, I decided a hundred bucks was worth the investment to avoid a cavity.  The last filling I had was twice that.<br /><br />The Sonicare comes with its own small charging base.  It's really simple to set up and with daily use the battery should last for a couple of weeks.  Battery life depends on how you use it, and the nice thing about the Sonicare is that you can change your mind any time:  there's \\"Go Care\\", which will run the brush for a minute, and \\"Max Care\\", which will give you a full 2 minutes of time.  I tend to do Go Care in the morning, Max Care at night.  You can also adjust for \\"I want you to focus on cleaning\\", \\"I have sensitive gums\\", and \\"I'm really in the mood for a good gum massage\\".  I'm typically more no-nonsense than that and just focus on cleaning.  One drawback is that the battery is not replaceable, so I'm not sure how many charges the Sonicare is good for.<br /><br />The technology behind Sonicare deserves some mention.  This isn't an 'electric toothbrush' - I still work it across my teeth and gums like a normal toothbrush.  The difference is that the head pulses and emits sonic waves that shake the microscopic ick that you've accumulated right off your teeth.  The vibration doesn't rattle your head or make your eyes water:  it sounds like you're gargling with a lightsaber, but the feeling amounts to a mild vibration that leaves your gums tingly.<br /><br />The last time I had an electric toothbrush, it was heavier than the Sonicare, despite being much shorter.  It had a shorter stem where the Sonicare's attachment head is long and slender, and I had a tendency to drool messily down the thing--while the Sonicare doesn't cause me that problem at all.  The Sonicare brush comes with one of each head:  a large and a small.  Both have long stems but one has a smaller run of bristles for smaller mouths.<br /><br />Using my Sonicare for two weeks now, the effects have been noticeable:  it's not just the odd sensation that my toothbaste has almost taken on the texture of whipped cream...it's also that my mouth feels clean like the Dentist just got through with it.  Even with \\"Max Care\\" and \\"Clean\\" settings, I don't have that achy, itchy gums feeling that a Water Pik turned on full can do.

The Sonicare brush comes with one of each head:  a large and a small.  Both have long stems but one has a smaller run of bristles for smaller mouths.    Using my Sonicare for two weeks now, the effects have been noticeable:  it's not just the odd sensation that my toothbaste has almost taken on the texture of whipped cream...it's also that my mouth feels clean like the Dentist just got through with it.  Even with \\"Max Care\\" and \\"Clean\\" settings, I don't have that achy, itchy gums feeling that a Water Pik turned on full can do.

B00D4HA5PG|5|Thanks Santa for the wonderful gift set !!!, I get all my favorite products in sizes that I can use and the products came quickly and not broken (Anything)  ....just love it...
B001AMQJAW|5|I love this product and use it daily mixed with AG fast food leave in conditioner. Keeps the friz at bay.
B00014I9NU|5|I LOVE this stuff!  I've been using it for 10 years.
B00AREGVUM|5|This stuff really works! Be patient and you'll see results. This is the cheapest place that you can get this amount for. This 6.7 oz bottle is $30 anywhere else, fyi.
B00H5BDX7Y|5|Great product ,would recommend ,plan to buy more in the future
B00R6PVXXU|5|very good for oily skin
B0034BV6KA|5|This fabric shaver works great. I have had it for over a year now and it still works perfectly! A must have.
B00009RF1E|5|I have one, and bought 2 for my teenage boyz.  these last forever, are solid and go a great job.
B00NP9DWUS|5|Received this the other day and I love it! I use this after cleansing, applying toner and essence and let it dry before applying moisturizer. I really love how this can be used all over the face not just your eyes. I've noticed the dark under eye circles are less noticeable and look forward to seeing the results after using the product for a few weeks.
B006GKHIHQ|4|Pretty good lashes for the cost. I used them with Duo lash glue (clear) and they stayed on really well. The reason I gave it four stars is because they were definitely too long. I don't know anyone with a lash line that long, but they were really easy to cut down to my eye shape, so overall this was a pretty good product. I can see myself ordering more in the future. They also arrived quicker than I expected them to, which was a nice bonus.
B00LCS54AA|1|I don't know if to early but I had one week to use it and I don't see any difference, I hop I don't waste my money again
B00DOPZL34|5|This is the third one of these Bag organizers I have purchased with another on the way if your having trouble like I did keeping your hand bag organized I highly recommend one of these or two .this has 4 pockets in the front and the back and in the closet one to the front has a little pocket I like to keep my lip stick in .The middle has three long pockets two that zip and the middle has no zipper.also has handles so you can just lift this out great if you want to just switch bags .I find this to make my life so much easier than digging to the bottom searching for things this is around 11 inches long and the width is about 7 inches you will be surprised how much you can carry in this has made my life so much easier I also want to mention the zipper is plastic but I have had no problems with this one or the other two I have for a few dollars its worth  every cent.Also they come in many coloirs to choose from thisone is purple.
B0029L1LI8|2|gave me rash
B001JKTTVQ|5|Before owning the Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch, I never really had a complete set like this. I have been wanting to get a set for so long but they were always priced way to high for me to afford. I really enjoy my other Shany Cosmetic products and thought I'd give this set a try and I cannot seem to put it down!!! I've always loved doing my makeup but never took a real interest in using eye shadow until this past year. My pouch came in a pretty red color and I love that it has a flap that covers up all of your brush heads before you roll it up. It's great that it comes like this because you can easily take it with you in your purse if you need to, or if you dont have a big bathroom (like myself) its hard to find a spot for everything and the roll up bag makes it easy. I have really enjoyed playing with all the different brushes and finding out which ones do this or that. I would definately suggest this item to anyone if they were looking for a new brush set. I forgot to mention that the mineral powder brush is really quite soft and doesnt feel like sandpaper to your face like kabuki brushes I've used before. I used to be a Mary Kay Senior Consultant and used their mineral power \\"kabuki\\" brush for what seems like years. I now realize that The Shany brush Set has really great quality and spreads the powder effotlessly and evenly.I've only had these a couple of weeks but they seem to be holding up well. Of course you get your occassional shedded hair but I think I should have rinsed them off and let them dry first to get out most of the loose/unglued hairs.
B00OTGX8F0|5|Very good product, does what it says it does.
B003BQIZX4|5|Given to my daughter  for Christmas, no complaint, happy with the product..
B003YJAZZ4|5|My husband has the older version of this and was in much need of an upgrade. We can always trust Braun for an awesome product.
B00CCE6YRU|2|all i got to  say is  its  nothing  like the  pic its  not full at all and  its  short  not  long
B004X2ZUS8|5|Love the product
B000GCLR40|4|I first learned about this product from my doctor. I had impacted ear wax and after he dug it all out he suggested that I use sweet oil to keep the wax soft. I've been using it and so far it's working.
B0063A4RXW|5|The color was black and the hair is silky and str8 i really love the length to.  I was very pleased with the product it was also similar to the picture.
B000172SGG|2|These nippers have long jaws; I wouldn't recommend them if you're afraid of stabbing yourself (go for the 1/4 inch). Were exceptionally sharp when I received them, but very dull after 3 months (I'm the only one who uses it and I only use it on soft tissue). This has been my experience with Tweezerman nippers multiple times. I'll go with another brand in the future.
B00OSB2J8I|5|I use this religiously!!! Makes my face feeel so smooth and silky! It doesn't have an over powering smell like a lot of these products do!
B004M1BO3U|5|Awesome toothbrush, highly recommended! Great price and really feels like a professional cleaning. Hoping that this will eliminate unnecessary trips to the dentist
B000GGKQ16|4|I bought this because I recently had a partial plate made.  It sure is handy to use.  One of those necessities of life.
B00OJWCCLA|5|Love the clean smell
B00BXLW9GI|5|I really see a difference! love this product.
B000C21A7I|5|Greit
B004AZZ8T4|5|When I was introduced to the Benefit Line of Cosmetics.  My first purchase was this pencil.  Since funds were limited and I wasn't quite sure about all the strange names of the products.  I was cautious ... very cautious!  I really wanted out, but not without that darn concealer/highlighter I \\"had to have\\" because, I had tried it and it seemed to give me a lift around my slightly saggy eyes.  I felt that If I had more time to play and maybe next time invest in another complimentary product, I'd be onto something!  For a few bucks, it was certainly worth a try.  I got hooked.  All the products since that I've gotten are top notch(and the compliments aren't bad either!) But, I've got a problem that I need help to resolve.<br /><br />I found out, sadly, that my special product(pink pencil/concealer/highlighter) was discontinued. No words can explain how I felt,,,And still feel!  Can anyone help?  I'd really like to know where I can purchase this item, if possible.[[ASIN:B000FBF58G Benefit Cosmetics Eye Bright Pencil]]<br /><br />Thanks kindly for your help.  Nancy Townsend - nltownsend@verizon.net
B00S715K9K|5|I saw this healing clay when I was searching around for a new type of face mask...and boy, am I glad I found it!<br /><br />It comes in a powder form (I didn't read the full product description, so I was a bit surprised when I opened the jar) which means you can mix the clay to your desired thick/thinness which is awesome. The other big plus was the fact that since it is in powdered form, it won't dry out, which is another complaint of mine solved regarding products like this. The jar is also quite large, and holds a lot of powder.<br /><br />I used the healing clay mixed with apple cider vinegar instead of water like recommended for a stronger mask last night, and after using it, my skin is noticeably softer, and feels a lot smoother (less bumps from acne and blackheads).<br /><br />The only recommendation I would have for this is product is that you should use 3 tablespoons of water/apple cider vinegar for every 2 tablespoons of clay. I thought the 2 for 2 recommendation on the directions made for a really thick clay mask, but it could be just my personal preference.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying this again. It's awesome.
B000JNQSIQ|5|Very quiet and a nice case to keep all of the Goody's you get with it ,<br />it does the job
B00GETFD1M|5|Great cologne. Smells good and the seller got it to me very quickly. I would buy from this seller again
B00006IV2F|5|This has a very quick heating and I love that there are multiple temperature settings. I have very fine, straight hair and don't need a lot of heat so it works well for me to give a quick styling. Great for shorter hair because the tines are short. Love it.
B007JBF99U|5|Does what it is supposed to. I am seriously loving me some babyface! I will reorder again and again. Shipped on time.
B005JFUYNE|5|This gel is amazing it holds all day and now that it comes in this dispenser i couldn't be happier
B00FZ29ICO|5|Diffuses oils very well and is very simple to use.  Turns off automatically after about 4-5 hours.  Great for one room use.  I liked it so much I bought another one!
B00F1D56HI|5|this is my 2nd bottle and I love it..!!
B000VVT94G|4|This product cuts awesome. The people that cut themselves are not to bright. They are sharp, but that's the point. They are loud as hell though.
B00EOSH3AO|5|This stuff is AMAZING!! Your black heads literally just come out with one application!! This is the real deal! Like where has this been my whole life!? Definitely will buy again!
B00016XJ4M|5|I wanted to wait to write a review on this, mainly to see the impact it had on my face, and woahh it did. I normally have a mixture of dry/oily skin which is a huge disaster. After using this product for a little over 3 months, my skin has cleared up a lot and been far less oily. I usually use this and some light moisturizer after I wash my face and it is very refreshing (since my skin is dry as well I need to add some moisturizer to it cause this toner can dry it out more if not). It smells like roses too which is an added bonus for your pretty little face!
B007KWXH4M|3|I am not joking when I say that this stuff looks like baby poop and it doesn't smell that great, either.  If you can get past the looks of it, it does its job, but I prefer the B'iota shampoo for regular hair which doesn't look or smell like a bodily excrement.  Am definitely switching back to the regular formula.
B000FBNYRU|2|In general, I like benefit cosmetics. They seem unique and special, and I love the names. However, I'm not sure how I feel about High Beam. It doesn't do much (esp for the price!) and...well, let's just say there's a fine line between \\"glowing\\" and \\"shiny\\". I have very fair skin, so maybe this just looks better on people with a tan.
B00PXUOHA6|2|Ideal is good but, clips are flimsy.  Broke on first use.
B005898UTQ|5|Have tried other dry shampoos and NOTHING even comes close.  And the old hippy in me loves the smell, couldn't live without this product!!!
B004OJU990|5|My favorite brush. Excellent quality.
B00L673EEU|3|Product is as advertised.
B000NB5BHS|4|When I feel that I am more acidic than usually i gargle and rinse my mouth with this product. I feel confident that it does what it says it does. Also, if I feel a sore throat coming on I gargle with it. So far I have been lucky in not obtaining a worse case sore throat.
B006K26D9E|5|Love this product. I was using Deva styling gel and switched to the cream. It gives my curls definition and a softness. Wouldn't ever want to run out. I also use it with Deva Condition One. Great combination for nourishing curls.
B001PAGZ2G|5|Great stuff! Smells good and makes your skin very soft. Not bad for the money.
B000W0YGGC|5|This cologne is absolutely fantastic. Almost every girl that gets within a few feet of me compliments how I smell when I wear this, and have gotten even more notice from it than the All American Stetson I used to wear. It's able to be worn both formally and casually, and I highly recommend it.
B000UK16AI|1|Very nice!!!!
B00DW8DFU4|4|Very good
B009FYTMOM|5|Take it with me on all my road trips.  Mirror at the top and a good amount of room to store your brushes and foundation
B000Z5YDQC|3|I have oily hair and have tried a few different dry shampoos.  I loved the way this product smelled and worked, but it didn't last long.  It's priced a bit too high for not lasting long.  I think I used it 5 or 6 times before it was gone.
B00070E8IS|5|My Elchim from the 90s finally died and it was like a death in the family.  My hair, while I used a temporary hair dryer was atrocious with frizz and stray hairs everywhere.  This Elchim showed up and it was like a miracle.  The hair dryer is just amazing.  I read some of the reviews and there was a burning smell for the 1st and maybe 2nd time I used it, but never again.  It leaves your hair silky smooth!<br />Oh and regarding the heaviness...don't judge a book by its cover.  It is heavy until you use it.  Then magically the weight is distributed nicely.  Don't ask me how...some kudos go to the designers!
B000W9Y3SE|5|it is pretty good!<br />nothing can be better than this sunscreen!<br />I recommend this if you are looking for sunscreen!
B0000C88FM|4|This shaver is really nice, and does a good job shaving my legs. I don't use it often, but have tried it in the shower and it worked great wet too. Would buy again.
B000FEGUIM|5|This is my first electric shaver (have been using gillette sensor excel for number of years) and I love it.  This is giving me a very close shave on my cheeks but not so close under the chin/neck area.  Still, I am very happy with the overall shave and definitely recommend this to others.
B000UGXFCO|5|it was as per my expectation
B003BVINRC|5|They are great! They are normally pretty expensive and this was a pretty good deal that I found. These razors work very good
B008YQM40G|5|I have sensitive teeth and this is the only whitening tooth paste that does not cause me any discomfort.  I LOVE Colgate, before this tooth paste I didn't think there was a whitening toothpaste out there that was effective in whitening, excellent at leaving your mouth feeling completely clean and adequate for people with sensitive teeth.
B003MRRL2I|3|I really do not see a difference.  My son's face is about the same......he says the same thing.......oh well. teenage skin is difficult
B0009XH6V4|5|Perfect! Good power.
B004D2DR0Q|5|I like this product and I have been using it for years. It has a protective sunscreen agent. It is perfect for me.
B000GHWTLK|1|Wy dednt resive item
B0007XYRBI|5|Olivella fragrance free bar soap is incredible, long lasting (making it worth the price) and leaves my skin dewy.  I haven't used their other products and if they have a fragrance free versions, I will buy them all!  A friend of mine uses olive oil straight from the bottle and her skin looks so young and fresh.  Rather than smell like a salad, I'll opt for Olivella!
B005Z4QT7E|2|This is okay. I'm not overly thrilled with the cleaner. I think you would do just as well to drop some Dawn detergent in a plastic (disposable) cup and swish the brushes around. Then rinse. I did like the sleeves that came with this to keep your bristles from bending and getting out of shape. Just don't think this was worth the money.
B00F008GFQ|5|It was a gift for my wife.  It shipped quickly and was exactly what she was wanting.
B002RBF1PO|5|This razor is awesome and will last a lifetime. Gives a great close shave. Pair it with some persona blades. Throw away the Derbys that it comes with.
B000MANVWW|5|My go to deodorant. Body heat activated :D
B008DLT9H8|5|Both sides of brush work great.
B00AAJOZN4|2|Useless no good
B002GSXS4O|5|It works as described. I used my last foil way longer than I should have and it was time to replace.
B0076J9RZW|1|Terrible product! Smells bad! Gives me skin rash. This is probably the worst product I bought from Amazon. don't buy
B001EWF3IC|5|I love this product!  I use it in the morning to reactivate my curls and also I use ti when I straighten my hair with a flat iron and it seems to really protect my hair.  I like the subtle scent too.  I always love Aveda and this product is no exception in fact I use it with the Be curly lotion and one pump light elements smoothing fluid and ten sprays of this and with a diffuser my naturally wavy hair has ringlets!!!  All three of these products is the key though and using a diffuser!
B00QFHYUNU|3|I bought these because I was looking for the BEST. so sick of cheap Chinese clippers.  They don't have that awesome clean crisp feel that I expected.
B00HMX1LLU|5|Love it. Very long too
B00K5AAVH2|5|Nice long handle with good heft to it.  The finish and grip are flawless.  I have purchase a few old gillettes and the Edwin Jagger DE89 and am very pleased with this purchase at 1/3 of the price of the EJ and less than most of the Gillettes.
B000RZLL38|3|I love having this on the wall and out of the way so I'd give that 5 stars.  However, with that said this is the third one I have purchased in 8 years so they do not last.  At some point the thing will make a racket and spark and poof....toast.  But I will continue to rebuy and stick it up on the metal piece that is already on the wall as I do love having it on the wall.
B00Z1ID3M8|5|love
B00C8GBZAS|5|I have very sensitive skin and bought this pore cleanser in particular since it said it had very soft bristles.  They feel like fur.  I've only used it a couple of times but so far I'm impressed.
B006YGR7PA|2|so this tattoo kit wasn't as good as i expected and it was missing some things.. like the tattoo gun stand!!!
B00LLLOEIQ|5|I put a few drops on my shower head. Does wonders for headaches!
B0037AKUMI|5|Great product. Just don't drop it like I did.
B003XKW8RM|5|I totally love this morrocon rose water!! I love the smell of roses. I don't understand why there r customers that complain about the odor. Its wonderful just like roses. I look forward to pampering my face with this rose water I love it! please keep supplying this product!! I recommend this rose water( I use this twice a day as a toner)
B00EIL8RJ8|4|The item was shipped very quickly. I have been using it for about a week now and I am seeing an improvement. The downside is it really dries out my skin. However, I am prone to dry skin so I did expect it. I started out once a day but have now dropped down to just once and I avoid using the toner on the dry areas.
B00EOOWDDK|5|This is an excellent small amount for anyone who's curious to know if it's worth the price of a larger bottle.It's also a perfect purse size ;) I will definately buy this again.ALSO.For Christmas,the perfect thing for a stocking stuffer.It is the real thing.Good experience with this seller as well.
B00ITJNFDI|5|ok so at first i was kinda doughting on buying them b-cause there was only 1 review but when i finally got them and they arrived omg they are soo pretty the color is a little diff. from picture and very thin but not too thin js they are soft i love them cant wait to wear them and match them up with my hair. the waves are not how they look in the pic they are acctually prettier
B00CNOUZE2|4|Great Fogless mirror! Just wish it looked less cheap. It did exactly what it said it would, and I love that it also comes with a great razor holder! Quick tip for new buyers: do not place the mirror in direct stream of water. Other than that it worked perfectly and I was impressed! I use this mainly for washing my face and brushing my hair in the shower. Or shaving hard to see places.<br /><br />This item was sent free for consideration. I am not compensated for this review, and all opinions are my own.
B003EIOWTA|5|I've had experience with various brands of applicator sponges and learned fast that not all are good.<br /><br />I use these mostly for stage make up (that includes using street make up on stage as well as the heavy, horrible stage make up)<br /><br />These sponges apply both PERFECTLY.<br /><br />They feel supple - not stiff and dry like other sponges that consequently apply make up in streaks.<br /><br />I can easily get even coatings with these and blend make up well!... both with street and stage make up - stage make up is heavier and doesn't break down this sponge, so I can put it in a baggie and save for the actor and re use again, the next day, if I'm running low.<br /><br />I highly recommend these - I love them and they work perfectly !  :)
B00X52N372|5|This powder is amazing !!!!
B003I97ANU|5|Great dye, looks natural and makes you feel years younger.May have a strong smell at first, but peroxide will do that. Well worth the effort using this. I saved HUGE money buy using this in place of just for men dyes.
B005V1J9PK|5|LOVE these brushes.. they are so soft and blend really well..<br />i'm happy with my purchase and recommended them to my sister in law.
B004VSF5FW|5|I was surprised when I found this product on line.  have not been able to find it recently.  It was shipped on time and rec quicker than expected. Thanks
B003IUAZR2|4|Great oil and value. The only reason it didnt get five stars is that is has no dropper. This creates wasted oil when you only need a little. Other than that it does a greay variety of jobs for home and health.
B005V22SEI|5|...both the product and the delivery. I ordered 4 different scents from this company and barely had to wait until they were delivered to me. It was quick, the products were beautifully packaged, and it looks like they will last a long time. I've only really used two, the orange for homemade laundry detergent (which smells fabulous) and the lavender (my favorite) for some homemade body lotion and I the level of liquid in the bottle barely moved so I will have plenty for future projects. Can't wait to use the lemon and tangerine! I will definitely be coming back to order more from this vendor and highly recommend them for all your essential oil needs.
B001XURHBQ|5|Purchased this to use when traveling. love that the container is watertight, and so compact.<br />Smells great, and is affordable.
B001MA0QY2|4|Overall, very happy with this product. Easy to use and results exceed expectations. Be aware that it does get VERY hot! My hair is fine and thinner than it once was so I use the coolest setting and it's still hot, but with very nice, smooth results. The only negative is the small size and location of the control settings...I have small hands and that tiny knob is still hard to get your fingers in there to adjust. Not a huge deal as I plan to leave it on the low setting, but if it were necessary to manipulate often it would be annoying. That aside, this is an excellent product at a great price. Very pleased and glad I bought it.
B003YJAZZE|5|NO MORE RAZOR BURN. It is great, but just make sure you want to buy it and keep it because amazon does not allow returns. I wanted to return it because the 790 was available for the same price after a coupon. But, I am happy because the higher model just has more features that I do not really use.
B009Q1YPV4|5|I love this shadow! It's pretty, packaged well (no damages on two separate purchases of this palette), and most of the colors are sparkly and shimmery. Not the greatest pigment, but it builds well. Could be improved with an included applicator.
B00IYD8V8S|1|Wish I would have read the reviews.  Like others I thought I was getting a set of 12.  Luckily I received a white one.
B00HBSC3JA|5|First time I have ever used beard specific products. Could tell a difference in the feel of my beard after just one use. Beard is softer feeling and easier to comb. Recommending it to my fuzzy faced friends!!!
B001E769BM|5|I'm actually using this soap for the shower, I love it. It smells good and is high quality. I recommend it if you might have allergies as I do to many chemicals. It comes in several varieties but I picked peppermint because it's my favorite. This is the refill size but I noticed that has snap-up lid on the cap. You could just keep buying this bottle if you didn't mind having a 32 oz. bottle of liquid next to your sink or in the shower, etc.
B000V2ACH8|5|love this stuff.
B00KW72UWC|2|very very light colors :(
B001GNBW0W|5|Does a great job of adding length without clumping.  The brush is a great size and it's easy to get the smaller corner lashes with the tip.  I usually give my lashes two coats with this (let it dry between applications), for the perfect effect.
B0007DHMD8|5|This is a wonderful semi-permanent color. It covers grays completely and doesn't damage your hair at all. Shiny and natural.
B000O1DT3K|5|I'd suggest this polish to lovers of neutral polishes...it's long lasting and doesn't chip easily.  I always receive compliments when wearing it!!!
B00N03NZTW|5|Love this!
B0036WJ456|2|This product reminds me of spray on deodorant or tan-in-a-can. I used it once and realized that it was technology that needs to be improved on before I use it in my hair again. I don't like the feeling of &#34;wet powder&#34; on my scalp...
B009Z3MG0K|5|I have never had a tube of concealer last me this long. I think I'm sold on this stuff for life!
B00461F4PA|5|Best thing I have ever done for my feet!!
B000AR8W8K|5|I purchased this item to go abroad. While the dryer was not too heavy , it was very strong and my hair were dry in no time.
B004V4HNYC|2|Should rename to not a perfect match,  Too bad the salons had to take the brunt on the false advertising.  Private Escort NOT EVEN CLOSE!
B000FGC99O|2|I used this product in conjunction with the Biotin shampoo. I have fine, thin hair that tends to get greasy. I wanted a product that was SLS free and could potentially help my hair look thicker. This product weighs my hair down and it makes my hair greasy within an hour after using. Yikes. Might not be the right formula for my fine hair. Will never purchase again.
B000GCY2CY|5|This original shampoo is rarely available in the stores.  So happy to find it available on line and at such a great price.  This is the only dandruff shampoo that really controls the itching and flakes for me.  Thanks
B000F955GA|3|I bought it to help my acne, but it didn't work.  I think it is more for eczema and rashes.  It didn't hurt my skin though and would probably work for other skin conditions besides mine.
B009PIJLMQ|5|I flip flop back and forth between toothpastes but this may be my favorite.  I like the taste and it doesn't leave that chalkiness behind quite as bad as some do.  When you use it in subscribe & save it is a decent deal.
B0081CWUE8|3|I bought this in hopes of finding a Cleansing Conditioner to use that would be cheaper then Wen. I have a  nice natural curl to my hair but it does tend to get frizzy in the summer and dry in the winter. This product is not nearly as thick as the Wen product and I have found does not create the same results. After using it my hair still feels &#34;tangled&#34; and hard to comb out. Also find I am &#34;washing&#34; my hair the same amount as before where with the Wen product I am washing my hair much less which makes up a little for the higher cost.
B003E84M8G|5|I usually have allergies to facial products and I just wanted to try this, I had no itching or burning and the coverage was beautiful.  If you wet the sponge just a bit before applying, it give you a glow.
B003XMNHTS|5|The brush is very soft yet the brisels hold up well.  It works great for applying lipstick to the entire lip or touching up liquid lipstick .  The handle is a good size, not too small where it's hard to hold or too big so it's clunky.  This brush is a definite must have in every collection!  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my review.
B0009DVDTU|5|This is the one and only eye cream I've ever used that actually works on my dark circles under my eyes. I've tried numerous others, some much more expensive, but none work nearly as well. Would recommend.
B000980PGM|5|great service and product
B00GR0EI9Q|5|To start off i've been an avid Gillette user for since the three blade was introduced.  The Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive actually lives up to the title.  You can actually feel the hydrating gel reservoir releasing the aloe and vitamin E.  That lubrication along with five ultra glide blades makes for one of the most comfortable shaves i've had in a long time.  The entire razor is put together well to complement its features.  The handle has a very well balanced  heavy feel.  The only issue I had was with the flip trimmer.  That was mostly user error.  As once I figured out the correct way to handle the blade it did a very nice job getting the areas you cannot with the guard down.  Overall I give the Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive Razor five stars.  This razor delivers whats promised.
B003YJAZZ4|5|I have very sensitive skin--Especially my neck.  I have been shaving my face for over 10 years now with a Whal Peanut which is a personal trimmer/groomer unit used by a lot of hair care professionals.  It has treated me well but does not even come close to a razor shave.  This means that I must shave everyday and still walk around with A LOT of stubble.  I have tried so many other options.  I have tried all the different razors and different techniques.  Razor burn on my neck every time.  I have also tried numerous electric shavers but have never found a unit that actually shaved all the hair quickly without pulling or irritating certain hairs and leaving others behind.  I was more than a little skeptical about spending this kind of money on yet another attempt.  SO GLAD THAT I DID!!!  For the first time in a decade I have a shave that is razor close.  The neck may be just a tad outside this range, and I mean barley.  My neck hairs grow sideways and curly though.  The braun took them off quickly and with no pain or irritation.  I have been walking around all day feeling my face in disbelief.  I never thought I would feel this close of a shave again.  NOT ONE RAZOR BUMP EITHER!!! This is the first review I have ever written--the product performed that well.  It made me want to sit down and let someone else who may have the same problems I did with razor burn that there is a solution.
B002MUAP5G|3|Works as advertised. It provides just the right angle to get to the hair on the upper part of your back. The length and angle however make it awkward to get to the lower part of your back and along the upper part of the shoulders. It's also, in my opinion, over priced for the simplicity and materials used.
B007B5D9C8|5|EXCELENTE
B0011U19PI|3|Well, I'm a bit disappointed in this fragrance.  It is light and not overpowering, which is great.  What I don't like is it reminds me somewhat of your grandmother's perfume.  lol  I'm surprised because I thought I would really like it, so won't be purchasing this again.
B0046VJTX8|3|Its a good product but not for oily skin....
B002SYXHTC|5|Most amazing EVER!!!  I have curly hair!
B00EXJE41K|2|I bought it in place of the obagi elastiderm eye cream which is a wonderful product for wrinkles around the eye.  Although the gel says it is for wrinkles around the eye, it does not work well.  I have noticed wrinkles that had gone away using the Obagi elastiderm eye cream have now returned after I switched to the gel.  It is an expensive product that is not very good.
B000GSEAGG|5|A classic breath freshener. A great alternative to messy gum. Mild and less overpowering than most of the products on the market today. Fits nicely into a pocket. I could be mistaken but I do believe I had one in my backpack when I was at the airport and got it through security, careful though.
B004L4EING|5|Great product
B00461F4PA|1|doesnt work. looks like all hype.<br />regularly get the &#34;real thing&#34; with pedicures. not worth the effort or price. pass.
B000OTZLFG|5|and Lovely. Just the scent I wanted for the warmer weather to come. I think this will be the one I return over and over again,
B001MA0QY2|5|I can't believe how soft my hair is after I use this straightener. I am going to purchase more of the oil that came with it.
B0010H6KRE|1|This thing is a crap bought it a month ago used 2 times and the sponge came off cpntact the seller he said is normal the sponge comes off so u can wash but there no way to put back that means garbage
B000C4SBJQ|3|I cant devote enough time to wear the 10% long enough to do any good. I get the 35% and use that for much shorter periods of time.
B001WAKUTS|5|I have used this for two months now and my lashes are thicker and a little longer.  You have to give this product time to work as hair grows in 3 month cycles.  Three months is the time you would want to give a product like this to see if it is working for you.  I admit I was suprised.  I had irritated eyes initially but it went away. I like he product....it does what it says but don't use it for two weeks and think it does not work.  It will work but remember the growth cycle.  It prevents the lashes from falling out before they reach their full growth potential...that is how it works.
B001ZSBI8Y|5|Best stuff!
B00KP5Y6N2|5|i love it..would buy again
B004HJ737S|5|I bought this lotion to use after epilating and I absolutely love it - it really soothes my irritated skin and leaves it feeling soft and silky. This lotion absorbs quickly and isn't runny or greasy and it smells wonderful! I've tried so many lotions and have always been dissatisfied for one reason or another. I'm so glad I've finally found a winner!
B000FEF1V4|4|Doesn't vacuum up all the hair, but makes the overall cleaner process.  Fits well in hand.  Cuts well. Simple to use.
B002GJ7GR8|5|I have previously ordered this product. This has worked very well for me before I have acne, scars & oil skin. I highly recommend this people to improve the texture & appearance of acne scarred skin
B00EQ524X6|5|I have used  Wexler products for several years and love them all, especially the skin brightening cream but have not been able to get it from Bath and Body Works for a long time!
B0058WABXG|5|Good mask...no issues and I have very fair and sensitive skin
B000JLEUVA|5|GOOD
B0002JKPA4|5|I have used these rollers for many years and love them because they do create a long lasting, natural curl without damaging my hair.  Only one downside, if you have hard water, the mineral build-up will ruin the steamer after about a year.  Since we got a water softener I have had no problems.
B005HR60MI|5|Have purchased this before and love the moisturizing qualities of it for my skin!! Will purchase in the future also.
B00BPBLMCS|3|It is a decent back shaver, you will nick yourself if you apply any kid of pressure and if you have very sensitive skin like I do you will have some discomfort after shaving. I have used it 4 times and it will get the job done.<br /><br />Now some drawbacks. With my transaction it took nearly three weeks before I got my order. Paying 8 dollars for shipping I expected a shorter wait and the bakblade product itself is decent in quality although I wish there was a way to sharpen the blades because I can see it getting very expensive, if a comparable item comes into the market at a lower price point I will defiantly switch I am typically a brand loyal person but this product has inspired very little loyalty in me.
B00295VHWO|5|Seriously. Don't spend drugstore prices. These work great, ship promptly, and are super inexpensive. Glue works fine, but its a small bottle. No.complaints whatsoever.
B00I073WLE|5|I have acne prone skin, and this does NOT break me out at all! I love this even more than philosophy's hope in a jar. This is definitely a staple of mine. It really does even out your skin tone and give you a nice glow.
B000U8E1AM|5|I have been using Bioelements Flash Foam for about a year and I am happy with the results.  One bottle lasts me 4 1/2 months (I always put the date I started using it on my stuff so I know how long it lasts).  You really only need 1 pump (sometimes I do 2 just to get extra cleanser) and I do wash my face twice a day (at night, I use make-up remover first then wash my face).  I haven't had as much problems with my oily skin as I've had in the past, I now go through one oil absorbent sheet, sometimes two, in a a day versus the six and seven sheets I used to use. And, it's been ages since I've had any break-outs as well. Originally I started out with the cleanser for sensitive skin, which I have, but then switched to the foam cleanser because I wanted to try it and I've had no sensitivity issues with it.  I just wish that Bioelements had a make-up line, I think they could come up with something good!<br /><br />I think all the products are good by Bioelements.  It's best to start with the travel sizes if you're unsure what cleanser, toner, and moisturizer you need - beauty products are really trial and error.  And, the regular sized products do last so the cost is worth it!
B004BCEFUY|5|I love the scent. It stays on for the entire day.
B003YCVWXK|5|This color is amazing - no need to wear any eye shadow because the color is so vibrant! The mascara stays on until I wash it off and it gives great length and volume to my lashes.
B004L96NZW|2|This product would be great for some one  that has dry hair.  It does make the  hair  very soft without a conditioner, but for me it is to soft.
B004MCICSO|5|Wife says this thing is the best thing she has bought for her face. My wife's face is really sensitive so she is always trying out new products to try and find the right balance. This product does all she needs, leaves her face feeling soft and cleanses it at the same time. She has even got my daughter to try out this product; my daughter agrees with her that it makes her face feel soft as well. Like I say if it makes the women in my life happy it must be good.
B000U0F9GA|5|What I was looking for, what was described, and arrived in really decent time. I found the package outside my door Sunday morning after ordering it Friday night!
B00AYO1DVW|5|Love them. They are longer than usual so they really hold well and they just sparkle
B003MC1ZSE|5|Wonderful product
B000172R6C|4|This comb is good value for the money.  The price is better then the local stores.
B000LPSGL4|3|I LOVE how this body butter makes your skin soft, but the white chocolate scent leaves a lot to be desired. I love the mango, Asian Lily and sweet almond fig so far! I just ordered the white peony...Delon is great but I could only give the white chocolate 3 stars....sorry Delon..This scent needs tweaking.
B000NSVW1K|4|I love Solar Sense's face stick for the kids. It's quick and easy to put on and doesn't run in their eyes. I bought this one because it was a better deal and liked the antioxident idea, but the kids totally balked at putting on the cream. It's perfect for older kids or adults because it's not greasy or anything, but if you have younger children, the face stick is the best.
B007F4B69S|5|I love the 3d line of crest products, I use this with the white strips and always get compliments on how white my teeth are! Some people even thing I have fake teeth.
B0069SQE2A|5|Excellent. Quite strong. Am currently using it for homemade laundry soap. Seems to be doing the trick. Good strength for the low price.
B0011Z1VD8|5|Very good product and only product to keep my husband's hand moist. Would recommend this product to anyone that work with there hands.
B004FF93Q8|2|This is my go-to mascara, but usually I purchase it from the MAC store/stand.  This is the first time I purchased it online from this seller and I was less than satisfied.  The mascara is nothing like the type that I use in the store.  The consistency is incredibly liquidy.  Waste of money.  Buy the real stuff from the MAC store/stand.
B00BOJL924|5|Excellent
B000UVZU1S|4|As I am not yet out of my other moisturizer I have not tried this yet.  I hope I like it as it is a lot less expensive than my previous moisturizer
B000052YP4|5|I have used this product for many years & have found it perfect for my skin type & to be priced fairly, far below comparable creams to be found in department store brand conscious names . Most cream manufacturers put strong smelling perfumes in their products & I prefer this cream which has no fragrance & does not feel heavy or greasy on my skin.  I will be 70 next week & am told constantly that my skin is beautiful, so I feel I am a good advertisement for Neutorgena.
B00DIMJZ4O|5|Outstanding!  Anyone not taking this should be....great invest toward a healthier life.
B003GCA4TQ|2|I was looking forward to buying this make-up mirror because it claims to have a bulb that never goes out.  However, the mirror itself barely adjusts, so I had to stand at an angle to put on my makeup.  In the end, it found a home in the back of my closet and I purchased a different mirror.  Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B00EZM9ESS|5|Good variation included in the case, fast shipping, will use again.
B0019MT7SY|5|I love this sunscreen for my baby.  I tried regular baby sunblocks and they all gave her chemical burns.  The pediatrician recommended zinc-based sunscreen, so this is what I bought.  It works so well that my baby doesn't even have a tan and we live in Alabama where it is hot and sunny most of the time.  I put this sunscreen on her before I get her dressed in the morning and we spend lots of time outside without worrying about sunburn.  I have had sunburn this summer and now have a nice tan, but my 8 month old is still pasty white.
B000I5KCIW|5|Very good product. Highly recommend!
B002HIMXCQ|1|In my opinion, this product is way overpriced.  I feel like the price was &#34;robbery.&#34;  I later found that I can order this online for prices ranging from $7.99 to $8.99 for the 8 ounce bottle.  I will never buy this again through Amazon.  If you type &#34;organic root stimulator carrot oil&#34; on the internet - there are much better options.  What a Shame!!!
B005FO1S0W|3|It works but not as dramatic as some of the other reviews  betrayed.
B007O7AZBG|5|After seeing a lot of makeup gurus on YouTube use this brush (well, all the Real Techniques brushes), I was sold on the fact that they seemed to work so well on camera and the affordable prices. I've been using this brush for well over a month, and I couldn't be happier. This works beautifully with my liquid foundation as well as powders like blush or bronzer. The bristles are so soft, but firmly packed together. I've washed these quite a few times already and there is no shedding of hairs or any other problems. I highly recommend this product.
B000C1Z1JM|2|Bought this from &#34;Amazon.com LLC&#34;<br />Unfortunately, i was displeased by this product.<br />I had originally used a sample of this perfume, found as a promotion sample in a magazine. I liked it and that's why i ordered one.<br />But when  the full product arrived, it was as if it didn't smell like the sample i had previously used. It was like a totally different smell, which i didn't like.<br />I will be very careful in the future, when ordering perfumes again!
B00T12C754|5|The argan oil works well for what my wife uses it for. She mixes it with an essential oil that she enjoys smelling, then applies it lightly to her face, she is fair-skinned and has a hard time finding something that does not make her break out. This works better than the $30 products that beauty places charge for. This works better and has none of the other harsh chemicals. This product works,cheaper, healthier, and readily available. What is not to like? Also this does not leaver her oily after use, it leaves her skin moisturized and does not dry her out.
B005NWZV5Y|5|Great treatment!!! It really helped me restore my hair to a healthy state. It doesn't have any harmful chemicals so it worked great on treating my hair. I continue to use it and every time I can see a better change in m hair!! :) Im really happy with this treatment. I recommend it 100%!!!
B007R4ONS2|5|Great product. Great company. I originally posted a negative review about this product & the company contacted me to see what they could do to make me happy. They sent a new spatula, which works much better than the dud I received first, plus a gift! The new spatula works as advertised and the free gift more than makes up for the initial aggravation. I would definitely recommend this product  and order from this company again!
B009WCLNZI|3|You get what you pay for here.  It is a basic set of manicure tools.  There is nothing super special and the nail clippers scare me.  They could take off a finger!!  The other tools are nice but I did also wash everything before I used it just to be safe.
B00IERDN6O|5|Mother's Day gift for my fashion conscious elderly mom.  Her feet are gnarled from wearing poor fitting shoes for years, but these slippers are both comfortable and stylish!  Oh and one more thing - the slight treads make her steps a bit more secure.  (Please don't just think these are 'old lady slippers', I have a pair as well!)
B0014P8L9W|5|I purchased this clay due to the fact, that I had a possible infection after a stingray hit in to my left foot. I was afraid of infection and since I do not take antibiotics ( because I do not believe in their function) I was told to make a paste and put it on the wound. I could feel slight pulling and I never really had any infection, just slight swelling, which is a normal reaction to a trauma.<br />Many people use it as a facial, which I believe works, but never tried it; no reason so far.<br />I believe in nature's healing power and this is another product that belongs to that category.
B00CBLHT82|2|This was not exactly the look I was going for. It made my hair straw-like. Probably would have worked better if my hair was a bit shorter
B0009OAHRI|4|Loved it big bottle great price wonderful smell
B001JJBC9Y|1|Just under a year ago my last hair clippers broke, so I looked around for a more durable alternative (the other set lasted about two years). I think I cut my hair all of four times with the Oster before the adjustable blade handle started becoming a little loose, but it was still useable. Well, it is no longer so. After the handle became looser over the last few months I finally decided to try and tighten the screw that holds the handle on the clipper. Well, that pretty much ended it. The handle now sways in the wind; the \\"adjustable\\" blade is now stationary. While the clippers still work, the idea that a \\"professional grade\\" machine would become dysfunctional after one person used it once a month for a year is pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />I selected this product because of what I'd read online, and the reviews. Hopefully my review will get some folks to reconsider and buy another item instead. I will not be buying Oster products in the future.
B004FEBHWC|1|My legs never did get bronzed.  Tanned up to 12 min each time three times a week to get ready for my cruise.
B004P00GRS|4|Good stuff!
B005TU1M8K|4|My stylist used this product on my hair recently. It allows me to style my hair without all its natural waves. I can't decide if I like that style for me, but this product definitely does what it says and leaves your hair soft!
B00120PDN6|4|I love Juice Organics Light Tint Moisturizer with SPF 30! My skin is very sensitive - many facial products, makeup, shampoos, conditioners, laundry detergents, etc. instigate nasty breakouts so I don't use much on my face. Also, to prevent wrinkles (and worse) I always protect myself from the sun. This product gives me just the right amount of daily moisture, sun protection, and tone evening. I like that the tint is very minimal. The first time I put it on I thought it was too oily and too light-colored. But after a minute or two I realized it was neither. Once it's on, it somehow mellows out and blends into my skin. My skin color looks more even without looking like I'm wearing makeup. It gives just a slight bit of \\"shimmer\\" for a few hours, but not in a greasy or glittery way. And best of all - no breakouts! It's not heavy enough to cover blemishes or dark under-eye circles. For those I still need a concealer. And if I'm at the beach, I use a stronger SPF. I use this product alone on low-maintenance days and/or under my powder mineral makeup. Once in a while, the little gray piece on the bottom of the bottle must be popped off and the air pushed out from the bottom, then it pumps better. I've been using this product for well over a year now with no problems.<br /><br />The product itself deserves a 5 star rating. However two (minor) things cause me to rate it at 4 stars: 1) I've ordered several bottles and only one of them has arrived with the plastic cap unbroken. Sometimes it's cracked and can taped, but a few have been too smashed to save. 2) I'd prefer that it came in a recyclable tube so I can cut the end off, get every last bit out, and then recycle it. (And speaking of recycling, they may as well eliminating the box too.)<br /><br />All in all, it's a great product. I hope Juice Organics continues to make this Light Tint Moisturizer.
B000ZN3D4C|3|The dental guard ist what it´s made it for.. the biggest con is to get comfortable with  the guard by sleeping..
B000UWAWQU|5|I specifically bought this to use for travel. While it is larger than I had hoped, the Waterpik Ultra puts out a powerful stream of water comperable to the full size counter top waterpiks. And that stream is adjustable to suit your comfort level. Mine came with severl tips, but I tend to use only one. It is easily refilled if it runs out of water, so feel free to take as long as you like. I travel with the charger also, so I simply plug it in at night every couple of days and I am good to go the next day. I did not get the travel bag that I have seen on other sites. I believe this would be nice to have, but I just carry it in a zip-lock bag.
B0095SIKOQ|5|I have been using Medi dan for twenty years and it is still working for me.Nothing els does the work as well.
B001CT053U|5|He smell so good.......i could jus eat him up and i like boobs so its like a win win for me
B001063NY8|3|The bottle did not come with an eyedropper for application. The first time I used it I tried to pour a little into my hand but ended up with too much. I ended up transferring this to another bottle that had an eyedropper.
B009T09EMC|5|These are absolutely beautiful. I will save these for a special occasion and I recommend these to anyone who wants to dress up their nails!
B005SWRTP4|5|I have been using this product for over 30 years, and it is still the best around.  Not sold locally, so very glad to be able to order on amazon.
B00J9SSDIA|4|The case is super easy to take on and off. The jelly feel is great for absorbing bumps and the accidental drop. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the case is transparent, which I didn't  expect. Fortunately I own a white S5, so the color of the blue case I chose does show. I wouldn't buy this case for a black phone.
B00B2HIMD2|5|I use this soap and lotion for my pwder room. They smell so wonderful and summery in our cold winters!
B002T5ES0M|4|the pad is soft and thick enough to be used for eyes
B00GJSSYEQ|4|Shipping was very fast. I ordered Friday it was delivered Tuesday. I was kind of scared because I heard lots of vendors on here sell fake babyliss flat irons but it's real. Works great. Although when I opened it there was a noticeable knick next to the dial as if it's been dropped or used before. But it still works great. I love everything else in the trunk. Great gift idea or if you do your own hair all the basics are in here!
B001GKX9VU|5|Where aloe vera and other lotions fail, this is the only product to use. A little expensive, but the relief it provides from a sunburn is incredible.
B0026J10CU|5|This was my very first Shany product and I absolutely fell in love with this palette!  The colors are so pigmented and so buttery. It has so many color varieties and finishes. I love the fact that the price is so affordable as well. Good quality stuff Shany!!
B006QO4BRM|5|Great product awesome deal.. and my nails are awesome
B004NH2YQ4|1|Just bring a toothbrush where you're going, you guys. They even make those mini ones that fold in half. Use that if you're traveling. Bring gum or a certs if you're thinking of these as a breath freshener. I'm surprised by the number of good reviews here - I can't make my mouth feel clean with one of these, the bristles are tiny and rough and dumb. The center is weird and not a replacement for toothpaste.
B007X0VBGC|2|I bought this based on the excellent reviews but personally I do not like it very much after several months of use.  The body wash is a bit too jelly like and not sticky enough, so when it is squeezed out from the bottle, it tends to drop to the floor and gets wasted.  I also do not like the squeeze bottle, a hand pump type container is much more convenient to use.  Furthermore, there is a substantial amount of soap scum build-up after each use.  I just finished it and found something much better.
B000Q39MFK|5|love summer hill and summer rain by crabtree & evelyn
B00AC2OKMK|5|Old Spice is most definitely a classic gift for my Dad.  I am sure that any father, or guy for that matter, from the baby boomer generation will appreciate the gift of Old Spice cologne.  While the bottle is now plastic instead of ceramic, the bold scent of Old Spice will surely be appreciated by any man!
B000PY17PI|5|This product is excellent it works exactly as is discribed and planed for. I am very happy with my purchase.
B000WZP4OK|5|Good price, the genuine article, no problems noted.
B004DAP4JA|5|I love this product. It has improved my skin noticeably in 2 short weeks.Friends and family comment on the youthfulness of my complexion. I have tried many products but this has proven to be the best yet!!
B003XK591O|5|Love this shampoo! No buildup
B002RJUPS4|5|Shipping was super fast like 5 days.  I tried it on as soon as I opened it and it was super red the best shade red ive seen ever, it didnt get on my teeth, then i went to wipe it off and it wouldnt come off it didnt even come off when I washed my face, so id say very long wear!!!!   Im in love   I WILL be ordering more Lime Crime!
B002RT71XG|1|I like the old formula and I paid extra hoping to get the silver product pictured. The torquise bottle was received.it does not Work nearly as well and I am disappointed with the product and the seller.
B00I32AN4K|5|This mask makes my hair incredible.  I also put it in my curly headed daughters hair.  Normally she has very Frizzy hair and now she has wonderful, beautiful curls and everyone thinks she used a curling iron.
B00026ITJ6|5|My nails are fine, weak, and thin. Given any opportunity at all, they'll catch, chip, peel, or break;  and the cuticles are no better.  Probably doesn't help that I use my hands freely, and refuse to baby my nails.   As lousy as they may look, unless chipped or chewed down completely, Carmichael's will make both nails and cuticles look manicured and tidy.  I can even rub Carmichael's Cuticle Cream into my nails and cuticles when I'm on the way to a meeting or luncheon, and my nails will look polished and ladylike when I get there-- no hint of the yardwork, carpentry, and kitchen cleanup I've actually been doing.  There's no icky perfume here, which is important for me.  And if I forget and leave the jar in the car on a hot day, the cream will melt down;  but I can just leave it to cool in the jar, and it's fine again.  In short:  This product is a godsend for those of whose who want to look polished and grown-up when we go out, but still use our hands for all kinds of things around the house, and even under the hood of the car.  The little jars last for a long time, which makes it even better.
B00J4R760C|5|My hair feels so silky after using this!!  And people are noticing which is the biggest tell-tale sign it's actually making an improvement.  I have keratin treated hair and I swim a lot -- so this mask has been a godsend.
B003XKY57S|3|I have moderately oily, acne-prone skin that gets very dry around the eyes and mouth and is prone to dehydration in the drier winter months. (Right now, you're wondering, why use oils at all? They're great for keeping the skintone taut, dewy and even, and the right ones won't break you out.) Have been using Silkia Camellia Oil all over the face at night (topped with acne treatments and eye creams) and using the Josie Maran Argan Oil dropper for touch-ups during the drier days. The JM was pretty good, but since I had the small dropper, I never really used that all over the face. Thought I'd try this product, and it's fine, but the camellia oil is definitely better. This product has a thinner, water-like consistency--almost falls out of the dropper. Goes on easily, but I don't think it sinks in or gives as long-lasting moisture as the camellia oil, which I'll go back to after this is finished (or sooner, if the winter forces my hand)!
B00DT70V9G|5|Good product no problems
B000052YQN|3|Well, this product works, but the ingredients are questionable. If anyone else is looking for another product, Jergens makes a face cream with the same basic ingredients without some of the chemicals.
B007JWZL3I|4|This is perfect for between coloring touchups - it's fast & effective - I always like to have one handy.
B001C7MEKO|5|Gf was happy. Didnt know what i was doing but glad i chose these hurrr.
B006Z5K3FG|5|I absolutely love my makeup!  Excellent quality and the shipping was super fast!
B00JZFB13G|5|Great
B003689HHK|2|They cut fine, but heat up way to fast, they are also too loud and sounds as if there is something loose inside. Delivery was ok though
B0043OYFKU|5|I purchased two of these - one for my son who has acne trouble, and one for myself, hoping it would be a fast way to wash my face in the shower. It is wonderful!  I have used it for a week now, and am already seeing improvement in my skin texture, coloring and overall appearance. For the price - it can't be beat!  my son is also having great success with keeping his acne at bay.  He doesn't like to spend time washing his face, but he WILL take this into the shower and use it.
B00KYF03BM|5|Very nice blender!  It is a very high quality.  Arrived on time, no problems.  Love it!
B004WKBRSS|5|I feel very good about there entire product line the gels  have a good amount in them and afterwards your skin looks refreshed.
B0092BWWG8|4|These were a lot of fun at my daughter's 'Disco Diva Dance Party'.
B009NNFB0O|2|It did marginally soften up my beard, but it has an overwhelming smell of licorice to it which I suppose isn't so bad if you like that smell, but I'm not really a fan.
B004TSFE28|5|I looooove this set for the following reasons:<br />- synthetic feels \\"softer\\" than real bristles<br />- bristles do not absorb makeup<br />- no bacteria<br />- unbelievable and streak free application<br />- less prone to breakage<br />- easy to clean<br /><br />I wish that ...<br />- the Base Shadow Brush and Deluxe Crease Brush were smaller so that I can get a more precise application<br />- this was sold without the case, I don't use it. Perhaps that would lower the price :)
B003HVCUAC|5|This is awesome product.  I use it with the Silicon Mix Treatment.  I use about a couple of scoops for each product (mix) and apply & rinse after 30 min or longer.  I don't use it as a leave-in.  Hair is super soft.  My hair type is 4a/b/c.  Highly recommend as conditioner for the hair.
B00KLA4INE|5|Exactly what I expected. Will take a while to see if it really works.
B001UIQ2QC|5|I have used this product for years and was surprised to see it on Amazon.  I blow dry my hair first and then just work a little into my hands and work it into my hair.  it gives a nice lift to my hairstyle.
B001MP0QLK|4|It's so hard to find a cordless straightener, and most of them use butane and don't work well.  I like this one because it is not only battery powered, but you can charge it in your car.  I bought this one three years ago and when I gave it to a friend, I bought a second one because I couldn't part without it.  Between the two batteries it comes with I can get a full hour on high heat.  The heat is also pretty evenly distributed and constant, unlike butane straighteners.  While this straightener is not really meant for doing a full complete hairstyle, it is fantastic for touch ups and weird kinks you may get in your hair during a camping trip.
B00FH692PQ|5|This product is very good, after several weeks' use , my hair got much thicker, and lost much less hair.
B003K8N1GY|5|It's nice to have a way to tell if you should reapply sunscreen or get out of the sun on a cloudy/sunny day.
B00092M2VO|5|I had an Andis hair dryer before and this one is just as good if not better than the last one I owned.  It has some weight to it but it makes it feel much sturdier than most of the plastic ones.  Plus it looks much more expensive than it really was.
B00112BS7K|5|very nice foundation for price.
B00886CPZG|5|Great water based face paint.  Really high pigment.
B000KHMPOW|5|I use it on my face and chest and legs. Just a small amount on the capillaries.  It seems to be helping to diminish the redness and soon will help to totally eliminate the capillaries.
B009B7UZTO|1|when they changed their formula, they lost me as a customer.
B00EPPZXRG|5|This deodorant works! This tiny tube lasts me for over 4 months. I only use 2-3 swipes on each armpit once a day, that's all you need, unless I go to the gym, then I use it before the gym too. Still lasts me for over 4 months.<br /><br />I have never gotten a rash from using this one. For me it has helped with razor burn actually. I have used another baking soda based, natural deodorant and that gave me a rash, but this one doesn't. I think the oils in the Pure Pitz one help prevent that. But some will still be sensitive I guess.
B002TSA916|5|I bought this for my husband because of his dry skin as recommended by my dermatologist.  He now loves it.
B001ZS655U|5|ok
B00D2GT02S|4|Nice product
B000127WHG|5|Wonderful, and very complimentary with Camile Beckman French Vanilla eau de perfum. Nice for everyday or those special occasions.
