B000005L86|5.0|This cd does need to be listened to loud for the full effect. Don't worry...it is plenty good played quietly too. You can really hear Lee Perry's affect on the sound here. He has a way of creating a sound which surrounds and envelopes you in a hypnotic way. Adding to that the melodic vocals of the Congos...a gift to roots reggae. I highly recommend this to everyone who claims to be a hardcore roots fan. You can't be one fully without this in your collection!
B000002L5I|5.0|Trouble Is starts the jam with a KWS original called called &quot;Slow Ride&quot; however this CD is anything but slow. Shepherd's lyrics and masterful guitarwork combined with Noah Hunt's powerfully articulate vocals deliver a passionately energetic blend of southern tinged rock and blues. Originals such as Slow Ride, Somehow Somewhere Someway, I Found Love and the popular Blue on Black prove the Shepherd/Hunt combination works extremely well. Also included are versions of Hendrix's &quot;I Don't Live Today&quot; and an excellent version of Dylan's &quot;Everything is Broken&quot;.<br />My other favorites are &quot;Long Gone&quot; (which is reminiscent ofearly Rolling Stonesblended  with the blues of Stevie Ray Vaughn), King's Highway and a well crafted ballad called I Found Love When I Found You.
B00000IJPU|3.0|This is an extremely difficult album to rate. The music on it is many of Iron Miaden'ts best tracks, which alone make for some outstanding metal. While not technically as proficient or fast as say Metallica, as a group, Maiden is arguably the most FUN metal band to listen to, the one I keep playing while my Metallica CDs get far more limited play.<br />So, on the one hand, you have a 5 star band playing 5 star music. So, why only 3 stars for the album? One word, and it's been said before. Slection. There is no way a group like Maiden can pack all their hits into 1 CD, and this one runs a whopping 78 minutes (a CD maxes out at 80). Still, though, one feels like it's not a good cross section. There are the songs that HAVE to be there, Aces High, Run to the Hills,The Trooper, Hallowed be Thy Name, Running Free (albeit a live version with Bruce rather than the Di'Anno roiginal), and 2 Minutes to Midnight. You can't do a Maiden &quot;Best of&quot; without those. At that point, however, questions arise. While commercially popular, Can I play with Madness and Bring Your Daughter (the Iron Maiden version, the Bruce solo version rocks) weren't that great. On the one hand, they were both &quot;hits,&quot; but in a catalog like Maiden's they weren't up to par. Fear of the Dark is the highlight of its album, and probably deserves its spot, especialy the live version here, it's really good. Virus, as has been mentioned, is another big question. It's cool getting a new song (and an excuse to get Maiden fans who otherwise have every song on this CD to buy it), but it's nothing special. Man on the Edge is a far better Blayze track. Clairvoyant and Evil That Men Do are both good songs (I like Clairvoyant especially a lot), but again, Best Of? Same with Be Quick or Be Dead.<br />Then there's the overall feel of the album. It never slows down. It feels like Maiden is totally one dimensional, just variations on power metal, steady, punding beat that never lets up. Where's ballads likeRevelations or Children of the Damned? Where is the most complex, almost symphonic song Maiden ever did, Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner? Most importantly, where is Iron Maiden, their banner song?<br />Best OF is certainly personal preference, but if I had been in charge of this albu, Virus could have waited for Virtual Xi (which it's not on), in its place would have gone Phantom of the Opera (either Di'Anno's version or the one from Live After Deathm they're both incredible). Clairvoyant, Evil, and Be Quick would have made room for Rhyme. And Can I Play and Bring your Daughter would have to step aside for Revelations. And Iron Maiden would have to be put in somewhere. That is overall more representative of Maiden as a group, but still covers them from beginning to end.<br />In all honesty, though, 1 CD is simply not enough. You could easily stuff a second CD as well. Murders in the Rue Morgue, Heaven Can Wait, Powerslave, Die With Your Boots On, Sea of Madness, maybe 7th Son of a 7th Son (you want to see Maiden complex and all over the place), Mooncild, a 2nd CD would be very easy to fill up indeed.<br />However, don't get me wrong here. I take issue with some of the tracks here as best, not as good. For someone who is just getting into Maiden, get this and Live After Death, that should cover most of the bases early on. However, don't do this if you're on a budget, because you won't stop there. As an intro to Maiden, this works, and it certainly still hits most of the high spots, but it could have been better. Given that we're talking about Iron Maiden here, as a best of album, this just falls short of what their best truly is.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I think in order to say you have a complete set of DVDs  you have to own this collection.Some people want to buy just the first two parts, i think they should have them all as one set . They are connected in a time line and in a sequence of events that is developed  during it . Another resone to own this set is the extra elements that you will get on the fifth DVD . However, this collection need another DVD ( sixth one) to acommedate more documentaries on the movies, more on the great sondtrack, interviews with the stars of the movie (Brando, Al pacino, Denaro).They should talk about their roles in the movies.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Despite being hammered by critics this was not a bad movie.  There were some really cool effects that make the movie worth watching.  The whole love story is a bit or a reach but let's remember this is not reality we are dealing with.  I loved Kate Beckinsale and hope that she doesn't suffer the same career turn that Kate Winslet did after &quot;Titanic&quot;.
B000002H4Q|5.0|The Cure are a wonderfully creative (if a touch dramatic) band, and their music has remained with me through adolescence into adulthood (forgive me if wrongly spelled words abound in my review).  I would like to find a way to petition Elektra Records for the following: please release remastered versions of EACH and EVERY Cure LP.  While 'Galore' and the upcoming 'Greatest Hits' offer remastered singles, I personally feel that this band has created several masterpiece-level full-lengths ('Kiss Me' among them)that truly deserve the digital-remastering treatment.<br />Also, and I know I'm not alone here, would someone at Elektra please seriously commit to releasing a collection of Cure B-sides?  For new Cure fans who may be unaware, let me tell you: Cure B-sides rank nigh equal in quality to album tracks, and some of them are actually SUPERIOR to those on the LP's (\\"This Twilight Garden,\\" a 'Wish' outtake, is a prime example).<br />I'm sorry this \\"review\\" turned into a rant, but if there are other Cure fans out there who are craving remastered albums and a B-side compilation, email me.  Let's see if we can put some pressure on Elektra!

6303168507|5.0|This movie without a doubt should be in the top 100 movies of all time. This movie shows Oskar Schindler.  A profitter (I know by spelling is bad) of slave labor, a womanizer, and a member of the Nazi Party during the holocaust.  But this story always shows how this man along with Itzak Stern, (played by Ben Kingsley) saved the lives of over 1,100 jews.  Liam Neeson gives one of his best acting roles playing schindler and the movie shows the tragedys of one of the darkest chapters in history.  This movie deserves 10 stars at least.
0380729407|5.0|&quot;By the Pricking of my Thumbs, Something Wicked This Way comes.&quot;  This Shakespearean couplet sums up one of Ray Bradbury's literary masterpieces in only two lines.  Ray Bradbury is a dream worker as he writes a destined classic about one of the oldest force; good versus bad, right versus wrong.  His book, Something Wicked This Way Comes, is compelling and entertaining, but more importantly leaves a lasting impact on the reader.  This book is about two young boys and ones father in a war against the Autumn people, Dark and the freaks and their carnival and mirror maze, and carousel.  I will never go on another Carousel as long as I live.
076783819X|4.0|I know that most reviews here talk about the ending to this movie but it can't be denied. I was surprised by it.  The movie even though it has great performances by Bridges and Robins, Bridges character makes to many assumptions at parts. The movie is slow to start(except the first couple of minutes) but once it gets going it doesn't stop until the ending.  I did like the movie a lot but I would recomend renting the movie first so you can judge for yourself.
B00000AFDW|4.0|In 1998, following the most successful reunion tour in history, KISS released &quot;Psycho Circus&quot;, the first new recording from the band's original lineup (Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, long exiled drummer Peter Criss and guitarist Ace Frehley) since 1979's &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Being a longtime fan of the original lineup,I still had my reservations on whether the reunited KISS could shake off the cobwebs and make a record that rivals their better efforts of the mid 70's (&quot;Destroyer&quot;, &quot;Love Gun&quot;). Would a clean-and-sober KISS still have the magic touch? The answer is a resounding YES. In the depressing, gloom filled alternative rock era that was the 90's, KISS made a record that was catchy, fun, and remarkably strong. The title track is perhaps the best song the band has ever put together, with a wicked Def Leppard late 80's style guitar crunch. In fact, Ace Frehley's guitar work has never been so appealing than here. On tracks like &quot;Into The Void&quot;(on which Frehley also sings lead) and &quot;You Wanted The Best&quot;, his work is outstanding. It should also be noted that Gene Simmons' vocals are stronger and better than they were 25 years ago. He sings lead on &quot;We Are One&quot;, which could easily serve as an anthem in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Surprisingly, there is no sexually-oriented material on this record, which shows the band's maturity, especially since every member of KISS is over or near 50 at this point. Peter Criss, the oldest member of the band(who subsequently left the Farewell Tour in 2001 due to a financial dispute) keeps up pretty well on the drums, although his vocal work is raspy.&quot;I Finally Found My Way&quot; is a near copy of KISS' biggest hit, &quot;Beth&quot;, and Criss can't seem to muster up the high notes anymore, so the song is a bit flat. It would have been better performed by Paul Stanley, who still can hit the high notes.For the hardcore KISS fan, &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; is a must- a great way for the band to close it's long career. For anyone just becoming interested in KISS and wanting to hear one of their best collections of material, look no further, because &quot;Psycho Circus &quot; certainly is one of them.
B00003CXCK|5.0|I can understand the complaints of people who feel that the movie loses importance because certain events depicted in it were fictionalized.  But I don't argee with them.  Now, some of what's in there IS untrue, that's for sure.  Oskar Schindler was a greedy man to the end, according to his wife.  He didn't weep when he had to flee the factory at the end.  But still, the picture is one of the most powerful I have ever seen.  Unflinching in it's portrayal of the inhuman crimes committed by the Nazis, it's also quite uplifting, giving us the messange that human decency can still prevail in the most awful of situations.  And the last scene, in which the real-life people who were effected by the events shown in the movie pay tribute to Schindler's memory, is the most appropriate anyone could possibly have used.  It reminds us once and for all that what we've been watching for the past 3 hours was not pure fiction.  Or a partly true-life story exploited simply for it's moral message.  It actually HAPPENED.  Those are real people we've been watching on the screen, not just &quot;movie characters&quot;.  Even if a few events were changed to suit the film, it remains a moving memorial to the 6 million victims of the Holocaust.<br />Some of the other reviews posted here I find to be rather baffling.  I'm referring in particular to one that should appear about four below this one, entitled &quot;What's wrong with Spielberg?&quot;.  The reviewer asks something like, &quot;Why did Spielberg make this movie?&quot;  Well, why shouldn't Spielberg have made this movie!?  Given the enormous scope Holocaust, there should be MORE movies made on the subject.  More films like this one -- movies that explore how such an awful situation could possibly have come about, movies that tell the true stories of people who suffered unjustly under Hilter's regime.  So it's an important historical document, no matter how you look at it.  I don't think that the movie is unfair to the Germans, because the atrocities that are shown in it are all true.  And fascism is not, I repeat NOT, &quot;long obsolete&quot;.  It still exists in the world today in Iran, Afghanistan etc.  So the movie is also a warning, in the form of a reminder.<br />(Also, in the Omaha Beach sequence of Saving Private Ryan, the Germans who were being &quot;wasted&quot; were not defending &quot;their&quot; land.  They were defending their position in France -- land they STOLE.  So I think it's fair that the movie takes the side of the Americans.)<br />As I have already said, the movie is an important historical document, and it's a movie that everyone should see at least once.
B000002NHN|5.0|enough said.  buy the album.  a beautiful blend of cultures by a musician still firmly rooted in the celtic tradition.
B00000JHAU|5.0|I am still getting acquainted with Belle and Sebastian's music. I already own &quot;Tigermilk&quot;, &quot;Fold Your Hands...&quot;, and the &quot;Sing, Jonathan David&quot; ep. &quot;If You're Feeling Sinister&quot; was definitely going to be my next Belle and Sebastian purchase. Unlike &quot;Fold Your Hands Child, Walk Like a Peasant&quot;, &quot;If You're Feeling Sinister&quot; is flawless. I consider this album the band's most definitive album. Even &quot;Tigermilk&quot; had one or two flaws but remained a classic in my book while &quot;Fold Your Hands...&quot; was spotty and inconsistent. I particularly loved &quot;Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying&quot;. I found myself replaying that song a couple of times before finishing the rest of the cd. The melodies are just awesome and incomparable. There really isn't another band that can write a pop song like B&amp;S today. There wasn't one song on this album that I didn't like.
B00004XQ83|5.0|you can't help but sang along to these folk catchy tunes.<BR>a must have for any library<br />&quot;we thought you was a toad!&quot;
B000000OTU|4.0|This album is great as far as greatest hits albums go. I only gave it 4 stars because they could have done a better job of selcting tracks. There are songs more worthy of being on this album than ones that were chosen. One of my favorite songs on this CD is Eat The Rich. I love the guitar/bass intro. If you get this album along with the Aerosmith Greatest Hits album released on Columbia then you will have a good start on Aerosmith.
B000001DQG|4.0|Clearly exhausted from the grind of turning out multiple albums within a short time span, Caribou doesn't catch Elton at his best. It does have a number of gems sprinkled throughout the album but more than its fair share of filler. Still, what filler! Even the weakest material is still fairly catchy and memorable.<br /><br />The opening track channels The Rolling Stones at their best while still sounding uniquely like Elton-\\"The Bitch is Back\\" and its companion rocker \\"Pinky\\" along with the story song \\"Dixie Lily\\" with it's New Orleans vibe promise more than the album can deliver but by the concluding the track the stunning portrait of of a trouble youth \\"Ticking\\" more than makes up for the filler on the album. The truth is that Elton's filler was better than most albums. The albums that followed  \\"Blue Moves\\" and \\"Rock of the Westies\\" had their moments had their moments as well although they seemed more like an echo of the greatness that had come before.<br /><br />The big hit--\\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\"--was an example of a strong power ballad. The ironic thing is that Elton hated \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" when he first completed it yet it managed to become one of his signature tunes. The top flight production of Gus Dudgeon and arrangements manage to salvage most of the weak tunes. Yes, \\"Solar Prestige\\" is gibberish (and was meant to poke fun at all those looking for illumination in Elton's work) but like the gibberish on the White Album it still manages to entertain.<br /><br />Carbiou was certainly a come down after the nearly flawless GYBR of the previous year. The garish cover says it all.
B000002JS6|5.0|This album is AC/DC getting up off the ground after being knocked down by Bon Scott's death, and standing taller than ever before. This is AC/DC's greatest album ever. It is amazing that the voice of the band could be replaced and they still achieved this masterpiece. This album contains not only two of the greatest AC/DC songs ever but two of the greatest rock songs ever, Back In Black and You Shook Me All Night Long. This album is a must in any rock fan's collection.
B00005N9CV|1.0|A travesty, and I like Krall quite a bit. Two tempos only, Jimmy Scott ballad and medium-slow bossa nova.  Arrangements completely vanilla, no originality whatsoever, and feature an overly-present guitar on most of them.  She just sings these great standards completely flat. No surprise that, considering her support.  Her producer, arranger, manager and she herself should be sentenced to a 3-year diet of Percy Faith.  Hey Klaus, she's Diana Krall, not Barbra Streisand!  You should refund your fee to her so she can get the small group going again and really showcase her talents.  To me, this album is a BIG disappointment.
B00005JKES|5.0|I do think the pilot should be included, but it came down to who has the rights to it.  I bought the pilot off of ebay.  Still, this box set is well worth the money.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|This self-titled album by the \\"Greatest Band on Earth\\" not only has some GREAT sounding tunes, but a LOAD of laughs too.  <BR>While a few of the D's best songs are missing from this album (Cosmic Shame, Sasquatch, Exploding Brains and Shells) I guess they have to save SOME stuff for the inevitable follow-up. As you may have read, this album is FULL of profanity, but, trust me, that only adds to the humor of this hilarious rock duo.  <BR>The songs are extremely well written and some are downright beautiful-which may seem surprising for a band that sings about sex, their roadie, mythalogical creatures, and how talented they are.  <BR>Do yourself a favor and buy this album...
0380788624|5.0|A book featuring cryptography, war, looted treasure, computer hacking, techno-geeks, jungle expeditions...what more could a boy want?<BR>This book is so full of rich detail, humor and even interesting characters that I didn't want it to end.  The author must have done an incredible amuont of research.  The pace never lags, with multiple story lines and subplots (which unbelievably ultimately tie together).<BR>There are few authors whose books I would immediately read when released without regard to subject matter or reviews.  After Cryptonomicon, Neal Stephenson is on that list.  I'm waiting for his next one.

It is actually a little big for him but the pictures are wonderful and the story really keeps him captivated!The storyline is funny and my little guy just giggles every time we read it. This is a book I will hold onto for years and pull out every Halloween! I have already recommended it to a few friends.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie and Final Fantasy I think were the two best movies this summer.  Both of them have amazing CGI animation, but the twisted humour in this one was absolutely enjoyable.<br />There is a little bit of mild language in the film, and a lot of the humour I don't think is recommended for any children under the age of ten, however, they still may enjoy the movie.<br />One of the things that makes this movie great has to be Eddie Murphy.  If you have a character that's completely comical, then he's the one to get.  Not to mention he does a dang good job of it, too.<br />It's a twisted fairy tale with plenty of added humour, and personally, I urge everyone to at least rent it.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride has the ability to be one of the few singers who can easily bounce between the fast songs, such as I Love You, and the ballads, like A Broken Wing.  Blessed with one of the best voices in any genre of music, not just in the country music world, it almost seems like there isn't a song that she couldn't sing.  There are two songs on this collection that totally amazed me, There You Are, from the Emotion CD, has a lot of power in it, just from her vocal performance alone.  One of the new songs, Where Would You Be, displays one of the rawest shows of emotion from any song in recent years.  The only thing that overshadows the emotion of the song, is the vocal performance that Martina displays on this song.  It is truly her best song, both performance wise and emotionally.  There may be a lot of popular country singers, but no one else could put forth a performance to match Martina's.  A devoted fan, I couldn't wait for this CD to be released, and I wasn't dissappointed.  A great collection from a great singer, a CMA Female Vocalist, even.  It doesn't get much better.

B000002HRE|5.0|Metallica gone soft?  Sold out?  No, I don't think so.  ReLoad is another excellent Metallica album.  From the instant metal classic &quot;Fuel&quot; to the heavy-hitting &quot;Fixxxer&quot;, ReLoad shows that the 'Tallica boyz still know how to jam.  &quot;Devil's Dance&quot; is a loud and heavy song taken from the pages of &quot;Sad But True.&quot;  Metallica didn't sell out, they matured, expirimented and succeded.  This is apparent with &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; and &quot;Low Man's Lyric.&quot;  Just as &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; was a great song from the Black Album, &quot;The Unforgiven II&quot; follows in its footsteps with a heavier touch.  This album is a must for anyone's growing Metallica collection.

B00005NWRS|5.0|I have to admit, at first I wasn't overly impressed by &quot;Gold&quot; but after hearing Ryan sing these songs in concert and listening to the album more and more, I think it is incredible.  Many of the critics and reviewers are guilty of being unnecessarily harsh on young Ryan, setting expectations that are too difficult to meet, not to mention utterly impossible to exceed.  Give the guy a break--he's young and unbelievably sexy with a gift for writing honest and achingly beautiful songs, and he does this to near perfection on &quot;Gold&quot;. We have watched Ryan's song-writing, delivery, and presence mature from the days of Whiskeytown, and he is certainly getting stronger with each recording session. My only complaint is that I am not the lucky girl he wrote the album for.
0440236304|5.0|The most striking thing about this is Burgett's simple, laconic style:  This is not the work of a writer, but a soldier, and as such, he never imparts a political or moralist overtone.  This is simply what happened to him as he remembered it, the training and fighting and blood and humanity.  Burgett tells about Paratrooper school and its rigors, about being dropped behind enemy lines, and about plowing through hailstorms of bullets into what would be one of the hottest ground firefights in military history.  Thank the stars he survived, because writing like this is as hard to come by as it is historically valuable - a soldier's story, and a soldier who is unafraid to tell you what he remembers without interjecting opions about political affairs or larger morality.  Just 'I did this, it felt this way, and this what I saw'.  Absolutely astonishing.  This is by far one of the best supplements available to anyone studying the Second World war in Europe, much as Hersey's 'Hiroshima' is to anyone studying the Pacific campaign.  You will not learn about diplomacy or the reasoning of Generals here, but you will be on the ground in the firefight, astonished to get out of it in one piece.  The section on boot camp is also a welcome addition to the history of this most trajic war, as it is an aspect to American soldiering very often overlooked or underplayed.  All in all, a very readable, utterly compelling piece of history, unclouded by emotion or agenda, worth much more than the five or six dollars it sells for.  It is worth noting, however - and Ambrose makes mention of it in the introduction as well - that as a memoir there are certain pieces which Burgett assumes as a soldier from all the excitement on the ground which are more hearsay than not.  He reports seeing a dead Japanese in the fight, but as he did not know what Japanese uniforms looked like, he was probably saw the body of a Russian Mongol.  In some way, though, this adds to the authenticity of the account, as we are behind the eyes of an eighteen year old boy dropped into the middle of a bloodbath, there to save the world.  This is an important, valuable book.we are behind the eyes of an eighteen year old boy dropped into the middle of a bloodbath, there to save the world.  This is an important, valuable book.
0689504764|5.0|Great book the Kids really love.<br />A simple story of a family going on a bear hunt, going through difficult hikes (grass, winter storm, forrest, cave), finding the bear and then retreating AS FAST AS POSSIBLE! Good for the 2-5 age group.<br />Going on a Bear Hunt is more than a story.  It's a rhythmic chant that gets the kids involved in the story.  My mom taught this to my gang before we got the book.  They love sitting around in a circle making the &quot;swoosh, swoosh&quot; sound of going through the grass, the &quot;oooohhhhh, oooohhhhh&quot; sound of the winter storm, the &quot;squelch, squish&quot; sound of going through the mud.<br />A good one for reading aloud to a bunch of kids.

It took me a long time to see it, especially being told that it was about 3 hours long.  I bought the DVD and re-discovered why I love Pacino.  He paints a beautiful picture of Tony Montana, drug kingpin who gets in over his head.  With a beautiful wife, Elvira, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, this movie is perfect all the way to the bloody end. And even gave birth to the classic phrase,&quot; Say 'ello to my lil friend.&quot;  This movie is phenomenal!!
B00005LMBK|5.0|The first time I ever knew about the Gorillaz was when I was at home, watching MTV 2 and suddenly the music video for the single off the album entitled,&quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; came on.My first response was:&quot;Who the hell are these freaks?&quot; and so my reflex at first was to turn the channel to VH1 or CARTOON NETWORK or something, but for some reason,I felt like I couldn't turn. Like something was telling me &quot;DON'T BE SO MISJUDGING. SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER!&quot; So I sat there thinking I was in for one of those little sweetie pie Britney Spears type of videos but then suddenly the rap came on. and I started having a new opinion about them. right after it was over. I said to myself. &quot;Well I guess that was prettty good. So I started hearing it for a couple of months. and then one night I stayed up for a special edition of the Midnight Run on Cartoon Network:they were showing japanese animated music videos instead of japanese animated shows. and after the flow of the never before seen Daft Punk-Discovery and the Kenna video Hell Bent from his debut album  New Sacred Cow, 2 never before seen Gorillaz videos came on and they rocked the house! Get the gorillaz album or be the only one in the world without it!

6300182770|4.0|TV will rot your brain, some say- and in the world of Videodrome, that's exactly what happens. A group working with a media philosopher (a nice parody of Marshall McCluhan) has created a signal that can be superimposed on a video program that will, quite literally, mutate the brain. It may be a tumor- or it may be a new organ. It's infected cable TV president Max Venn (James Woods), and  is starting to change him and his world in bizarre ways.<br />Videodrome is a wonderfully original movie that mixes a well crafted script with some novel (for the time) special effects and a marvelous darkly comic sensibility. Puns abound; the president of &quot;Spectacular Optics&quot;- itself a pun- is named Convex. Brian Oblivion (the Marshall McCluhan parody) founded the &quot;Cathode Ray Mission&quot; (as in &quot;cathode ray emission&quot;), where the homeless and destitute are re-integrated into society by providing them with exposure to television.<br />Underneath this is a dark, sexual theme- Max's attraction to the images of bondage and sadism that are his undoing, and to radio psychologist Nikki (Debbie Harry, in a compelling if inartful performance) who is willing to go a lot farther than is Max in her pursuit of kinky thrills.<br />Is Max really being physically transformed, or is it all in his head? Is the New Flesh real, or another delusion? All in all, a compelling and original film that will delight any fan of cult films and erotic horror.
B00005AAFS|4.0|wow, it blew me away,having only heard &quot;sonne&quot; be for buying this album,i didnt know what to expect, but i wasnt dissapointed,with tracks like &quot;links 2 3 4 and &quot;ich will&quot; this album is a great addition to any rock collection
B00000IL1K|5.0|I bought this album in April/May of 2000 at a small store called Soundwaves in Houston.  I bought the CD primarily to help me relax, as I was getting tired of listening to Dido's album.  I found that popping in this disk, shutting down the lights and kicking on the scented candles allowed me to get through some very tense times.<br />Other CD's listened to that provided great vocals and good beats are Chicane - behind the sun and Dido's first release album.  For the record, I didn't even know who Brightman was when I bought the album.  I just liked the beats and thought her voice was great, just like Dido's.  Only the opposite was the truth!  I have bought other Brightman CD's and didn't care for them as they were too opera/classical for me.
1881273156|3.0|Others will probably find as much or more in Deborah Tannen's You Just Don't Understand or in the relationship and communication sections of Richard O'Connor's Undoing Depression. Both of these have been lifesavers in our couples therapy. Maybe four stars for those who are not put off by so much message.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this album well before the Eminem debut......Thinking about it, I bought it in March of 2000 at a small store called Soundwaves in Houston.<br />The point is, small stores find these gems way before the radio and mass media does.  I personally liked the beats and thought her voice was great.  I don't listen to the album much anymore as I have listened to it a zillion times and it is way overplayed on the radio.<br />However, I did listen to this CD to relax.  I found that popping in this disk, shutting down the lights and kicking on the scented candles allowed me to get through some very tense times.  Other CD's listened to that provided great vocals and good beats are Chicane - behind the sun and Sarah Brightman's Eden album.  For the record, I didn't even know who Brightman was when i bought the album.  I just liked the beats and thought her voice was great, just like Dido's.  Only the opposite was the truth!

B000000WHC|5.0|»Still Got The Blues« became a classic among blues albums. The songs cover all the possible tempi og straight forward blues, always dominated by Gary Moores inspiring guitar virtuosy.<br />In the beginning, »Texas Strut« was my favourite song. »As The Years Go Passing By« - probably the bluesiest song on the album - takes a lot more time to catch but ends up being a real favourite as well. Though in the end, the title track remains the masterpiece!<br />It doesn't really matter if you buy »Still Got The Blues« or the follow-up »After Hours«. They basicly sound the same. And this IS brilliant blues music!

B00005OWEG|5.0|If you are truly a fan of great films stop reading about this one and go see it! Coppolla's &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; is a real gem.<br />The basic story flows vividly yet mysteriously up the river into the dark jungle. Coppolla, as you may have heard, adapted the story from Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; with the exception that H.O.D. is set in the African jungle based on a journey that Conrad took into the Upper Congo, then controlled by Belgium as a colony, whereas A.N. is set in the jungles of southeast Asia during the height of the Vietnam war.<br />For Redux, Coppolla went back to the raw footage, or dailies, and re-edited the entire film from scratch. The added scenes enhance rather than detract from the film, I felt. The film is set during the Vietnam War, but it is more about the dark side of human nature, and also how those in power often try to twist and distort the truth to fit meet their own ends. Is there a &quot;method&quot; to Col. Kurtz's madness? See the film and decide for yourself. It is interesting to watch the profound transformation that Capt. Willard (Sheen's character) undergoes.<br />The big questions on your mind may be:<br />1. Did Coppolla considerably improve the film?<br />2. Did the 45+ extra minutes of film enhance the flow and thematic development of the film?<br />3. Are the special effects and battle scenes spectacular?<br />The answer to all three of these questions is a resounding YES!<br />(except perhaps for those closed-minded &quot;purists&quot; out there who vehemently object to ANY change from the original release.  To those of you whom fit this description, I remind you- Coppolla himself adapted the movie more closely to what HE originally envisioned, with FULL creative license- not with some big brother film exec looking over his shoulder and pressuring him to edit it in a certain way).<br />Overall improvements:<br />-the panoramic shots are more spectacular (of course this was my first time seeing it on the big screen so I'm sure that makes a difference)...<br />-some of the battle scenes are more realistic, allowing us to see the face of human suffering, not just the awe of exploding napalm bombs.<br />-the scenes at Kurtz's compound are more visually dazzling, and also a bit more shocking and graphic (some may feel this is gratuitous; but I believe Coppolla did that intentionally to communicate the devastation of man's violent nature, and the vicious cycle that we find ourselves in as a race).<br />Moral of the story:<br />Evil is rooted in lies; we all have a dark side to our human nature that we try hard to deny and keep in the shadows.<br />For more on this theme read Conrad's novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (a concise 130 some pgs) or delve into some of Carl Jung's writings about the shadow side of human nature.<br />Interesting tidbits:<br />-Mr. Clean, the teenage soldier on the gunboat was played by a 14 yr old Laurence &quot;Larry&quot; Fishburne.<br />-Much of the film was shot in the Philippines on location<br />-Coppolla had to personally mortgage virutally everything he owned to secure financing to complete the film which ran well over the studio budget.<br />-Coppolla makes a cameo appearance as a wartime journalist in the film<br />Apocalypse Now Redux is a cinematic masterpiece- well worth the journey upriver.t on the big screen so I'm sure that makes a difference)...<br />-some of the battle scenes are more realistic, allowing us to see the face of human suffering, not just the awe of exploding napalm bombs.<br />-the scenes at Kurtz's compound are more visually dazzling, and also a bit more shocking and graphic (some may feel this is gratuitous; but I believe Coppolla did that intentionally to communicate the devastation of man's violent nature, and the vicious cycle that we find ourselves in as a race).<br />Moral of the story: <br />Evil is rooted in lies; we all have a dark side to our human nature that we try hard to deny and keep in the shadows.<BR>For more on this theme read Conrad's novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (a concise 130 some pgs) or delve into some of Carl Jung's writings about the shadow side of human nature.<br />Interesting tidbits:<br />-Mr. Clean, the teenage soldier on the gunboat was played by a 14 yr old Laurence &quot;Larry&quot; Fishburne.<br />-Much of the film was shot in the Philippines on location<br />-Coppolla had to personally mortgage virutally everything he owned to secure financing to complete the film which ran well over the studio budget.<br />-Coppolla makes a cameo appearance as a wartime journalist in the film<br />Apocalypse Now Redux is a cinematic masterpiece- well worth the journey upriver.
0804106304|1.0|I thought this book will be very intruging. WELL IS STINKS.<br />1st, there were no main characters, which adds on to confusing.<br />2nd, it is so stereotyped! Here is just a bad example of a another stereotypical view of the Chinese. Buy this only to destroy it.

6305622930|3.0|Patton is a great movie.  The VHS and DVD copies do not have the entire movie however.  I have a copy of the entire movie that I taped off of TV.  On the DVD and VHS versions, the movie ends with Patton walking his dog towards the windmill.  They are cutting off about 30 minutes of the movie in these versions.  You are missing the following:<BR>1.  Patton rebuilding Germany<BR>2.  A birthday celebration with his wife<BR>3.  Patton sword fighting<BR>4.  How Patton treated captured Germans<BR>5.  The car accident<br />When I bought the DVD, I assumed that it had the entire movie as it is a 2 DVD set.  I was dismayed to find that the second DVD had some garbage about the musical score.
B000002952|5.0|I highly recommend this album.  The songs are gorgeous and her singing impeccable of course, but she's also backed by a group of *top-notch* musicians.  If this album were a woman, I would marry it.   So go buy it already!
0452282152|4.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring is a wonderful story painted by Ms Chevalier.  It is a page-turning story where a famous painting and its real-life Dutch artist is brought together with the fictional character Griet, who becomes the girl with a pearl earring.<BR>Little is known about who exactly Vermeer was painting when he brought to life what is affectionately known as the &quot;Dutch Mona Lisa&quot;, thus, Chevalier takes this wonderous opportunity to create a fictional story around how this painting came to life.<BR>Griet enter's the household as a maid in order to help her own family after her father is injured.  She slowly works her way up to becoming Vermeers assistant in the studio, and even adds her own artistic edge from time to time.  Envenually, her intimacey with the painter grows, and she learns more about herself in a short time in an artists studio, then she would have learned laundering the families' linens and running errands for years.<BR>A wonderful book--the last 100 pages of which you will not want to put down!
0792846338|5.0|This is my favorite movie!  Paul Sheldon (brilliantly played by James Caan) is in a horrible auto accident.  Annie Wilkes (even MORE brilliantly played by kathy Bates) &quot;saves&quot; him from dying.  Meanwhile, the rest of the world thinks he is dead.  Ironically, Annie is Pauls &quot;Number one Fan&quot;<br />Annie seems like the perfect nurse; cheerful, pleasant, great cook; until she finishes reading her newest Paul Sheldon book which kills of her favorite character, Misery Chastain.  Annie throws a rage, saying Paul is &quot;not good&quot;.  She then leaves.<BR>Annie is back the next day, cheerful as ever.<br />Kathy Bates deservedly won an oscar for her role as Annie Wilkes.  She goes from giggly happy woman to a monster in 0.0034 seconds.  She is one of the scariest figures thought up by Stephen King, the one who wrote the book the movie is based on.  This is scarier than other movies because it can really happen.  <br />I recommend this movie to anyone.  I love it.  It is full of suspense, horror, and twisted plot characteristics.  A great movie to watch!
B000003N7R|5.0|A very sophisticated complexity of Jazz medleys that are sure to intrigue and stimulate even the finely tuned Jazz ear. I actually began my foray into Jazz with this album and can honestly say that having used this work as a springboard into Jazz I feel it gave me a great appreciation of the musical style and more amazing than that I keep coming back to this album for its blend between the melodic and rhythmic, no matter how many more artists I listen to and appreciate. a powerful album from two heavy hitters in the Jazz world a must buy for the first time listener or for the honed jazz enthusiast looking to expand their collection its great for listening to with a loved one or having in the back round when friends are over
0792151712|4.0|A three-hour-and-fifteen-minute movie does not speak well to director James Cameron's intelligence. Not only did he spend two hundred million dollars on a film with a predictable ending (though you know that some producer suggested Arnold Schwarzenegger beat the crap out of the iceberg and save the day), but he made it so long that theaters can only show it three times a day instead of four. This significantly increases the chances Cameron will succumb to the &quot;curse of the water picture,&quot; lose money and have people call him an idiot.<BR>If they don't call him an idiot for his expenditure, they'll surely call him one for his writing. Obviously, Cameron was going to sink or swim with this project, but couldn't he have subsumed his world-class ego for one second and given the writing assignment to somebody with an imagination? His clever story features a poor boy, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), sneaking onto the Titanic, then falling in love with the aristocratic, soon-to-be-wed, Rose (Kate Winslet). Naturally, none of Rose's family or friends wants that to happen, so the clandestine couple spends the entire trip avoiding people. Pardon me, but was that plagiarized from &quot;Wings of the Dove&quot; or &quot;Out to Sea?&quot; <BR>Cameron had a titanium camera housing designed so he could film inside the actual wreckage of the Titanic, thereby necessitating an extraneous storyline involving a treasure hunter (Bill Paxton) poking around the wreckage. Cameron flashes back to the main story when Paxton finds the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), who has survived the disaster. If suspense were nickels, Cameron's epic would earn him little more than a hot, steaming cup of 1912 coffee. <br />This movie is long. I mean long like the Nile, long like a Bill Clinton speech, long like a trek across the Outback, long like John Holmes.
B000005DQR|5.0|By now the genius of Shadow (Josh Davis) has been realized but I am constantly running into people who have no knowledge of this mad scientist of the orchestrated beats, turntable, dj arts. Bottom line if your'e into scratching, can appreciate astounding musical genius or are looking to see what that so called DJ stuff is all about check out this joint Davis is the forerunner in this art and his style is a kaleidiscope of fusions from traditional styles of Jazz over to pink floydish melodies I am absolutely amazed every time I hear this masterpiece by Davis he was and still is the forerunner of this art. Check it out and listen at least five times before passing judgement it won't take long for you to appreciate exactly what is going on in this EP, and then tell your friends about it. Peace
B00004R99U|3.0|Obiously the story line of this direct to video DVD is not accurate historically. This is Disney and it was made for kids in mind. It is expected that Disney has made a fairy tale out of a historical figure to those of you have knocked both this video and the original Pocahontas for that reason. It is kind of like George Washington chopping down the cherry tree. So don't let that detour you from purchasing this video. Now that that is out of the way, for those of you that enjoy a fairly decent story line, this is a decent DVD. For those of you who like true Disney quality animation that you got with the original Pocahontas, you won't find it here. True, it is a sequel, but the animation here is no better than that which you would find in a Saturday morning cartoon. One thing that is noticeably better than its predecessor is the DVD picture quality. Although the first Pocahontas is better animation, the transfer to DVD was visibly grainy in the first Pocahontas, which was extremely disappointing. This one was smooth as silk. Choosing between the two DVDs is a toss up, bad animation versus bad picture transfer.
B00003CWTH|5.0|Rarely does a film capture what is important about existence. This one does. Life is not &quot;real&quot; in the sense we like to pretend it is. But when you tell truth on this level it's going to lose most people. <br />The superficial aspects of Magnolia will entertain the masses, but like the Tao they will laugh at it. That doesn't matter. This film is like a message from a higher dimension sent to reassure us that there are spiritual forces at work whether we know it or not, whether we understand them or not.<br />If you need inspiration about the process of redemption, here it is. I bought a copy for a good friend. The Aimee Mann sound track was my next purchase!
6305127689|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time.  God Bless America - United We Stand.
B000002GFT|5.0|I sure as heck think so!  And beyond that, this is one of the best albums of the 1960s (which, therefore, means it's one of the best albums of all time).  This entire album is nothing short of extraordinary.  An explosive, distinctive blend of rock and folk, nothing at all like what Bob Dylan or anyone else has ever done.  <br />What a treasure it is to have an album that not only features a mind-blowing, orgasmic, contact-high-inducing 8-minute version of &quot;Matty Groves&quot;, but also features 32-and-a-half minutes of stellar tracks as well!  This is truly inspired playing, and I cannot stress enough my love of Sandy Denny.  <br />We're very lucky to still have Richard Thompson out there working hard.  We are very unfortunate, however, to not have Sandy Denny with us.  Other than Odetta, I can't think of any other woman of these past 40 years that epitomizes the spirit and roots of folk rock more than Sandy Denny.  Her voice, her songwriting, her soul are ethereal, haunting, and downright spiritual.  More people need to know that she did a lot more than sing the high backup vocal on Led Zeppelin's original &quot;The Battle Of Evermore&quot;.  Getting this album and listening to it will educate you on the virtues of Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson.  It will also educate you about the roots of folk rock music as well.  <br />It might also make you suspect that 1969 could have been the best year ever in pop culture.
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona is one of the true goddesses of our time. We haven't heard anything new from her in awhile, but her older albums remain treasures. If you buy one CD your whole life, buy this one.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This album holds its own with its unique and beautiful sound.  i have heard much comparison to radiohead, but i don;t feel they are similar enough to do so.  Sigur Ros has carved out a niche of its own.  i love it.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I've been reading many reviews comparing L&amp;T favorably to TOOM, and I'd have to agree. The most accurate way I can describe the relationship between Dylan's last two albums is to compare it to the relationship of two mid-seventies' albums:  PLANET WAVES and BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.  In short, TOOM is to PLANET WAVE as L&amp;T is to BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.  PW is a great album with some of Dylan's best work (&quot;Forever Young #1,&quot; &quot;Dirge,&quot; &quot;Wedding Song,&quot; and &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;), yet it also has a couple of so-so songs (&quot;On A Night Like This,&quot; &quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot;).  Likewise, TOOM has some of THE BOB's greatest songs (&quot;Not Dark Yet,&quot; &quot;Trying To Get To Heaven,&quot; &quot;Standing in The Doorway,&quot; and &quot;Cold Irons Bound&quot;) as well as its share of mediocre works (&quot;Million Miles,&quot; &quot;Since I Fell In Love With You&quot;).  Both albums received due praise as well as some undue over-praise. Both followed a period of relative inactivity on Bob's part and were hailed by many who were glad to see he was still artistically alive.  Don't get me wrong.  As I have said they are both great albums, but they are not masterpieces. <br />BOTT and L&amp;T, however, are masterpieces.  Not only are both albums filled with excellent songs and include only one negligable tune a piece (&quot;Meet Me in The Morning&quot; and &quot;Bye and Bye,&quot; respectively), but both of these albums' songs form a coherent musical whole.  Even the two so-so songs mentioned make up for what they lack lyrically with great music.<br />The most interesting thing, for me, about these two relationships is their contrasting attitude shifts.  PW was mostly upbeat fare procaliming the joys of love (although Bob's comment in &quot;Something There Is About You&quot;--&quot;I could say I would be faithful/I could say it in one sweet, easy breath/But to you, that would be cruelty/And for me, it surely would be death&quot; sounded ominous) while BOTT was mostly about the darker side of love.<br />Here at the the turning of the century, we have the opposite movement.  The dour mortality of TOOM is replaced by the jubilent, almost silly, life-affirmation of L&amp;T.<br />I am not, however, saying that L&amp;T is better than BOTT; it's not. But it's pretty damn close.
0385006896|5.0|This is the best mystery book you could possibly buy. It has every story and book ever written about Sherlock Holmes, arguably the best and most famous fictional detective. It chronicles every adventure and every charcter, among them Moriarty, Sherlock's brother Mycroft, and Watson. My favorite part is when Sherlock and Mycroft match wits in an unspoken contest involving a man walking by on the street. If you like mysteries, buy this book. If you like collections, buy this book. If you like thick, rich plots, memorable characters, and excellent adventures, BUY THIS BOOK. This book could be given to any of you out there who appreciate a sensational read.

B000002N3J|5.0|Another one of those good to the last drop type of albums and a greatest hits one at that. I'm glad that Ms. Ciccone didn't just leave us hanging with the Ultamate Collection, I mean it's fine and everything but Something to Remember is perfect. I use to just listen to this when I went to bed but I don't see why I can't listen to this anytime of the day. When Madonna put this album out, she was just getting out of the controversey from SEX and the imfamous stunt on the David Letterman show and then there was Dennis Rodman, whatever. I can see why critics would push her actual music to the side but they shouldn't. I'm glad that Madonna's music has matured to this. This may be another one of favorite Madonna albums next to Ray of Light which Ray of Light this is not. Just a lot of silky smooth ballads. My favorite tracks are Rain, I'll Remember, I want You (with Massive Attack) and Live to Tell. I wish 'Justify My Love' was on here. I looove that song with the radical lyrics. I'd recomment this CD even if you're not that big of a Madonna fan, who cares. You'll get your money's worth.

0792841859|1.0|This movie is a great example of what is wrong with Hollywood today.  I watched this movie hoping to see an intelligent, controversial film but instead it was the same old politically-correct propaganda.  <br />I'm certain that a lot of racism existed in the South in the old days, and that some of the events in the movie were realistic.  But what I didn't like was that this movie portrays most southern white people as despicable, illiterate, racist murderers.  Yet all of the black people in the movie are depicted as peaceful, church-going, articulate people.  I actually had to rewind the tape at several parts of the movie because I couldn't make out what some of the white people in that movie were saying; they sounded so unintelligible.<br />This film basically makes racial issues of the old South seem very clear cut.  Good &amp; evil, black &amp; white.  Anyone who feels that there are two sides to every issue will find that Mississippi Burning is an insult to their intelligence.
0451203933|5.0|Every American with even the slightest interest in<br />military matters should read this book.  Period.<br />Superbly written, truly nightmarish, heart-breakingly<br />realistic.<br />Folks, Mogadishu was exactly how NOT to do it.

The only criticism I have<br />about Mr. Bowden's reconstruction:<br />1. Should have had more maps, and all should have compass<br />bearings, indications of distance.<br />2. Every chapter and episode ought to have started with an<br />hour/minute of action, to better keep track of the progress<br />of events.<br />3. An alphabetical list of all the combatants likewise would<br />have been convenient and helpful in reducing some of the confusion.<br />4. Mr. Bowden seemed to shy away from criticizing Clinton and<br />those other officials who were, in one respect or another,<br />responsible for this slaughter.  His afterword should have<br />dwelled on this aspect of the story more than it did.<br />Otherwise, one of the finest books I have read in several years.<br />A tribute to the brave Americans who fought and bled and would<br />have otherwise been so unfairly forgotten.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Make no mistake, &quot;Gold&quot; is brilliant and a MUST HAVE. But don't expect the broken-hearted barnyard recordings that made Ryan Adams the darling of the alt-country scene. Old fashioned fans may be disappointed with this glitzy flirtation with (dare I say) Pop Rock. But let's come to Jesus here...we saw this coming with &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, and the truth is now sealed with &quot;Gold&quot;. Ryan Adams is growing as a musician and a man.<br />&quot;Gold&quot;'s sound is primarily rock, emotionally strong, and upbeat -- Big haired glitter like the Stones, Lou Reed, Neil Young, The Who, Dylan, and even a little Grateful Dead space jam or two are sprinkled throughout. And let us not forget that Ryan got his start as a punk rocker! No Depression fans don't worry though, &quot;Gold&quot; does have something for you. An eclectic 16 songs with a 5 track bonus CD is no shocker from the super-song-writing-genius, who has allegedly written thousands of songs at the tender age of 26, and adapts a variety of musical styles effortlessly.<br />While it's not a stretch to call Ryan Adams' new sound &quot;Americana&quot;, it is only slightly astray from the very broad category of alt-country. Denimed and Marlboro'ed renegade Adams has a patriotic thing going on with &quot;Gold&quot;, and it is ironic timing that the jacket features handguns and big old American flags, among other icons.<br />Overall, I think &quot;Gold&quot; is great American music -- and evidence that Carolina country boy Adams' life and latest jaunts in big cities like Nashville, NYC and LA have changed him -- and his music -- forever.
B00005JKOJ|5.0|What can you say about one of the best musicals ever to grace our screens? That its a piece of art? Funny Girl is just that a piece of art that will last forever and Barbra Streisand will always be known for the role of Fanny Brice. Barbra sings like an angel and her acting, singing in this movie is fabulous. Barbra rules and so does this movie.
B000020617|4.0|The Foo Fighters have done it again: created an album full of fun to listen to tunes that are an eclectic mix of happy, over-the-top pop, and straight out rock-n-roll. Although &quot;Nothing Left to Lose&quot; is not quite as awe inspiring as their previous effort &quot;The colour and The Shape,&quot; it is still well worth a listen for both Foo Fans and general music fans alike.
B00001XT76|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again and I love it. Its like one of those movies or songs that an artist sings that you can never get tired of hearing, you know the one that you wake up and can't wait to put into the CD player, the same goes for this movie, you smile and feel good while your watching it and after you watch it. This movie is great!
B00005AFLT|5.0|There two things I always remember about this album is that every time the beginning of &quot;From the Beginning&quot; played on the radio it sounded so much like the beginning of &quot;Roundabout&quot; by Yes, and that the end of &quot;Living Sin&quot; was used as the theme music for one of the local television news shows in Albuquerque. &quot;Trilogy&quot; was the third album from Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, the British Progressive (nee Classical) Rock group and it is certainly interesting in retrospect to consider those first three albums as a set. On their self-entitled debut album, ELP offered a balance between tracks featuring synthesizer overkill by keyboard virtuoso Keith Emerson and the melodic compositions of guitarist Greg Lake, wherein Emerson turned in his organ for a piano. Their second album, &quot;Tarkus,&quot; went in the first direction, with the Tarkus Suite representing their best effort along those lines. &quot;Trilogy,&quot; represents the other direction of ELP, one which I personally favor.<br />The two parts of &quot;The Endless Enigma&quot; are bridged by a &quot;Fugue,&quot; that shows ELP's interest in pursuing classical musical forms, as does the final track, &quot;Abaddon's Bolero.&quot; &quot;The Sheriff&quot; is one of those cute ditties the group tended to indulge in a bit too much, while &quot;Hoedown&quot; from Aaron Copeland's &quot;Rodeo&quot; is one of their better direct adaptations of a classical work. &quot;Trilogy&quot; and &quot;From the Beginning&quot; highlight the instrumentality of the group in a clearer, cleaner style. All in all, the high points on &quot;Trilogy&quot; are not as strong as on their debut album, but this certainly got ELP back on track for my money.  The live version of &quot;Hoedown&quot; included is a minor addition to this remastered import version of the album.
B00004Y7SF|2.0|Christina's Christmas CD was quite a disapointment to me.I got it expecting a great CD for Christmas and what I got was over-produced R+B pop.Christina did not put the effort she ususally puts into her music.The classic Christmas songs were good,but the rest was pure crap.Some I don't think should be considered Christmas songs.Christina needs some lesons from Mariah on how to make an excelent Christmas CD,then hers would have been way better.
B00005K3OT|5.0|&quot;Chocolat&quot; is a film with a story as richly textured as the confections sold by Vianne in her Chocolaterie.  It is a story of many layers that appears to be one flavor on the outside, but changes as the confection dissolves in our psyche.  On its face, it is a story about an endless drifter named Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk, who take up residence in a small French town in the 1950's and open a Chocolate shop right in the middle of Lent.  However, once the initial layer melts away we realize that this is not a story about Vianne, but really a story about the town and its people.<br />Vianne is more of a catalyst to the stories around her than a story unto herself.  Ironically, Binoche is a lead actor in a supporting role despite having the camera on her most of the time.  If there is one consistent theme that runs through the film it is one of reconciliation.  Prior to Vianne's arrival, several of the townspeople had survived in a kind of stasis, with unresolved issues never addressed or confronted.  Vianne is the straw that stirs the drink and brings various issues into the open to be examined and resolved.<br />The film has a strong feminist subtext, which is not objectionable by itself, but too often becomes strident and preachy.  Of greater value is the subtle message that provincial ignorance is well served by exposure to new and non-conforming ideas (Vianne and Roux) and that the forces that promote ignorance and conformity out of fear of change (Comte de Reynaud) are no match for the power of knowledge and the freedom to exercise it.  In this way, the film is very uplifting and relevant despite its folksy telling.<br />As he did with \\"The Cider House Rules\\", Lasse Hallstrom lets the story dominate the screen, bringing us well developed character studies without excessive directorial stylizing.  Hallstrom's strength lies in character interpretation and in guiding the actors to broaden and deepen their portrayals.  This is clearlyevident here.<br />Juliette Binoche gives a wonderful performance that earned her a best actress nomination from the Academy.  Judy Dench continues to make great acting a routine, garnering her third best supporting actress nomination for her role.  Lena Olin gives a standout performance as the battered wife struggling to regain her self esteem.  Alfred Molina is also excellent as the oppressive mayor trying to pull the strings of the townspeople in a desperate attempt to maintain the status quo.<br />This is a terrific film with numerous thought provoking subthemes.  While it is not a powerful film, it is a substantial film.  I rated it 9/10.  It is a delight for the thoughtful and intelligent viewer who enjoys a well developed human drama.
0811826848|4.0|First off- the book itself is just beautiful; an amazingly well designed book. It's just HUGE, and every page is a treasure; lovely to look at. My big problem was the cost- I wouldn't mind so much if all (or even SOME..) of the proceeds went to charity. Do the Beatles (and the inexplicable Yoko) not have enough money?<br /> That said, I enjoyed the book a lot. The book is laid out in a way that makes you feel that you're sitting around a table with The Fab Four, just shooting the breeze. Their stories are fascinating, especially the way their memories don't...quite....gel. John, unfortunately, comes off as something of an egomaniac, and a rather pompous one at that. It seems that everything of any worth (in his opinion) was his idea. I'm still a fan of his music, I'm just a little less a fan of the man. <br />   My only real beef with the book is the lack of a narrative voice- The Beatles mention John's car accident, Mary Quant, etc., but there is no narrator to let the unenlightened in on what happened, who that person was, etc. Otherwise, Beatles fans will spend many a happy hour reading this book.
6304493681|5.0|Mamaru Oshi's &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; is a provocative and compelling story of one woman's search for identity and the meaning of being human.  Motoko Kusanagi is a human with cyborg components who tackles special security situations for a secret police force.  When the mysterious 'puppetmaster,' a powerful hacker who can crack into people's brains, appears in the form of a woman cyborg, Kusanagi finds herself questioning a lot about herself and spouting out deep philosophical thoughts along the way.  The animation and backgrounds are simply stunning, while the DVD has superbly mixed surround sound.  There is plenty of action and quite a bit of fan service, but it all ties perfectly into the plot.  The skillful blend of action scenes and intellectual drama is why this is one of the most excellent anime films around.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This music defies description. You either hate it, in which case you are probably not listening to it the right way, or you love it.  Blind Guardian has created a complex and lush sound that could be classified as heavy metal if you had to categorize it.  The lead vocalist injects fantastic emotions into the songs on this album, ranging from screaming and growling that would make Rob Zombie fecise himself to soft lilting that could be compared to a seventies folk god.  That is to say nothing of the amazing composition. Theatrical, melodic, complex in the extreme,this is truly a kind of language of the gods.  Yes, I have a high opinion of anyone who can create such an awesome epic atmosphere with nothing but sounds.  If you like medieval folk styles, take notice.  If you have any love for fantasy, take note.  Heck, if you are a true connaiseur of theatrical or cinematic music, buy this darn thing.  A hideous, beautiful, tragic story of corruption, betrayal and salvation told by talented musicians. <BR>This is definitely not for the faint of heart.  awesome.  awesome  awesome.
6305014140|4.0|There aren't many occations where anime movies combine action, violence, and drama that actually compliment each other without seeming ridiculous.  Ninja Scroll is one such movie that successfully entertains with the story of Jubei Chan, a fierce ninja who must battle demons and find an antedote for a slow working poison working away at his insides.  The film is full of gruesome scenes of violence and impressive visuals.  It also contains much nudity that follows the graphic nature of the animation, but might otherwise be considered unnecessary.  By the end of the movie, Jubei and his female counterpart have encountered many obstacles and have grown in character, but the development seems a little uneven.  That and the nudity force me to give it a less than perfect rating.
0743216385|5.0|Notwithstanding the wonderful HBO miniseries based on this book, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is an entertaining and worthwhile read in its own right.  Ambrose skilly fully weaves personal accounts from the paratroopers of E Company into a compelling story of the war in the European theater.  Ambrose has earned his stripes as one of the premier historians of World War II, and with good reason.  His writing style is easy to read, he does a great job of individualizing the large cast of characters and he masterfully sets his story within the context of the greater conflict without distracting the reader.  <br />All this makes the book essential reading for those watching the HBO miniseries.  The miniseries is great cinema, but the medium is necessarily limited in how much background it can bring to each episode.  After the first few episodes I started reading the book along with the show, and it helped me in distinguish the characters and orient what was happening.  Also, the book gives you a greater understanding of why certain objectives were so critical to the war effort.  When I've read the part of the book that corresponds to a new episode, I get to focus on the performances and visual aspects of the show.  Reading the book only enhances the experience of watching the miniseries.
B00005MP58|2.0|I'm a huge fan of P&amp;P--both the novel and the miniseries. I'm sorry to say that previous reviewers are right. The &quot;Special Edition&quot; is--quite literally--a washout. While the sound is good (and widescreen Colin Firth can never be a bad thing), the transfer is terrible. The colors, contrast and shading apparent in the video or original dvd versions are almost non existent in this &quot;special&quot; version. If you're a widescreen purist (or just want double the Colin) go ahead and invest--otherwise, your other version is probably just fine.
076790382X|3.0|&quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot;, a collection of short essays written for a British audience about returning to the States after many years abroad, is mostly entertaining and amusing.  There are a few points where the author misses the point, or pontificates for just too long, but there are just as many times when I found myself laughing out loud.<br />The book is perhaps funniest to other Americans who have lived overseas for some period of time, and are now attempting to get used to American life again.
B00005NP04|5.0|Finally! A compilation of Martina McBride's hits. Her voice continues to amaze me with every new recording, she continues to break new ground and push the boundaries in country music, while not straying too far at all. All of her big hits are here in their glory, such as My Baby Loves Me, I Love You, Wild Angels, Valentine, There You Are, and social relevant songs like Independance Day (perhaps her career song) and Love's The Only House, plus way more! 19 songs total, with four new tracks. When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues is a song packed with attitude, a surefire hit. Where Would You Be is a touching song, with the vocal powerhouse you'd come to expect from Martina. Concrete Angel is another social issue song, about child abuse, offering a glimmer of hope with the girl's dreams, very sad and touching at the same time. Blessed is an uptempo, positive, start your day song, it'll put you in a good mood. This album is a perfect representation of Martina's career to this date, and offers a glimpse of the future with the new songs. A must have.
B0000026VF|5.0|the best Europe album so far,Tempests vocals are once again out of this world and the guitar solos are superb.pip is the best track while heaven,cry 4u,girl from lebenon,homeland and 7th sign follow closely behind.iv ordered the re-released version with extra tracks as this is a heavy rock album thats highly under rated.
B00005N83M|4.0|J.LO is more uptempo friendly, than the ballad heavy debut album ON THE 6, which in a way is good, but also bad at the same time. The album leads with the first single Love Don't Cost A Thing, promising but also somewhat repetitive. The second single, Play, is one of the best songs on the album, awesome vibe to the song that makes you want to dance and sing along. I'm Real is a promising song too, very Madonna like in a way, with her own energy. Jennifer Lopez may not be the best singer, but she makes good use of what she has. It's the material on the album that is not the best. Sure there are great songs like the latin influenced Ain't It Funny, Dance With Me, and the spanish songs, there are the great songs like the Darkchild produced That's The Way, or It's Gonna Be Alright, We Gotta Talk, etc. That's Not Me, borrows from the Destiny's Child type of music, with a fast chorus, not bad but repetitive. The album falls with the two ballads, Sincerely and Come Over, they are very difficult to listen to, her ballads from ON THE 6 were way more up to par. This is a fun album to listen to though, with lots of uptempo songs that will stay in your head, it's just the small places the album falls short. Still worth checking out though!
B0000026J1|5.0|This album is a must for hard rock fans.joey tempest does a very good job on the vocals while kee marcellos guitar solos work well too especially on Towers callin,superstisious and the speedy ready or not.the album has various tracks to suit your taste ie hard and soft and there is some nice keboard sounds to top it off.Sign of the times and never say die are a favourate.
B00005JKES|4.0|Yes, it's a shame this set is being released sans pilot episode.  We can thank the suits at various production companies and studios for that.<br />However, due to a technical loophole, the original, as aired in the US pilot episode, was released in Hong Kong as a region 0 DVD (which means it'll play on anybody's DVD player).  It's got a 5.1 dolby digital track (I know some will complain about the lack of a DTS soundtrack) which can be annoying at times.  Agent Cooper in particular sounds disconcertingly chipmunk-like.  But the transfer is pretty decent, and until the suits can get off their collective butts and do something about rights to the pilot in the US it's better than nothing....<br />Various overseas DVD outlets on the net undoubtedly have it for sale as well....<br />As for the DVD set, I'm looking forward to it.  My tapes are nearly worn out, and I hope Artisan is planning to release the second season as well.  I'm looking forward to seeing the show in pristine form again.
B000002UWL|5.0|Considered by many PSB fans (myself included) to be their finest album.  Neil produces his most intriguing and heartfelt lyrics, and Chris spices up the mix with a cornucopia of sonic surprises.  I can honestly say there isn't a moment of this album that I don't adore.  Synth pop perfection of the highest order.  My favorite album by one of my favorite musical acts.
B00000JPH4|5.0|Even with all the advancements in animation and special effects, very few recent movies have stirred me as deeply as this one, made in 1982.  I first saw this movie at the age of five, and I give it full credit for my warped imagination and my interest in creating other worlds.  It's only now that I realise how profound it's effect on me really was.<BR>The characters are designed by the wonderful fantasy artist Brian Froud, and each seems to have a soul of it's own.  The sound track is chilling, the scenery is spectacular, and the voice-over actors are perfect.<BR>The critics who panned the script as 'shallow' were obviously not sensitive to how moving a simple, neatly-crafted story can be.<BR>I have never seen another movie that has drawn me so completely into it's world.  A few more films like this would do us all good.
B00005KHJR|4.0|THE WICKER MAN    (UK - 1973)    Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Theatrical soundtrack: Mono    First-time director Robin Hardy and acclaimed writer Anthony Shaffer (twin brother of Peter, and author of FRENZY and SLEUTH [both 1972], the latter based on his stageplay) attempted to revise the horror genre with this cult favorite concerning a deeply religious police sergeant (Edward Woodward, in a note-perfect performance) whose search for an apparently missing schoolgirl on a remote Scottish island exposes a Pagan society rooted in old superstitions and the worship of vengeful gods. To the accompaniment of a haunting score by Paul Giovanni, comprising variations on traditional songs and folk music, THE WICKER MAN depicts an isolated community at odds with the world at large, steeped in ancient beliefs and ruled with deceptive benevolence by a patriarchal figure (Christopher Lee, in unusually subtle form) whom the script suggests is a monstrous con man, maintaining the island's customs not through genuine convictions, but because the islanders - all of them true disciples of the cause - simply know no other way.    The central mystery (Woodward's search for the missing girl) is genuinely engrossing, and the bawdy songs which greet the sergeant's arrival are soon replaced by an earthy sensuality as the true extent of the islanders' belief in regenerative powers - divorced from traditional notions of 'morality' - become apparent. Lee's assessment of God verges on blasphemy (\\"He had His chance and... blew it!\\"), but ultimately, neither Christianity or Paganism emerges with any dignity from the devastating finale. There's real magic in every  frame of this extraordinary film, though it's clearly not for everyone: If you don't 'get it' within the first ten minutes, then the careful pace and deliberate absence of familiar horror motifs may seem a little long-winded, even dull. Everyone else, however, will be enchanted by this unique, one-of-a-kind movie.    The filmmakers themselves have roundly condemned the shorter 'theatrical version' (88 minutes) which crept into UK theaters in 1973 as support for Nicolas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW. However, most viewers were first introduced to TWM via the shorter print, simply because it was the only available version for many years, and despite the makers' protestations to the contrary, it's still a remarkable experience.     The filmmakers' preferred print (100m) underlines the script's major themes and streamlines the narrative, and will be a revelation to anyone who's only ever seen the theatrical print or the 95m version unearthed by the BBC. There are a few bits and pieces in the theatrical version which are exclusive to that print, and the BBC edition includes an animated 'Sun God' which appears after the closing credits, filling the screen before shooting backwards into darkness. The loss of this brief, iconic fragment from most extant versions is inexplicable.
0201633612|2.0|The ideas presented in the book are great, but the writing is too complex. The book could be re-written with simpler and far fewer words. More examples are needed.<br />I use some of the design patterns frequently, yet when I read the book, the descriptions are extremely dificult to understand.<br />I usually have more experienced Java programmers explain the patterns to me.

B00005OAJ1|5.0|At first I thought I would hate it since I found out it wasn't going to be all acoustical, and it isn't.  But after a week of listening to it, the songs grew on me.  Although similar, the songs are a lot different from the D's live show, and they are full out rocking. Some songs take on an entirely new sound as they throw in drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, but they still maintain the similar sound you're used to if you're a fan of their live show or their HBO show. The only problem is that the electroniuc stuff can drown out their lyrics and acoustic guitars, which is a shame.  These guys just click when they get together and have a couple of the best voices in music today.  I thought some of the chatter tracks between the songs would suck but they're not too bad and are pretty funny.  Definately a great purchase.
B0000028UK|4.0|Think of Ten as The Clash's Give 'Em Enough Rope. <br />Think of Vs as London Calling.<br />Not a perfect analogy, but you get my point. Vs is one of the most solid, intense albums ever recorded. The recording is excellent, the songs are well-written, and dammit, the band actually KNOWS each other this time and it shows. This is easily one of the biggest jumps in quality any band I know of has had in such a small time. <br />The fire that ignites Vs isn't the whiny, poor-me attitude that so many people mistake the band as having. this is an album ablaze with rebellion. It is the sound of a steadfast refusal to give ground in the face of overwhelming odds. It spends nearly an hour fighting the good fight, occasionally finding solace in victory (the end of the awe-inspiring Rearviewmirror), humility in defeat (Dissident), or wondering if it can go on at all (the hoarse cry of Blood). It does. And after it's most anthem-like, going-down-with-the-ship declaration, Leash, it sinks into the eerily silent Indifference, an organ-driven work of art that signals the album's final surrender. <br />Pearl Jam's best days were still ahead of them. They needed to be broken before they could reform themselves the way they needed to, and maybe that's what 1994 did for the band. But Vs is probably their best mix thus far of what makes the band great and what made the band popular.<br />Truth is, Vs does everything Ten did. Everything. But it doesn't do much on it's own, so there's not a lot of experimentation or artistic growth here. That doesn't really matter in the end, because Ten made the rules of the game, but Vs outdoes it's older brother every time they play.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I have to agree with anothe reiewer that said after the first listen they weren't impressed,but upon later listenings they were. I am also in that same category. I wasn't too impressed with 'The State'. It had some good songs on it,but began after a while to seem repetitve. In fact the first time I hear 'How You Remind Me' I thought it was some song on 'The State' that i hadn't heard. When I heard Nickelback was coming out with another cd I figured I'd get it for 'How You Remind Me' the same way I got 'The State' for 'Leader of Man'. Upon my first listening of the cd I wasn't too impressed,but now after hearing the album numerous times I can say that it is an awesome cd. Not one to be missed.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I am a bad, bad man.<br />When Binaural came out, being a monster Pearl Jam fan, I devoured it. I listened to it more times than I will EVER admit to in those first 4 months. What happens when you overindulge yourself on such an album? It eventually effects your ability to enjoy it. So I heard the songs on the bootlegs some time later, decided that the Binaural songs were just better live, and stopped listening to the album. I'm an album-oriented person, so the creeping feelings I had that Binaural was Pearl Jam's first miss bothered me. I started having really negative feelings towards it. I came up with all sorts of reasons I thought it failed to live up to the last few discs they'd made (which are some of the greatest works I have ever heard). <br />So yesterday I was in a Pearl Jam mood, and I threw it in. It blew my mind. It's still not at the level of most of their work, but it beats the living hell out of Ten. Like most of their work, it works very very well as a piece. If you just skip to your favorite song, you're going to miss out a bit, because Binaural isn't interested in offering up stand-alone catchy songs. It aims for grander visions, and succeeds fairly well.<br />If we're lucky, Pearl Jam will continue to grow and experiment. Everything they've done since has been a great improvement over Ten, and their willingness to leave most or even all of their fanbase behind suggests that they're more devoted to their artistic vision than they are to popular taste. It ought not be the way every artist is, but I sure wish a few more would take this approach to their music.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge is an excellent movie.  The singing in it is fantastic; Ewen McGregor has a wonderful voice.  I was not expecting to like the movie when I went to see it, and the beginning is a little bit strange.  But if you give the movie a chance, it's superb.  I ended up loving it!  One thing that's so great about it is that it is so different from most movies.  I very highly recommend it!
0452282152|5.0|The best thing about this book is the way you must view the people through their simple, uncomplicated stoicism.  The emotion comes through, then, like the view of an eclipse, that you can't look directly at to know.  This one stayed with me.
B00003CX95|4.0|If you loved the movie, the DVD is a must have in order to hear Gibson's commentary as well as to enjoy the cinematography.  <br />If you thought the movie was only good, or otherwise, you may want to rent it first.  Mel Gibson's commentary was good, but not excellent.  I love Gibson's acting and his directing.  Probably, too much, so I wanted, or expected more. Never-the-less, it was great to get his thoughts on the movie.<br />I liked Braveheart as a movie, but did not love it.  It is an important presentation of the determination of controlled men for freedom at all personal costs and sacrifices. It also shows the heavy cost to power hungry men when they take away all that a man loves and holds dear to their hearts.  Gibson shows that there is nothing to hold a man back when he has lost that which he loves most.  But, it just didn't drive me like other movies have.<br />If you have NOT seen the movie, it is a bit gory, and the ending is intense for the more sensitive viewer... or should I say for anyone who is not insensitive.  But, the script is well written, the cinimatography is striking and the movie doesn't let up.

A masterfully told history that sears the heart and shames the soul.

B000059H99|4.0|Recommendation: High<br />Review:<br />The movie was such a great hit and I loved it when it came out; but when I revisited it years later, it seemed to have some slow moments that I had forgotten.  Regardless, if you are a student or fan of film, or just want some insights into how a completely unknown actor could rocket to the top of the industry you have to buy this DVD. <br />What drives this DVD is the actor's / director's commentary by John Avildson (director), Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff (producers) and actors Talia Shire and Burt Young.  It also has great featurettes for &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; and &quot;never-before-seen-footage&quot;, and a video commentary by Stallone as well as other features.<br />Stallone lived &quot;Rocky&quot; as an actor; he took his best shot and won.<br />(So that you don't think I am just a &quot;Rocky fight fanatic&quot;, I confess that I have not seen 3 of the 5 Rocky movies.)
B00005N5S5|5.0|The original budget for this film was $6 million; rumor has it, they spent almost as much restoring it for transfer to DVD, and it shows.  The colors are vibrant and brilliant, without overpowering the show, and the new Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is amazing.  This version looks and sounds better than the original theatrical release.<br />The transfer, and the additional material make this DVD a must-have for any sci-fi fan.
6305426651|3.0|Grief and happiness, pain and joy, laughing and crying... choose the words. Two such contrastable feelings being mixed in one single movie. The intent is good, but the result was not that good for me: You are just enjoying the last joke you heard in the movie when you have to watch a scene of sorrow, and vice versa.<br />Try eating hot Mexican or Indian food and your favorite sweet cake, at the same time, not one after finishing another. You'll understand what I mean.<br />The movie becomes superficial: you can't enjoy the jokes at their best because you are expecting some sad parts to come and, again, vice versa.
B00003CXZ3|4.0|Memento was surprisingly good.  When I rented I figured I would be getting a typical revenge type movie like the Limey and with a few twists and turns like any Cohen Brothers movie.  But what I got was an interesting premise and a well acted film.  The movie was intriguing, but the only complaint I have is that is was to complex.  Taking out a few events or expounding on a few things would have helped this movie out alot because their is just so much going on.  Messing with time frames is also something that seems to be in style now but i've never seen a movie go completly backwards.  Overall it was an enjoyable movie, but no masterpiece.  The director has tons of potential and i'm looking forward to other things he will be putting out.
B00005N9CV|4.0|The Greatest Jazz Album Diana Krall has made 'til now, is no doubt &quot;All for You&quot;, by far, as for this release it's pure easy listening bossa-nova. The tunes sound alike the Johnny Mandel arranged songs of the &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; Album, but really more overproduced. I love Bossa Nova music, I loved both albums of the '60s featuring Sinatra and Jobim, one of them with arrangements by Ogerman too, but something is not as good with this effort, and I agree with some reviewer that in some parts of the recording the sound is somehow distorted or overmiked, oddly enough.<br />In Diana's albums you can find almost everything: The excellent very jazzy first effort &quot;Stepping Out&quot;; the more sophisticated &quot;Only Trust Your Heart&quot;; the great jazz combo of &quot;All You&quot; (her masterpiece, for those who prefer Jazz); the luscious, gentle, intense ballads of &quot;Love Scenes&quot; (no orchestra needed, thanks), the clever combination of jazzier arrangements with her trio and the subtle bossa-nova ballads, with strings and arrangements by Johnny Mandel (her &quot;massive&quot; masterpiece, still worthwhile for jazz fans because it has jazzier moods and plenty of her piano, besides the orchestra arranged songs intended for a wider public). But &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, still worthwhile for a Krall or easy listening fan, is somewhat flat, its songs too &quot;similar&quot; to each other, not really worthy of Diana's great talents. It would have been a perfect album, if for example we could have left &quot;'S Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; as Bossa Nova tunes, but less overproduced, let's say, with similar arrangements than those of &quot;I've got you Under my Skin&quot; and &quot;Let's Face the Music and Dance&quot; from &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot;; then, I wouldn't have included most of the rest, especially &quot;B&eacute;same Mucho&quot;, never liked anglo-speaking singers trying spanish, less &quot;boleros&quot;.....that reminds me of some pop bands which want to appeal to the latin american market. Diana's voice is for jazz!!!! And then I would have included some jazz standards like &quot;How High the Moon&quot;, &quot;Imagine my Frustration&quot; and others by Ellington or Fats Waller, sort of arranged like the uplifting songs of &quot;All For You&quot; and the torchier ballads of &quot;Love Scenes&quot;...and ther you have an excellent cd, who leaves everyone happy...and has variaton in its repertoire and moods, and most important, completely up to Diana's talents and standards. That's was what I was waiting for!! And I was kinda disappointed..<br />Later on, considering Diana's producers' infatuation with the Bossa Nova trend, which is all right with me....I'd like them to try to provide her with more creative, modern and stronger bossa-nova arrangements, like those of Bebel Gilberto's fantastic &quot;Tanto Tempo&quot;. It would surely turn into something great!! If you want to listen to a recent jazzier deliver by Diana, buy Terence Blanchard's &quot;Let's get lost&quot; album, in which Diana sings the title tune.

6302518423|5.0|The production of this film is truly amazing and fascinating.  A complex blend of ballet, stage, and film, and can only be described as riveting for a lot of scenes.  I have enjoyed watching this more than once, and hope a DVD version will soon come out. Background information on this film should be very interesting.  This is Greenaway's special stylistic approach.  This video is best viewed on a large screen television, since the images are very complex for many scenes, with various blends of styles. John Gielgud does a tour de force in this film.  This film contains a great deal of nudity, but watching it only shows how natural the human body can be, as it is not exploitive in any fashion.  There are a lot of very complex image scenes, and the way the book was brought to life as it was being read from is more than worth the cost of the video.  This video is truly a hidden gem.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I grew up with The Goonies and I consider this one of my favorite adventure movies of the 80s. The cast, the writer and the director are amazing and the story is outrageous.  I just bought the dvd, and after 16 years I think the movies still rocks!<br />If you are a Goonies fan, this movie is a must-have for your Dvd collection.
B000002GLV|5.0|This is a ***** superb album that is a must for any fan of blues or jazz or of jazz blues fusion. It is second as a John Mayall &quot;Jazz Blues fusion&quot; album only to the hard to find John Mayall album &quot;Moving On&quot; (which begs the question: when is this Masterpiece going to be issued on CD?).  The most exceptional track on this album in my book is &quot;Change Your Ways&quot;, in which John Mayall belts out a lyrical, funky, poetic message to his girlfriend, backed beautifully by sax, trumpets, lead guitar, and his own masterful blues harp.
0805017445|5.0|There's not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said -- it's fantastic! Colorful, interactive, and fun for mom and dad to read outloud. We are finally buying our own copy so someone else at the library will have a chance to check their copy out!
B00004Z459|4.0|Hybrid Theory is a great CD...if you like Limp Bizkit, you'll love this. The entire CD is full of great guitars and is packed with tons of energy. It's great for listening to before going out and playing football or any contact sport. The only thing that keeps this album from earning 5 stars is Cure for the Itch. It completely stops the momentum throughout the entire CD. It's loud and fast and then you hit this song and go, \\"What was that?\\" Luckily it's the 2nd last track. Overall this is a great rock CD... Get it. You won't be disappointed.
B000002UUH|5.0|A slice of John Lennon's genius is captured here in this album, it is poignant (Woman, Imagine), expansive (Mind Games, #9 Dream, Imagine), brilliant (Imagine), honest (Jealous Guy), touching (Woman, Beautiful Boy), raw (Cold Turkey), insightful (Watching the Wheels)... if I had my way I would add three songs to this album to make it a complete &quot;Collection&quot; and would remove four. I would have added: Just Give Me Some Truth; Real Love; and Free As A Bird (of course the latter two were released in revised form only in the last couple of years).
0062502182|5.0|I am a 13-year-old girl. I just started reading &quot;The Alchemist&quot; today, and already I find it one of the best books I have ever opened. <BR>   It is a little fairytale about a shepherd named Santiago, who has a dream of a treasure in the Pyramids of Egypt. He embarks on a journey to find that treasure, and ends up learning about omens and intuition from a mysterious old man who calls himself a king. Throughout the adventure, he discovers the &quot;Soul of the World&quot; - the force that controls everyone's destiny, or &quot;Personal Legend,&quot; and the language of the world - something understood by all, even sheep.<BR>   For anyone who says &quot;The Alchemist&quot; is boring or &quot;hard to get into,&quot; I say this: we are a culture of instant gratification. If those hurried people took the time to read this book, they would find its true message: that to fulfill our dreams is to fulfill our destiny, and that unimportat things should never get in the way.
B00005QFHG|5.0|I just recently saw this move after longing to see it for about three months.  Let me say i was not disappointed.  The story is one you can relate to, the people are real, and the chocolat is delicious.<BR>I loved Vivian because she was a free spirit.  She cared not what the villagers thought of her, though she di dbecome angry when the mayor steps too far.  She protects, stands up for what she believes in and makes wonderful hot chocolate.<BR>I thought Roux was a interesting character.  He was a wonderful musician, who could almost read vivian's mind.  He had a soft heart, and a longing to be known for who he was not what he was.<BR>all in all i would rate this movie a 5 out of 5.<BR>You have to see it.
B00005O5CM|5.0|If ever a movie succeeded on the back of its star, Legally Blonde fits that description.  The movie takes a seemingly implausible plot - blonde wants to keep boyfriend so she enrolls in law school - and with the charms of Reese Witherspoon, makes it a joyful and fun movie.<br />Elle Woods (Witherspoon), blonde Calfornia girl, thinks her preppie boyfriend Warner is going to propose.  But Warner thinks he needs a serious gilfriend so he dumps Elle for the brunette and more stoic Sarah.  Determined to win Warner back, Elle decides to follow him to Harvard Law School.  Elle's admissions video is an absolute hoot.  It is nice that Witherspoon is fi8nally being noticed, after standout performances in &quot;Pleasantville&quot; and the best of movie of 1999, &quot;Election&quot;.  (Sorry &quot;American Beauty&quot;.)  The success of &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; has openned new door for her and we can expect a sequel to this and a &quot;Honey West&quot; series, as well as &quot;The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing&quot;.<br />While in law school, Elle is not taken seriously. She shows up in class with a flowered pen and a heart-shaped note pad.  Finally, she breaks down and buys a pink I-mac.  The contrast between the bubbly blonde Elle and the dour Harvard stuffed shirts is wonderful.  Elle manages to get assigned as an assistant on a murder case (another incredible stretch of plausibility) and is able to use all the knowledge she has gained from Cosmo.  There are a couple of subplots, like Elle helping her maincurist friend find confidence and the usual sexual discrimination thing, but they are incidental to being able to watch Elle interact with all these Harvard bluebloods.  And the movie has something to say about accepting people for who they are and not prejudging them.<br />The key, of course to the success of this movie is Reese Witherspoon.  She is a pure delight to watch.  She always has something out of this world to say and in spits of incredible odds, doesn't get down.  She gets close, when she thinks that a professor who admired her for her brains is really only interested in her looks. However, one of her professors says to her &quot;If you let one stupid (jerk) ruin your life, you're not the girl I thought you were&quot;.  That gives Elle the courage to go forward and she discovers that it was the right thing to do.<br />&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; has been released in many cities to make up for movies that were delayed or dropped early.  In this dire times, it is the kind of movie that will make you laugh - and that is what we need.get down.

B000003N69|4.0|Accompanied only by drummer Rasheed Ali, John Coltrane takes his experimenting to dizzying heights with &quot;Interstellar Space.&quot; This is as stripped down as it gets, yet it's in this format that Coltrane seems to draw some of his most interesting inspiration. I bought this not just because I'm a fan of Coltrane and all of his beautiful accomplishments, but also on the recommendation of several friends, who insisted this one of his best works.<br />This won't take &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; off my favorite Coltrane list, but it's definitely high up there. This is wonderful stuff, for people who aren't afraid to try new things.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I have all of Diana's albums and I've been to her live performance at Barbican in London some time ago. I'm not saying that this album is bad..  It's just weak as compared to what I'd logically expect from performer of her calibre and to what we've already seen in her previous albums. It's just not that Diana that I love listening to all through the night. Pics are just great but music...No drive, no passion, no detail... The whole lot of delicate things &quot;a la DK&quot; are missing. On top of that, being hi-fi enthusiast (provided that I express my own opinion on the CD which I bought from recognised retailer) I can say that from technical point of view album sounds BAD - distortion is too obvious probably due to high level of recording. <BR>I hope that she's not going to continue this trend and surprise jazz fans with yet another &quot;pop&quot; album of background music.
006441034X|5.0|I am a 13 year old reader, and I thought that this book was fabulous. it was so well written, and original in the story book. It gives so many details along the way, and you really get into the story. This has been my favorit book yet. I would reccomend it to any young reader. I read it faster than any other book yet! I just can't give it enough applause. Sophie is well characterized so you can actually relate to the character, which I like in the book. It is very much a fantasy book, yet you would still enjoy it if you don't like fantasy. All I can say is WOW!
B000002WU9|5.0|Before this album came out, I didn't really respect Raekwon too much. I was all into Meth, RZA, and GZA. I just hadn't given Rae much of a chance. That all changed after I got this cd. This was the best Wu that I had heard to date and to this day it is still some of the best. From then on Raekwon became my favorite member of the Wu-Tang clan and has remained that way. This album has excellent beats and Rae's lyrics shine. Also Ghost and Rae compliment each other very well with Ghost being on about half the songs on the album. Songs such as Knowledge God, Ice Water, and Wu-Gambinos are real classics. From start to finish the album shines and really is a must have for any real hip hop fan.
0446607274|5.0|This is my fourth Connelly book, and it's another winner. He writes mystery novels different than the rest of them, because there are no easy answers, and no cop is a superman. Detective Heironymus Bosch has been in many of Connelly's previous books, and this time he's investigating the murder of a high-profile black lawyer named Howard Elias, who was in the middle of a lawsuit against the LAPD. Needless to say, there are many people who would want Elias dead, several of them cops.<br />But for Michael Connelly, there are no easy answers. Red herrings abound in this story, and Bosch is further distracted by his relationship with his estranged wife. Add to that a murder case steeped in pedophilia, powers-that-be in the LAPD who want the case solved as quickly as possible, high-price internet callgirls, dirty cops...and you've got a complicated case that could spark inner-city riots if it's not solved to everyone's satisfaction.<br />If you like this book, I recommend the other Connelly books I've read...&quot;Blood Work,&quot; &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; and &quot;Trunk Music.&quot; Connelly's work is gritty, realistic, and sometimes very funny. A fantastic writer.

0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand was a talented writer, whether or not you agree with her philosphy.  Alas, the Rand purists are offended by all reviews that are not uncritical praise, and the anti-Rand socialists are outraged by any that do not paint the author as unspeakably evil.  Whatever happened to the idea of an open mind?<br />In light of the foregoing, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that &quot;the Fountainhead&quot; is a great book for someone just looking for good fiction. It is a tale of competing schools of architecture in New York during the 1920s and 1930s, when capitalism was increasingly opposed by dialectical materialism and socialism. <br />Howard Roark, the main protagonist, is a lone eagle who desires to achieve on his own, applying his own modernistic style to architecture, to erect buildings that inspire a sense of joy while being a testament to the greatness of man.<br />Roark is opposed in his efforts by an assortment of traditionalist-architects, who oppose modernism in favor of the baroque styles of Roman and Greek architecture, and who heap scorn on any architect who steps outside this box. The traditionalists are supported by a socialist-journalist named Elsworth Toohey, who writes a column in the New York Banner, praising or criticizing the work of architects. Toohey has great influence on public opinion, and few architects or builders wish to risk his wrath and public humiliation, and so &quot;go along to get along,&quot; much in the same way that political correctness works today. <br />Howard Roark refuses to be swayed by these strong commercial and societal pressures, and continues to design office buildings, homes and other structures in a way that pleases him. He suffers terrible adversity because of his principles and his vision, but over time emerges victorious. <br />I loved Ayn Rand's prose, her descriptions of New York and its skyscrapers. Her writing flows smoothly through the mind, painting pictures in the imagination, and is fresh and inspiring. I found her sentences expertly constructed and a joy to read. <br />The motivations of some of the characters, however, is not always easy to understand. Dominique Francon, for instance, loves Roark but feels compelled to destroy him; and when she no longer wishes to destroy him, marries someone lesser than Roark in an inexplicable act of self-contempt. The novel has other aspects that also strain credulity, such as Roark's long and preachy opening statement in his second jury trial, where he is little more than a talking-head for Ayn Rand's philosophy. (In fiction, this is called &quot;author intrusion,&quot; and is to be avoided.)<br />I like Ayn Rand, and sympathize strongly with her support of individualism over group-think statism.  Rand's philosophy jives closely with the writings of 18th Century British economist Adam Smith, who taught that every individual in pursuing his or her own good is led, as if by an invisible hand, to achieve the best good for all. Therefore any interference with free competition by government is almost certain to be injurious.  I agree.<br />Having said that, I do not believe that individual action (the &quot;lone eagle&quot; Roark approach) is always the most effective means of achieving success in every endeavor. There is the concept of synergy, where two or more individuals can produce more or create more than any one of them can do alone. This is the concept wherein &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.&quot; The Beatles achieved more as a group than any one of them ever did alone. The value of teamwork is illustrated by professional sports, and the concepts translate well to the business world, as most creative, productive endeavors require cooperative effort. Individualism is the engine of creativity and capitalism, but a volunatary association of individuals united in a common purpose can often accomplish more than an individual acting alone.  This is not a contradiction of either Ayn Rand or Adam Smith.<br />Howard Roark suffered much in his ascent to the top, but much of his suffering was avoidable or at least could have been mitigated by a better strategy, perhaps by seeking the assistance of a good publicist or marketer, the alliance of a competing journalist to Ellsworth Toohey, and by establishing a business network of professional association and cooperation with others who shared his modernist vision.<br />Ayn Rand's novel makes you think, and helps you determine where your own personal philosophy fits into the cacophony of competing ideals. But first and foremost, the Fountainhead is just good fiction. Enjoy.
B000005HFH|5.0|This cd collection is incredibly evocative -- you can almost hear the ice cubes clinking in glasses in a dimly lit, smoky club.  These recordings date from 1953-1956, and in spite of them being in mono, they're extremely clear and enjoyable.  Baker's earliest recorded vocal ('The thrill is gone') is here, along with 19 other classic examples of his singing -- moving interpretations of some of the finest songwriting of the early 20th century, works by Gershwin, Carmichael, Rodgers &amp; Hart, Kern, Burke &amp; VanHeusen, Cahn.  Most of the greats are represented here.<br />Baker's vocal style is unique and unmistakable -- at times it seems like he's hanging onto the melody by his fingernails.  He wraps his heart and soul around these tunes and lyrics -- going 'inside' so deeply that it's almost like there's no one else in the world but him as he takes each one and makes it his own, as few other vocalists before or since have been able to do.<br />The accompaniment throughout is retrained and well-played -- Baker's vocals and trumpet are joined by piano, upright bass and drums -- leaving his one-of-a-kind voice in the spotlight, where it belongs.  That being said, for those who have somehow managed to remain unexposed to his music, his style is never showy -- he was one of the most intimate singers I've ever heard.<br />If you need some music for a nice romantic evening -- dinner with someone special -- or if you just want to luxuriate in some of the finest jazz vocal performances you'll ever experience -- this is a great place to turn.<br />Interested in exploring the life and work of Chet Baker a little further?  Check out Bruce Weber's outstanding film portrait LET'S GET LOST, shot just a year or so before Chet's untimely death.  In the film, we're treated to some rare footage as well as some contemporary studio work (an Elvis Costello tune!), and some very candid, brutally honest recollections by Baker.  It's a great piece of documentary filmmaking.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is one of the most innovative and intriguing films of the past 10 years.  Other reviewers have certainly given the reader enough information to cover the film (read them).  The singular thing about it is the way the film successfully puts the viewer in exactly the same position as the protagonist - unable to &quot;connect the dots&quot;.  The story is told in short segments - in reverse order, causing the viewer to have to &quot;remember what came next&quot;, and - just as the protagonist - I felt almost compelled to take notes, just so I could piece the story together in some coherent way.  If this sounds uncomfortable, it is.  If it sounds unpleasant, it is not.  Rarely does a theatrical experience challenge the audience to this extreme.  The over-all look and feel is certainly 'Film Noir'.  In most cases, color tends to disrupt the feeling of 'Noir', but not here.  The whole experience is so unique that the mood is maintained throughout.  Amazingly enough, Memento manages to accomplish all this without ever seeming self-conscious.  There is no &quot;look how clever&quot; gloss.  The film accepts itself matter-of-factly - and so do we.  The cast is uniformly excellent, and the script is sharp and precise. Occasionally, a film comes along, which - because of its complexity or innovation - absolutely demands several viewings.  Memento is just such a film.  If you rent (rather than buy) it, you will soon find that you've paid the purchase price for repeated rentals.  Bite the bullet, and spring for your own copy!

I am happy to say that I can listen to each &amp; every song on this album without skipping. From the groove-filled &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin&quot; to the pillow talk of &quot;The Lady in My Life&quot;...no doubt, this LP/CD is still the best in its own right

B00005OAJ1|4.0|JB and KG can rock out, there is no arguing that.  I have been watching their series on HBO religiously and cannot get enough.  What disappoints me about this record is that it is not completely acoustic which is what I was hoping for.  The songs sound good with with percussion and electric guitars, but it is not the D I enjoy so much on tv.  It just seems some of the more sublte parts by KG have been glossed over.  Still a great cd but it could have been better.
B00000ICD9|1.0|I've seen many a bad film in my eighteen years of life,but this one takes the biscuit. Like many other robin williams films of recent years,it's just so damm forced with saccharine drenched sentiment,that it's likely to give you cancer. This is the only film i've watched that made me want to throw sledgehammer at my tv.(and i love my tv)At least you could laugh at battlefield earth and blair witch 2 but this just made me angry, almost violent. If there is any kind of movie likely to provoke violence,it's not's fight club or clockwork orange(now they are great films,and far more meaningful and challenging than this sappy mess)it's ...movie's like this. I honestly dont know why robin williams make's films like this,he is a talanted guy both a good comedic and dramatic actor. but i fancy ever since mrs doubtfire he has been involved in a nonstop sea of sugar and is losing his credibility fast.

B0000062FN|5.0|while i agree with most of the other reviews presented here--this is indeed the best album by the first version of santana-- a follow-up to the seminal abraxas, there are a couple of areas that need some clarification.<BR>neil schon plays as much (if not more at times) on this recording as does the leader. it is schon who plays the wah wah heavy solo on evwerybody's everything (with tower of power horn section). the recording quality, for its time, is unifromly excellent.<BR>as for mr. santana vs. mr. schon, carlos plays with the lyrical and emotional intensity that has become his trademark, but neil at the time really had more chops and plays with a ferocity well deserving of his recording debut. it was  rumored at the time that schon turned down an offer to tour with clapton's derek and the dominoes but instead opted to join up with santana and company--good choice!! the guitar harmonies (which according to carlos were inspired by eric and duane's work on layla) add an entire extra dimension to the santana 'formula.' neil's style is a bit more focused and straight ahead, but he would be eclipsed by carlos when carlos ventured into mahavishnu fusion territory. i remember seeing this band live once and was struck by the rocking intensity they brought to the concert. however, i must say that my favorite period of santana was his early 70s fusion phase-- caravanserei, lotus, the record he did with alice coltrane, etc. for straight ahead post woodstock santana that began to hint at things to come this record is a must!
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is a really awesome movie buy the dvd it's awesome!
B000002KOJ|4.0|Clouds was, perhaps, the album observers expected Joni Mitchell to release a year earlier.  In recording her debut, Song to a Seagull, Joni avoided those of her songs made famous by other artists in favor of a &quot;concept&quot; approach centered around fairy-tale and nautical imagery.  Pirates, seagulls, sailing ships, kings in tenement castles, I feel lost in the city.  Its performance values were stark, free-form, echo-laden, with pseudo-medieval formalism.  It was a verbose, grotesque, gorgeous-but-flawed treasure which was not for everybody.  <br />Clouds, on the other hand, introduced a more wide-open Joni, her soaring soprano far freer than on the debut, with simpler song and lyrical structure and a mountain-spring-water-purity to the recording after Dave Crosby's muddy castle-fortress echo.  Once again, the arrangements consist mainly of singer and guitar, although her voice is doubled and trebled more often, and the playing is closer to campfire strumming than on Song to a Seagull.  The songs on Clouds convey a lush romanticism made heartbreaking and wistful by tales of love that is at turns found, lost, uncertain, or doomed.  The album also unveils her own interpretations of several of her standards - &quot;Tin Angel,&quot; &quot;Chelsea Morning,&quot; &quot;I Don't Know Where I Stand,&quot; &quot;Both Sides Now.&quot;  The playing and lyrics are Joni at her most straightforward, and her voice is at its gorgeous best on some of the tracks.  <br />Although I love this album, I would rank it below several of her other pre-&quot;Don Juan&quot; discs - it is certainly my least favorite of her first period (the straightforward acoustic period, coinciding with her first four albums).  It doesn't have the curious charm of the debut or the soul-deep passion of Blue.  Ladies in the Canyon has a similar mood, but with far better arrangements and songwriting.  Her singing on some of the songs here - &quot;Tin Angel&quot; and &quot;The Fiddle and the Drum&quot; standout - is a rehash of her glum alto affectations on much of the debut.  She's better off when she climbs up into the high end of her range (away with those philistines who consider her top end unlistenable), especially on &quot;That Song about the Midway,&quot; in which Joni's high C's send haunted tingles down my spine.  &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot; certainly conveys a certain joyful ebulliance, but of Joni's &quot;token happy songs&quot; on her early albums (&quot;Night in the City,&quot; &quot;Big Yellow Taxi,&quot; &quot;Carey&quot;) I find it the weakest.  <br />Clouds is, of course, home to &quot;Both Sides Now,&quot; which is arguably Joni's signature song.  Melodically gorgeous and lyrically reflective, it seems to draw all of her epic romantic experiences into a sorrowful lesson - &quot;I really don't know love/life at all.&quot;
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is a really awesome great movie!!! I think this is the best movie ever made!!!!!!!!
B00005NZBN|5.0|Look at what this man has done in the past 12 years:  the wonderful &quot;Oh, Mercy,&quot; two stunning, traditional folk albums (including a Grammy for &quot;World Gone Wrong&quot;), the mesmerizing &quot;Bootleg Series,&quot; &quot;Live '66&quot; capturing one of the most important moments in 20th century music, an Academy Award for &quot;Things Have Changed,&quot; a nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature, a Kennedy Center Award, a Grammy for the haunting &quot;Time Out of Mind,&quot; and now the classic &quot;Love and Theft&quot;!!  Suddenly, Bob Dylan is the most accomplished artist of the past decade.  He did it from the age of 20-30, and he's done it again from the age of 50-60.  I hope everyone understands our great fortune in witnessing Bob Dylan's incomprehensible genius.  After all he's done, how does he find something different?!  &quot;Mississippi&quot; is as good as anything anyone has ever written, and this album would receive four stars if it contained &quot;Mississippi&quot; and a host of marginal songs.  However, there is not a single &quot;good&quot; song here -- they are all astonishing.  We had no right to expect anything of this magnitude from Dylan.  But thank God he once again exceeded everyone's expectations.
B00003CXE7|5.0|great movie I own it on dvd and vhs =-)
B000003S0I|3.0|After listening to &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; which i thought was very good and had many beautiful moments, i was disappointed by Larks in that overall it sounded very dry and dull.  I fail to see what KC was trying to do when they recorded this album.  I wish they would have said something about that in the newspaper clippings in the albums liner notes.  Until i hear something about their purpose behind this album  i cannot apreciate this album from the standpoint of a music fan, there is just no emotion like there is in a Yes or Beatles recording.  &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot; is an ok song and &quot;Larks..pt.1&quot; is slightly interesting, but other than that i'm sorry i got this cd.
B000003BF1|4.0|What truly drew me to album was not the singles, Keith or even Mick but Charlie Watts drumming on &quot;you can't always get what you want&quot;! Listen to this man pound on the skins and you can feel all the urgency and hopefulness that envelopes the closing of this album. Truly one of the most outstanding albums ever released. If you only want to own a few Stones albums then this should be at the top of your list!
B0000062FJ|5.0|I grew up listening to this album and it has quite honesly had a major influence on my musical tastes since.<BR>The cuban beats and raw guitar sound is simply un-matchable, totaly unique to Santana, but for me, its the beautiful and free form Hammond Organ sound of Gregg Rollie.  He is the reason that I learnt to play the Hammond. Although he is not as &quot;classically trained&quot; as some and not quite a &quot;virtuoso&quot; he is, to me the best.<BR>My personal favorite track is Soul Sacrafice.  This is the one made famous by their mad performance at Woodstock.  On the album it is just as raw and has just the same feel as that Woodstock performance.<BR>And the track Savor is superb, the congas and timbales are so fast and precise.<BR>If you are into Latino Rock or any rock come to that, then you must own a copy of this album.  <BR>Also get Abraxas and Santana 3.  They are also to the same high standard and just as raw.   Santana at their best.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but I sort of wanted to write one in response to the person from Whippany, NJ who said he couldn't find the movie anywhere on the two discs!  Is this person for real?  What in God's name is he doing?  He does have a DVD player, yes?  He's not attempting to view these discs with a VCR, is he?  My God.  Anyway, for the rest of you who have no trouble operating a remote control, this is a fantastic film.  Obviously.  Come on, it's &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;  Possibly the most enjoyable film ever made.  It's just optimism and love run amok.  Great cast.  Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are a perfect odd couple, and Robin Wright-Penn is stunning, even when she's doped-up and cracked-out in the 1960's.  Leonard Maltin doesn't know what he's talking about in saying he didn't buy Hank's performance.  Well, I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I think, in most everyone's opinion, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a great American film.  When you can find it.
B0000025GW|4.0|Here is Bob singing his heart out. In this case quite literally. That's because a year or so before releasing this album he became a 'Born again Christian' who felt so strongly that he should record this album. Here's Bob, been there done it, respected all over the world now singing the true meaning of life.<BR>This is a album you won't regreat buying, no matter who you are. With wonderful tunes and melodies to heart felt lyrics, you will not be dissapointed. <BR>Take that from me - who isn't even a Dylan fan!
B00005LQ04|1.0|is an understatement!  A boring plot line, tiresome special effects (which, by the way, DO NOT stand the test of time), and poor lighting throughout make this a movie I would line up to miss.  The only redeeming scene is the fall through a stained glass window, which is the only death in this movie that is worth watching in this ... attempt at the horror genre.
B000002C2E|5.0|I am at a loss to explain the reaction to the new Dylan disc, LOVE AND THEFT.  It's a fine album, and a surprisingly fun listen, but TIME OUT OF MIND is a far meatier piece of work and nothing less than a masterpiece, one of the great albums of all time.  Lyrically, LOVE AND THEFT has nothing as good as &quot;Don't know if I saw you...if I would kiss you or kill ya,&quot; that offsets the the simple but gorgeous melody of &quot;Standing in the Doorway&quot; on this collection.  This is an album with words that matter; lines leap out at the listener with a frequency that shows up much of today's music for the half-baked, formulaic sham it is.<br />  Elvis Costello actually said this was the best thing Dylan's EVER done, and Costello, one of the last remaining singer-songwriters of note, has written more than a few good ones of his own.<br />  Music this affecting rarely goes down easy; Dylan's fans should know that better than most listeners.  The many awards and accolades this album received were richly deserved, not the product of sympathy from an industry that was suddenly faced with the realization that Dylan wouldn't be around forever.  Enjoy LOVE AND THEFT -<br />it's a fun collection, the band sounds great, and it's just like Bob to confound expectations by following up his darkest album with one of his lightest. I doubt however, that it will be remembered among the canon of Dylan's most significant efforts, while TIME OUT OF MIND certainly will.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|I am now a true Child of the Corn after listening to this song. BUY IT! This is one of the best rock albums of all time.
0385424736|4.0|Grisham provides another gripping legal drama with an explosive pace, making this book hard to put down. The story has a little bit of everything; from the law student who finds himself in the role of David versus Goliath, the comical character played by Deck, there are the complimentary thugs and the token beautiful woman. Grisham weaves the story together magically and it makes for a very exciting read, building into a crescendo at the end with an unexpected twist. The only faux pas with this novel is that readers will invariably question whether the story could happen in real life. As a lawyer myself I seriously doubt it, but then real life tends not to be an interesting read. Apart from the fact that the story beggars belief, this makes for a definite purchase and comes close to the greatness of The Partner, but not quite.
B0000560XI|5.0|I was a late-comer, but I've fallen hard for the Buena Vista Social Club. I have the movie on DVD and the now-classic album on regular CD, the Classic Records super vinyl two-disc pressing and the DVD-A. Although I don't have a DVD-A audio player, the two-channel Dolby mix on this disc on my standard DVD player hooked up to my stereo is superior to the standard CD and a match for ... Classic set. There's far more depth in the soundstage, the vocal have outstanding presence and the instrumental solos have incredible punch. It's all especially amazing in view of the fairly primitive recording situation Ry Cooder and crew found in Cuba, where, among other things, they had to worry about fluctuations in electrical current affecting analogue tape recorder speeds!
B00004Z459|3.0|Basically the scoop is that linkin park are a good band which blend a mixture of basic hip hop from mike and chester to uproaring sounds of heavy punkish rock music, no doubts about it I like the band but they are a bit to mainstream for my liking and I realise that these guys will end up with no one liking them anymore so if you like there singles one step closer,crawlin,papercut and in the end buy it.  Best song for me is a place for my head and other bands i reccomend are HED P.E oh yeah! sevendust (Cool band) and godsamck.
B00003CXWV|4.0|OK, so Blow doesn't support a huge all star cast, or an ambitious multi-angled plot, but to be quite frank, I thought most of Traffic was a load of pretentious, preachy Hollywood smarm. With the exception of Benicio Del Toro scenes (which were fantastic and well deserving of an Oscar), the movie had all the personality and believability of &quot;As the World Turns.&quot;<br />Blow is much less ambitious in it's scope and cast, but what it lacks in sophistication, it more than makes up for in it's charm and honesty. That's not to say that facts weren't changed for whatever reason, but the protagonist isn't made out to be some herculean character. He's just a normal, likeable guy who made lots of tragic mistakes in life that lead to a path of self destruction. The movie doesn't preach or try to be all things to all people. It is what it is, and the people act like, well... people. What they do they do for their own reasons, not to further the plot. That's what makes the movie great, it's about people being people and all the stupid, unpredictable things they do.<br />Oh, it's also about drugs, how could we forget. But the whole drug aspect seems very secondary to the human aspect. There are no grandiose speeches abut the War of Drugs and how we should spend more money on treatment than prevention or anything even close to that, but it also doesn't portray drugs in a glamorous or friendly way. Drugs can never be human, and this movie portrays them as neither evil, misguided or liberating. They are what they are: just another inanimate substance with a disproportionate social significance.<br />Kudos as usual to Johnny Depp. After seeing the interviews with Jung in prison, it was almost creepy to see Depp mimic him. Depp does his best work when portraying real people like Hunter S. Thompson, Donnie Brasco, Ed Wood and the like. Depp goes so far as to adopt every subtle little nuance of a person making his performance completely believable. It was impossible for me not to sympathise with Jung, regardless of his selfish behavior. <BR> <BR>The DVD boasts some great special features that I have only begun to explore. Chief among these is the aforementioned prison interviews. There is also a host of deleted scenes and a commentary with both the director and Jung. Good Stuff.
B00000JR2A|3.0|It has become pretty well known that Roland Orzabal, the guiding light behing TFF has had a tendency to be a little too much of a perfectionist. Let me start off by saying that the title cut is probably the most fantastic sonic adventure I have ever experienced (although its sound is very Beatlesque Sgt. Pepper period it is original on its own and a true masterpiece). The rest just kind of leaves me flat and it is not because of lack of effort or melody. It just seems kind of overblown. &quot;Badlands&quot; tries to incorporate jazz influences but just comes off as long and tedious. Other cuts are tuneful and melodic enough but just don't move me. I think a lot might have to do with how brilliant the title cut is and I am being honest. I expected to just be blown away with the rest of it but was dissappointed because everything pales in comparision.
0064471837|5.0|I read the Harry Potter books and I loved them, then I found Sabriel and Lirael.  Sabriel was the best book I had ever read and I'm not a reader, now I can't get enough. It's really good, suspenceful. I could'nt wait till Lirael came out now I'm just waiting for Abhorsen
B00005NB0H|3.0|How did the Who's tightest, shortest, and most devastating album of the 60's become the most cynically reissued and bloated 30 years later?<BR>The original &quot;Leeds&quot; (7 songs, under 40 minutes) was brutal, all slashing riffs, banshee wails, and scorching feedback.  Granted, the 1995 reissue greatly improved the sound quality, and it was hard to complain when it revealed such inspired performances of &quot;Fortune Teller&quot; and &quot;A Quick One&quot;. <BR>But the inclusion of only one 'Tommy&quot; number on that reissue could only whet the appetites of fan's for the whole show.  And here it is.  And MCA has successfully bilked you into buy a 2nd (or maybe 3rd) copy of this document, which, as always, represents the live Who at their absolute peak.  Hopefully, this version corrects the atrocious vocal edits used on the 1995 version (I'll have to compare it with the original).  But it's hard not to feel a bit (or, more precisely, a LOT) cheated.  But that's the way it goes, I guess, and at least we can rest easy that we now hold the definitive document of the greatest live band of the 60's.  Until the deluxe Dolby 5.1 DVD version comes out in 2006.
0060955775|5.0|I just finished this book.  I am almost at a loss for words. <br />This poignant novel tells the story of a young woman named Veronika who seems to have everything: beauty, a loving family, a good job, etc.  However she feels empty inside, wondering what the purpose of life may be if things will just go downhill from then on.  Thus she decides to end her life, cleanly and quietly.<br />Yet she does not succeed.  She awakens sometime later in a mental hospital, Villete, and is told she only has days to live, as her attempt left unreparable damage on her heart.<br />She attempts to find ways to end her life more quickly while trapped in Villete, but ends up finding LIFE instead.  With a death sentence creeping up on her, she battles inwardly between her previous wish to die, and her current fascination and discovery of life.<br />We all know how we are &quot;supposed&quot; to live, the rules and regulations that we abide by each and every day without even realizing it.  Is this living?  Paulo Coelho addresses this question brilliantly.  Veronika's lesson is one that should be heeded by all.  Unforunately it seems that those who truly live their own lives will instead be deemed &quot;insane&quot; or &quot;crazy&quot; by the law-abiding people surround them.  What is life?  Who can define another's choices, characteristics, and temperments?  If a CEO decides not to wear a tie to work anymore, because he says it is stupid to nearly choke on a piece of fabric for ten hours everyday, who is to decide if he is crazy or not?<br />These questions and more like them will invade your thoughts after reading &quot;Veronika Decides to Die&quot;.  I strongly urge young and old, male and female, directed and hopeless, to read this book.  I think we can all use a little insight into life.
0767849493|4.0|1.  Dogma has a great script and an exceptionally talented cast including Alan Rickman, Linda Fiorentino, and Chris Rock.<br />2.  Dogma was directed by a devout Catholic named Kevin Smith who endured the trials of Job when it was found that this little fantasy was critical of THE CHURCH.<br />3.  Dogma is Smith's 4th movie.  He had only a brief stint at a film school. Each movie's direction/production values have improved by leaps and bounds.  He is lucky enough to be able to finance his projects while still learning his craft.<br />4.  Dogma, unlike most comedies, will actually make you think, even while you laugh.<br />5.  Smith deserves our support...he continues to improve, and his movies entertain and are full of witty dialogue, so why should we complain?<br />6.  Just by doing Clerks, he showed he had more cojones than all the fanboys out there.<br />7.  Dogma is occasionally pedantic, but mostly funny as hell.<br />As I'm still growing up myself, I'll leave it there....
B00003CXTG|1.0|Let me think here...pearl harbor...japanese attack on our land...WWII...millions lost in that war....Normandy....Nagaski...Heroshima...love story??  um..no<br />the only good part was when the movie ended...Cuba Gooding Jr.  as a ship's mate going up to a 15mm gun and shooting a zero down??sex in the parachute hanger??  being shot down in a spitefire over the english channel by the Luftwaffe and jumping out into german encrusted waters with U-boats and the navy everywhere and living while your wounded?? in a nutshell, its was a great idea, as great an idea as taking Monty Python seriously..Jerry Brockheimer has made some terrific movies and disney has made some terrifically bad movies, put them together and the PC structured, don't say that, don't show that methods of disney show thru the creative and often dramatic essence of Brockheimer...This has as much potential as a good movie as a baby with a pork chop tied around its neck has a chance to excape  for a pack of hungry wild wolves..
B00003CXP1|5.0|The name of my review is the original title for this work of art, but it also sums up this film's plot. Even though I have some OOP Criterion DVDs and a couple of limited editions, I am very proud to call this the centerpiece of my collection. This had a personal effect on my life and changed my look on life and drugs. The last breath you take at the end of this film will be the first breath of your new life.<br />Requiem For A Dream is the story of four midsuburan individuals who have hopes and dreams for there lives that could not happen. Ellen Burstyn (from The Exorcist) plays Sarah Goldfarb, who gets addicted to speed. Jared Leto plays Harry Goldfarb, who gets addicted to heroin. Jennifer Connely plays Harry's girlfriend Marion, who gets addicted to heroin also. And, for a suprise, Malon Wayans plays a serious role as Tyrone, who is addicted to heroin also. They are great actors (especially Ellen) and give the performances of there lives.<br />The editing on this film is amazing. The drug taking sequences, the last 30 minutes in the film, they are all perfectly editited. The cinematography and sound make you see through the junkies world. You hear what they hear, you see what they see. You especially see the last 30 minutes through the eyes. That 30 minutes is very intense.<br />As I am writing this review, I am watching this film for the third time. It is that good. Gladiator robbed it of it's Best Picture award and Julia Roberts stole the Best Actrees from Ellen Burstyn. Bravo to the cast and crew of Requiem For A Dream. I recommend this film to everyone and this trufuly is a film of films. This will change your life for the better.<br />Also Recommended:<BR>Fight Club<BR>Pi<BR>Trainspotting<BR>Requiem For A Dream (Book)<BR>A Clockwork Orange
B00005OAJ1|4.0|This album is a long time coming. The D has been around for years and I can't believe it took this long for a formal album to come out. The tracks are both hilarious and musically sound. If these guys wanted to, they could be legit rock-stars (if they aren't already). Jack Black has amazing vocals, and Kyle Gass adds flavor on guitar. Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) provides amazing drums on several tracks. I would name some favorite tracks, but I like them all. Pick this up today. You will not regret it.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Probably closer to 3.5 stars. I bought the Limited Edition CD and I feel a few tracks from the CD proper could have been cut and placed on the bonus CD instead. All in all however, this is a really good CD with some exceptional tracks e.g. New York, New York, Gonna Make You Love Me, and Touch, Feel and Lose. The production is superb (Ethan Johns' Hammond is also quite nice) and Adams' vocals are exceptional on most tracks. A very diverse album that will likely expand Ryan Adams' fame to new heights.
B00005NW02|5.0|When i heard system of a downs first cd i loved it but there were a few tracks that i really didn't care for. the new cd however i have fell in love with every song. it's heavy it's waltzy it's everything you've ever dreamed of in a system of a down cd..if you like system of a down i'd deffinatly tell you to buy this cd!!!!!!
B00005NWRS|3.0|Ryan Adams is an incredibly dynamic artist.  He hops from style to style and develops so quickly that any album is bound to be just a snapshot of what he's doing at the moment.  This is an unfortunate time to take a picture.<BR>Gold starts off relatively strong, ends relatively strong, but swims through a very long rough patch for most of its length.  There are two key problems here, the first being the pathetic production values probably imposed by his new label.  Ryan retains the authentic, rough, a little sloppy but very in the moment style of his last album but now we get horns, strings, howling female background vocalists and more more more!  Could have worked but I'm afraid it doesn't.<BR>The second problem with this album is that Adams' brilliant lines, the ones that give you chills but seem so simple, are either missing or buried in the arrangements.<BR>Pleasant but certainly not brilliant or up to expectations.  I'll be looking for more next time &amp; I suspect Ryan Adams himself has moved on from this.  A light-weight transitional album from one of the best songwriters around.
B000021YQV|3.0|well, i didn't know what to expect. i liked the single and was interested enough to check it out. their first album is great. this one slips a little. it's still a good album but at times the songwriting seems forced in way. a couple of songs sound like filler. and his lyrics are not as thought out. &quot;prison song&quot; is a little too blantantly political to be enjoyed as a good song.  it can repititious at times (loud/screaming-soft/singing-loud-soft again-screaming again, ect.) overall one of the better albums to come out this year.  i also recommend slipknot's iowa.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|After watching Memento, my wife and I sat up talking about it for a long time. The story is a classic detective mystery with a couple of big twists - first, the detective cannot form new memories, because of an injury he has suffered. This means that he retains information for at most ten minutes, and may well forget the beginning of a conversation by the end, or if distracted.<br />The second twist is a creative result of the first - the director has chosen to let the audience experience some of what life might be like for this character by showing the scenes in reverse order. For the most part, the movie unfolds backwards!<br />One result of this is that performances by Carrie-Anne Moss, Guy Pierce, and Joe Pantoliano shine even brighter, as you see their actions, then the motivations for their actions later on. Layer upon subtle layer, the characters and situations are built, until we arrive at the beginning of the film, and the biggest twist of all.<br />See Memento. It's one of the most creative movies I've seen in a lifetime of cinema.<br />** NOTE: Rated R - there is a ton of bad language and a couple of brief scenes of brutal violence.**
B000002J1I|1.0|Is what I thought when I heard it just recently.  Veteran musicians putting out a competent, tired work.  It does have some interesting ideas, but these are lost in the overall scheme of things.
B00000JQFM|4.0|This is surely one of the ones to have if you like Joe Satriani.<BR>The last track, &quot;Echo&quot;, is my favorite song of all of Joe's works I have heard.  <BR>The tracks are all clean studio grade stuff - a nice reference when listening to the same songs live on Joe's other albums.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I would just like to congradulate Tom Hanks on making another good decision to do a movie.  He has made some good decisions in the past including &quot;Forest Gump&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and now &quot;Cast Away&quot;.  All three of these movies were rather long in length and it works great.  Tom Hanks' incredible change in body composition in the movie really shows how dedicated he was and adds a lot to the cinematic experience.  He goes from a well fed FED-EX worker to a skin and bones cast away.  It was really brave of Tom Hanks to accept doing this movie knowing that he would be the only character on screen for a large portion of the film.  He held the audience's attention well and this movie is a success.  The reason why I gave this movie a four was because of the ending.  It was not totally satisfying.  Yes it was open enough that we assume more good things will happen but to leave a movie theatre totally satisfied is better than leaving wondering too much....
0812550706|5.0|An uncle of mine gave me this book.  I wasnt previously a science fiction fan, let alone a Card fan.  Now im both.  This book is so...so...so HUMAN.  Maybe its because of the fact that i was a young boy, like Ender, when i read it, but something about this book is unforgettable.  I can pick it up still today and just read random pages of it, and ill enjoy it.  The story is so touching, and even though Ender is a genius, i think he has an every-man quality that is undescribable.  A previous reviewer mentioned that the queen as weakness idea was a drawback to the book.  He obviously didnt read the whole book, or maybe hes just ignorant.  The weakness he speaks of was actually the alien homeplanet.  The queen turned out to be the very opposite, giving Ender a new hope.
B00003CXXI|5.0|My 3 1/2 yr old and 11 yr old boys love this movie!  We've seen it 3 times and will own it as soon as it's out.  It's got a little adult humor mixed in with the great animation but I think it's fine for all audiences.  It's definitely worth owning and watching over and over!  I think my guy brushes his teeth better now so they won't look like Shrek's!!
B00005OAJ1|2.0|Tenacious D is indeed the greatest band in the world but this album is not a good example of their work.  What this is a good example of is the record industry taking an artist and watering them down so that their true essence is mild enough not to disturb or offend anyone.  They have become homogonized and sprinkled with mass appeal. The unadulterated RAWK of Tenacious D lay primarily in their simplicity and passion; this album has been overproduced, as was my fear when I heard of this undertaking.  I only hope the D doesn't bring the Dust Brothers and their unneccesary sound effects on tour with them.  Long live the D.
B00005QW5X|3.0|Deliciously tacky movie version of John Cameron Mitchells brilliant Broadway show isnt pulled off as easily on film, as it gets a bit too excessive in its last third, but its lead is such a dynamic star that it is worth a good look. Telling the story of an internationally ignored rock star transsexual who, following a botched sex-change operation, now has the angry inch of the title, Mitchell as director uses too many silly animated sequences to tell the charming story of how Hedwig travelled from East Berlin to America only to have all her songs stolen from her by her once best friend Tommy Gnosis, a teenager who is now an international rock star. The highlight of the film, and the mainly memorable aspect of it, is the fantastic collection of songs written by Stephen Trask, that are all toe-tapping and will stay in your head for days.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Mounting suspense, witty dialogue, great performances and so much to watch. Four reasons to see this movie immediately. If it's your first time watching Hitchcock, this might be a good place to start. The story centers around photographer L.B. Jefferies (played by Jimmy Steweart), who is confined to his apartment because of his broken leg. He is visited regularly by his nurse Stella (played by Thelma Ritter) and his socialite girlfriend Lisa (played by the luminous Grace Kelly). As for that, he really has nothing more to pass the time with. So he begins to spy on his neighbors. From this, several miny story-lines enfold but the most interesting by far is that of a man who appears to have murdered his wife. As the evidence becomes more clear, the suspense mounts and leads to a gripping conclusion that is much better than any in a modern day horror movie. A movie like 'Rear Window' is so interesting to watch because there is so much for us to watch. There's Jeff's story line, the possibility of a murder and all of the other things going on around him that gives the viewer something interesting and new. In a way, 'Rear Window' is like an homage to movies themselves. What is Jefferies doing? He's a voyeur. What are we when we watch movies? Getting the idea? Maybe that's what makes this movie so interesting to watch. As Stella quoted, we've become a race of peeping toms. So watch 'Rear Window', you won't regret it.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Lackluster adaptation of the hugely popular video game that has Angelina Jolie filling in more than ably for the title character. Swaggering around in great clothing and accesorized by the coolest gadgets imaginable, Jolie's Lara Croft is an action woman extraordinaire, seizing her audience by storm with her powerful physical and emotional presence, and presenting the most popular female action hero since Sigourney Weaver first started battling those evil aliens. The story, however, isn't up to her standards, wasting the gorgeous around the world locales and strong supporting cast in favour of overly-edited action scenes and deceptive but ultimately useless character development (all the scenes about Croft dealing with her father's untimely death never really tell us anything about her or her relationship with him). The plot, such as it is, concerns our heroine racing against time to save the world from being taken over by a Venice-based power cult called the Illuminati who require an ancient talisman to be used in a ritual during a powerful solar eclipse. Between these guys and Hannibal Lecter running a museum in Venice, the place has certainly fallen off my personal list of future vacation spots. Though it features many good visual effects and exciting battles in ancient temples and all the trappings you hope for in a film of this sort, there's always the feeling that something's missing. Once you reach the finale and find out it's topped off by the most anti-climactic ending of the year, you have finished watching an okay but unremarkable movie starring a very impressive but underused leading lady. And yes, her breasts are everywhere all the time. Looking forward to a better sequel.
6305176299|5.0|Speed takes off at the beginning credits, and you are off for the ride of your life. Non stop action galore, and plenty of<br />twist and turns in the road to keep you speeding to the very<br />riviting climax. Keanu Reeves plays LAPD officer Jack Traven<br />to the hilt, a devil may care kind of guy, who feels invinsible as long as he has his partner, played by Jeff Daniels, Harry<br />Temple by his side. He rolls along through life at super speed,<br />until he crosses a bitter, and bomb savey, ex-policeman Howard<br />Payne, played very chillingly evil by Dennis Hopper. Payne's<br />game of cat and mouse on a LA Bus, leads Jack to the realization<br />that he is not invinsible, and just might take a bus full of<br />very innocent people with him. Sandra Bullock, as the sweet and caring Annie, who fate put in the wrong place at the right time, is along for the ride of her life trying to keep the bus and<br />everyone on board in one piece. Speed has it all, action, thrills, plot twist galore, and a little romance, too. You'll<br />love, not like this movie. I give it 5 stars, and would have<br />given it more.......Reeves and Bullock should work together again.
B00003CXXS|2.0|Weak entry in the dinosaur saga has some scenes so scary they surpass the work done by Steven Spielberg in his previous two films (Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park), but without a good plot or any sense of excitement the result is still a dud. Sam Neill gives a tired performance in his return as Dr. Alan Grant, who is commissioned by a supposed millionaire and his wife to take them on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna (the island where the dinosaurs had been created in the second film) as an anniversary present to them. Little does he know, they plan on landing on the island. Naturally all mayhem ensues, and let me tell you some of the scenes with the pterodactyls had me clinging to the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, the characters really are tired, Neill isn't the slightest bit solid and the dialogue verges on the ridiculously mundane. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are quite fun as the foolish couple, and Laura Dern is lovely in a small (and stupidly manipulative) appearance as her character Ellie Sadler. The visual effects continue to be top notch. One of the weakest endings of the year for sure.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Too many people who don't like this film becasue they don't understand the way this film was made. This is the film that broke the rules and as a result, every movie in some way borrows from this one, The acting is phenominal from all cast members and I don't even need to mention the screenplay and direction. This is a film for the ages that one viewing cannot do justice. This isn't the kind of film you watch on the surface only, because no one thing in this movie has a single meaning. &quot;Rosebud&quot; is more than just a sled, or a lost childhood. The film says it best that no one word can describe a man, and that is what Citizan Kane was doing; describing a complicated man from different points of view. This is, indeed, the greatest film made. <BR>  And on the DVD: The picture is outstanding! I've never seen this film look so good. And for film buffs, the feature commentaries by both Peter Bogdonavich and Roger Ebert are excellent and give you a whole new perspective on the film. The documentary that comes with it, Battle over Citizen Kane is haunting.<BR>  This movie is a must-see and must-own for anyone who appreciates great filmmaking.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Gothic and beautiful but empty-headed follow-up to Jonathan Demme's perfect The Silence of the Lambs that has Julianne Moore ably filling in for Jodie Foster's role as Clarice Starling. The change in cast is most appropriate, actually, since Demme's film had a documentary-like grunge feel to it that Foster fit perfectly (not to say that she's not glamorous), while as here director Ridley Scott has filmed the entire thing as if it were a grand opera, and Moore's classic looks and striking hair colour fit the visual fabric of the film so much better. Other than that, there's not much to it-the plotline is basically finishing off loose ends that the characters didn't wrap up last time, with Starling chasing Hannibal Lecter (the always impressive Anthony Hopkins) across two continents to save him from himself. There's no one to save in the nick of time, there's no driving plotline, nor are there any interesting characters (Giancarlo Giannini's turn as a cop who goes after Lecter in the most ham-fisted of ways is so predictable as to induce yawning when his outcome finally arrives), and so you're left with a film that's all dressed up and no where to go. That said, it also features some of the most disgusting and disturbing images I've ever seen on film, all the more annoying because there's nothing of value to attach them to.
B000002AGE|5.0|Heavy Weather is a masterpiece. Not everybody gets it. Nonetheless, it is not only Weather Report's best album and one of the best Jazz Fusion albums of all time but perhaps a top-ten album in all of Jazz. It is Jaco's (who loves you?) best Weather Report appearance as well. All the pieces come together on this album from start to finish. Well, enough dancing about architecture... Check it out.
0440219078|5.0|I think that The Giver, by Lois Lowry was a very good book. It showed society through the eyes of an adolescent boy who felt different from everybody else. This novel is particularly well-written in that it shows if someone feels different from society, they do not have to try to change. In The Giver, Jonas does not agree with the rest of society's views, and that is okay. Jonas does not change his personal morals and opinion, which takes great strength but is shown to be worth it in the end. Staying true to one's own beliefs is a very important lesson that is taught through this book.
B000002MIB|4.0|I was kind of dissapointed when I learned that the only live Van Halen album was all with Sammy Hagar. I don't despise Sammy Hagar like some Van Halen fans do, but David Lee Roth was probably the better performer. Still, this is a really good album. Even hearing Hagar sing the Roth-era classics(e.g. Jump, Panama) is really cool. Also worth noting is Alex Van Halen's Pleasure Dome solo. I didn't think much of Alex before I heard this, but that solo is incredible. It lasts about 8 minutes, and never gets boring. Of course Eddie is in top form throughout. The whole band sounds like they're having a really good time on stage. Any Van Halen fan should check it out.
B00003CY3W|5.0|Ghost World drew me into it's characters and quirky situations like no film has done since Rushmore. About the middle of the film I found myself saying in my head, &quot;I am LOVING this movie!&quot; Thorah Brich plays Enid, a young girl, fresh out of high school, who just can't find her place in the world. She approaches almost every situation with a certain detachment which reflects this. She is pretty much torturous to others, though she never intends on HURTING anyone, she is just, detached. She has only one friend, Melora, played by Debra Azar, though through the film, they begin to drift appart. This is set in motion when they play a cruel and thoughtless trick on the pitiful Seymor, played by Steve Buscemi (Yay!) Enid becomes fond of Seymore, at first out of pitty, but it grows to something more. The film leads to a phenomenal and surrealistic ending, which brought me to tears. The film has many moments when it is both amusing, and sad and the same time. It also takes some risks I was VERY pleased to see a movie tackle, and acomplish. I loved every ounce of this delicious film. I wanted to walk right back in the theater and watch it again. Please, see this movie, support it's makers, it is a very special treasure. Yay.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|If you aren't offended easily, buy this CD!
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall is one of the few great jazz pianists and vocalists to come along in many years.  I have all her albums, and I am a huge fan.  This album is, I hope, the last in a downward spiral of marketing agents run amok.  Someone decided to take a great jazz musician and transform her into a &quot;Sex Kitten Accompanied By Strings.&quot;  The modeling photos and the(muzac-like)symphony orchestras are an insult to a musician who is at the top of her form in her earlier albums with just her trio or quartet.  Please, please Diana, lose the phony image stuff, and get back to the very solid, hard-swinging jazz albums that place you in the ranks of the jazz greats.
0783231482|5.0|John Belushi and Dan Akroyd prove to be one of the greatest musical, criminal,comedy, and acting duos of all time in this film.  The Blues Brothers has been my favorite movie since the age of twelve.  The mixture of comedy, music, dancing, car chases, politics, and religion is a perfect blend!
B000005JAK|5.0|In fact, the aid of a big record label helped the band's sound immensely. Gone is the razor-thin production that hindered the power of their SST albums. Though the sound is still very treble heavy, the band sounds much more fresh and alive here than it did in the past.<br />This might not be their best album, but it certainly has a lot of their best pop nuggets. Fast, poppy hardcore fans of punk and power-pop alike will enjoy. Play it VERY loud!!
B00004WLXZ|1.0|While the ad for the DVD states the running time length for Day of Freedom at 30 min., it is actually the same old 17 minute version that everyone else carries and the visual quality is no better than any standard VHS. I bought the DVD for the sole purpose of seeing the 30 minute Day of Freedom and was saddened to see the usual version, which for academic purposes is missing all of Reel #2.
B00003CXRP|5.0|To tell you the truth after viewing this film more than once, I am clueless as to why Tom Hanks did not win the academy award for this.  This movie is fascinating.  Tom Hanks plays a federal express executive whose plane crashes into the sea killing all on board but him. What follows is the most amazing almost without dialog acting you have ever seen.  I highly recommend it.
B00000DGUG|5.0|This cd took me aback at first because it is so drastically different from Jagged Little Pill. The beat in some songs is so tweaked that it falls under no specific genre of music. However, it is one of the best cds i own. With her introspective lyrics and thought-provoking tunes, it defies all music. I love it!
0060987464|5.0|Marilyn Manson has always been an outspoken man, but in his autobiography, it goes to a new level.  &quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot; is brutally honest and extremely compelling, and Manson himself paints a picture of himself as an underneath it all too human figure that his music just covers up.  The saying Sex, Drugs, and Rock 'N Roll never took such meaning until this book was written.
0613127536|4.0|Surprise--better than the movie.  I don't like this sort of movie much, but the book is fabulous.
B000002LKU|5.0|Simply put, this album is a serendipitious rapture of country/folk rock that mellows the listeners mood.  Once listened to, this upbeat CD will be an immediate favorite.
B00005NWRS|5.0|I drove from Indianapolis to Nashville and back in one day just to see Ryan Adams perform at a little bar with a stage.  He was incredible.  Puts on one of the greatest shows ever.  Gold is an amazing album, not as rocking as his live shows, more mellow and better to listen to when you want to relax.  Just buy the CD.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This is the defining anime. Everything about this movie is beautiful: Characters, backgrounds, MUSIC, story, plot, setting, even the voice overs. Without giving too much away, bascially, the government is trying to harness and control the power of the gods, which they are finding in these kids. The story of what happens in the process unfolds itself in the 2 hours of non-stop entertainment. And let me make clear, there is a REAL story here. The plot is hazy right up until the end, but the story has you wide-eyed all the way thru. No unneccesary violence to fill time, just pure action. If you're a first time anime viewer, this movie is for you. If you're already an anime fan, this is a MUST have for your collection. I can't say more. This is THE defining movie, plain and simple. Watch it. Buy it.
0393312836|5.0|This book is an amazing trip. Through the narration of Alex, a young miscreant, we see his transformation from free-roaming criminal to a thing, the botched result of a government experiment. The book is really good in the philosophical arguments it brings up: Can people be changed from bad to good without choice? What will society sacrifice to feel safe? Is humanity in the choice to be right? It is one of the most provocative novels I have ever read.<br />And that's just half of it. Burgess writes with an original prose that is used by Alex and his criminal buddies. This helps immensely to portray the graphic implications of their activities without actually being graphic. Even though we see the bad things he does, we still feel a connection with him and share in his pain in his treatment. Maybe it is his childlike glee or the fact that the people that are supposed to protect the public are far more insidious. A brilliant book, read it even if you've seen the film, because this book has another chapter which changes the end of the story and gives it a more hopeful tone.
B00003CXTG|3.0|This was a movie worthy of seeing, assuming that you know that you are watching a love story and not watching a lot of history. Surely the action scenes are great and the movie generally followed history. The problem is that they could have done the same love story and not changed the historical facts. In the movie Midway, history was followed almost to minute detail. They did throw in the love story angle and the ficticious hero, Matt Garth (Charlton Heston), with his son falling in love with the Japanese girl. This did not take away from a very good historical movie. Who knows why the makers of Pearl Harbor decided to gloss over much of history? Even the scenes of ships exploding in the harbor were obviously modern warships used as props. I was hoping to see WWII era destroyers and cruisers but no such luck. It looked strange to see modern frigates and guided missile cruisers being bombed by the Japanese in 1941. The bottom line is that they made a good movie and blew the chance to make a great movie. If you want to see history, see Tora Tora Tora!.  If you want a movie with an love story and great computer generated special effects, see Pearl Harbor.
B00003CXDD|5.0|If you want to get a movie that is worth your money...there is no better purchase that you could make (probably in your whole life) than buying this movie.  This movie is classic.
B00005AWTR|3.0|As Clapton ages he sinks deeper and deeper to his &quot;roots&quot; in the blues.  I thought Reptile to lack the creativity that I have loved in his music.  His themes (musically and thematically) seem stale.  I have only listen to the album twice and have no desire to go back.  Three stars for production quality and the fact that even stale Clapton is better than most musicans.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Pop at its best. For those who think that the first Radiohead was the best they made, you will realize that there is something coming next...From 'New Born' up to 'Megalomania', not a single track is too much. Review's over 'cause the music should talk by itself. Enjoy the journey
B00005LQ04|4.0|For those of us who think that Wes Craven is the master of the horror genre, we can think again. I'm speaking these words after watching &quot;Suspiria,&quot; one of the most frightening and terrifying horror movies ever made. Created by Italian director Dario Argento, the movie manages to be menacing and gory at the same time, and Argento fills his canvas with a vast array of vivid yet bizarre colors, eerie lighting and camera techniques, and a soundtrack to top all horror soundtracks. In short, this is one hell of a scary movie! <br />The plot is a basic one, more of a vehicle for Argento's explorative imagination. It begins with a storm, as young Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in Germany to attend ballet school. Argento wastes no time in creating a sense of unease, from her cab ride to the school, as she watches the colors of street lights in the pouring rain, to the gruesome and outright malicious murder of a runaway student. All of this happens within the first ten minutes, which should be a message of what lies ahead (in other words, be prepared). <br />The movie then takes us to the school itself, a dazzling array of vivid colors and elaborate set pieces that put the house in Robert Wise's &quot;The Haunting&quot; to shame. Susy is shown the many rooms and introduced to the staff and students, though discovers that she will be rooming off campus. That is, until she begins to get suspicious about strange occurrences, and the staff relocates her to the premises. Her suspicions mount higher, and she begins to wonder if there isn't more to the ladies that run the academy. <br />You may find yourself forgetting the plot behind all of this mayhem, but that's perfectly reasonable, given the fact that Argento seems to be more interested in attacking our minds than provoking them. And he succeeds in doing just that, taking us into the darkest depths of horror with his adept use of gore, bursting colors, camera movements and creepy sounds from all around. <br />This is extremely unsettling stuff here, some of the most elaborate yet unbearable set pieces ever constructed for a film. The beginning murder sequence is a true shocker, one that we see coming, but never in such a gruesome manner. Other sequences involve a blind man being attacked by his own seeing-eye dog, multiple stabbings, a girl's corpse coming back to life... it never stops. <br />But it all works due to Argento's ability to get under our skin before shocking us out of it. Before each scene of brutality, there is a wonderful buildup of suspense and terror, because even though we know what's going to happen, we're totally in the dark as to how it will occur. He keeps us waiting impatiently by employing a slowly building soundtrack, heightened by slow camera movements that center on the faces of the person involved. <br />&quot;Suspiria&quot; will remain in the memory long after its first viewing; in fact, you may never forget it. It stands out as a visionary masterpiece, one for the senses and the mind, a horror film that transcends the boundaries of the genre. I was intrigued by every minute of this film, which keeps you in the moment long after it's already passed.
0871137380|5.0|For starters this book is graphic and pulls no punches, which I think it a good thing.  It also acknowledges the Somali point of view, which makes it all the more disturbing.  I was in the process of reading it when the Sept. 11th attacks occurred and it really put things into perspective as to what the modern soldier faces in combat and what we ask our men and women in the arm forces to do in harms way.  No one can walk away from this book and not have a greater respect for America's armed forces and a better understanding of the role the USA plays in the world.  Whether you agree or disagree with America's involvement in world politics, this book accurately portrays the reality and enemies our soldiers face in modern combat.  You will never again take military involvement lightly or treat it as a the news item of the evening.  These soldiers were a victims of a bad situation and ultimately a politically motivated military action instead of a military operation.  Lastly, Bowden makes a critical observation on page 410 - 412 about the countries we are trying to assist and whether we have an obligation to do so.  This engagement was a wake up call for the US and forces us to revisit how we deal with these types of situations in the future. Gog Bless America and thank you to all our men and women in uniform.
0380002930|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing.  It is a great book to read to your kids, or to yourself!  The characters, despite being rabbits, are well constructed and believable.  The characters make the book, and they certainly do their job here.  This book will make you look at rabbits in an entirely different light!  <br />DON&quot;T PASS THIS BOOK UP just because it looks like a children's novel!!!!!
1567184855|5.0|A very interesting book.    There are many books which try to help us make sense of life's primary questions:  Where did we come from?  Why are we here?  Where are we going?  There are also many which try to do so using information gathered from hypnotic regression.  But none are so well organized and coherent as this.  I went on to read all of Newton's work after this.
0060955775|5.0|...is not worth living. <br />I love this book. When it was first recommended by a friend my first reaction was \\"Gosh, that sounds so morbid\\". On the contrary the book dwells not on death but on the joys of living.<br />Veronika is not your classic suicide victim. She is beautiful, bright and has a comfortable life. There are no earth shattering moments that lead her to this decision. No major disappointments. No catastrophes. Out of simple boredom and disillusionment, she decides to end her life.<br />Her suicide attempt is foiled-in part. She is revived but with permanent heart damage that gives her a few several weeks left of life. Only then does her journey of self-discovery begin, where she examines her life and why each day is a gift to be treasured.<br />This is a book that has something for everyone. It reminds us to live life fully and examine each thing that makes our lives worth living. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, so `Bon appetit!'.
B00004TWZF|5.0|This film is in 'the most beautiful' category of the films i've seen. It is not about a contest,  a personal success or just dramatical story. It is about passion, poetry and deepest in ourselves. It is what a film should be: a sensual experience of that magic in our&amp;other selves.<BR>The characters, especially women, are said to be 'tin' in words; but they are what some of us really are. It is not necessary to agree with other people, in fact, it deprieves one of his/her self if attempted. For those that like watching likeable, developing, 'better man' characters in a film, this one won't do. It is like life of passion, not life of fitting in.
0790743221|5.0|This movie is entertaining and fun for everyone.  I found it to be heartwarming, a favorite of mine.
B000059TPN|5.0|Next to T2: UE, this is the next best DVD in my collection. The film transer is perfect. The sound is wonderful, and the features are incredible. Buy this and buy this now!
B00004YM0D|5.0|I loved the movie. The soundtrack was evan better! The great<BR>mix of all the oldies and the \\"Everywhere we go\\". Especially \\"Na Na Na Na Hey Hey\\" and \\"Ain't no mountain high enough\\" made this album complete.
B00004TRD8|5.0|One of the best sequels ever made. It doesn't capture the same feeling that T1 did, but it adds another level to it. Instead of the powerful darkness, it adds a bit of light, and light-heartedness. The special edition is what this DVD is all about. The deleted scene with John and the Terminator at the gas station WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY FUNNY! One wonders why they didn't have that in the final cut of the film. The making-of documentary is a film-school lesson. Watch it and learn. Very intriguing. Great DVD, a must-own for any DVD enthusiast.
0375703861|3.0|A (too) long but humorous book about the bizarre and sometimes slightly tragic evolutions that families go through when they are adapting to a new/different cultures.  This is Smith's first novel and it is often very witty.  The book covers the current goings on between and with Samad Iqbal (a screwy Bengali) and Archie Jones (a working class Brit) - who have been friends for decades (as a result of a bizarre military experience).  Their wives, Clara (a wild Jamaican woman who was beautiful but had all her teeth knocked out as a girl), and Alsana (who is basically angry all the time) are equally funny and odd.  The lives of these two families and in particular their children - are the threads that tie the book together.  Smith manages to cover, through her characters discussions, every sort of issue imaginable: race, religion, fate, teenage angst, pregnancy, etc.  Her characters are all complex and deftly developed.  And since they are complicated (realistic) they are not all particularly likable.  This was a fun book for me, living in a Bengali culture I could laugh and nod whenever Samad did something really \\"Bengali\\".  Some of Smith's best writing is in the dialogues and conversations.  It is a big book and should only be tackled if you are a steadfast reader.
B0000508U6|5.0|Perhaps the most compelling song on the album.. at least for me.. would have to be &quot;Trouble&quot;. Even a year later, everytime I hear the song, I get swept up. This is one of maybe a handful of songs that have brought me near tears when I've heard it (it's even better live). That song was there for me when I needed it (played it at least 10 times in a row one night). Fired from a job, betrayed by a friend, just going through a really tough time... *sigh*<br />Fast forward a year later, I'm blown away by the slow, grassroots movement this album has made in a year. Perhaps someone can tell me how it happened. One day it was all the rage on college radio, the next in Top 40 chaos. <br />Lyrically, the album lacks, but the music makes up for it. Chris' voice sounds like many contemporaries, and there are many comparisions and criticisms, but it works as an instrument for the lushness and beauty of the sound. They aren't the best band of all time, but they all (band members) work together very well. Time and consideration were taken during the making of this album. Very well produced and arranged. These blokes aren't going anywhere. The older they get, the music (lyrics as well) will mature.
0060934913|4.0|I first read Anthony Bourdain in the pages of a New Yorker magazine and was absolutely blown away by the pace and wit in his extraordinary story-telling.  Bourdain, chef at \\"Les Halles\\" in New York, gives us a no-holds-barred brutally honest view of the steamy side (literally!) of the restaurant world, particularly in New York City.  Although some reviewers have complained about some of the language used (and it is particularly nasty between the various nationalities of men in the kitchens) and the sheer volume of drug use, I think that without it, the book might not have been so authentic.  Bourdain makes no apologies but rather, tells a great story.  In one chapter he describes being in France as a child with his family and during that trip, his discovery of his love for food.  In another he describes from morning through a full day (and late night) - a day in the life of a restaurant chef - it is a brisk, wonderful ride - every word (this chapter was the one published in the New Yorker that so enthralled me).  In a later chapter he talks about his first trip to Tokyo, assisting the owners of Les Halles with their Tokyo restaurant.  His description of the fish markets in Tokyo at the crack of dawn is absolutely riveting.  Forget reading it so you can pick up tips about when to order fish and why never to get a well-done piece of meat - it is so much more than that. Get over the language and learn about the incredible world of those whose food you eat.
B00003CXWV|4.0|This is a solid drama and action movie.  What makes it unique is that it is based on a true story.  The music is incredible and just makes this a wonderful drama and action film!  The music makes you re-live the 60's and 70's.  Johny Depp is outstanding.  Absolutely wonderful extras on this DVD, including an excellent documentary on Colmbia and COCAINE.  This movie carries a wide variety of emotions.  You'll be sure to be moved.<BR>As entertaining as this movie is, it just goes to show how that drugs and self destruction go hand in hand.  Blow definitely exceeded my expectations.
0783117523|5.0|For anyone in doubt of Jolie's acting abilities, Watch This Film.  Angelina shines as Gia in this fantastically well done film.  One of my all time favorites, this film just pulls you along for the ride.  Absolutely fantastic.
B000001FKY|5.0|This is by far the band`s greatest album. The band, from when it started playing gigs in the late 70s had one only aim: put rock`n roll on top of the charts. With this album they did more than this: they became one of the most top selling rockers ever. The album has very good songs: Women, Animal and Pour some Sugar on Me are all very good melodic songs, Hysteria is a nice ballad. Buit the songs I love the most are the powerful ones of the album: Don`t shoot Shotgun, Run Riot and Armageddon it. This album is much more rockin than Adrenalyze and the average songs are better than in Pyromania. The band is in its best shape ever, Phil Coleen and Steve Clark don`t miss a riff, Joe Elliott`s voice is on top and Rick Allen can play with one hand much better than most drummers can play with two. Buy it! I bought it in a second hand shop in London a month ago ... and it is my everyday life soundtrack. I hope you guys out there reading this will agree with me....................
B000009ED0|5.0|Of all them KR albums i've listened to this has to be the best he has put out. All but three of the songs were fresh, not rehashed remixed Dj stuff. can't wait for more.
0345428064|4.0|I read the abridged version of Remote Control and decided to read the unabridged version to see what I had missed.  I discovered that I had missed nothing more than a large amount of swearing and plenty of graphic violence.  I recommend this book to anyone, but would promote the abridged version as the better option, as the story is not adversely affected by the 'chopping' of several parts.
B00000INEX|5.0|As with the rest of this collection, this is a beautiful video, with beautiful music and my baby loves it as much as we do. It's great when we want to spend some fun relaxing time together, since we all enjoy it! He's now 13 months old, and has seen it for 5-6 months, and never gets tired of it.  And as usual, the puppets and the Clark girls always make him laugh!
B0000027K7|4.0|this is an excellent album. it's not really mountain's first: leslie west had put out an album called leslie west-mountain the previous year that was produced by felix pappalardi-i guess you could call it either a west solo disc or the first proper mountain lp. i think that this is easily the group's best album. this is one of the cornerstones of american hard rock/ metal-although it is, musically speaking , much more than that.  as much as i love the original jack bruce version of &quot; theme for an imaginary western&quot;, it is bettered by the powerhouse rendition that mountain did on this album.  leslie west was simply one of the best american rock guitarists at the time, and one can witness this opinion throughout this excellent track. pappalardi's vocals and bass playing do remind one of the great jack bruce, but they add to the mix of styles that were a feature of this fine band, possibly the most talented american heavy rock band of their era. the hit &quot; mississippi queen&quot;, the fine hippie ballad &quot;for yasgur's farm&quot;, the hard rock number &quot;never in my life&quot;  (featuring great drumming from corky laing), the eerie ballad &quot;boys in the band&quot;, the weird folk music of &quot;the laird&quot; (with some good sitar work from west)and the  hard rock cut &quot;silver paper&quot; are the biggest highlights of this disc. nothing is bad on the album however. as i wrote above, this is certainly mountain's finest album.
0345413377|5.0|I'm sure TAS doesn't need and extra review, but here's my shpeal anyway.<br />I enjoyed the story of The Amber Spyglass very much, and was quite enthralled by the characters.  Truly, I have never felt as strongly for a character in a book as I have for Lyra and Will (I cried...).  Again, the slightly (ok, gigantic) anti-religion theme was a little bothersome to the plot, but I think the characters and writing made up for it. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger than 10 or 11, but older than that should be fine.  I enjoyed this book greatly, and I advise you to try it for yourself! (Only after you've finished 'The Golden Compass' and 'The Subtle Knife' of course).
B0000214F0|5.0|What a great movie. Anyone who sees this film will say &quot;dang, he put his fist in the guys what?&quot; and, &quot;watch the wine burst from the guys stomach how?&quot; or, &quot;that girl's his what? Can't be. No way...    Dang...    They'd have kids with 2 heads or 3 arms or something.   Dang...&quot;
B0000026J1|5.0|This is a great album guys, surely the best of this band and one of the best I've ever listened to. Kee Marcello's solos in this one are really addictive especially that in &quot;Superstitious&quot;. Buy it and you'll surely give it a 5 star rating.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forest Gump on dvd is great. I've seen it a bunch of times and gets better everytime I watch it. Those who seen this movie will love it on dvd. Great sound, great picture. This movie had me laughing each time I watched it. Watching that goofy bastage chase that girl Jenny was touching. He would get into situations that made you feel sorry for that subana bish. That cork suker ran aimlessly through the USA. What was that about. Funny goofy guy. Forest Gump is a goofy fargain bastage that will keep you laughing.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|First let me state the obvious: I am a fan of Jane Austen, and have been for 30 years.  Secondly, let me state that the first viewing of this adaptation had all the charm of an impacted wisdom tooth.  Unless you are well acquainted with the story, you will be monumentally confused the first time you see it.  This is not a film you can go into blind, because it won't give you any help with what is going on. Oh how the British  love the device of implication and assumed history.  Neither will be much help in understanding this.  The people that I watched this with found it extremely confusing and discordant, and I did too, even though I have read the book many times over the years.  Most of my audience kept complaining that the people looked too British.  If ever there were a cast of singularly unattractive people, this is it.  Anne Elliot looks not so much faded, as enbalmed and brought back from the dead for this performance and I found Frederick Wentworth podgy, buck toothed and very unappealing.  And those were his good points.  This film is chock full of people who seem able to vent with great abandon unless honesty would clear everything up in two seconds flat.  At which times they look tortured and constipated.  The director and writer also saw fit to change things from the book, and none of the adaptations were an improvement. <BR>     Having slammed their physical appearance, I must say that the people in Hollywood would have cast actors with physical appeal and no substance.   The British cast on the basis of talent, and even if the actors are not particularly handsome, they grow on you.  I can not think of one person who did not do a very good job,  and although I found Anne and Frederick's tortured looks, gaping, gawking, and inability to communicate, extremely irritating, I am inclined to blame the director more than the actors.  Captain Benwick was very good, but he reminded me of the Pillsbury Doughboy playing dress-up.  Anne's eldest sister, Elizabeth,was shrill, annoying and petulantly unattractive.   In short, perfect for the part.  The murkiness and evocative moods, reminded me of Wuthering Heights meets Frederico Fellini.  Brooding and bizarre.  <BR>     If you can over-look dentition, physicality, and mood swings, you will like this movie.  It has a certain  jarring charm, mostly superb acting, interesting wardrobe, and it is unpretentious.  It doesn't care whether you like it or not.  I did, and although my daughter will not watch it with me, my husband very much enjoyed it, and he has watched it with me more than once.  This is the only  Persuasion that I could find, and if you can overlook some things, you will find yourself drawn to it again and again.  The ending is not what I would have done, nor do people in Austen novels kiss on the streets of Bath. In the book, Anne did not seem as wimpy and  irksome as in this.  I frequently wanted to slap her. Hard.
0385493622|5.0|This is the story and the history of the world longest standing math problem. There were some problems in my calculus classes that I just gave up on after 20 mins. This problem has people giving up on it for 350 years. Fermat's last theorem is simple and elegant and it stumped dudes with stratosphereic IQs for centuries. This book starts with a good history of number theory, starting in ancient Greece and progresses up to Andrew Wiles, the guy who finally crack the problem. It is kind of funny, the problem could be written on a bar napkin. The proof ended up being 130 pages long and involed almost all of the newest mathematical developments of the 20th century. It is a great book, there are so many interesting characters, I really enjoyed it. It isn't technical and certainly doesn't require a math degree to understand. It was a fun little book, and it a fast read. Don't miss it.
B00005QATY|5.0|Being from the South, I was not in the least bit offended by the actions and speech in this movie.  Actually, I would almost swear that I recognized some of the characters as being people here in town!  Even though some people in other areas of the country may view the &quot;slang&quot; &quot;countrified&quot; speech as ignorance -- and maybe some of it is -- the movie characters portrayed in a hilarious fashion a way of life many years ago, and captured very well the naivete and unique speech of the South. Ignorant -- no.  Simple -- yes.  The music is also outstanding.
B00000634J|4.0|Much like Paul McCartney's Wingspan 2 CD set, and George Harrison's All Things Must Pass reissue, John gets a remastering of some classic songs. The sound is brilliant and evokes the feel of the songs. You really do feel like you are listening from the producers control booth at musical history being made. Favorites such as Imagine, Instant Karma, Nobody Told Me, and Watching the Wheels sound clear. I have only two minor critisisms for this collection. First of all, the cover art reflects the early 1970's incarnation of John. I personally preferred the cover art of The John Lennon Collection (1982 LP, 1989 CD). Also, contained on that collection was Move Over Ms. L.. This is now not available on CD. Move Over Ms. L. was recorded in 1974 during John's &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; period. It is a very good, rocking song. He would be bst served by a double cd set (as with Wingspan) to cover more of his career. Hits such as those on The John Lennon Collection and this one could go along side songs such as Meat City, Bring On The Lucie(Freda People), Hold On, What You Got, etc.... Probably a 40 track set will someday soon be needed to expose more people to John's genius. I feel that the Beatles as a group and solo artists definitely could benefit from increased exposure to the public. Over all, I would give this a 4.5 star rating. Rock on John! You are with us in spirit, always.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|GREAT EXCELLENT FANTASTIC JOYOUS.....I can use these and other words to describe the music of the Beatles. No other band can come close to the beautiful melodies and lyrics of Beatlesongs. Their music will live on forever and touch the lives of all who hear it. This is a great package and I hope they release The Beatles 2 !!
B00003CXWV|5.0|Great movie.   Johnny Depp is awesome.   If you liked Boogie Nights you'll like this movie.
B000050XEI|5.0|I got this CD mostly for the song 'Only Time', which has been played over and over during the attacks on New York City.  I was truly moved when this song was played, as it is such a beautiful song.  It has given me a new way to think of the song.  The other songs on this CD are also very well done, I enjoyed 'Falling Embers' and 'A Day Without Rain'.
B00005NP04|5.0|Just when you think she can't possibly get any better... BOOM, she blows you away!!  This is a collection of all of Martina's greatest hits plus 4 new song, sure to join the list of hits!!  With this CD you get the best of Martina, plus a glimps at whats to come in the future. With songs like My Baby Loves Me, Independence Day, Wild Angels, A Broken WIng and Happy girl we get all of Martina best music.  Of the four new songs of this Greatest Hits CD we have \\"When God Fearin' WOmen Get The Blues.. which is a fast uptempo song with alot of attitude, it's totally Martina and definately country.  With Where Would You Be, we get the vocal power that we see on A Broken Wing.. this song is utterly amazing.  With Concrete Angel... we get to deal with the issue of Child abuse.. a very touching song that I think needs to be heard.  And Blessed is a great song to start your days with.. it's an upbeat, Happy song... Definately purchase this CD.. I promise it'll be the BEST you'll ever spend.. Martina will not, and could not let you down!  The CD hasn't let my CD player since the day I got it (Sept. 18th)
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was an excellent by literary standards and engaging storyline. The story of seclude community that has controlled actions of all the citizens. Everyone is assigned a job at the \\"Ceremony of Twelve\\" and from there families are put together and babies are given to you. One boy, Jonas, becomes the chosen to receive memories. From there on, the story goes into a detail what the community has given up to avoid the past memoirs of their humanity. This book to me was interesting from the start. I was really disappointed that the book ended so fast. Still, this book is a must read.
B0000025US|5.0|I was blown out of the room when I first listened to this <BR>album on LP.  I later replaced it with a CD, after buying<BR>the LP version for 10 friends.  When I was burglerized,<BR>my CD player had the disc on it (they left the jewel case<BR>behind -- empty).  I looked at the empty CD case for <BR>months, longingly, and when I finally replaced my CD player,<BR>I ordered it again.<br />The CD is short; it contains only the cuts that are on the<BR>LP.  It really doesn't need to be longer.  It is a nearly<BR>perfect tour de force by three great players with a <BR>remarkable affinity for each other and the music they<BR>play.  I couldn't be without it, clearly.
B00005LKIM|1.0|This movie left me feeling tricked.  &quot;Hannibal&quot; has absolutely none of the wit, intelligence or suspense of &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot;.  It is nothing but a vulgar little slasher movie.  The beautiful Italian setting and the music are cynical, calculated but, ultimately, failed attempts to add a veneer of depth and sophistication.  Hopkins hams his way through the appalling script and Moore's constantly impassive facial expressions suggest that she was slipped an overdose of botox.  The shock-horror elements of the &quot;story&quot; are crass in the extreme.  The thrilling suspense of the first film has been replaced by make-'em-barf excess.  One disturbing facet of this film is the sneakily unspoken suggestion that, at the back of it all, we should somehow be cheering Lecter on as he eats the brains of Ray Liotta's boorish character.<br />This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend it.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This was one of the most entertaining films I have seen in a while. The story is so original and keeps you wondering what may happen next. It is amazing how modern such an old movie can look by the cinematography's innovative style. The DVD's video is very sharp to go along with it's clear sound. The extras are great, it comes with a documentary, two commentaries, and a whole bunch of trivial types things. I believe this is THE DVD to buy among the current releases, for it's story and well put together package.
1881273156|4.0|This book has helped to propell our relationship forward.  We understand each other much better now, speaking each other's &quot;love language.&quot;  I like the simplicity and shortness of the book.  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because Mr. Chapman gets preachy religious quotes and towards the end he sounds as if he can fix EVERY relationship with his theories, when we know that love can not be categorized black and white as the book tends to preach.
1587990717|5.0|Taleb's latest is a refreshing look at the world of trading, and moreover, at the tired world of thinkers who all think alike.  Thank heaven there is someone who is not another lamb heading off to slaughter.  He pokes fun at philosophers, journalists, and all those who are pretentious.  A great book for the lay reader, unlike the brilliant Dynamic Hedging, which is for those who read formulas.  After finishing this masterpiece, you will see the world of trading, writing, and culture with amusement and clarity.
079284632X|3.0|This is one of those films that are difficult to explain or defend.  While the film actually is based on The Virgin Spring (as opposed to Roger Corman's liberal use of Egdar Allan Poe's legacy to try to give a hint of art to his Vincent Price films in the early '60s) and Wes Craven's stated intentions about making a comment on the state of American society at the time do seem to be sincere, its still a hard film to really recommend.  Basically, two teenage girls from the middle class are kidnapped, raped, and brutally murdered by a pack of degenerates who are then just as brutally and sadistically murdered by the girl's family.  What set the film apart is the extreme (and close-to-realistic) nature of the gore and violence involved.  People literally have gotten sick while watching this film and for good reason.  I saw an edited version and still found it hard to take.  As well, Craven makes it clear that the criminals and the avenging parents are pretty much only distinguishable by their social class.  The parents, by the end of the film, take the same sadistic pleasure in their revenge that their victims took in their original crime.  Its a grim message and not an extremely pleasant one.  It also might be a lot more truthful than a lot of people want to admit.  Still, I can't really recommend this film for that message.  To get to it, you have to sit through some really repugnant, sadistic stuff and its hard to say that Craven's artistic intent can really be used as justification.  (I guess the main problem is that I got the feeling that the filmmakers were basically getting off on the same violence they claimed to be condemning.)  This is the type of film that everyone will have to make up their own minds on.  So, in the end, a film that painfully betrays its low budget but manages to carry a very disturbing power to it and claims to, at least, contain a message that is still relavent.  Not for anyone with a weak stomach but if you're a fan of gore films, (I'm not but I won't condemn anyone who is -- sometimes excess and shock has an understandable appeal) Last House is kind of required viewing.  It doesn't really work as a horror film (I was never really scared as much as disturbed) but it does have a primitive, very raw power.  Whether to see it is your own decision.  I don't regret having watched it but at the same time, its not something I ever want to sit through again.
B00005N9CV|5.0|The long wait for this terrific album was worth it.  She has really done it this time.  Incredibly lush orchestrations of some great tunes.  &quot;Cry me a River&quot;.  No it isn't Julie London and Barney Kessel, but it is excellent nonetheless...  &quot;The night we called it a Day&quot; is really well....sultry.  Such a great tune.   She uses two different guitar players this time.  Both very good, tho  a bit trebel on the settings for my taste- but as I say, both very very good players. You will want this cd. ( The photo on the cover is just about worth the price.  Nice shoes Diana!  GREAT VOICE!  A very tasty morsel.  GET IT!
0786915749|5.0|Well, this is a definte place to start your dragonlance series... introduces you to the world of Krynn. Bringing fourth a set of heroes. Leadership, friendship, glory, love.. all mingled into this great book. What can I say more? It's simply the most spell bounding fantasy book you'll ever lay your hands on..<br />Oh.. if your planning on getting this, MAKE SURE you buy the second and third volume of the trilogy as well. You'll regret it if you dont.. mark my words or my name isnt Raistlin Majere! =o (actually, it isnt. haha.)
B000002MJC|5.0|I bought this album the week it came out back in 1993 and I have gone through 3 copies of it since, that's how much I've listened to it.  I've always been a huge DM fan, but this album reminds me JUST how much I love them.  Martin Gore has written the most beautiful, poetic songs of his career and Dave Gahan sings them with a force, they will bring shivers up your spine.  This was a very dark period for the boys... Dave was at the peak of his heroin addiction during the recording of this album, and Allen Wilder left after the SOFAD tour was over, but I think this album really reflects how turbulent things were, and you can tell they really put a lot of heart and soul into making it.  It's still my favourite cd of all time.  If you're a DM fan and you have not heard this album, I suggest you pick it up.  Some fans don't like it though, it is a little dark but an amazing work of art nonetheless!
B0000584V3|5.0|Being a fan of Type O Negative, Paradise Lost, Dark Tranquility, it takes a lot for me to be impressed enough to buy a band's entire back-catalog of cds.  Opeth is another band like that.  If you buy Blackwater Park, you won't need to buy the back catalog for a few weeks, because BP won't pleave your player for that long.  This band would have been Black Sabbath, had they come along at the right time.  Enough with the Sabbath comparisons though.  Buy this cd if you're into dark melodic, yet angry heavy music.
6304126360|4.0|the concept to put sci.-fi film, together with extreme beauty was beyond my exspectations.The plot was good,what a life kirt had, to live with farrah in her prime,whom did not know anything except what he told her.dream come true for most males.there humdrum life was enterupted by a man whom wanted to be known as a great scientist.He introduced his find to kirt and farrah and oh my &quot;could life still go on&quot;.
0345350499|4.0|I just finished the Mists of Avalon.  This is the first book I've read by Marion Zimmer Bradley.  I must say, I am not too familiar with the Arthurian lengend, so the twists in the plot were relatively surprising for me.  I think in a way, this actually benefitted my experience, as I was not so much comparing and contrasting the different renditions, but simply enjoying a story with slightly familiar characters. <br />I found my favorite parts to be in Avalon and involving the fairy people.  The fantasy parts are very descriptive and well written.  The story itself seemed never to really drag.  <br />Looking back, I don't think the author creates very likable characters.  I found myself rooting for Morgaine, as is apparent that the author has a tendency to forgive Morgaine's faults.<br />But I gave this book 4 stars.  Why?  You need no familiarity with the Arthurian legend, or even any real interest in the legend to enjoy this story set in medieval times.  I, unlike some reviewers, enjoyed the religious conflicts brought up, and I enjoyed the resolution at the end regarding this conflict.  I suppose what makes me like this book the most though, is the realization of the goddess in me, and everywhere.  I found that my set of rules regarding life tended to be more like that of Avalon than of the Christian world we live in today.  I found it beautiful to read about women struggling for the same sort of things I believe in - but also let me see the other side of things.  <br />All in all, it's a rewarding 900 page read...if a bit daunting at first.  However, the beginning doesn't lack forward movement, and the story is quickly gotten into, so it's easy to keep on reading.  <br />I do recommend this highly to most people... familiar with the Arthurian legend or not... not only was it great fun to read, but it provided some lasting images for myself...and that is the ultimate goal of reading anything.
B00001PE4D|5.0|As sad as it may be, the reality is that many of today's teens are portrayed very well if not exactly in Cruel Intentions.  The movie does a wonderful job in displaying the crazy motives teens have today.  Perhaps this is why we experience so many teens killing teens and highschool schooting. The reality is that teens of today have been currupted by society.  Girls such as Kathryn are going out of their way to destroy the innocence of others, such as Cecile and Annette.  The movie holds a dreadful truth, teens are vicious. They will do what it takes to get what they want. The movie was spectacular itself. Ryan Phllipe and Sara Michelle Gellar play their roles wonderfully. The evil seems to come out naturally. Cruel Intentions show that teens are not what they seem.  Though you might think they are harmless and innocent, there are those who have evil intentions.  However, some do change over time, such as Sebastion does. People may learn a lot about teens from this movie. Don't put too much trust in anyone!
B000002546|5.0|This cd is a great cd. I want to let everybody know though that Jeff Beck was inspired to do this type of music after he heard the late great Tommy Bolin (James Gang,Deep Purple). Tommy did a album with Billy Cobham (who is also on this cd) when Jeff heard it he was blown away. If you like this kind of music please check out Billy Cobham's cd Spectrum with Tommy Bolin on guitar. This cd is a great cd in it's own right though. Enjoy.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I am a 32yr old father who was dragged to see this cartoon by my wife and kids. This movie comes on with the typical fairy tale narrated scene, then BAAM! Shrek (Mike Myers) takes over with his witty cracks. Eddie Murphy gives a great performance as the donkey that never shuts up (if you can be that funny, why)? The Princess (Cameron Diaz) gives spunk to an old fashion character. Shrek had me laughing louder than anyone in the theater. The Disney shots are great. A classic story line with new-age comedy.
B00000BKDW|4.0|Iron Maiden is one of the best heavy metal bands of all time.  You know it, I know it, we all know it.  This album has one of my favorite songs of all time, &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.  You can just see all the water, you feel like your house is going to flood while listening to it.  I love the part where Bruce says &quot;Down comes the Raaaaaaaaaaain!&quot;.  One of the greatest moments in heavy metal history!  No lie!  I just love it when the rain comes down!  Four stars cuz it's a little too happy and upbeat for me, but great music for sure.
B000002G6J|5.0|This is, quite simply, one of my favorite cd's.  Jobim is a genius.
B000002JSP|4.0|I love bluesy rock, it reminds me of the rain, and I love the rain.  &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; is definitely one of my favorite songs of all time.  The only reason I give this four stars is because this album sounds a little bit too happy, and it doesn't really fit with the rain motif.  They should have kept their old style, and written &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; like that.  But oh, well, it's rainy music nonetheless.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  If you like this album, check out my favorite band, Candlebox.

B000002BQK|5.0|After the perfection of Mariah's previous album, DAYDREAM, I wondered how she could top herself. Well she did just that with BUTTERFLY. This album isn't that much of a step up... it's slightly better than DAYDREAM. On BUTTERFLY Mariah explores hip-hop beats a bit more and the results are excellent. It's more goovy and slicker than her previous efforts. The lyrics, which were all written by Mariah, are awesome too. Mariah's shown on here that she's grown as a songwriter as well. &quot;Honey&quot; is one of her best songs ever and the rest of the album flows well together. On the vocal side Mariah decides to play it a bit low-key. She only lets loose on ballads like &quot;whenever you call&quot;. BUTTERFLY is an excellent R&amp;B/pop album and could be considered one of the best of 1997.
B000002W9Q|4.0|The CD is great.  My only problem with the &quot;soundtrack&quot;????? is that it is missing one of the best songs from the movie.<BR>I have the CD, but was greatly dissappointed that one tune was missing.  I don't know the title or artist, but I want and need that song.  Can someone help me out with the missing tune?<BR>It was played the night that Jennifer Grey discovered the entire dance group at their cabin doing the greatest dirty dancing I've seen in a long time.<br />Thanks to anyone who knows the tune.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This has to be the most disappointing movie I've ever seen.  The plot is nearly non-existent, and the character development is even worse (for instance, Darth Maul is a central character, but there is no explanation of who he is; rather, he just shows up every once in a while for a fight scene or to simply look mean, imposing, and powerful).  The effects are great, but in the absence of a storyline they become almost annoying.  If it weren't for the fact that this is a Star Wars movie (which gave me hope that it would get better), I would have walked out of the theater after the first 30 minutes.
0394716787|5.0|i can't vouch for whether it's complete or not, but it's sure jam-packed.  the tripped-out cover art is completely incongruous with the misery-riddled oeuvre of Poe, but the book itself is a marvelous resource.  if you've ever despaired of ever having a complete collection of this GREAT American writer, here's just about everything.  it gives one a sense of satisfaction.
B00005N9CV|1.0|I am a big fan of Diana Krall but found this album to be a big disappointment.  The arrangements are very plain and the whole album lacks energy.  If you want to hear how a ballad can be delivered with intensity and direction, try Kurt Elling's latest - \\"Flirting With Twilight\\"  I'm looking forward to Diana's next effort.
B00005JCAA|4.0|<BR>Meet Joe Black is a wonderful fantasy in the true classic Hollywood tradition.  Performances are excellent all around, and romance just doesn't get more soul-stirring than this.  I believe that time will be good to this film.  Once the brutal reviews are forgotten Meet Joe Black will gain a much wider, and more appreciative, audience.

B00003CX9E|5.0|This restoration of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is nothing short of miraculous, practically as dazzling an achievement as the film itself. It's pretty well known that the original 35mm print of &quot;Kane&quot; was lost long ago, so expectations of producing a superior duplicate from another duplicate were never very high. On the film's 50th anniversary, Turner Enterprises released a restored print for theatrical release, but though it was brighter, it had a somewhat white-washed, softy-focused aura that served neither Welles' purpose nor the &quot;film noir-ish&quot; properties of Welles' masterpiece adequately.<br />The DVD restoration, on the other hand, has crisp, sharply-defined images, richly complex and nuanced blacks, whites and greys, and an audio track that sounds fresh and &quot;present&quot; without over-equalization of highs and lows or gratuitous stereo simulation.<br />For some viewers, &quot;Kane&quot; ranks as the greatest film of all time because it's possible to stop the film on any single frame of its 2-hour length and produce an exegesis not only on the aesthetic and technical strengths of that individual shot but on the film as a whole, given its organic structure and the microcosmic status of each of the parts. For such viewers, this version should prove especially indispensable, affording glimpses of information--faces and other objects formerly covered by dark shadow, lap dissolves once too subtle to spot even in slow motion, competing, yet independently crucial, conversations--perhaps not accessible since the film's initial release.<br />Even without the bonuses, the single disc would be worth the price. But the inclusion of an additional DVD, &quot;The Making of Citizen Kane,&quot; along with the historical, biographical, contextual materials included on the first disc make this package a steal.  With this many riches to choose from, viewers may be excused if they pass up the Peter Bogdanovich running commentary on the film (I couldn't stay with it for very long), but Roger Ebert's extemporary &quot;play-by-play&quot; is not merely profuse but perceptive, articulate, and edifying from the very first shot. Even his commentary during the gallery of stills, in which he explains why &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is his favorite movie and why it deserves its reputation as the best ever, is not to be missed. (I now realize that the hurried, superficial quality of much of his newpaper reviewing in recent years says more about the product than the reviewer.)<br />One caution: The first disc, with &quot;Kane&quot; and all of the assorted contextual material that follows, initially behaved &quot;buggy&quot; on my iMac DV. After disabling extensions, internet connections, and practically every other program except the DVD player, I was able to run the entire disc with no further problems.with it for very long), but Roger Ebert's extemporary &quot;play-by-play&quot; is not merely profuse but perceptive, articulate, and edifying from the very first shot.

B00005B36H|5.0|Why does this band always get doubted after they make a new album? When Undertow came out, everyone figured they wouldn't hear much from them in the future. Then nima came out and blew everyone away. I admit that I didn't think they could top nima, and by no means did they.. but this is excellent music. After three amazing albums in a row, I no longer fear any &quot;bad music&quot; from Tool. They have totally established themselves, and I know the next album will be amazing, and the next one, and the next one, etc. I admit that they will never top nima, but so what. nima is a masterpeice. That doesn't mean they won't keep making awesome music. Four more words, then my review is done.. Danny Carey is amazing.
B000000OTY|3.0|the version of &quot;in your eyes&quot; is a cheap permutation of the original POV version and edits remotely available. Paula Cole is a contributor to the shame and luke-warm performance of it, however, &quot;secret world&quot; is a well done and is worth having. note that the disc has more songs on it than the video concert &quot;secret world.&quot;
6300214044|5.0|What a powerful, moving film!  One viewing will prompt this film to remain in your mind as long as you are here on this planet.  Some movies are educational, some are entertainment.  This movie is both.<br />I disagree with the idea that a child wouldn't understand the point of this true story.  I think a child eight or older could benefit from viewing and talking about The Elephant Man.<br />The lesson that every human is a human being with the same soul and feelings as any other, no matter the external appearance is a most valuable one for children to learn, and the earlier the better.
B00005MP58|1.0|I just received my copy of this new edition and it was a great disappointment. Very poor quality. The other DVD version may not be perfect, but it's certainly better than this one. Colors are washed out and in some cases almost nonexistent and contrast is too dark! Terrible conversion. I'm returning mine for a refund! This wonderful production deserves the best remastering, not a mediocre one like this one!
B00004TLN3|4.0|First of all, I'm a guy, so I haven't read a single Austen book.  But I did really like the Emma Thompson version of Sense and Sensibility, so I have purchased additional Austen videos so I can share them with my girlfriend.  (Action movies aren't an option.)<br />I did enjoy this movie quite a bit, even though the production values aren't as good as S&amp;S; but they didn't have that kind of money to spend, and they didn't have Ang Lee to direct it.<br />I really liked the female lead in the movie.  She captured a young and innocent look better than most actresses I could imagine (Emma Thompson, for example, could have never done this role).<br />I laughed out loud at Catherine's gothic fantasies.  They seem to capture the mood of a young girl's longing for the prince on the white horse quite well.
6301976622|4.0|Meanwhile, what does &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; mean?  I went to a translation site and they don't do Latin.<br />This one is a lot of fun, a little uneven as the first part is rather talky and stagy.  The sexual politics between Taylor and Kerr are hilariously dated, and their relationship was never very believable to me.  But no matter -- it's always sumptuous to look at.<br />Ustinov goes over the top, comes out on the other side, finds some more scenery to chew there, goes back for seconds, spits it out and then comes back for more.  Bravo!<br />Leo Genn is a terrific &quot;yes-man.&quot;  Taylor is more of a movie star than an actor, which is okay given the epic nature of this picture.<br />Second half of picture builds to a series of fantastic set-pieces which make the whole thing well worth the wait.<br />Not as high a quality film as &quot;Ben Hur&quot; which is still the gold standard in this genre, but a real treat and one I'm shamed to admit I was ignorant of for so long.
0780628551|5.0|I really like this film. This film is slow and deliberate. Johnny Depp is such an interesting actor you become immersed in the film just on the performance of his character. This is really modern filmmaking based on old-fashioned story telling. It is very intriguing and has been unjustly underrated.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I think this movie is great. The saber duels and 3d are one of the best I ever seen.<BR>The negative about this movie is that jarjar is in it. Did chewy make stupid jokes in episode4-6? No! And that thing about our cells talking to the force? I mean, comeon! The force is supposed to be something that you cannot explain, like God, not anything logical that scientists have proof of.<BR>And the story are a little bit shaking. Anakin was a good P I L- O T when obiwan met him, not a R A C E R. How can he then learn exactly how to fly a fighter in a minute when adult people learn to fly only after a year? Sure luke is a good fighter, but i dont think he flied when he was 9 years old. I know Lucas can do better than this, its clear that he did this movie to make money. But I read that he creates episode 2 especially for 12-year old children, &quot;if adults like it, then its just a plus&quot;, he said that on an interview.<BR>We can only hope the force is still with him, like it was 30 years ago...
B00003CXP1|5.0|...but nonetheless it's great. This movie is so fast paced that when I went out of the theatre I actually saw the rest of the people  moving slowly . Requiem has a great cast and delivers an important message while scaring the hell out of you (I don't do drugs but after wtaching this movie I'll even quit smoking).  There is no doubt about the power of this movie but people should remember that not every movie is suitable for everybody , so you have to be prepared for 1h 50 min of strong agression to your senses.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Probably the best B movie ever made. The story is exceptional and the effects are excellent. <br />The Special Edition offers many extras. I didn't have that high of an opinion of Cameron after his 'King of the World' thing at the Oscars, but after seeing the docu's I have a new respect for his talent and vision.<br />The slickest thing? The extras are on the flip side of the DVD. Sure you might miss a cool label but I appreciate the space saved by not having to shelve yet another oversize double or triple disk case. <br />A+ all the way around.
B00004R99J|3.0|Let me start off by saying the storyline of this movie was very good. It is the only thing that kept my review from going down to two stars. Now for the bad news. This has got to be the worst transfer to DVD I have ever seen. With all the digital magic that DVD boasts of having, you figure that Disney would at least match the quality of their video tape for this title. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I am not one who usually complains about such things. In fact, you won't hear me ranting and raving over the historical facts of the film. Let's face it, this is Disney and the story is written with children in mind. If anyone is going to take historical figures and turn them into a fairy tale, it is Disney. That is to be expected. What is not expected is a grainy horrible video transfer we find here. This DVD is for Disney DVD collectors (unfortunately like myself) only. Otherwise, buy the video tape.

1577311523|5.0|A friend of mine sent me this book from Newyork to Bombay, India. After reading this book I felt that such a book is beyond all the ratings what to talk of 5 stars. Indeed, the book is very well above 10+ stars. Many authors and preachers have told us about importance of 'NOW'and need for being in 'NOW' for eternal joy, fulfilment and meaning in life. However, the simplest - down to earth - manner in which Mr. Eckhart Tolle has clarified and explained the present moment 'NOW' is highly praiseworthy. He has shunned all the esoteric and unintelligible jargon and said so much in a simple modern language. I read the book three times and each time every word in it reflected a deeper meaning of itself.Every word is useful to practical day to day living.I suggest that every one interested in making a progress in her/his spiritual journey must read this book.

B00005OAJ1|2.0|Having been a Tenacious D fan since their earliest appearances on television, I eagerly anticipated the release of their &quot;debut&quot; as much as any of the 5-star reviewers who have posted here. Unfortunately, I feel the quintessential charm and raw energy of Tenacious D is lost on this album. <br />Admittedly, with this endeavor Tenacious D has achieved the ultimate &quot;cream dream&quot;--to play their songs with some of rock's modern gods. But without the endearing qualities that make Tenacious D who they are to a fan like myself, this over-produced CD left me hanging, and hoping that the D haven`t sold out. The heavy electronic guitars, drums and sound effects almost completely eclipse Kyle Gass's skillful fingerpicking talents, and almost none of the tracks take full advantage of Jack Black's explosive and soulfully innovative vocal stylings. And disappointingly, Jack's comedic interludes sound forced and over-the-top, if that's possible for him. (Especially over-improvised is the segment titled \\"Inward Singing.\\") Finally, the storylines that inspired the songs are altered almost beyond recognition, making it difficult for the uninitiated to understand, just what is the allure of `that band Tenacious D everyone has been talking about?' <br />It's important to remember that Jack Black and Kyle Gass were first and foremost stand-up/sketch comics turned musicians. Kyle Gass taught Jack Black to play guitar so they would have something on which to build an act and make people laugh. Then, with the help of comedic geniuses David Cross and Troy Miller, the band's self-titled (and sadly short-lived) HBO series gave the self-proclaimed Greatest Band on Earth a story, and a persona of comic irony that is the very basis of Tenacious D's cult appeal. What could be funnier than two bumbling, &quot;classically trained&quot; amateur musicians belting out heavy metal-inspired rock tunes on tinny acoustic guitars? Singing passionately about the legend of Sasquatch and their experiences at Jesus Ranch. And to a seated, silent and yawning audience? It's hilarious. <br />And ironic. Because those of us who stayed up late to watch the three sole episodes reacted to their crass and weird performances in a manner exactly the opposite from the show's bored nightclub audience.  The story of Tenacious D made us laugh until our sides hurt. And Tenacious D fans like myself will argue that JB and KG are two of the most talented and creative musicians out there today. Kyle Gass is an awesome guitarist and Jack Black has the range of the best vocalists I can think of. And I'm sure I am not alone when I say that seeing the D play live was by far my favorite concert-going experience. Tenacious D is a ridiculous joke and a serious work of art at the same time, which is why the D's fans love to love them. <br />But if Tenacious D's style on the HBO series had been that of this new album, it would have been a rock drama, not a comedy. There is something about a band that is a legend in its own mind that is markedly funnier than a band that takes itself too seriously. Alas, I'm sorry to say that this die hard Tenacious D fan will be keeping this CD on the shelf...and will continue repeated, obsessive listenings of her Tenacious D acoustic bootleg compilation
B00003CX9E|5.0|When Orson Welles found out that Ted Turner wanted to colorize Citizen Kane, his response was: \\"Tell Turner to keep his damn caryolas away from my movie.\\"  It was Welles' greatest masterpiece, and he was very eclectic about how it was marketed.  I believe that Orson would be pleased with the Citizen Kane (Special Edition) DVD.  This edition gives you three perspectives: Citizen Kane sans commentary, Citizen Kane with Peter Bogdanovich's commentary, and Citizen Kane with Roger Ebert's commentary.  Their commentaries are excellent.  Bogdanovich views Citizen Kane from a predominately psychological perspective, and Ebert views it from a cinematic perspective.  Their commentaries complement one another perfectly.  Disc 2 (The Battle Over Citizen Kane) explains the historical background of Citizen Kane.  I recommend that you view disc 2 before viewing disc 1.  Disc 2 eradicates the misconceptions associated with this movie.  Eliminating these misconceptions lets you view Citizen Kane in terms of the story that Welles wanted to tell.
0385486804|5.0|Jon Krakauer does a great job of recreating a human -- a soul in flight in this wonderful book. He captures the essence of a powerful mountaineer and individualist that Krakauer himself seems to admire.

For anyone who loves adventure when spiced with introspection, philosophy and reflection, this book is a must read.
0380973650|4.0|&quot;American Gods&quot; is something of a misnomer as a title since this is more acurately a story about &quot;Gods in America,&quot; most of whom immigrated to the new world as their followers trekked across the oceans to come here.  Most of this is news to Shadow, the main character in Neil Gaiman's novel, who learns his wife, Laura, has been killed in a car crash just as he was about to get out of prison.  But if you remember one thing about this novel it is that there are no accidents, nothing is coincidence, and everything has meaning.  Shadow, who has a modest talent for doing coin tricks, becomes the employee of a strange being who goes under the name of Wednesday and is warned by everyone he meets or dreams about that a storm is coming.  Soon it becomes clear that this is not an allegorical statement, but that there is a coming battle between the &quot;new&quot; gods and the more ancient variety of deity.<br />Ultimately the sum of the parts of &quot;American Gods&quot; is not greater than the whole, and when the war of the gods ends with a whimper instead of a bang, it is an unsatisfying climax as is the resolution of Shadow's relationship with his dead wife, Laura.  Gaiman has actually done too good of a job on his research of the ancients gods, so that it becomes difficult to tell whose rules apply; are we dealing primarily with Norse mythology here or is there a more general set of rules that apply?  I am sure some academic can explain it all to us, but do not ask me and while I do not expect to be able to guess where Gaiman is going with his story, I do want to feel that this story is more than slight of hand or some type of con game.<br />The best part of the ending was the truth of the quiet little town of Lakeside; again, the pieces fall into place, this time with a more satisfying sense of conclusion.  &quot;American Gods,&quot; despite its problems, most of which can be forgiven since Gaiman is clearly trying to construct an epic, is an interesting tale, well told.  Michael Crichton talked about a paradigm shift in &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; arguing that science no long produces truth; Gaiman touches upon this, but without really developing the new paradigm (and its attendant gods) in significant detail.  However, through out the novel Gaiman's characters consistently captivate us even when the story becomes obscured.  In the end, &quot;American Gods&quot; is a good read.esting tale, well told.

B00003CXBK|5.0|This fast-moving, inspiring animation is really a new art form. Miyazaki takes animation to a new level by weaving philosophic debates about human excesses in uses of natural resources with fantastic battle scenes, romance and honor. The animism of Japanese religions comes to life in the form of great animal Gods as they compete with humans for space on the planet. But like other Japanese productions, no one is protrayed as truly evil and there are no &quot;guys in white.&quot; The boar God is portrayed as stubborn and the would-be evil woman shows compassion to leppers. Overall, the movie makes not so sublte statements about a mulitude of social subtlies.<br />A great piece of work and a great way to learn Japanese.
0385472951|5.0|One of John Grisham's best.  Patrick Lanigan, a lawyer from Mississippi, is found in Brazil by people who want their money back.  Apparently, he has stolen it from a client as well as the partners he worked for before his supposed death.  The amount missing-90 million dollars.  The author weaves a wonderful and elaborate story where Patrick is the only one who knows exactly what the next steps will be within the story.  First, he is charged by the FBI for wire fraud, but he has something up his sleave for them.  Second, the local police would like to charge him with capital murder because of the charred remains of someone or something found in his vehicle at the time of the accident.  Then , there is the small issue of an unfaithful wife, a couple of insurances companies, and a beautiful woman who happens to be the only one who knows exactly where the money is.  With the help of his attorney Sandy, Patrick is always one step ahead of the law, but at the end of the story, he forgets to keep an eye on the one person he thought he could have trusted with his life and money.  I highly recommend this story to those who likes a plot with more twists and turns than a grand prix race.

0767809246|5.0|&quot;Stand By Me&quot; is truly one of the classic movies of the Eighties generation.  Though it takes place in the 1950s, it could easily be about any four friends of that age group, regardless of time period.  In terms of lasting appeal and transcendence of time boundaries, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; could easily hold its own against such classics as &quot;Casablanca,&quot; &quot;The Godfather,&quot; &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; and other paradigms of the movie industry.  I truly don't think that's overstatement.  Every person I know, be they intellectual or layman, loves this movie.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
0743216385|5.0|As an Army veteran myself, I was honored to be able to read of the dedication and commitment of the soldiers of Easy Company. There is no greater historian than Stephen Ambrose to pass this legacy along to the public. This book follows a historic path from Normandy to the present of these brave paratroopers.<BR>Ambrose provides an insight of these men through intense research and in-depth interviews of those who lived it. This is made even more difficult by the fact that this is a generation who served out of honor and duty and not for the glory that we have showered upon them. There was a spirit in the American of their era that lacks in the majority of eligible soldiers today. We can all learn a lesson in bravery and dedication from these men and this book provides a window to them that many cannot understand and can only sit back and marvel at what drove the men of Easy Company. <BR>Those of us who haver served since and those who serve today can only hope to live up to the standard set by these men. Ambrose has put together a captivating record of their accomplishments and ensures that the generation of today continue to recall the men of Currahee. I salute them.

6305807043|5.0|&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; directed by Spike Jonze from a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, was in my opinion one of the most brilliant films of the late 20th century. The film tells the story of an out-of-work puppeteer (an excellent John Cusack) who discovers a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (played, curiously enough, by John Malkovich!).<br />BJM is a claustrophobic workplace satire, a surreal sex comedy, a gender-bending love story, and an innovative blending of science fiction and fantasy. Furthermore, the film is a reflection on interspecies communication and the nature of language, a metaphysical exploration of the nature of life and identity, and a somber meditation on the role of the artist in a consumeristic society.<br />Cusack and Malkovich are joined by a superb ensemble cast that brings complete conviction to this bizarre material. Orson Bean is particularly hilarious as Cusack's daffy, horny boss; he delivers his frequently outrageous dialogue brilliantly.<br />BJM is as notable for its stunning visual effects as it is for its amazing dialogue. Such sights as a giant Emily Dickinson puppet give the film a weird, Willie Wonka-ish flavor. Also marvelous are the parodic &quot;films within a film&quot; that spice up the whole. And the film is nicely enhanced by Carter Burwell's fine musical score.<br />BJM is imaginative and truly original; the film's concept is realized brilliantly by a talented cast and crew. I give it my highest recommendation.

The Princess is saved, everyone turns into a human all pretty and skinny.  Not this time.  It had wonderful actors that were just right for their part.  The plot was excellent and everything flowed into one another.  Mike Meyers was awsome and performed the way he always does, excellent.  If you didn't like it, it wasn't the movie, it's you.

B00005OAJ1|5.0|This is the first CD in a long time that has made me listen to it constantly since I bought it. I've been a long time fan of the D and I like the well polished production.<br />It's like JB and KG finally got their wishes and became the rock gods that we always knew them to be. I don't agree that it's overproduced. I love the fullness of the sound. From the full on rock of Explosivo and the wah wah porno guitar of Double Time, the studio versions of the songs we know by heart are almost exactly the same as we remember and better(except for Tribute, but that's another thing). I can't stop listening to it.
B00005B1EX|4.0|Rob is back doing what he does best, and that's a beautiful thing. The tracks from the excellent &quot;Resurrection&quot; are faithfully reproduced here, as well as great, heavier versions of Priest classics. If you ever listened to the old Priest discs and said to yourself..&quot;Gee..this is great, but I wish it was a little chunkier..&quot; then buy this and Priest's 98' Live meltdown for a nice 1-2 punch. The only slight downside is with the mix. Overall sound quality is great, but the bottom end on the kick drums is so hilariously overdone, that you have to unplug your car's subwoofer if you want to hear the guitars. The new band kicks it nicely, (where did Rob find young guys who could play a guitar solo??)Bobby J, ex-riot, is incredible. My only question is...Why has Rob sung horribly out-of-key in every one of the 11 times I saw him over the last 20 years, but always hits it perfectly on these live albums? Gotta love overdubbing :)Still, one of the best metal albums you're likely to find this year. Welcome back Rob.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This album is a bona fide Dylan classic, leapfrogging over his excellent but overpraised previous effort and landing in a strangely familiar new territory. The masked man is once again writing songs that we have almost heard before in our dreams, and that will inform our dreams for years to come. Why get into the game of comparison to the rest of the canon? Love and Theft is one of the essential ones; no finer judgment is needed to direct the reader's buying decision. Through the long decades of Dylan drought, any one of these songs would have been a standout track and a cause for rejoicing. And here they all are in one place.<br />Love and Theft takes up the same themes treated in Time Out Of Mind: old age, the inevitability of decline, death near at hand, love gone sour and love among the ruins. But where the earlier album treated those themes under the leaden sign of Saturn, god of melancholy and senility, this one treats them lightly, even exultantly, under the aegis of the two winged gods lurking in its title - Mercury, the nimble-fingered god of thieves, and Eros. So lightly, that you may boogie to the old-time, good-time rockers and lilters here for several spins before the lyrics' slyness and wisdom, their inscrutable probing and salving of universal wounds, start working their way into your bones.<br />As to the fingers here, they're plenty nimble, all right. It would be an injustice to say the band cooks.  It cooks, serves, clears, pays the check and washes up after itself. It's tight as a yakskin drumhead from beginning to end. Used to be, Bob embarrassed us all when he attempted to croon. Here, paradoxically, now that his voice seems fit only for stripping off old tarpaper siding, he delivers the crooners with aplomb and authority. And when he tears into a 12-bar blues, the sawdust flies off the floor.<br />William Butler Yeats, whose great poetry flowered into breathtakingly greater poetry as he aged, asked, &quot;Why should not old men be mad?&quot; They should, of course. And here arrives one barely-old man's testament to fine madness and hard-won sanity. What can I say? &quot;I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.&quot;
B00000JPH6|4.0|Ok, granted, I was 5 when it came out. My experiences with Jim Henson at the time included The Muppet Show and Sesame Street. I had nightmares about this film for years after I first saw it. But now I love it!. It is a dark but beautiful film. The story is sweet. I wouldn't recommend it for children though. <br />It is the classic tale of good vs. evil and how one can not truly exist witout the other.  This film shows a very different side of Jim Henson's imagination. I think, if you're a collector of his films, you definitely need to own this movie. Everyone has a dark side... this is his.

As she falls into a grove at Coyote Ugly is starts to look like she will never make it as a song writer.<br />My Opinion: I loved the bar scenes. That's where the 4 stars come from. I like the scenes with the Coyotes in them. They were the most interesting and the most fun. The rest of the story was cute, but what I really wanted was more of the Coyote Ugly. That was what was fun. I didn't really need another &quot;little girl makes it in the big city&quot; story. I did enjoy Kevin O'Donnell and his character. It was nice to see a good guy getting the girl for a change. I'm sick of the jerks that are mean to the girls and the girls who want them more because of it. John Goodman was great as the father struggling to be on his own. Maria Bello has been one of my favorites for a long time and she doesn't let us down here. I only wish she could have been the main character and we could have also seen into the lives of each of the Coyotes. Even though I wished for more of the bar, I was thoroughly entertained and enjoyed every minute of the movie. I ate up the deleted scenes that rounded out the story and filled in the holes. I will definitely be looking for a good deal on a used copy of this DVD to add to my collection.<br />DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 the best! Video quality is great!  Sound: DD5.1 with great music  Extras: There are plenty of extras. The deleted scenes show why we shouldn't have been surprised when Gloria got married. They also show people taunting Violet with predictions that she will fail. They help fill out the plot. Also included are the trailers, documentaries, and music video.  Menus: The menus are ok. Nothing to write home about.<br />What You Should Do:  Rent it unless you can get a good deal on a previously viewed copy. It's a guilty pleasure type movie, but the price for a new copy is too high.<br />Related Movies To Check Out: Road House, Flashdance, Cocktail, Doc Hollywooden surprised when Gloria got married.

B000002VC5|3.0|Though I never really caught on to their music when I was younger, I must admit that over 20 years later - I'm digging I Robot with a newer set of ears and can really appreciate the musicianship behind this album....A yeah, I can never play &quot;I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You&quot; lease than 7 or 10 times in a row.
0380730405|5.0|Wonderful English writing.  The best novel I have read in a very long time.<br />  I couldn't love the characters but I did very much love the novel.  It is a good mystery/romance.  The descriptions of Manderley, a big old English country house were wonderful.  So were the descriptions of the everyday routine of life at Manderley from time in the morning room with correspondence and a review of the planned menu to tea in the library.<br /> The author is clearly a class snob and does not speak well to anything she thinks inferior.  The whole idea of the story clearly points up her feeling that there should be special privileges for the aristocracy or near aristocracy.  But it is possible to get around all that because of the story and the descriptions.
B0000025RI|5.0|Firstly, I'm a big fan of Michael Jackson. Unfortunately, I was just 5 yrs old when this album was first released. But I do remember I watched him dancing in a tiny tv screen. Time passed and I was a teenage girl fascinating at some boybands. But I couldn't into those hot guys in the boybands. Cuz I already listened to his music. That was real music. All those rhythm, lyrics and dance were totally different from what I'd listened before. I became a big fan. I wish I listened to his music earlier, then I could feel the fever that you ppl over there remember. Anyways, I'm happy that I can feel his music, this great work in world's music history. He does make History. Sometimes, I put his CD in my CD player and spent all day listening. Really all day. from Off the wall to Blood on the dance floor over and over again. I hope you can have this experience too.<BR>It's incredible. Especially Thriller, it's amazing. I feel it's of no use of saying it's great. Cuz everybody's saying it. But you can say it from YOUR heart after listening to this. It was released in 1984 pretty old and maybe older than you. but it doesn't matter cuz it's just timeless. Time doesn't mean anything but the history and record this album has made.
B00004W55E|5.0|I've had this CD for about a year now and have listened to it at least once a day. That says something.<br />Ferrell has such command of her instrument--moreso than any other singer I can think of. Of course her touted coloratura-esque high notes can shake your undies down to your ankles, and her breath control and capacity would leave a bull elephant gasping with envy: both of which rest on a cushion of velvety low notes that give them greater relevance.<br />What strikes me most about Rachelle Ferrell is that she is able to capture and convey emotion like no other singer. For instance, her performance of I Can Explain says with wordless notes what language would be hard-pressed to explain: intense longing, pleading, searing heartache, and ultimately hope. In fact, it's interesting that the lyrics state that she can explain (why she's caused her lover pain) and yet she never does explain--in words. I think it's because she resolves to explain in the way only she can: through the language of the soul, made manifest through that amazing voice.<br />One more point: do nothing that requires your full attention while you listen to this CD. You'll likely cause an accident. Consider this comparable to one of those warning labels on some medications; do not operate heavy machinery while listening to Rachelle Ferrell.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Forget Priscilla ! You'd better think &quot;Bowie&quot; &quot;Glam Rock&quot; &quot;Punk&quot;... Excellent music, beautiful story, so inventive and creative... Just saw it at an avant premiere in paris france and preordered it now. This guy is talented as the actor and director... I can't wait for his next movie...
B00005OAJ1|2.0|I wasn't exposed to Tenacious D through their HBO bits so I might be a little lacking in perspective. However, I'm a big Jack Black fan from High Fidelity, and all I can say is Tenacious D. is low fidelity for small low-brow kicks. While mildly amusing on first listen, I believe I may have lost a few IQ points with each chuckle. I can't even fathom a second listen, because there's nothing really redeeming about the CD. I'm not a pro-PC guy, but I am pro-intelligence and I'm sorry guys, but how you screw women or screw up songs is not my idea of humor. And, I also expected more from the Dust Bros. production Come on are these the same guys that did Paul's Botique and O'Delay? Any producer could have done this high-gloss job. Pass this one by and make these guys work harder next time around!
B00004XQ83|5.0|All these songs are great.  It is a collection of blues, country, folk, bluegrasss, and gospel music, aptly described as roots music.  The album is executively produced by T. Bone Burnett.  To get an idea of how the songs sound like, rent the movie.  I would have to say that this is the best song-oriented soundtrack I have heard in a long time.  This is despite what kind of music you most commonly listen to.  The songwriting and execution is excellent by various contemporary artists of traditional and traditional-style songs.  Think turn of the century music that was not commercial (i.e. not big band or show tunes).  This is truly music that comes from the soul.  It is really great.  Once you listen to this CD enough you will probably want to explore the genre further.  It is really addictive.  And check out the amazing film by the Coen Brothers.
B00004VVNB|5.0|A great SF movie, I must say a master piece. Good actors. Still original with a deep reflexion about society. To be seen teenagers and older. One of my top ten SF movies.
B000002MY3|5.0|my favorite album ever!. Alanis is amazing in this album.<BR>u have to buy it.
6304316267|5.0|WOW!!! What a film to say that I was thrilled to bits would be an understatement. Everything was just right for me, the comedy was there combined with the ocasional piece of action. Which all blended together helped the film pave a way to my heart. The chracters where all brilliant Burt was at his best! Dean Martin played the perfect drunken wash-out. Whilst Roger Moore did a fantastic job of belittling himself whilst keeping his usual blend of humor and charm there for the audience to see (What a guy)! To miss this film would be a crime!!!
B000002WPI|5.0|If you like hip-hop and you don't own this album, you should do three things: Slap yourself in the head with a greasy trout, take a shower, and buy this album.<BR>This is the album that got me into hip-hop, and about 7 years after its release, it's still one of the best records i have. Never underestimate the immense influence this album has had, it's not often a whole genre changes through one album but in this case that's exactly what happened.<BR>Enter the Wu-Tang is breathtaking, raw from beginning to end, hip-hop in it's purest form. All mc's are excellent, and RZA's best productions are found on this album. Every track is awesome, but highlights are &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot;, &quot;Method Man&quot; and the legendary &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot;.<BR>Buy it, buy it, buy it, buy it, eat a cookie, buy it, buy it!!!
B000002LND|2.0|madonna fans will relive their fantasies with this collection of tired songs we still hear. madonna girl give it up, how many sexual statements can you make.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I actually bought this before I saw the movie, so at first it seemed like a great soundtrack.  As an avid Bono fan, I was thrilled to see his name among the list of artists, along with Beck, David Bowie, etc.  I even have to admit that I like the soundtrack version of &quot;Lady Marmelade&quot;... although I have to be in the right mood to hear it... and I was pleasantly surprised by the vocal talents of Nicole and Ewan.  Over all this CD was well worth the money I spent on it...<br />but...<br />after seeing the movie, I have to ask...<br />where's the rest of the soundtrack?  what happened to &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;?...and I'm *definitely* missing &quot;The Show Must Go On,&quot; which was easily my favorite song (and one of my favorite scenes) in the movie.  Just including the Queen cover would have pushed this all the way to a 5 star CD, for me.  It's still great, though, and I don't regret buying it in the least... I'll just keep hoping for a &quot;More Music from...&quot; CD.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I had never heard of Moby until I bought this album. I kept hearing his name and bought &quot;Play&quot; on a whim. And I'm glad I did because I would've never ventured into the field of techno (i.e. Daft Punk). Although I'm not a vegan, I respect Moby's faith, because I'm a religious person also. I'm a fan of all genres of music, but I assumed techno was strictly ambient/electronic/dancy music. Moby sets himself apart from the techno bunch with this negro spiritual-inspired, 18-track opus. It's amazing how you can take a plain ol' sample, add some tranquil, melodic background music and create a compelling work out of it. Add that to the fact that Moby is practically a one-man band and did all of the musical work himself. From classical to rock to techno, there's a song for everyone.  All in all, this album is a classic. And you don't even have to be a fan of the genre.  I would've given this 4 1/2 stars, but that's not an option, is it?  Nope.  My top 5 are &quot;Porcelain&quot; (my favorite one), &quot;Southside&quot;, &quot;Rushing&quot;, &quot;Bodyrock&quot;, and &quot;Inside&quot; (my second favorite one).  An honorable mention to &quot;Run On&quot; as well, because the lyrics coupled with the beat makes for a quite catchy song.  If you don't own anything by Moby because you don't like techno, you should at least give it one complete listen.  I didn't think I would be too thrilled about it either.  Granted, there could've been less repetitiveness with the samples, but it's something that you can listen to straight thru.  You can scoff at Moby if you want to, but do you think today's generation would even consider listening to late 1800's/early 1900's plantation music?  I'd probably squirm in my seat...
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Great, long awaited album. Definately worth the cash. Some of the greatest guitar riffs you will ever hear, matched with crazy flowing lyrics, twisted wit, and JB's heavenly pipes (heh)... Unparalleled album. Long live the D!
B00005NW02|5.0|I have had the cd for about a week. What I have been able to hear is extremely creative. They are not in some trite genre. They are creating something exciting and new. I think their next album will be something great. They are a little rough but the potential is amazing. The melodies are very infectious. Very clean and aggressive guitar and bass work. The percussion is very much like early sepeltura. Very tribal. I think everyone will being hearing alot more from this band in the future. I think if you like punk, metal, hard rock, or any kind of music with distorted guitar work this album is a must have. If you are a musician then it like hearing metallica in 81 or Smashing pumpkins in 91. The musicianship scares you its so fresh and creative. Well its 01 and heres your band.
B00005QATY|5.0|I am in love with this film.<br />I will admit, this is very different from other Coen films and it may be an acquired taste, but from the moment I turned it on I was hooked.  George Clooney is amazing.  He has a fantastic on-screen chemistry with every actor.  You can enjoy this without ever knowing the story of the Odessey, but I would recommend at least reading the cliff notes for it.  Knowing the Odessey makes the movie much more fun to watch.  The acting is wonderful, the story is classic, the writing is spectacular and the music is beautiful.  You must watch this film.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Gruesome!  Don't watch it unless you are willing to fast forward a few scenes.  <br />This is an ironically sick movie.  The script is well written, Anthony Hopkins is, of course, very good in his role, (but, you have to get past the cheesy voice overs that are supposed to be from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;) and Julianne Moore plays an excellent Agent Clarice Starling (a tough act to follow after Jodie Foster's role).  Director Ridley Scott makes another great movie (Gladiator was similarly excellent while being gruesome, but not quite as gross as this). <br />The photography is stunning (except the grossly gruesome disgusting scenes).  The locations are beautiful. The music is excellent. The editing is wonderful. The deeper uses of symbolism is intriguing and challenging, Etc. Etc. Etc.  There really are some many technically and artistically great things about this movie; but in the end (literally) it becomes exceptionally gruesome, with a extraordinarily odious and contemptible  final scene.<br />I would not recommend this movie for almost anyone because several gruesome scenes go too far.  <br />Of course, there are those who like to push their personal limits.  But, if this is something they would enjoy...... maybe Hannibal would make a good evening for them!
B00005NNMK|4.0|As a remastered version of Europe's crossover and breaktrough 1986 album,this amounts to a very good job,except for the typo in spelling the title of the track 'Rock the Night';even that can make this new version a collector's item.This is a great album,recorded by a band at the height of their creative powers,blending pop and metal,Joey Tempest's great vocals with John Norum's legendary guitar prowess,all in the name of creating an artistic product of lasting value and able to still create interest.
B000002NJS|5.0|Great dance tunes with an eclectic mixture of songs.  I would have to say this is my favourite Madonna CD so far...look forward to more to come!
0062502182|1.0|I bought this book after I heard people talk about how wonderfull it is and how it contains many grate ideas. Well, let me tell you - I was disappointed. First of all I felt like the author was assuming I (the reader) was incredibly stupid. Otherwise, I really don't know why he kept repeating himself. In my opinion, the one idea the book does have, could have been easily summarized into 2 to 3 pages. At most.<br />Second of all, I think this book hasn't a single original thought in it. People have been writing about one's dreams, his abilty to do anything if he believes, the goodness of human being etc. since for-ever. The only thing Coelho did is: he recycled.<br />And last but not least, think a minute to yourself and answer this question: Does the idea of a boy traveller in search of meaning remind of anything?  I have one name for you:  The Little Prince (and really, if you want to go with the &quot;real stuff&quot; read The Prince and don't waste your time with this silly book).
0743216458|5.0|Since reading Citizen Soldiers about a year ago, Stephen Ambrose has been one of my favorite military historians. Having read several different unit histories before, I found Band of Brothers a refreshing exception. Choosing more personal level instead of usual &quot;platoon this did that while being supported by X squad&quot; is an excellent way of telling about small unit actions. Ambrose follows 1944-1945 Screaming Eagles´ European battles mainly through certain members of E company. He has chosen just the right level of telling their (E company´s) story without writing too much about same person at a time or certain battle or other happening. While reading this book one finds out that these elite soldiers were just ordinary men with same problems all other people had at that time. This book isn´t some serious tactical study but a true war story which has been told just like war stories should be told.<br />Apart from this book I also highly recommend Ambrose´s Citizen Soldiers and D-Day for all those who are interested about US Army in western Europe during later part of WW2.
B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks rates as one of the most singularly innovative additions to network telelvision.  David Lynch's obsession with making the everyday middle-american world beautifully strange (the word &quot;awe&quot; with its horrific element intact is useful here) and Mark Frost 's (St Elsewhere) quirky writing meld seamlessly in this soap opera that exposes to much beneath its surface.  The episodic nature of television often strains to create new episodes that maintain sturdy characters while repeatedly playing the same scenario over and over.  In this case the characters are superficial, common and quirky.  But rather than falling into the dull routine of love triangles and deceit (although TP has these in abundance)  Lynch and Frost immediately disrupt quiet american life with a murder--a dead prom queen, Laura Palmer, floats up to Pete Marshall shattering his early morning fishing routine.  The town is cast into chaos.  FBI agent Dale Cooper, played perfectly by Kyle MacLachlan, enters the town wide-eyed and appreciative of its tranquil simplicity.  Using holistic methods, Cooper unravels the black underbelly that provides the illusion of innocence.  Playing between superficial soap opera moments and some of the most horrific and surreal moment ever shown on TV, Lynch and Frost use the weekly format to delve deeply into the dark forces and evils which exists within beauty.  And the show is ultimately beautiful in its raw exploration that reveals fear is always obliterated by love--not justice or truth.  The show's inteligence survived its first season by hiding behind the murder mysery of Laura Palmer.  Lynch and Frost planned to leave this mystery unsolved indefinitely in order to explore all corners of Twin Peaks.  Unfortunately, the network forced the team to rush towards a solution in the second season fearing that ratings were dropping because viewers needed closure (actually Twin Peaks was losing the soap opera element as they realized the world of Twin Peaks was more complex and real than most prime time viewers were prepared to patiently stomach).  Without its central nexus and Lynch leaving to complete Wild at Heart, the show floundered until Lynch's return.  However, the show snapped back into brilliance following Lynch's return.  But it was too late.  The show met the same fate of all brilliant American network shows that shined too brightly before its time--it was cancelled.  The team put together a final TV movie that &quot;ended&quot; the show in the manner it began.  Lynch followed it with a dreamlike prequel in the theaters called Fire Walk With Me (a creepy mantra pulled from Laura's phantom killer).  All of this if assembled adds up to a work of visual art that was way ahead of its time and dismissed as quirky and silly--but its rough end was probably caused by people expecting to be entertained by quirkines, but kept safe from the show's more awesome yet brutal spectacles.  Still the entire work (if one can find it all and watch it in order) stands as a challenge to network programming need for dumbed-down product.  First time viewers and skeptical fans should bravely revisit this fragmented masterpiece.
B00005QATY|3.0|I had a strange experience with this movie.  I really disliked it after I saw it, I mean really really disliked it.  But over the next few days I continued to think about it and remember funny parts of it.  And the music was outstanding.  All together, I think I'm glad I saw it.  But I'd definitely try to watch it first before buying to make sure it is to your taste.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Diana Krall is a supertalented singer and pianist. On this album she shows too less of both. I love her for these subtile piano solos she played on the albums &quot;Love Scenes&quot; and &quot;All for you&quot;, which are reallllly great ! But this album is more likely to listen to on a snowy december day, with the cat on the oven. I miss the colours of her voice and solos. The gave me so much. In November she will be in Hamburg and i am very happy cause i will listen to a great musician of our time, back the her roots... <BR>The guitar sound is much warmer than every other guitarist i listened to, but his solos had been greater on the albums mentioned above.
B00005N9CV|1.0|Sure, the album photography is great, her voice is great, as is her piano skills, but like another reviewer so poignantly noted, this is not jazz...it's Lawrence Welk's greatest hits.  Seriously, (and I hate saying this), but if you want to be bored to death, or at least put to sleep, listen to the orchestral arrangements and the soft violins and let this sleeper of an album take you away.  I really hate saying this, becuase I have every other one of her albums, and besides a few tracks from her last album, I love just about every song she's recorded.  I've seen her live twice and in televised performances...and let's just say I was expecting some more jazz-oriented tunes with great piano riffs and her super-sultry voice, and what I got was a bunch of sappy violins.
B000002B5L|5.0|There are few albums that are good all the way through, from beginning to end. This one is. Lauren Hill is an excellent singer and rapper, she makes really good music, and she is sexy. Pras has one of the coolest voices, and is not heard enough. His solo album was disappointing. Wycleff is around too much these days. I've gone off him completely. Some nice raps here also by John Forte. Check out his album, 'Poli Sci'. 'The Score' is one of the classic albums of the 90s.
B000001GPX|5.0|I have 3 complete cycles of Beetoven's symphonies, but this is a must-have addition for every music lover. While it can be argued on the light and easy view Kleiber emphasizes in the 7th, both performances are unparalleled in intensity and vitality. The only better performance I am aware of is the 4th symphony - by Kleiber and the Bavarian State Orchestra, dated 1987.
B00005QXDD|5.0|The greatest band in the world makes the greatest cd in the world. This is not just for fans of 'The D' or of Jack Black. Anybody whose looking for a good rock album that makes you feel good should buy this album NOW!!!
B00005LB9O|4.0|This cd is pretty good.  It's mellow and calming you know, something you could go to sleep with.  It gives me something to listen to when I get tired of the same Blur, Oasis,and other Brit pop cd's.  Some good songs are Sing, which is just amazing with the bango and the lyrics, and even the video is pretty cool, Side, The Humpty Dumpty Love Song, and Pipedreams.  I gave this cd a 4 becuase it seems like when you listen to the whole cd in one sitting, the songs begin to sound a lot a like, and the cd begins to get boring.  Nevertheless, it's still worth buying.
B000021YQV|5.0|I give this awesome CD 5 stars, because, I think System Of a down did a great job on this cd. I love the songs Needles, and Chop Suey!.
B000002BFZ|5.0|For those looking for another TEN, this is the wrong place to go.  NO CODE is the key album to understanding Pearl Jam and is the turning point of their career, some say for better, others for worst.  However, their progression is a journey, and this release is the one where Pearl Jam came to a fork in the road and chose a direction to follow. <br />Now, for those looking for another TEN, its time to move on.  You cannot expect an artist (a good one, that is) to go on milking the same formula.  Where would we be had The Beatles kept singing songs like I Want to Hold Your Hand, instead of traveling to the majesties of Hey Jude, and Revolution, (the White Album version)?  <br />Following Pearl Jam, in some ways, is like following Bob Dylans and The Beatles career.  These three aforementioned are true artists, and so their evolution makes a very exciting one to follow.  You cant really get the full impact of BLONDE ON BLONDE without knowing the six records preceding it, or RUBBER SOUL without hearing the five albums and myriad singles before that.  With this album, you cant really get the full impact without having at least a passing knowledge of the three records before this one.<br />Commercially, this is Pearl Jams worst release, and there are no biggies in the song selection such as Alive, Even Flow, Daughter, or Better Man.  However, just because a particular album does not get a lot of radio play does not necessarily negate it to the recycle bin.  Almost all the tracks are very strong compositions.  Sometimes the band falls down, such as Present Tense, which seems just a little to preach to me, and Habit, which says the same lines over and over and over for three and a half minutes.  Some may really like them, but for me theyre just so-so.  Mankind I still dont really know what to do with, because, although I like it, the song is a rather odd selection for the tone of this album.  Only one song will take you back to their earlier grunge days, and that is Lukin, which is just over a minute and sounds like Eddies vocal cords are ripped to shreds when he finishes.  I have a live version of the song and I cant understand anything he says in it.  <br />Pearl Jam, with their release of TEN in 1991, became one of the major players in the early 1990s along with Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.  Of these bands, Pearl Jam has had the longest career, and amazingly did not self-destruct as Nirvana did.  There is a reason for this, and this album becomes on of the keys in understanding Pearl Jam.<br />The first three albums are begin a descent into the hellish regions of rage and its effects on the human psyche.  VITALOGY, Pearl Jams darkest album, almost plays as a concept album about paranoia, pain, and death.  Eddie Vedders emotions and struggle for understanding are laid out for all to see, and the all consuming rage will have to either be allievated or only more ill could come.  The single most important moment on that particular album is Immortality, where Vedder deals with Kurt Cobains suicide.  Had the rage been allowed to continue, Pearl Jam could not have continued for much longer.  Its no conincidence that the first two albums sound like earlier extensions of VITALOGY.  They begin a downward spiral and absolutely plummet in VITALOGY, and the reason for all the experiments that made VITALOGY so uneven was because Pearl Jam was already, in their rage and fighting their own personal demons, were trying to come up with a way to deal with it.<br />With NO CODE, their most varied and least accessible album on a commercial level, find Pearl Jam on the morning after.  The first three albums represent the night before, drunken rage and struggle for understanding of this inherently insane world (or so it would seem) being nights only companion.  From a musical standpoint this release takes the rather roughshod experiments of VITALOGY and builds an album out of them, resulting in the most sonically different album in this bands catalogue.  Here, with all sorts of world vibes going down with mantra percussion and some of the softest songs of this bands career, instead of rage Vedder contemplates in a rational manner the problems facing him, and this record shows Pearl Jam finding solace in this course of action.  <BR>The experiments on VITALOGY borderline, at times, on the unlistenable with the likes of poorly executed sound collages (Foxeymophandlmama) or the inane (Bugs).  Dont think its because of a musical aversion to experimental music, because I really like Revolution 9.  Here, however, with the rage gone, the band focuses on this branching out more, and instead of half-realised thoughts on VITALOGY, we have full musical expressions.  The chaotic and unrealised song fragments or experimental vibes help indicate Pearl Jams searching, and while making an ascethic contribution, I always find myself skipping over them.  The musical expansion on NO CODE, the maturing of a band, ties in with the bands personal growth as human beings.  With the rage stripped away, instead we have a more subdued Pearl Jam dealing with problems in their lives with contemplation, which is one reason that it is the single most mellow album in their catalogue.  It is sad the fan base couldnt see that.<br />In the end, this is Pearl Jams turning point.  From here on out, their releases (1998s YIELD and 2000s BINURAL) would reflect this and further expand this bands journey.  It is a rather sad fact that, despite it being a very strong album, the fan base simply wouldnt rally behind this one.  This album had to come out, or Pearl Jam would just continually be plagued with their demons and artistically they would begin to lose their momentum and eventually self-destruct.  Without Pearl Jam making this choice to let go of their anger, I do notthink theyd still be around today, and I think Cobains death was a very sobering moment for them.  With this decision to move on, we have Pearl Jams most touching, heart-felt, and most fully realised album to date.
B00005ABKC|5.0|A very risky move at the time, Petty abandoned the rootsy, radio-friendly &quot;Damn The Torpedoes&quot; sound and ventured into harder rock territory with this CD. The songs are top-drawer, featuring infectious rockers like &quot;The Waiting,&quot; (although a superior version was recorded in 1995 by Linda Ronstadt), &quot;Nightwatchman,&quot; &quot;King's Road,&quot; and &quot;Something Big.&quot; One of the gems here is &quot;She's A Woman In Love,&quot; which was never released as a single. Hard Promises missed the commercial mark(et) and was ahead of new wave-laden early 80's Top-40 rock radio, but it's aim stands the test of time.
6305622914|5.0|The Full Monty was a delightful film.  I first watched it with friends after a holiday dinner and decided to get it and share it with my husband who also found it enjoyable.  The characters are well rounded, and the details of their lives and personal tribulations make them thoroughly engaging.<br />What I found most endearing was the development of closeness among the men whose fiscal disasters had brought them together in the first place.  No matter how outrageous the concept of the average guy getting naked in a Chippendales' style review, the spirit and courage of the men were wonderful to see.  So too was the gradual regrowth of their sense of personal worth as they worked out their routine together.  The scene in the unemployment queue with the men unconsciously going through their routine to background music was wonderful.
B000002MUN|4.0|This is Petty's first release for Warner Bros, sending MCA scrambling to release a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package and representing a turning point in Petty's career. His songwriting is still strong as steel and his melodies are every bit as infectious as his early work, but Petty seems to have found his own path here. There is a sense of serenity and peace, of knowing you've still got it, delivering straight-ahead rockers like &quot;You Wreck Me,&quot; and &quot;You Don't Know How it Feels,&quot; a radio-topping hit. Not many baby-boomer rockers can lay claim to that feat.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Lasse Hallstrom's film version of the Joanne Harris' novel Chocolat is as delightful a confection as were the heroines' chocolate creations themselves.  The plot is intricate and intriguing, carrying the viewer through the emotional transformations of each of the main characters.  In a sleepy medieval French town where life has assumed a repressive structure that has created an emotionally frozen and empty life for even the most highly placed members of its society, the heroine Vianne and her daughter arrive to set up a chocolate shop.  With her wonderfully concocted sweets she manages to liberate some of the denizens of the town, revealing their potential for greater happiness.  The story has a sense of myth, fantasy, and fairytale about it that leaves the viewer with a feeling of personal satisfaction.<br /><br />This is a film full of strong female performers.  Judi Dench is especially wonderful as a curmudgeonly elderly woman estranged from her daughter and forbidden to see her grandson.  Juliette Binoche does a fine job as the heroine.  She is as fragile and seductive as Monroe in some scenes and as forceful and independent as Bacall in others.  Lena Olin is wonderful as the abused wife who rises from the confusion and ashes of her own ruined personality like a phoenix under the influence of the heroine.<br />This is one of the best movies I've seen in a ling while, and I expect to order and read the book upon which it was based--something I rarely do.
B000021YQV|5.0|ever had an eargasm?  well if u want one...buy this CD!  Its so incredible i loved the first but Toxicity takes the cake!  ATWA is possibly my most fav song.  check it out
B00005OAJ1|5.0|I bought Tenacious D on the day of release. I had been anticipating it and I was certainly not dissapointed.  It is hilarious but what really suprised me, was the talent.  My god, aside from being funny as hell, they're great musicians as well.  The harmonizing gives the songs a more serious feel, which in turn, makes them even funnier.  Hearing Dave Grohl play the drums was also a real treat.  I also love Jack Black's sense of humor.  I don't care what anyone says about the swearing, I love it.  Call it my inner 8th grader coming out, but I still find profanity funny if it's done right, which in this case, it is.  I was playing this for a friend of mine last night and he said it actually made him sad.  He said that they have so much talent but they're only making funny stuff.  Oh well, he still ended up buying the album.  <br />Jack Black is a comedy genius.  He proved that in High Fidelity and it's looking like he's about to get back on track after Saving Silverman with Shallow Hal.  <br />If you thought he was funny in High Fidelity, this is the album for you.  Some of the highlights are \\"Tribute\\",  \\"Friendship\\", \\"Kyle Quit the Band\\", and \\"One Note Song\\".  I also love the spoken skits.  <br />Tenacious D is defintitely worth your cash.  Buy it now.
B00000BKDW|5.0|This is just one of all of the awesome Maiden albums out there. As usual, it is perfect. Maiden and Guns 'N' Roses are the Best bands ever. 'nuff said.
B0000524E5|4.0|Is Coyote Ugly a movie masterpiece...no...of course not...but it is a film that will make you laugh and maybe even get you up on the table dancing. Well that last one is a long shot but you will have fun watching this film. Filled with a kick butt soundtrack and likeable performances from the relatively unknown cast. It's the classic Cinderella story that offers few surprises but it shouldn't matter. It's very well done and Piper Perabo is very impressive and has the makings of a star!
B00000BKDV|5.0|I got this cd a few months ago, and since I only new a couple of their songs, I only listened to a few. But then I heard 'Where Eagles Dare' and I loved it. But the biggest surprise was 'Revelations'. I started listening to it one day and I loved it! The lyrics are so good, and the melodies and solos are incredible. This is a must-have for any Maiden fan anywhere! Up the Irons! Eddie is forever!
B00005JKES|5.0|they release all television series' in box sets of season's. they wouldn't release both season's in one box; the second season will most likely be available next year (if the first sells well). so buy this set, then buy the second season, then buy the pilot... it's just like any television series (i.e. the sopranos). season box sets. besides, this is the best television series known to mankind.
B00005NB0H|5.0|This double CD of one of the greatest live concerts in rock 'n roll history is fantastic in his deluxe edition. The sound is as raw and powerful as ever, and he liner notes including are very detailed including great live photos of the band in full flight on valentine's night 1970...Great CD!!
0671004107|5.0|This book is pure magic. I very rarely read science fiction (I tend to think it's a genre best left to adolescent boys), but \\"Contact\\" is no mere adventure story. Rather, it's a soaring achievement of intellect and imagination -- and a love letter to the human race. So much better than the movie, which was already quite good. It's like the movie, squared.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Its hard to find an album that encompases everything that this one does..punk and hip hop its amazing and when del hits the microphone you know youre in for quality...Im a bit worried about the perosn who would buy this and give it only 1 star afterall what were you expecting from it...this is hip hop and punk if you dont like either dont buy it you wont like it...Let me stress this is hip hop not rap..those true heads out there will know what Im talking about if you have to ask yourself what is hip hop then dont buy this at all you will not truly appreciate its meaning..peace
B00003CX8J|1.0|Bryan Singer proved he was a good director with the usual suspects and what is here looks good and is stylishly done. Infact it would have made a great first half of a film. Unfortunately it is the whole thing!The film sets up the sequels really well and they might well be good films, but when i pay to see a movie i want to see a movie, not an extended trailor for a soon-to-be movie franchise.This is like the pilot of a T.V. series.Sets up the characters, ends with a short action sequence to show what they can do and that's it.VERY DISAPPOINTING!!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I was extremely excited to receive this DVD....  Upon opening it, one gets the feeling that it is truly a special edition.  The packaging is very nice: the DVD box is sturdy with two openings for each disk.  The pamphlet inside the DVD is gorgeously produced and very helpful.<br />My first impression is that Disney has spent much time making this DVD user-friendly.  There is an abundance of directions and drawings showing you what is on the disk and how to get there.  Since there are two disks and a KINGDOM of information to pour through, these directions are very welcome (even to this seasoned DVD-viewer!)<br />Disney pulls out some familiar faces to make the experience as warm as possible:  Disney himself appears in various footage; Angela Lansbury narrates the documentary and provides a &quot;tour&quot; of the disks; Michael Eisner shows up; and Barbra Streisand sings a specially recorded version of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot;.<br />SNOW WHITE, the movie, looks gorgeous and, although old fashioned, is quite wonderful.  SNOW WHITE, the double-disk, is a lot of information to wade through.  I am amazed at the amount of behind-the-scenes film that exists!  Disney must have suspected that he was creating a classic - he filmed every aspect of it!  I especially enjoy the HALL OF ART section.  There are 3 halls of various story art (i.e. &quot;The cottage&quot;; &quot;The castle&quot;; &quot;the Forest&quot;; etc.)  Although initially I found it hard to move from hall to hall, I eventually figured it out.  The animated HALLS are extraordinary and the art that &quot;hangs&quot; there is incredible -- various renderings and attempts at bringing the story and locales of SNOW WHITE alive.  It's even more incredible that Disney Co. held on to these papers for all these years.<br />Well, in case you can't tell, I highly recommend the special SNOW WHITE disks.  You will spend days looking at everything that is included -- or you can opt to spend an hour and a halfviewing the original,gorgeous film that started the Disney empire....
B00005J79H|5.0|If you like this CD (or maybe especially if you didn't like it) see the excellent DVD!<br />18 great arrangements of Scorpions' classics + three cover versions of Kansas(Dust in the Wind), Queen(Love of my life) and the Cars(Drive).<br />Great video quality, shot with 12 cameras, excellent sound (DTS)!<br />Maybe a good reason to buy a DVD player .....
B00005NW02|5.0|O.k., I originally wrote System of a Down off as yet another wanna-be corporate Mtv &quot;nu-metal&quot; band.  I WAS WRONG.  THIS CD IS FANTASTIC!  Yes, I do think that SoaD should get down on their knees and worship at the feet of &quot;Faith No More&quot; (this CD brings &quot;King for a Day&quot; and &quot;Album of the Year&quot; to mind), but they really have their own sound that comes out and distinguishes itself from other bands.<br />I really liked their first CD, and on &quot;Toxicity&quot; the band is even more polished.  The only song that doesn't seem to fit on the CD for me is &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;.  It sound a little out of place compared to the other music, but that's probably because I've heard it on the radio so much.  With good reason, it's a great song!<br />Anyway, the rest of the CD is a little heavier than the radio hit.  I really like the lyrics.  The lyrics of most of the songs talk about social or political injustices, like Rage.  Unlike Rage, SOAD has a sense of humor and don't seem to take up an issue with Everything.<br />All in all, I think this CD is a safe buy.  Metal friends of mine are split on their opinions of this CD.  Some love it, some hate it.  The odd singing and rapid time changes could definitely throw a listener off.  I know this is often said, but I really believe that if you don't like it at first listen, believe it or not &quot;Toxicity&quot; WILL grow on you.  So will their first CD.  If you like Faith No More, Korn, and Rage; go ahead and experiment with System of a Down.  If you can, see them live, too.  Their energy could light the planet!  (Am I the only person who thinks that the lead singer of System looks like B-Real on a massive ammount of stimulants?)
1572522089|5.0|This is simply the greatest film ever made.  It provides an insight into the human condition unmatched in film history. It ranks with the great masterworks in history Hamlet Illiad Mahabharata The Gospel According To Luke.  It shows what humans are like and why our world is the way it is.  No film can match this. If one ever does I will be sure to let you know.
B0000026WD|5.0|This is an album recorded by a genius. His talent is second to none and this album just underlines this. What ever you want from this album you can get, be it: Dance - then turn to 'Dangerous', Catchy - then turn to 'Remember the Time', a group sing along and measage - 'Heal the World', a song for a lost loved one - 'Gone to soon', a Christian prayer - 'Will you be there?', right down to just pure sound and fushion - 'JAM'.<BR>This album is a master piece which makes any CD collection compleate and sturs the soul when listened to.<BR>~<BR>One request to ALL - &quot;Please don't judge him, take him for what God has put him there for, a voice, a dancer, a music maker and a few more tings when you look at him in Love and not in judging.<BR>~<BR>This is an exceptional album, 'Own it' and 'Enjoy it'

B000002KOQ|5.0|There's really no serious debate among fans of Joni or pop-rock in general as to what her best album is - all those who have ears to hear proclaim the monumentally great Blue her high watermark.  The real argument is over which disc ranks second best.  Most fans and critics say Court and Spark holds that honor.  I think it's unquestionably Ladies of the Canyon.  <br />This is the album on which Joni cuts loose most confidently with the pure instrument which is the high end of her soprano range.  In fact, part of Blue's greatness is in its retention of that singing style.  However, her singing on this album is perhaps unique among her catalog for the innocence it conveys on many of the songs.  This is without a doubt her last &quot;flower child&quot; album, and perhaps the one most deserving of the appellation.  <br />While the album's mood bears some resemblence to Clouds, the differences and advancement over that album are revealed in the first track.  Joni's rich acoustic guitar tones and girlish vocal approach familiarly carry the verse; then, in the chorus, a welcome new sound - the crystalline, icewater tones of a piano.  The album unfolds with arrangements which convey at once a spare innocence and a gorgeous, multihued flexibility.  I think that it is her best-arranged album (only Blue and Hejira really come close).  The second song, &quot;For Free,&quot; exemplifies why, using a cello and lovely syncopated clarinet solo to supplement Joni's vox and piano in a celebration of the spirit of musical expression.  <br />What else makes Ladies of the Canyon a sublime masterpiece?  Well, &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; is probably the funnest, most life-giving musical expression in Joni's entire corpus - a shrewdly jaunty way of conveying a sobering message.  &quot;The Arrangement&quot;'s haunting suspended piano chords treat hippie capitulation to the yuppie ruse as a profound tragedy - the stuffed shirt Joni so mournfully and movingly laments &quot;Coulda been more/ than a name on the door/ on the 33rd floor/ in the air&quot; - so much potential, but now he's dead to Joni, to the world of spirit and beauty, to himself.  A masterpiece.  The Clouds-esque &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; celebrates the various faces of womanhood with three vivid character sketches - friends of Joni's from Laurel Canyon?  <br />Meanwhile, some of Joni's best reports from the love front find their home here. &quot;Conversation&quot;'s strums foretell &quot;BYT&quot; while relating a story of an unhappily-married man rendezvousing with Joni to cry on her shoulder.  I can taste the apples and cheeses.  At the end, it erupts into overdubbed choral chanting, flute glissandos and a smoky bari sax solo.  &quot;Willy&quot; forecasts Joni's future fusion-inspired work with its rubato, syllable-squeezing vocal approach.  Willy is the man Joni actually wants to settle down with (!!!), but he's too emotionally damaged and shiftless to commit.  Idiot.  &quot;Rainy Night House&quot; brings the cello back to provide a subtle bottom to Joni's piano as she sings evocatively of the beginnings of a fling with a silver spoon dropout.  In &quot;Blue Boy,&quot; written in the third person, a woman looks for love from a cold &quot;blue boy&quot; interested in sex and little else.  He starts out figuratively as a statue; she ends up one as his interest cools.  Musically, this foreshadows Blue, with Joni singing sorrowfully at the top of her range, and letting her voice break movingly at the end of the long phrases at the end of each verse.  <br />Joni's version of &quot;Woodstock&quot; is not my favorite song on the disc, but its impressionistically anthemic generational claims sound less silly from Joni than from anyone else. It makes me ALMOST wish I was a Baby Boomer.  Almost.  <br />Ladies of the Canyon's best song is also its oldest, the closing &quot;Circle Game,&quot; which dates from 1966 and had been covered multiple times by the time she released her own version.Its poignantly sweet campfire singalong fable of the inability to stay the passage of time still suggests that childhood dreams can come true.  It paints and seals this masterpiece collection of songs, with all of its emotional twists and turns, with a gossamer veneer of redemptive innocence.
0140564349|5.0|I have to give this book five stars for being my absolute favorite book when I was little.  I used to make my mom read it to me over and over, I must have heard it a million times!  I grew up near Boston and you can see real places in Boston in some of the pictures.  If you are a kid or a parent with kids you definitely need this book, especially if you are in or near Boston.  I haven't read it in a long time (I'm 16 now) but I can still picture all the pictures.

B00004U2HK|5.0|I just ordered this video today, but it is one of the best musicals ever!  My husband just finished working on Sound of Music - the sing-a-long version at the Performing Arts Center in Nashville.  He comes home singing all the songs!  At his request I purchased a copy of the VHS tape so he can show me how the &quot;sing-a-long&quot; version works.  We haven't rec'd it yet, but I've seen it many times and love it every time!

B000000WJ2|2.0|I am a huge Keith Richards fan, and it saddens me to give any of his work a negative rating.  Main Offender starts off strong with an excellent, driving rocker, 999.  Unfortunately, everthing else on this disk falls off the quality precipice from the second track onwards.  Many of these tunes sound very familiar - they are mainly borrowed from Talk Is Cheap, in particular the song Rip It Up.  Unlike that earlier song, though, Richards does not inject much passion, excitement or edge to these songs, but just seems to be going through the motions.  On track four, Richards attempts reggae, but stumbles blandly.  On the seventh track, Hate It When You Leave, Richards changes pace again to a 60's Motown sound - imagine an effete, diluted version of I'll Be There.  A better name for this track should be Hate It When You Leave This Song Playing - it's sappy and just awful.<br /><br />These songs, other than the opening track, do not feature any significant quantity of memorable guitar playing.  Furthermore, Richards has tried to mellow out his voice more than on any of his songs on Stones albums, such as Little T&A.  Keith should acknowledge that he will never, in a million years, have a good, melodic voice and instead of trying to sing \\"nicely\\" go back to his raspy, harsh and thin sounding vocals that his fans like so much.  Without Keith's emotional guitar playing and scratchy voice, what's the point?  Play some excellent Richards music from Talk Is Cheap for the five-hundreth time before considering this unoriginal, lackluster effort.<br /><br />EDIT 9/20/11:  OK, a decade after I wrote this review 6 out of 7 people who rated it rated it as not-helpful. For anyone who disliked this review enough to hit the NH button, please have the integrity to post a comment explaining why, rather than just being a cyber-snob without any accountability.  Seriously, I'd really like to hear an intelligent comment explaining how anything I've written here is not accurate.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek was just an ogre that wanted to be left alone. He was a solitary creature that lived in his swamp quite happily. Or at least that was until his home was invaded by numerous fairy tale creatures from the near by kingdom of Duloc. In a quest to regain his swamp, Shrek meets a fast talkin' side kick named Donkey, a beautiful princess, and a whole lot of unexpected surprises on every step of the way. Obstacle after obstacle being conquered, Shrek finds that the biggest test he will face is to trust his heart, and follow it. A hilarious film that will make you fall off your chair, and leave you wishing this most fabulous fairy tale never told didn't have to end. Some memorable lines include: &quot;When this is over I'm going to need a lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'.&quot; Or &quot;You didn't slay the dragon?&quot; &quot;It's on my to do list.&quot; I definately smell a hit in Shrek's pond scum.
0792837614|5.0|My husband just finished working on the technical end of &quot;West Side Story&quot; at the Performing Arts Center in Nashville.  Not being one who usually likes musicals - he surprised me by coming home and singing songs from the play.  He worked the show for a couple of weeks and at his request I purchased a copy of the VHS tape.  We haven't had time to watch it yet, but I've seen it many times and love it every time!

This is a strong buy!
B0000584V3|4.0|I get a lot of unsolicited CDs to review, mostly death metal bands with corpses and satanic goats on the covers, bands with names from a morticians text book and members whose names are full of umlauts. After a quick glance, these CDs usually go into the trash or into the hands of my Venisection neighbor. And so it was as I opened the latest brown puffy mailer. Opeth. Never heard of 'em. Their bio sheet says they are from Sweden (aren't they all?)... no umlauts but lots of funny little circles, and that this is their fifth album. But the cover intrigued me enough to at least put the CD in for a sample. Very heavy and passionate with an interesting riff, fast but not to the point that it becomes blurred. And then the singer started in with the typical death metal &quot;belching the alphabet&quot; roar. Had it not been for the progressive, irregular rhythm and raw yet focused energy, I probably would have removed the disc. Five minutes into this dark, heavy track, the meter changed to 3/4, the tempo slowed, and light broke out as the hard-edged metal guitars were exchanged for acoustic, the rough melody replaced by a real, singable melody and the gravelly voice traded for silken, clear vocals. Two minutes of this startling interlude and the listener was plunged again into the dark roller coaster ride. Other tracks continue in this chiaroscuro, taking the listener through the darkest storm only to surprise them with rays of sunshine and abating rain. Instead of being abrupt, these drastic transitions are expertly executed, going from one extreme to another seamlessly and naturally. There seems to be a common theme throughout the eight tracks, though I've yet to be able to find a riff or a melody that ties it all together. This cohesiveness lends a nearly symphonic feel to the album. Most of the songs range from six to twelve minutes and this band works exceptionally well in such a large-scale environment. The songs never become tired or repetitive due to it's depth, sophisticated song structures, progressive elements and use of dynamics and atmosphere. Lyrically Opeth is pretty bleak but intelligently written, but what do you expect with song titles like &quot;The Funeral Portait&quot; and, well, &quot;Bleak.&quot; With it's simmering black caldron full of death metal, prog, folk metal and classic rock, this album is difficult to categorize but easily one of the most pleasant and surprising finds I've had in the last year.
9998221641|5.0|It is hard to believe that 6 centuries ago we felt the same as we do now. The beginnings of the check system for exchange. The horrors of the plagues, the expulsion of the jews from the continent, the excesses of the holy men and the evolution of arms from the sword to the longbow to the deadly crossbow which finished armor. The crossing of the channel and the capture of the king of France to be held for ransom. <BR>     It is truly a distant mirror and Barbara Tuchman has I think honestly depicted the times and made me know that our wars are just a continuation of history that has gone on forever.
B00005NWRS|3.0|The cover of 'Gold' screams 'rebellion'- a wild-haired Adams seemingly swaying off-balance in front of an upside-down American Flag. This, coupled with the extravagant praise he has received in the alt-country-friendly section of the UK media, means it is a major surprise to discover just how 'middle of the road' and conservative this album sounds. <br />Don't get me wrong- this is not a bad record. Indeed, with the cascading excitement of 'NY, NY' and the beautiful, reflective 'La Cienega..' leading the way, it is undoubtedly a great testament to Adams' songwriting talent and voice. It just sounds like the work of a old man, rather than the 26 yr old enfant terrible the hype suggests.<br />I'm also confused by Adams' use of his influences. 'Answering Bell' and 'Rescue Blues', taken in isolation, are both great songs, but in the context of  musical history, which Adams himself evokes frequently in interviews, they are little more than Karaoke versions of Van Morrison and Stones tracks. This is not the work of a creative genius- just a very good covers band.<br />I had not heard any of Adams' other records before 'Gold', but there is more than enough here to send me off in search of the old Whiskeytown stuff which made his reputation- and which must, surely, be a more satisfying record than this latest release
B00005N9CV|2.0|I think in this album Diana tried to win you over with the pictures rather then the music. I felt her songs lacked emotion.She had more pictures then songs. It is no doubt that Diana is a pretty woman but that isn't why I listen to her music. I love Jazz but this album was in a low bedroom whisper (as I have heard another reviewer say)and wasn't what I think she is capable of.Sex is what sells in pop but not in jazz, we want substance and emotion.I was disappointed.
B000051XSD|5.0|I love this tape. Almost all the songs are lovely, soothing and great to relax with. I recommend it highly.
B00005N9CV|1.0|Disappointing and dull-sameness best describe this album.  Her voice is nice, but nothing changes in her delivery or musical arrangements.   The artistic merit is extremely low.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I once was a big fan of LB...then along came this album.  Intro sucked...then came \\"Hot Dog\\", which is an infuriating track because it just so happens NIN is my favorite band.  It's nothing but a wasted effort to \\"try\\" to prove that LB is more creative and more bad@ss than NIN.  Sorry Freddie, didn't quite catch on.  The whole album is far from creative.  The whole album is nothing more than whiny, unthought lyrics and sounds that leave your mind confused rather than mind blown.  Every other word on the disc seems to end up being ..., which could be one reason some people call some of these songs catchy because you can easily learn the words by simply guessing when the 'f' word is going to come in.  I give credit to Fred for introducing us to Staind and Cold however.  <br />If you absolutely don't like this album buy every NIN album and Slipknot album available!!!  Truly creative music that will never disappoint!!!  Also D12 is a good one to consider because of track 19, which is kind of a hidden track!!!
B00004XOWM|1.0|The first time I heard the tracks on this CD I couldn't stop laughing. How is it possible for any band to be this bad?!? These guys are like Vanilla Ice part II, no talent just hype. I pitty the people who think this is worth their time. Kids, I know you're smarter than that. PLEASE, for your own sake, listen to better music. The only reason I give this even 1 star is well A, because Amazon won't let you give no stars, and B, the homosexual referance in the title is worth a laugh. &quot;The next morning Fred Durst's chocolate starfish hurt a little and there was hotdog flavored water all over his new silk sheets, but he had to admit that Carson Daly was the best he'd ever had.&quot; How cute.
0440178002|5.0|James Clavell has succeeded in offering an irresistable novel of feudal Japan.  Having researched Japan extensively for stage productions, and having a specific target on the Edo or Tokugawa era, I found this to be extremely culturally accurate.  Yes, I do know that the history was fuzzy, but he made a statement in the front of the bood that was kind of like this: &quot;Yo, I know the history's not totally accurate, so back off you perfectionist.&quot;  So I really give him credit for taking the liberty of doing that.  Overall, it is a masterfully interwoven tale.  <br />We will rule hagerstown!
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this CD, it cearly has great beats and a modern sound of combining rock with rap.  It's a bit angry but still pretty cool.
B000002GGU|3.0|This collection certainly empitomizes the AOR sound of the 80's. This may not be my favorite collection from that period. However, there are several hook laden singles that are quite catchy. The best of the lot is the spirited Summer of 69 which is loaded with pleasant harmonies and some solid rock n roll guitars. Run To You is another strong single with good guitar passages and the right amount of synthesizer.  One Night Love Affair has a super good hook around the chorus and is filled with emotion. Heaven is pretty ballad which changes the pace in a good way. The last two tracks are a little weak as Brian's vocals on these tracks are quite grating. Brian's overall style is somewhat limited as well. None the less, this is a good collection for those fans who grew up on 1980's rock/pop.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|You gotta hand it to the man, he is the best there ever was, and he proves it yet again with a collection capable of astonishing even the most diehard Dylanite.  One listen to Love &amp; Theft will make you realize that age is, thank God, just polish.  Hats off to Bob Dylan.
6302136105|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy watching most anything connected to the Doors.  However, this movie plays very loose with the truth on many aspects of the Doors' Music Career. The story jumps so quickly from Ray and Jim's meeting on Venice Beach to the band recording Light My Fire.  Nothing is mentioned on how Densmore and Kreiger joined the band. Val Kilmer was a good choice for the role of Jim Morrison.  However too much of the film dwelled on Jim's demons.  Oliver Stone portrays Morrison as an evil person whether he was drunk or not.  In addition, he gives the viewers the impression that there was a great deal of tension between Morrison and Manzarek. Just note the tension at the party between Ray and Jim during the infamous &quot;duck&quot; incident. This is simply not true.  Just read through Light My Fire and you will realize that Jim Morrison was a good person with alot of problems.<br />I enjoy hearing the Doors songs and they lead well into some of the scenes particularly when Val sings The Spy to Pamela.  The concert footage is fabulous as Val really pushes the right buttons.  The airport scene is pretty cool as well.  The lighting and scenery is certainly well done.<br />Most fans of the band will probably enjoy this film as long as they take it in a light hearted way.  However, those people who are looking for an accurate account of the Doors career may be somewhat dissappointed.  Visually though this is quite enjoyable.
B00003CX9E|4.0|There are a lot of people who call Citizen Kane the greatest film of all time. I don't know about that (there are a lot of films I enjoy watching more than this one), but I am blown away by the cinematography here.<br />In movie years, Citizen Kane is older than Moses. This makes its camera work and staging all the more remarkable. This is a brooding tour de force.<br />I invite all the people who have never seen it to sit back and drink in the imagery that Welles throws at the viewer. From the bright and clear images of Kane building his news empire to the distorted views of him being covered in a burial shroud...few have shown such mastery.<br />Cinematography is just the tip of the iceberg though. All of the visual appeal is used to convey a message about what is really important in life. Even if it does not become your favorite movie, this is a film that demands to be seen.<br />This new DVD edition is a wonderful reason to either see the movie again or to watch it for the first time. In particular, I enjoyed Ebert's commentary immensely. This is a great package.<br />I recommend this movie.
B00005J6UP|5.0|If you love the Goonies - and always watch when it's on broadcast television, this disc is for you.  The video commentary with the stars of the film as adults is worth the price of admission on it's own.  Better still you get a beautiful widescreen transfer of a great 80's film.  The Goonies is a great adventure movie that didn't find it's audience until video - so this edition allows for something more akin to the theatrical experience than most have had before.  The deleted scenes are rough, but fun.  Check out the extremely realistic octopus (wink).
B000002L99|5.0|If you do not like Sammy Hagar and think that David Lee Roth was better...then you won't like this CD.  However, if you do not care who is singing the lead vocals and are just looking for some really good music then you will love this CD!  I love Summer Nights, Best of Both Worlds, Why Can't This Be Love, and Dreams.  In my opinion, if you buy a CD and it has at least 4 good songs on it...then it is well worth having.  And this CD surpasses that requirement.
B00004Z400|3.0|Deftones makes some rap-metal music...and obviously, I don't like that kind of music, but this is different.  Chino Moreno's voice is beautiful and touching, unlike most rap-metal band's singers.  Listening to this album gives you a warm shiver, you feel like being alone in a huge bubble.  It makes me feel closer to myself.  Strange isn't it?  It's true though.  The best songs are &quot;Change In the House of Flies&quot;, &quot;Back to School&quot; and &quot;The Passenger&quot; which features Maynard James Keenan, the vocalist of Tool, and he has an awesome voice, and this song is great!  Deftones is a world itself, and I go there when I need to feel alone.  The only thing is that some songs are repetitive, but it's a good album overall.  Pretty emotional but heavy at the same time...weird but great mix!
B00003CX9E|2.0|I know this is supposed to be the greatest movie of all time but I just could not get intreasted in it even though I spent twenty five dollars on the dvd. THe movie is very slow although for a movie made 60 years ago it looks good on dvd. It is just very slow I watched it for a hour and ten minutes and finally took it out. The dvd set was not a complete waste of money though beecause I enjoyed the 2nd disc documentry a lot and found a new formed respect for orson welles. I was looking foward to the War Of The Worlds radio broadcast but can not found it on either of the discs, Does anybody know where its at or if its not on my disc for some reason.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken is an essential NIN album to get.  Songs such as &quot;Wish&quot;, &quot;Last&quot;, &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;, track 98 and 99 are simply brutal, industrial, intelligent music.  They made something in which you can feel all the anger, madness and raw power, and still be catchy and well-made and written.  The rythms are nice and flow perfectly with the lyrics and some loud distorted guitar riffs top it all!  Trent Reznor is a genius, forget all fakes, Reznor is there, and you'll feel him with Broken!
B00005A46T|3.0|I don't know, maybe I'm actually starting to show my age.  I'm not really hearing much new here that's worth the hype.  The songwriting is weak and suprisingly so is the production.  I can envision hordes of 13 year olds wearing slipknot shirts.  I'd be one to I'm sure if I was 13 again.
B00005KFUM|2.0|I bought this cd based on a review in a guitar magazine that raved about this singer/guitar player like he was the next guitar god. It turns out he's not even that knowledgable of the instrument and very amature in his playing and song writing. Nothing interesting going on at all. It sounds too much like Radiohead but not as good with some Tom Murello guitar licks thrown in. I see why they have'nt released this in America yet.
1572701099|5.0|By some wild chance, the appearance of the Audio Partners reading of &quot;Carry On, Jeeves&quot; is coincidental with the appearance of a musical about this very same very British gentleman's gentleman as well as the first two seasons of the British television series on DVDs. Having already reviewed the Audio Partners complete reading of &quot;The Code of the Woosters,&quot; I am happy to report that &quot;Carry on Jeeves&quot; (41109) is even a tad more successful.<br /> Any Jeeves fan must have noticed that the full novels are really a series of wild incidents put in to to stretch out a pretty flimsy plot premise. In the short stories, we have the typical pattern of Bertie Wooster ordered (by an aunt) to or tricked (by a friend) into helping out in some manner usually concocted by Jeeves with the ability of a master chess player who can see a dozen moves in advance. The original collection of stories under the title &quot;Carry On, Jeeves&quot; contains 10 independent episodes, of which eight have been chosen for this recording; and each fits the expected pattern.<br /> We start with Jeeves' first appearance &quot;Jeeves Takes Over.&quot; The other stories seem all to take place in New York City; and in two of them, Bertie is required to relinquish his flat so that some elderly relative of a friend will think it is the flat of the nephew. Telling the truth never seems to be the first course of action in any Jeeves story.<br /> The titles alone tell the story: &quot;The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy,&quot; &quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo,&quot; &quot;The Artistic Career of Corky&quot; are the ones that name the blighters who are thrust upon Bertie's good intentions and wallet. &quot;Without the Option,&quot; &quot;The Aunt and the Sluggard,&quot; &quot;Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest,&quot; &quot;Jeeves and the Hard-Boiled Egg&quot; are almost indistinguishable from the rest in plot and character, except that in the last one, the young man is actually admirable in his refusal to accept help from the Wooster largesse.<br /> Actor Marlin Jarvis does as good a job as did Jonathan Cecil in the earlier Jeeves recording, neatly adjusting his voice for each character; and indeed I would have thought I was hearing Ian Carmichael had I not known better.<br /> Another nice feature about these 4 tapes is that no story goes onto another cassette; and in only two of them do you have to turn the cassette over to hear the ending before the next story starts. Very considerately thought out by the producers.is refusal to accept help from the Wooster largesse.<br /> Actor Marlin Jarvis does as good a job as did Jonathan Cecil in the earlier Jeeves recording, neatly adjusting his voice for each character; and indeed I would have thought I was hearing Ian Carmichael had I not known better.<br /> Another nice feature about these 4 tapes is that no story goes onto another cassette; and in only two of them do you have to turn the cassette over to hear the ending before the next story starts.

B000051VWW|5.0|I've been listening to Sade ever since i can remember.  I used to hate it, but my parents played it every saturday.  Years later, i picked up Sade's love deluxe album - the album i had grown to hate.  But this time, i fell in love with it, along with all her other albums.  So when i heard of her new release, i had to buy it.  Although i like her older stuff more, this album should not go unnoticed.  Her lyrics still have that subtle depth to it, and her voice is just as smooth.  Hopeless romantics like myself will love the title song &quot;Lover's Rock&quot;, &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot;,&quot;All About Our Love&quot;, and &quot;Flow&quot;.  Other great tracks are &quot;Every Word&quot; and &quot;Immigrant&quot;.  All in all, its a great album, and i recommend it to everyone.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Admit it, put another actor in that role &amp; the film would have gone pfffttt in the market.  <br />Just by looking at the trailer, you would know that it would be a long, dragging, mostly-one-charactered story.  But what really caught my attention till the end was the great portrayal by Tom Hanks.  He led us to see his day-to-day survival in a forsaken island.  He made us realize that there are so many things in this world that we take for granted &amp; we ONLY realize their importance when we lose them.  <br />Yes, it was an adventure in a way but not something you would consider impossible or absurd.  On the contrary, most if not all of the events, were very real &amp; believable.  Chuck's survival was a great adventure.  It's very real that the only thing that kept Chuck going was hope to be reunited with his love one.  On the other hand, it is also very real (painful as it may be) that the 'surviving mate' would go on  with her life, no matter how much she loves her partner.  <br />The absence of the typical &quot;Hollywood happy-ending&quot; kind of stuff really makes this film truly unique &amp; commendable.  It takes patience, understanding &amp; realism to bear watching this film.  Now, if you are the type who prefers thin plot, light story, everybody happy kind of stuff, Cast Away is definitely not for you.
6305265666|5.0|Those responsible for the casting and historical setting of this version of &quot;Cinderella&quot; must own the same book on The Renaissance that I own from the National Geographic Society. I say this because on one particular page on the Court of the real King Francis I, there is featured a painting called &quot;Three Female Musicians&quot;, in which three dark-haired, dark-eyed ladies play instruments. The casting of Melanie Lynskey as Jacqueline de Ghent, the Good Stepsister, could well have been inspired by this painting. The same page also features an engraving of a tennis match such as the one featured in this film, which French nobles would have played in the 16th Century.<BR> As the heroine of the tale, a still-baby-faced Drew Barrymore delivers a fine, charismatic performance as the scullery maid who will not be broken by the authority of her cruel stepmother(Observe,the French don't have a word for &quot;stepmother&quot;, so there is a certain irony to the fact that this story takes place in France).<BR> Anjelica Huston matches acting genes with Drew Barrymore as the conniving, overindulged stepmother of noble blood who uses her servants as pawns and refuses to cut her losses in order to adapt to economic adversity. It should be obvious to a viewer that she could have made the three young girls in her care work together to maintain the manor rather than pit them against each other.<BR> As the Older Evil Stepsister, Marguerite, Megan Dodds was an interesting choice for the part because her pinched-faced cruelty is obvious to the audience, but not so readily obvious to the handsome Prince Henry, played by a befuddled but good-intentioned Dougray Scott, nor to the King and Queen, played by the appropriately strong and regal Timothy West and Judy Parfitt. Dodds'perfomance reminds me of the old adage, &quot;An indulgent mother makes a sluttish daughter.&quot;<BR> Melanie Lynskey's performance as the good Stepsister along with the performances of the actors whoplay the three servants, is one of the redeeming qualities of the otherwise miserable household. The presence of da Vinci in the story adds a divine benevolence to this tale, and as a child, I did read a version of &quot;Cinderella&quot; in which a male figure had the role of the Fairy Godmother.<BR> I have wondered why the accents of the principals were English rather than French. But ultimately, we watch an assertive young woman with a keen intellectual ability form a necessary and loving alliance with a Prince which appropriately takes place over time, proving her mettle against both his tormenters and her own, going out of her way to rescue those she loves, inspiring a childhood friend to do the same on her behalf, encouraging the understanding of societal outcasts, improving the quality of life for her small circle of friends, and justly putting her tormentors in their rightful places.<BR> This is a beautiful movie--a da Vinci painting come to life. However flawed it may be, it should inspire any viewer to great things!
6303334598|5.0|I also was channel surfing last night and wound up watching it. A long time ago I had caught the last five minutes of it and even though I felt it was extremely predictable, I thought it was a good 'feel good' movie. This time I caught it only ten minutes into the plot, just when he and the wife are about to hear the winning numbers...<BR>If you don't like predictable, 'feel good', light-hearted romance, this movie might not be for you... but I do!! <BR>I just loved it!! I am a fan of romantic comedies with good acting and good plots that renew  your faith in life and in the fact that there STILL are good honest people out there that will 'do the right thing' in spite of putting a lot on the line. I love Nicolas Cage as an actor. He can do a really dramatic role and he can turn around and do a great romantic character with feeling next time.<BR>If you liked 'While you were sleeping' you will love this one as well. Slightly more comedy content than another great one, 'A walk in the clouds'.
B00005N9CV|1.0|The first two albums by Diana Krall were off the charts.  However, her latest album is a great disappointment.  The arrangements are all strings, and little of Diana's wonderful piano skills.  Also, she apparently has determined that 'talking or whispering the lyrics' is better than singing them.  Not only does she not only not use her vocal skills, she has apparently decided not to play the piano as well.  Someone should also tell Mr. DiPuma, her manager, who apparently selects her songs, to dump the strings, go back to the wonderful jazz sounds of her trio, and let her use the voice that made her an icon. I hope Ms. Krall doesn't follow the footsteps of Nat King Cole (her idol) who gave way to the money tree and abandoned his jazz roots to became a 'TV singer' .  Finally, Diana's voice is sexy enough, she doesn't need to overdue it as she does in this album.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|When I was a little girl, I used to enjoy watching parts of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs on the Mickey Mouse Club.  It is an excellent movie classic and it always brings me back to my childhood days.  Fantasy is one of my favorite hobbies.  To escape to another world without being disturb with the reality of this one.  It is one of my favorite things to do, escape.  I was never able to see the entire movie.  The graphics and the color has captured my fantasy world and beyond...  It is just a fantastic movie.  I also am interested in other Walt Disney movies that I have not seen as of yet.  I bought it for my granddaughter who is my only girl out of 11 boys. (6 generations of boys only)  It is one of my most treasureable collectables that I will keep forever.  I'm glad that they put it into DVD. I cannot be without it.
0440236304|5.0|If you havn't read this book you are in for a treat!<br />With the recent release of Ambrose' 'Band of Brothers' on HBO there has been an overdue increase of interest in the Screaming Eagles of WWII.  This book is what first interested me.  This is the first in a series of four books written by a regular trooper of the 101st...And what a series it is.  This set is considered by most to be one of the best memoirs ever written about war.  Here is exposed the fear and tradgedy of a real battlefield.  Burgett has you on the edge of your seat for the entire ride from the unbearable training in the hot Southern sun to the terrors of D-Day and the battle around Carentan.  This is no holds barred, exposed in all its raw detailed writing at its best!<br />Please be sure to couple this book with the next three, including the number one WWII book (in my opinion), Seven roads to Hell.  Together this set allows an unforgettable glimpse into the life of a WWII paratrooper!<br />If you want the complete experience, read 'Rendezvous with Destiny' (see my review) for the complete unit history of the 101st, and do so before this memoir.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What makes OK Computer the greatest album of the 90's decade: Listening to it on long drives; A popular Anti-suberbia message (ironic, huh?); The playing of rythm which should have reminded the entire musical colture that rythms don't have to be in Common time; The slow part of Paranoid Android; The absolutly superb musicianship of the band in textures, instrumentation, jazz-comparable emotion with classical-comparable diligence; The minor falls and major lifts; Every listen is a new experience based on where you are in your life, or on how many times you've listened to it; The build-up of Exit Music; The fast part of Paranoid Android; the glockenshpiel/guitar riff on No Surprises; The effort and effortlessness of it all; it's one of the few albums released that to fully experiance it you have to listen to all of it from beginning to end; The melodies; &quot;Uptight, Uptight&quot; and everything that soon follows it; final half of &quot;Let Down&quot;; the macintosh voice; the way every five minutes brings you into a completely different room of the same house; The (optimisitc) ending; listening to it when you're with a group of friends;listening to it when you are completely alone and you feel like there is no way out;<br />and, finally, one of the greatest things to me about the album:<BR>Listening to it with your father, who believed that there was no great rock albums released since Bruce Springsteen, Floyd, and the Beatles, and sharing that moment when he smiles because he realizes he was wrong, and can't help turning up OK Computer.
B0000508U6|5.0|In an age of fake pop and insincere rhyme-rock, this is an absolute masterpiece.  In fact, I dare to say that this would be a masterpiece in any era.<br />If you want to hear and feel current songwriting at it's very best, this is the CD for you.  From top to bottom, &quot;Parachutes&quot; is an incredible piece of work.<br />Chris Martin pours everything he's got into every song, from heartbreak to happiness, self-doubt to self-understanding.  He is surrounded by three other &quot;professional musicians&quot; who know how to play, and play well.<br />It is mellow, and perhaps at times a little depressing, but it is as beautiful as fine art in a museum.  A true masterwork that will surely become a classic.
6305165912|5.0|The inventive minds of the Coen brothers have brought us some unbelievebly brilliant films in the past. Everything from the suspenseful film noir &quot;Blood Simple&quot; to the hilarious &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; But by far my favorite Film of thier's is the hippie, fever dream of a movie, known as &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is the Coen Brother's homage/spoof of the old Raymond Chandler detective novels.But instead of a tough gritty private eye we get an old burnt out hippie (known as The Dude) who has a passion for interleague bowling.The poor guy gets drawn into a convoluted mystery when his rug is soiled (&quot;the rug tied up the entire room, man&quot;) and he is mistaken for a millionaire named Lebowski.From that moment on the Dude goes through a crazy quilt of a city known as Los Angeles encountering every weirdo that the full moon can bring out (feminist artists, pornographers, a gang of nihilist Germans etc.)Actor Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the Dude. Nobody seems to want to leave this poor guy alone! He is thrown into a mystery when all he wants to do is bowl and get stoned! Special mention should be made of actor John Goodman, who plays the Dude's totally obnoxious, Vietnam obsessed, buddy.Goodman practically steals the film as he rants and raves and keeps getting the Dude into deeper and deeper trouble.Everything in this film is well done including a smart script, inventive set design, phantasmagoric, dream-like, special effects and a wonderful soundtract that includes Bob Dylan, Ry Cooder, CCR and the Gypsy Kings.This movie is dead on funny and will leave you laughing even after multiple viewings.Buy this movie!

B00005NB0H|5.0|The Who were one of the greatest rock 'n roll bands ever. Their legendary fame was made out of playing live all across the states and europe. In their prime years 1967-1973 their were unbeatable on stage (and that count for Zeppelin too, who in 1969 opened a show for The Who in Maryland and were blown off the stage), and the february 14th 970 show at Leeds university was their best performnce ever, and now we have it complete on this terrific double cd.
B00005MP58|2.0|I'm writing about the Special Edition DVD only.  I absolutely love this patricular adaptation of P&amp;P and have watched it so many times that I've pratically memorised the dialogue.  I was excited when I saw that a remastered wisescreen edition was available and ordered it at once.  What a disappointment.  The colour is so bad, especially on the first disc, it renders it almost unwatchable.  I tried to adjust my tv to make it better, but not much helped.  I makes me mad because the clips from the series that are shown in the little featurette have great colour tones!<BR>This would be a good edition otherwise.  I love the widescreen, and am glad they removed the credits between episodes, but please A&amp;E and BBC, do something about the condition of the transfer!! If another edition comes out promising a better transfer i will certainly buy it, but this time I will definitely read reviews first.  So the 2 stars are for this edition, not the actual series which still remains a 10/10 in my book.

0920668364|5.0|A few years ago someone emailed me a story that was almost identical to this book, though some things were added and the wording was a little different. It made me cry every time I read it. Then I found out it was a children's book and bought it right away. Though I am not a mother yet, I had been babysitting my then 3 year old cousin since he was 6 months old. I read him the book and he loved it. You can't help rocking back and forth without even realizing it while you read. And while we were struggling with potty training, he would always ask me to read this story while he sat on the potty. He loves the pictures too and likes to point out all the silly things in them. He realizes that mothers don't rock their teenagers or adult children and go sneaking in windows. It's supposed to be silly and just make the point that the child will always be loved unconditionally and that they can depend on their parents to be there for them. Young children love routine and repetition and I think this story suits them well. And I think this story is saying that a child is never too big for a mothers love and comforting. I highly recommend it and think it is a safe choice to give as a gift, despite what a few might say about it.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I agree with a lot of people who think this is the weakest of the STAR WARS films, but I'm not one those reviewers who gives this movie only one star because of Jar Jar Binks.  EPISODE I still has a lot going for it.  It has all the great special effects and action sequences that the first three movies contained, the pod race being one of the best examples.  It also has a few really good characters like the quietly menacing Senator Palpatine and the criminally underused Darth Maul.  I especially found Ewan McGregor impressive as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />But on the other hand, it does have its weaknesses.  I am in complete agreement with those were annoyed with Jar Jar, but I also found Natalie Portman's performance as Queen Amidala as pleasant as someone trying to write on a chalkboard using a rusty nail.  Furthermore, EPISODE I has the same rushed feel to it that 95% of all summer blockbusters have.<br />Overall rating: 3.5 stars.
0694003611|5.0|I've read this book many, many times while babysitting my young cousins. And now with twin nephews I'm sure I'll read it even more. It's a delightful book that I enjoy reading as much as the children enjoy hearing it. And the text is short enough that even an active child can sit through it. A definite must for any new mom! Makes a wonderful shower gift too.

B000002B7Y|3.0|After the glam-metal orientated THE ULTIMATE SIN, something must be done. So out to Jake Lee - in to Zakk Wylde. Castillos drumming is still annoying in this album, but he improved in NO MORE TEARS. The guy has no &quot;soul&quot; playing the drums, is something weird, when compared to Lee Kerslake and Tommy Aldridge, I dont know how to explain it properly... Anyway you looke at it is just an average Ozzy album, but with more guts than BARK AT THE MOON and THE ULTIMATE SIN. Please, dont try to compare it with BLIZZARD OF OZZ...Its impossible. BLIZZARD is, and always will be, Ozzy and Randy supreme masterpiece.
B00004YKUY|1.0|What an absolute waste of time and money. - NO. The new lead singer sounds more like Lindsay Buckingham from Fleetwood Mac than Steve Perry.Its just not worth the time nore the money. Barely a good track
B000002B82|4.0|Ozzy is a fortunate guy, in a way that he manages to mix his unbeliavable talent to write rock songs with great guitar players like Randy Rhoads, Jake Lee and, in this album, Zakk Wylde. The result is higly satisfying albuns, even when they are slyly &quot;pop metal&quot; oriented... NO MORE TEARS is better than NO REST FOR THE WICKED, no doubt about this. Randy Castillos drumming is less artificial here, Zakk Wylde is clearly more &quot;connected&quot; with Ozzy, the keboards are used parcimoniously, not overwhelming the album. Great, great, great.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is unreal. From the opening song \\"Airbag\\" , to \\"paranoid android\\" to \\"Karma Police\\", it takes you to another world, then back, then to a different one. There is no way to describe this record or catagorize it. THe only way is to sit back, pop it in and push play. Listen from begining to end and dont skip anything. Its unlike anything you have heard, or ever will hear. It is my 2nd favorite album of ALL time. Not an easy accomplishment might i add. I have three words for any doubters out there. Buy This Album. [It's worth the money I paid for it, and more].
B00003CX9E|5.0|I was worried before I bought this...after the hatchet-job done with Welles' &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (did anybody else notice the so-called 'letterbox'? T.O.E. was NOT originally a widescreen release, so the black bars on the top and bottom just COVER UP part of the original picture!!!), but fortunately they did a truly great job with this DVD release of &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;  A really beautiful picture...the best I've ever seen it, to be sure.<br />As for bonus material, you're not going to find many packages better than this one.  The 2-hour documentary about Welles and Hearst will shed all kinds of light on the story behind the movie, the movie itself, and the careers of both men.  Amazing, amoral, spoiled geniuses.  Incredibly interesting.  It's hard to believe that a man like Hearst really existed, but he did.  And then there are TWO full length feature commentaries, productions stills, a short newsreel about the original release of the movie, and more.
B00005NWRS|4.0|After the whispered elegance of &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and the extremely listenable &quot;Pneumonia,&quot; the world was primed for a heavily hyped masterpiece of a double album from Ryan Adams called &quot;Gold.&quot;  Now that it's here, it turns out to be a truncated version of everyone's best expectations, both in running time and quality.  But even if it fails to live up to the hype, it is still one of the best releases of the year, a wide-ranging collection influenced by just about every genre of music--punk, country, straight-ahead rock, and even gospel.<br />The album starts off nicely with the uplifting &quot;New York, New York&quot;, but it falls off for a couple of songs afterwards.  &quot;Answering Bell&quot; and &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot; sound beautiful, but are ultimately forgettable and uninspired.  &quot;The Rescue Blues&quot; gets things back on track and is followed by one of the album's best songs, &quot;Somehow, Someday&quot;, which has a soaring chorus.  There is nothing remotely awful on the album. In fact, there are plenty of choice tracks.  Apart from &quot;Somehow, Someday&quot;, other highlights include &quot;When the Stars Go Blue,&quot; &quot;Nobody Girl,&quot; &quot;Wild Flowers,&quot; &quot;Harder Now That It's Over,&quot; and &quot;Touch, Feel &amp; Lose.&quot;  However, at sixteen tracks, some of the other songs start to sound alike and indistinguishable from each other.  I recall liking &quot;Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; but I can't remember what I liked about it.  <br />Ryan Adams is a great songwriter, but he may want to pick and choose from his babies.  The hardest thing about writing is having to get rid of your favorite lines.  It's tough, but it ultimately produces a better piece.  Although it appears that Mr. Adams trimmed several tunes from this album to fit in one disc, he still could've cut out more.  At 70 minutes, it's way too long and similar sounding.  Where are the rockers?  Maybe next time.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I found great joy in cheering for these three lost souls. The theater needs more movies like this one. The refreshing and surprising comic genius of George Clooney and the other Coehn brothers reminded me of the &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Lucy &amp; Ethel&quot; meet the &quot;The Marx Brothers&quot;. I highly recommend you suspend your disbelief and enjoy this at times, &quot;Gumpish&quot; storyline. It is worth the time you invest in the viewing. The movie is fun for the whole family over the age of 7. See it.
6300208591|5.0|This movie really describes what is the sweet life.<br />Fellini big fan??????????? BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
0790743507|5.0|How can anyone not like &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;? Not only is it one of the greatest movies ever made, it's also one of the most entertaining and likeable movies ever made.<br />&quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is set in the roaring 20's, during the transition time when movies started to talk. The whole movie is just flawless from beginning to end. There just isn't a bad song, there isn't a pointless scene and there isn't a character that shouldn't be there. <br />The movie stars Gene Kelly as the screen star Don Lockwood, Debbie Reynolds as the dancer wanting to make it big, Donald O'Conner as Don's best friend and Jean Hagen as the dopey Lina Lamont.<br />Exciting, delightful and entertaining from beginning to end, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is one the greatest movies ever made that will never lose it's popularity or it's status. <br />This is what a great movie is all about.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Truly an amazing experience. It shook me, surprisingly given my jaded persona. After it finished,  I don't know whether to laugh or cry. It made me feel utterly hopeless. Like it wouldn't matter if I or anyone else died today, because the world would just continue to be a big, ugly mess. I hope we see more from this team. Aronfsky's films are the wave of the future.<br />(P.S. The soundtrack is a MUST!)
0195117298|1.0|I still don't get the picture.<BR>I've re-read this book at least 6 times.<BR>But then again I've read &quot;Uji&quot; many more times.<BR>(In the 13th century the Japanese Zen Master Dogen wrote &quot;Uji,&quot;<BR>which roughly translates as, &quot;Existence-Time.&quot;)<BR>Barbour and Dogen agree--<BR>time is not what we ordinarily think it is.<BR>Barbour writes that, &quot;The instant is not in time, time is the instant.&quot; (page 53.)<BR>Dogen wrote (not in &quot;Uji&quot;) that, &quot;Plum blossoms open early spring, not plum blossoms open in early spring.&quot;<br />There are many more parallels in their ideas about &quot;time.&quot;<BR>Although, without modern physics, Dogen could have hardly concluded that time arises from only two static elements:<BR>1) a relative configuration space, and <BR>2) Schrodinger's stationary equation for the wave function.<BR>Nevertheless, both Dogen's and Barbour's concepts of time are equally holistic.<BR>They both see life existing in the universal, cosmic instant.<BR>Barbour seems to see life being created at a single point (albeit connected to every structure in a vast, complex universe) where the wave function is the most intense.<BR>His picture is without time, motion, change, or space.<BR>Dogen seemed to see life existing in absolute nothingness--<BR>also without flowing time, space, or external frames of reference.<BR>Neither Dogen nor Barbour confront the possibility of an external factor.<BR>Mathematically, an external factor must always exist (Goedel's proven theorum.)

0783240503|5.0|This movie was so amazing that it blew me away.  I absolutely loved it.  The music and cast is fantastic.  When I want to watch a beautiful musical with great songs and storylines I pop this in to the VCR.  Buy It!  You will love it!
B00005OAJ1|5.0|This may be one of the funniest things I've ever heard. It rocks is a cheesy, silly way...but the humor is just so silly and warped. Must be heard to be believed. I loved it.
6304044836|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.<BR>Please put this on DVD.  A must for my collection.
6305594252|4.0|&quot;Stargate&quot; is a nice twist on the begining of a civilization (ours!) based on aliens, the mysteries of Egypt, and all those Gods they worshipped. James Spader is, as always, poised and controlled. In &quot;Stargate&quot; he is a scientist who has controversial views of the origins of the Pyramids in Egypt. He's recruited by the military to crack the code on a stargate to another civilization on the other side of the universe. With Kurt Russell, (who was not at his best in this movie) and a bunch of other military personnel they find themselves sucked into another world, one ruled by the evil Ra.  Here the story begins to unfold of the &quot;true&quot; origins of all those gods, temples, pyramids and beliefs of the ancient Egyptians.  The storyline moves nicely and the movie itself reminded me, in some ways, of Lawrence of Arabia, the Indiana Jones adventures, and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. The visual affects are minimal, but they do get the point across. The set work is finely structured and elegant. All is all, Stargate is a good sci-fi movie from the early 1990's.
0804106304|4.0|She's just a good author for all types of readers.
B000025APX|5.0|Perfect all the way through. No filler. Put it on and get a full CD's worth of awesome. If you like metal as hard as it comes, and don't mind harmony, buy this today. Unless, as stated in other reviews, you are old and or dumb.
B000005IRG|5.0|This album is the bridge of almost all music...when you have elements of blues, freejazz (coletrain and miles davis), and punk..you've got television...this, in my opinion, is the greatest album ever..and i don't make an ignorant opinion when i say that..on vinyl, i own all but one beatles record, every \\"who\\" record, several ramones, sex pistols, rancid, anti-flag, dead kennedys, and clash records. i've got all the miles davis and john coletrain. hell, i've even got emerson, lake and palmer...this album is simply the best...when you mix the talent of tom verlaine and richard lloyd (playing with matthew sweet since television), you've got intertwining solos that have more power than hendrix (yes, i said it)....well....i can't say enough about the talent of television....oh yeh...i'm seeing them on oct. 19th at \\"all tomorrow's parties\\"...i've been waiting for the past 2 years since i first heard them...i never thought they'd play again....well...everyone should buy the album and listen to the bliss. By the way, my band is heavily influenced by them... ... .
B000002LKF|5.0|This is a wonderful album.  It makes one feel trully alive.  The drum beats, especially those of Grupo Cultural OLODUM on tracks such as obvious child, reach your spirit and heart.  Beautiful.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Is &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; the greatest film ever made?  I can't answer that for you.  It's not my favorite film of all time, it's not even one I watch all that often.  But it is one that continues to mesmerize every time I run it, and I do think it lives up to its reputation.  Short of seeing a restored print on the big screen, this DVD version has to be the best way ever to see this film, in absolutely beautiful black and white.  If you have any doubts whatsoever about whether or not you'll like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, at the very least give it a rental, preferably this DVD version.  I'd be willing to put money down that you'll be back for your own copy shortly thereafter.<br />Also included is the wonderful documentary &quot;The Battle Over Citizen Kane&quot;, which is a good, informative study of the lives of both Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst, and how their lives eventually collided over this film.  It was a bit strange that the producers of the DVD chose to leave the opening and closing segments from the film's original PBS broadcast, including a short commercial for Scott's Turf Builder, on the DVD release, but that's why the Japanese invented the skip button.<br />More than a worthy purchase.
B000002KIK|4.0|I still can't understand why fans and critics dislike this one(although recently, I'm starting to read more positive reviews). Most seem to feel that Sabbath experimented too much on &quot;Never Say Die&quot;,but look at how much the music suffered once they gave in to the masses and played the typical metal formula(&quot;Exorcist&quot; inspired lyrics with monotonous beat). The greatness of Sabbath was their unique sound-punk style vocalizing; jazzy guitar and drum work;heavy rhythm and,unlike Dio's delivery,songs that evoked real pain.There are songs that have just as much adrenaline as &quot;Paranoid&quot; or &quot;Supernaut&quot;.Some have the blues/jazz influence of &quot;Wicked World&quot; and &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;.Others have the sweet sadness of ballads like &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Solitude&quot;.Lots of variety for a one-dimensional genre. The only flaw in the album that I can see is that it doesn't flow from song to song as well as some of Sab's other masterpieces.Regardless,it still blows me away today!
B0000009RT|5.0|According to the book BEATLESONGS, when the Beatles were recording SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARS CLUB BAND, Paul McCartney kept telling the other Beatles, &quot;This is our FREAK OUT.&quot; What is higher praise than that?
B000000OAA|5.0|This one covers all the bases that make Queen an amazing band.  Highlights include rare tracks like &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot; and &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot;.<br />Perfect album.
B0000019HU|4.0|i'd heard this a few times from friends and the like before purchasing it. at first listen, this seemed to me to be a record that grows on you. i'm not really a fan of the tons of trendy bands that lasted a few weeks that this record probably inspired indirectly. that might give me some bias. but alas, the guitar work is fantastic as well as the vocals and overall musicianship. i am not blown away and probably won't ever be but its still a creepy little record.
B000053ZS6|5.0|Tom Jones' best music in a while.  I can't understand why it hasn't been released in the United States.
0671024256|4.0|Stephen King probably should have called this book &quot;On Life and on Writing.&quot; That's because this book is part autobiography (a rather sketchy autobiography) and part writing course. The book never fails to be interesting, thus the four stars, but I think the reading/writing public could have been better served by two separate books, with a fuller treatment of both King's life and his tips on writing. What he has to say about writing is very helpful, and one cannot argue with his success. While it is probably not the final word on the craft of writing, it is a very good start.
6305508550|5.0|When my friend and I rented this, it changed our world of inside jokes and punchlines forever. This movie is halarious.<br />It's not really the funniest movie in the world when your actually watching it, I only laughed out loud at a half dozen or so scenes, but all of the little puns are the kind that you think are funny for ages afterwords, and unlike most comedy films, Office Space actually had re-view value. I won't gauruntee it, but I'll bet you'll find your self saying &quot;I'm going to set the building on fire&quot; and laughing ALOT after you see this.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I really liked the movie, but was dissappointed that Eddie Murphy played the comic relief talking donkey. I did'nt find any of the jive donkey's humor funny.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Eddie Murphy in Golden Child and Bev. Hills Cop.  BUT, him in Shrek, he was annoying to me, brought me back out of the movie thinking of Eddie Murphy, and not amused me.<br />I can't wait for Monsters, Inc!
B00005K3OT|5.0|I have returned mostly to classic books and films because I have tired of rehashed modern themes.  However, Chocolat is one film I have seen lately that has not left me depressed or thinking the movie industry has lost the ability to create anything but a way to make money.  Chocolat's lessons are positive, despite some negative characters and occurrences.  It is simply a great story, told well.  Warning:  If you are buying the DVD to watch at home for the first time, have some chocolate in the house.  If you are a chocolate lover, the sumptuous confection scenes will affect you!
B00000I5Y6|3.0|The harmonious and beautifully arranged 'The Wall' is one of the highlights, a composition you can't help falling for, quite immediately. And there's the classic 'Song For America' which barely needs further presentation - a must-hear.<br />Another highlight, of course, is the beautiful ballad 'Dust In The Wind' which, however, could have been from any band. Still, its presence on 'Best Of' is highly justified, since it is one of the best of its genre from Kansas.<br />A song like the opening 'Carry On Wayward Son' is more straight forward, on the edge between prog rock and rock'n'roll - and yet, its arrangement, the guitars, the drums, the piano, are very typical for the Kansas sound.<br />'Play The Game Tonight' is a typical 1980s song on which the band sounds very much like Foreigner or Asia. That one is not bad. But on 'Perfect Lover', and especially on 'Fight Fire With Fire', this 1980s sound becomes far too pop'ish, and it seems disappointing that these songs have been chosen for a so-called 'Best Of' album.<br />So all in all, 'The Best Of Kansas' is a compilation album with ups and with downs. Seen from a chronological and musically developmental point of view, the album does provide a good way of getting to know Kansas. But seen from a pure quality point of view, the ten songs are not the ten best ones, and my guess is that any admirer of Kansas will confirm this.<br />Taste differs, but what Kansas is all about, what Kansas is known and respected for, is their style from the 1970s rather than the 1980s development.
B0000508U6|5.0|I just bought this Cd today........Coldplay came to me over the radio and before the song &quot;Trouble&quot; was over, it was sold in my mind.  What I hoped was that the rest of the Cd was like &quot;Trouble&quot;.......and what was a perfect revelation to me, &quot;Yellow&quot; was another song from the radio that I never knew who sang, but here it is and I am loving this CD.<br />I Rarely if ever get new music.........in a big way I am the least impressed man with the new music scene, cheap imitation acousitcal bands seem to rule the airwaves, but Coldplay offers a very genuine understanding of how to treat the listener with touching lyrics and melodic guitars.......they sounds like nothing I have ever heard.<br />I dont know where they come from, I dont know their names, and I have a feeling that we will be hearing so much about these guys, <BR>it will make us sick........I pray media music doesn't kill this band with too much too soon.......I want so much to love this music for its true worthe, and I can see I am not the only one  according to so many great reviews I have read who loves what they do.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|I love this CD. With the constant theme of &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; being reiterated through the soundtrack, one thinks of a neverending cycle of destruction. A very dark and brooding soundtrack, it contains three segments: Summer, Fall, and Winter. In Summer, the listener is given an impression of hope; the music is light, almost carefree here. In Fall, the listener feels like they are 'falling' through Hell until Winter, where all out dark and somber music lurks within. A very superb soundtrack. Tip: if one has not seen the movie, this soundtrack will leave something to be desired.
078322608X|1.0|This movie bites.There were not 12 kung fu masters like the title implied. After watching Iron Monkey, Mad Monkey Kung Fu, and Iron Monkey 2, I had high expectations for 12Monkeys. Total disappointment. Don't even bother watching it.
0375703861|4.0|Very funny sketches of (near) contemporary British life. Deep characters, appealing plot.<br />But WHY has it been 'translated' (or whatever the term is) for American readers? The British don't talk in terms of 'traffic circles' (roundabouts) or '182 pounds' (13 stone), and yet some classic Brit-speak ('fruit machine', which means 'slot machine' and not 'juice press') has been left untouched.<br />Highly recommended, but in the interests of cultural integrity buy the original Brit-version.
B00005N919|5.0|This is a great movie. Sharon Stone shows... nuff said.
B00005KHL0|5.0|This movie although not as scary as the company would make you think is very good.  It tells the first part of the story in which Michael Myers attempts to kill his sister (who at this point dosen't realize she's related), Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).  It was continued by an equally good film called Halloween II in which it continues the same Halloween night of 1978 in Haddonfield.
630018403X|2.0|I found John Hughes 1985 movie The Breakfast Club to be an extremely generalized, heavy handed, piece of trite filmmaking that may or may not have been relevant to teenagers fifteen years ago, but is certainly nowhere near on target now.<BR> Obviously it was by design that his five main characters were one-dimensional character sketches of so-called traditional high school stereotypes.  You have Andy the jock (Emilio Estevez), Claire the princess (Molly Ringwald, a John Hughes staple), Bender the criminal (Judd Nelson), Brian the nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), and Allison the basket case (Ally Sheedy).  In my opinion, for Hughes to insinuate that these five people come from completely different backgrounds and had absolutely no contact with each other or anyone else from their particular type during school is just plain silly.  For example, it is quite likely that Claire and Andy, being popular people, would know each other, or at least that princesses and jocks would interact on a regular basis.  Same thing goes for Bender and Allison as social outcasts.  Only Brian, being the brain, would logically be shunned by all other classes.  <BR>For another thing, these categories have little relevance today because in todays modern society, and indeed this has always been true, teens simply cannot be categorized and labeled, even by their peers, in this manner.  I myself saw elements of my personality in every one of the characters, and neither I nor anyone I know would fit neatly into these stereotypes.<BR> The last thing Im going to gripe about in this review is, logically enough, the ending.  For a film that tried so hard to be edgy, the denouement was awfully hackneyed and predictable.  Four out of the five characters hook up at the end?  Gosh, I never saw that coming!  Also, the treatment of Allison was laughable.  This girl has serious psychological issues that have been with her all her life, but all she needs is a little makeup, a nice dress, anda clean-cut boyfriend to set her to rights?  I dont think so, pal.  Willful suspension of disbelief is all fine and good, but to trivialize Allisons pain and emotional trauma in this manner is irresponsible and does a disservice to those young people who do identify with her character.  I think thats enough bashing for this film; while it had its moments, it certainly is by no means the classic that it is reputed to be.
6305171769|5.0|This film was very good.  It returns to the original character of the first two films.  Laurie Strode.  The Return of Jamie Lee Curtis.
B000002OK3|4.0|Same goes for Reservoir Dogs as with Pulp Fiction--if you liked the movie, chances are, you'll enjoy the soundtrack.  There are a few dialogue choices I would have added from the movie (such as why Mr. Pink doesn't tip, and why he has to be Mr. Pink anyway) that would have made it even better, but the Madonna speech and &quot;Let's Get a Taco&quot; added some sick humor to the mix.  I, for one, will never be able to listen to &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; without thinking of Mr. Brown's interpretation of its meaning... <br />It's an eclectic mix on this soundtrack, but that seems to be the norm for a Tarantino film.  From honky-tonk country (&quot;Fool for Love&quot;), to funk (&quot;I Gotcha&quot;), to just some fun-loving '70s (&quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot;), the songs on here wouldn't normally be ones you'd find together on an album, but seem to work well here, as they did in the movie.  Most songs on the album were in pivotal parts of the movie as well.  <br />It might not be a soundtrack I'd buy if I hadn't seen the movie, but this one compliments its film very well.  Steven Wright's monotone DJ excerpts make a good lead in to some of the songs, but more film dialogue would have been preferable.  A recommended buy for those who enjoyed the film.
B00005LC6Z|5.0|this film is very good.  It continues the dreaded Halloween night of 1978 and Michael Myers's continueing mission to kill his sister Laurie Strode.
0451203933|5.0|Somalia was a thankless assignment. And, given the Clinton predispositon towards the military, and institution he &quot;loathed&quot;, Americans might not expect much from a small albeit dedicated group of fighters in this African cell of poverty and turmoil.<br />Bowden does a fantastic job of showing the personal side of heroism, of depicting modern warriors who go unrespected or unnoticed in their own countries. Taking a small, &quot;botched&quot; military operation, underresourced and quickly planned, Bowden adeptly portrays the people who live and die to help make sure that we continue to live and die in freedom. These men illustrate valor and commitment, to one another and in the name of an unappreciative government. Mostly without the seemingly everpresent CNN live world coverage, a small number of men accomplished a lot with a little.<br />The September 11 events make us grateful that we have soldier warriors like these men.
B000055WIQ|4.0|I thought this movie was very good.  However if you have seen very many horror movies and feel as though none of them are scary, you most likely wouldn't think this was that scary.  It's More Startling than it is scary.  I bought this movie because I really wanted to be scared and everyone I've talked to that has seen it thinks it's scary but I didn't think it was scary.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was a great book. I enjoyed it very much, even though I thought it was a little weird. I couldn't quite grasp the concept, but about 9 pages into the book I completely got the book. I gave it 5 stars because of the imagery, the concept of the city, and the total realization of this place that it was almost real like I could just touch it. As reading the book I was kind of thrown off the subject I could not understand what was happening. Jonas to me seemed different from all the other people in the book. Like he had some kind of special power over the others.  When I reached the part about the &quot;Giver&quot; or boss I completely understood what Jonas was to do. I could never imagine live in a place where you couldn't be free to think and do. Where you where told what you where to for the rest of your life. The concept of this book was so surreal that you can picture it happening and you can create the scene inside to your head. Jonas didn't like the way things were being run. When he finally understood what was happening, like for example when he finally saw what being &quot;released&quot; meant when his father killed the other twin or how you had to apply for a child. When he came to harsh reality that the game he often par took in was actually a sing of war and the other kids didn't know what was happening, but Jonas knew what pain was and told them to stop. Over all the book was very well written and I wish they would make a squel.
B00004TJFL|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good.  The plot is of course the same as all of the other five Halloween films that tell the story of Michael Myers.  In this installment it continues where #4 left off and continues telling about Michael's attempts to kill his niece.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Say, do you like great songwriting, but too often find it packaged in artsy, coffee-house pretense?  Well, I do.  I love a well written song, but often find the sparse production of &quot;singer-songwriters&quot; to be, well, boring.  John Mayer writes great songs, personal songs.  He sings them with great passion.  He also has the pop sense to record with a full band that adds to their accessibility.  The combination results in the intimacy and quality of the singer-songwriter genre with the excitement of pop songs.  &quot;Love Song For No One&quot; could be a hit on pop radio, college radio, or anywhere else for that matter.  &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is an album simply packed with great songs.  Mid-tempo, intelligent pop/rock/folk for people who like their folk with some kick and their pop with some brains.  Mayer is a talent worth checking out.
0393317552|5.0|GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL is a persuasive discourse of competitive plausibility regarding the challenging question why population groups on different continents experienced widely divergent paths of development. Contrary to the voluminous objections cited in the many of the reviews below, Professor Jared Diamond, clearly an enthusiastic proponent of environmental determinism, presents a set of premises consistent with evidence provided from a wide range of disciplines, but he does not attempt to answer the question of genetic diversity, including differentiated intelligence, among racial groups as many reviewers have inferred. If anything, implicitly, the author appears to support promulgations of differentiated intelligences; he sets out to demonstrate intelligence was not the root cause to Eurasian dominance.<br /><br />On at least two occasions Diamond, without equivocation, stated he found on average the New Guinean to be more intelligent than the average European or American. He was prompted to undertake this investigation as a result of a question posed by a New Guinean friend - Why white people developed so much cargo (material goods) and brought it to New Guinea while the indigenous had so little. Diamond summarized his findings as follows: \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples environments, not because of biological differences among people themselves.\\"<br /><br />Beginning 13,000 years ago, the author illuminated the conditions or circumstances that may have facilitated growth for some groups and inhibited the same for others. Diamond accepts the out of Africa theory for the dispersion of Homo sapiens to the other continents (for purposes of his treatise Europe and Asia are indivisible), and like the old axiom of real estate, the importance of location, location, location becomes readily apparent. For Diamond, food production is the ultimate cause of variable rates of development for different peoples. He illustrates how the abundance of wild plants subject to domestication and availability of large mammals served as immediate factors to transition from hunter/gatherer bands and tribes to sedentary agriculturally based chiefdoms and states.<br /><br />Diamond lists what he proposes as proximate causes to European dominance:<br /><br />1) Germs - based on close proximity to domesticated animals, immunities were developed infectious strains Europeans would carry to other areas, resulting in the decimation of non-immunized populations. In turn, those groups had few autochthonous diseases that would affect the invaders.<br /><br />2)  Invention of writing- relatively sedentary lifestyles facilitated devotion of more time and effort to the creation of methodologies to control and coordinate commerce. These systems eased transfer of information among society members, and had further implications to the establishment of hierarchical political organization.<br /><br />3) Axial orientation of the different continents - east/ west orientation was conducive to transmigration of people, products, and technologies. Plants best suited to specific climatic conditions were readily transferable; geographic encumbrances were less severe and population isolation was not as significant.<br /><br />4) Establishment of hierarchical organizations - food production instigated the growth of artisan classes focused on technological improvement, leisure classes devoted to functions unrelated to subsistence, organization of massive armies comprised of professional soldiers, and religion, which allowed individual groupings to live together under codification without killing one another.<br /><br />5) Continental Isolation - Landmasses that were separated by geographic or ecological boundaries were under less pressure to develop or adopt new ideas, products or technologies from competing civilizations.<br /><br />Some of the author's theories were not defended as successfully as others. His explanation why Sub-Saharan Africans were unable to identify species (the water buffalo and Zebra are two prime examples) that may have been used in farming and commerce seemed rather weak. Capture, taming and subsequent selective breeding for temperament seems as viable here as he indicates was the case on the Eurasian plains for other species. Similarly, he does not offer a convincing argument regarding the American Indian's failure to domesticate the Bison, although the inference seems to be the lack of cultivatable plant life was certainly a factor.<br /><br />Overall, Diamond provides a compelling theory of the differences in development rates among different peoples, linking a wide set of factors that are not generally considered in parallel in the historical record. For anyone with even peripheral interest in the evolution of different societies, this is an enthralling book.water buffalo and Zebra are two prime examples) that may have been used in farming and commerce seemed rather weak.

0780626966|5.0|Excellent set, Obviously Nightmare on Elm Street have been all time favorite horror movies, at the end of each part you will see Freddy's coming back again. We anticipate waiting for every sequel. It is intelligent and amazing action, humor, and mostly the horror, which is my favorite. It is worth buying. Excellent features included. The encyclopedia is full of great stuff for the PC; you will enjoy the games and the fun. Highly recommended. We are waiting for another new sequel, I am sure Freddy will back again, just wait and see!

B00000K19E|5.0|It is very rare to find a complete movie in everything here is one for you. The Matrix, a great Thrilling ride, sets new standards for the film industry. Buy it you won't regret it, because I am still watch it from time to time, never felt bored. Simply, One of the best movies ever made.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Granted, 2001 has been a pretty mediocre year for movies thus far, but &quot;Memento&quot; is a film that more than deserves nods come awards time, this is a film that demands to be watched again and again. Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano turn in great performances as a man with no short-term memory and a his enemy/sidekick/friend. You will need to watch this movie more than once, because once you've seen the end (or the beginning, as the case may be) you'll want more than anything to go back and observe again how it got there. This DVD is especially nice because it includes, as a special feature, the complete text of the short story the movie is based on. I for one would like to see this idea used far more often on DVDs.
B000002KBU|5.0|Oh this album-Joni Mitchell is at her finest I feel here, as she pours out her feelings on everything from love to loneliness and isolation to missing a home you're far from.  Some of the songs are so lovely you cannot help but want to weep, either from joy or sadness.  Her moments of joy come sparkling through in such unpretentious ways-wanting to squeeze the beauty of life and share it with someone you love is something so pure and beautiful.  In this album I feel you can really get a sense of who Joni is, which is such a rare and wonderful gift because her wishes and dreams are so touching and heartfelt.  Plus, with her softer than silk voice she goes through crescendoes and up and down throughout the pieces, going to places that still, after all these years of listening to them, have never ceased to amaze me and catch me off guard.  This is a jewel of a album, simple as that.  In Little Green, she expresses the deep hopes and desires of a woman who has given birth to the most precious baby and had to give it up for adoption.  I listened to that song hundreds of times without knowing that was what it was about, until a few years back when I learned she had given her daughter up for adoption.  Now listening to it just amazes me even more, as I admire her strength in the face of such a difficult task.  Every single one of the songs on this album is a rare beauty, and each is unique and stands just as well on its own, but put them together and you'll find that listening to this album is like entering into your own pleasure garden where each song seems to be speaking to you and yet holds so much more as well.  I have nothing but praise for Blue.
0930289455|5.0|If anything, the real genius behind this book is that, by the ending, you're still not clear how much of the backstory is real and how much is just another figment of the Joker's derranged mind. This is THE definative work on The Joker as a character, and even if Moore didn't have masterworks like &quot;Watchmen&quot; under his belt, this book would mark him as a comic book genius.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Scary. Absolutely scary.<br />This is one of the very best restorations on a film that I have seen. The images are so sharp and clear that they are literally menacing. This is the true definition of a perfect restoration.<br />For first timers, you won't like this film. But the images will haunt you and you will return to it like a puzzle that stumps you the first time around. The acting (all courtesy of Welles' Mercury Theatre) is superb. The photography is unparalleled. The Bernard Herrmann score is classic. <br />An American classic that grows more and more relevant with every new era. We need it more than ever.<br />Orson Welles will never die...and neither will Kane.
B00003CXRP|3.0|While not a terrible movie, &quot;Cast Away&quot; was by no means as good as it could have been. In fact, it's hard to really pinpoint exactly what's wrong with it. The plot moves slow, but it has to. There is almost no music to speak of, but I actually found that to be rather effective. If this film fails, it's because it really felt like it should have somehow been more than it actually was. Hanks is really better than this -- looking forward to &quot;Road to Perdition.&quot;
074322454X|1.0|As a voracious reader of history I bought the book with great enthusiasm.  I was disappointed.  I found the book shallow and<br />tepid, so much so I found it hard to finish.  Writing of one of the elite units in the US Army, Mr. Ambrose barely gets the<br />reader involved.  His recounting of a heroic bayonet charge, or an assault down a fire swept causeway, gives the reader as much feeling for what it was like as me describing my breakfast with the phrase &quot;I ate breakfast.&quot;  His use of ridiculous comparisons and statistics is insulting to the rest of the dogfaces of the US Army.  While the 101st made three combat jumps and spent time on the front intermitently broken by time in camp, other regular straight leg divisions never left the front.  yet he goes on to say that the  180  combat days at the front put every man at risk of breakdown.  Mr. Ambrose needs to read his sources better.  It was CONTINUOUS time at the front that broke a man down.  Curousing and drinking in England doesn't count.  While I respect and admire the individuals and their heroic acts.  Any of the referenced works in the reviewed book are more fitting tributes.  Maybe the HBO treatment will do them better justice.  The best treatment of war on a personal level is With The Old Breed by Eugene Sledge.<br />I give it one star and place it in the circular file.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This was  a funny but cleaver movie and excellent to watch from the visual side that I have seen for a while. I like a movie that makes yor laugh out loud.I enjoyed the story line and the mixing up of all the characters from the cartoons of old I think it perhaps was a better movie for adults as they could see the hidden jokes behing the characters better than a child that prehaps had not met them all yet as the young ones today are to busy with the current cartoon and the pair pressure from there friends keeps the interest there with the selling of  toys and cards to promote there cartoon.Like Pokemon and then dragon ball Z, Shek has know toys here yet I hope to get one when they come and a copy of the movie<BR>so I can see it again Iknow I will enjoy It as much the jokes are just wonderful a must see.
B00000064G|5.0|I am fascinated by the reviews here. A lot of people have been turned on to his music by a short car commercial. It's poetic justice. The guy was too special to be forgotten, even a quarter century after his death. I became familiar with Nick Drake back when R.E.M. were still less than household names in 80's. I was and always will be blown away by his unique talent. As somebody who writes songs, struggles with depression and has not played gigs in years since my depression worsened, I can only too well relate to surely some of what Nick felt. However, it concerns me some of the the myth-making that people do about him. People like to embellish the legend not endow the person with respect and gratitude for their art. For one, the Robert Johnson \\"hellhound on my trail\\" thing is a great blues tale but I have read the biographical notes that Patrick Humphries wrote about him in the liner notes/booklet that accompanies the Fruit Tree box set. Nick (and its so clear in his voice) was just a painfully introverted and gentle soul who probably needed to immerse himself fso fully in his music to almost a hypnotic trance-like state that life, the clatter of background/crowd noises while he played live shows was apparently just so distracting it really threw him off and he could never be comfortable in such settings. Its even reported on at least one occasion, Nick would perform sitting on a chair with his back turned to the audience. As a result, he stopped performing live somewhere in the last 2-3 years of his life. That's where Pink Moon comes in. Yes, he was suffering when he wrote it, but the \\"cracking up\\" thing just makes it sound so much \\"more funny farm, get the straight jacket\\" and this kind of melancholy is far from that - its a kind of intensified sobriety and quiet still yearning and you hear that stillness and longing in Nick's voice and it gently and forcefully MOVES you. (Another thing, if you really sit still and listen to this album all the way through, its 28minute length is plenty long and you will probably want to do something quiet afterwards). Okay, here's my final piece of debunking, somebody from Wisconsin compared Nick to Kurt Cobain and that this is like a suicide note and that 3 days later after he finished the album or some such nonsense Nick killed himself. Well, sorry that might make a nice little E! True Hollywood story but the facts don't fit. Pink Moon was released in 1972. Nick died in 1974. Pretty simple math. Also, in the last year of his life, its reported in Humphries biography that Nick started a new anti-depressant medication and appeared to respond quite favorably to it and was according to his family and few close friends lifting in spirits. He even recorded 4 songs for a Pink Moon follow up album. However, soemthing might have changed, either the drug just stopped working. I'm not clear about the events of his last days -- and frankly its not really how he died that people should be that fixated on. (God help me, what's next? People will probably start some \\"Nick Drake was murdered\\" conspiracy Webring.) I only mention these things to point how desperately Nick wanted and tried to live. People who have never suffered intense chronic depression just don't get what its like to live with feeling that bad for quite literally months and years at at time with only the fickle crap shoot of some pharmaceutically-induced relief to place their hopes upon. Do not judge what you do not understand.
B000020617|5.0|What do I have to say.???   Fans will always enjoy the foos second album &quot;the colour and the shape&quot; but There's nothing left to loose is still an excellent album, more poppy and softer but the songs are still great.  Dave really shows his talent in this album.  They haven't gone soft they still have the next album, which will be heavier and fun like the others.  But remember though that it is still really great and fun to listen to.  maybe you are interested in something softer sometimes.  you don't always want something heavy.  A variety of different songs is a good thing.  they will always be my fav band, and maybe yours too.  Full of surprises.
B000002G7G|5.0|The Velvet Underground were such a great band they probably could have made even third-rate material sound interesting. Fortunately, they were never faced with this challenge. During his days with VU, Lou Reed was on one of the all-time great songwriting tears; and nowhere is this more obvious than on the band's eponymous third album. For the ballads alone, Reed's work here is staggering -- &quot;Pale Blue Eyes,&quot; &quot;I'm Set Free,&quot; &quot;Candy Says,&quot; &quot;Jesus.&quot; Throw in the two delirious rockers &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;Beginning to See the Light&quot; and the undefinable but wonderful &quot;Some Kind of Love,&quot; and you begin wondering which devil Reed made his pact with. No joke, folks: Lou has come up with a batch of songs here as uniformly strong as 'Blood on the Tracks' or 'Plastic Ono Band.' I can't give any higher praise than that.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I can't add much to what's already been written, but wanted to add my 5-star vote.  I tire of most CD's very quickly and feel like I'm constantly searching for quality.  I am absolutely blown away by this release.  Bought it on a whim....had never heard a song....and now I'm harrassing all of my friends to buy this ASAP.  Such a refreshing album after so much junk that's been released in the last few years.  <br />I wish I could give comparisons but he seems to defy them.  Alt/rock with some serious musicianship as a basis.  It's not fare to compare him to DMB, but that seems to be a common theme.  They're pretty different in my book, but if you like <BR>DMB this would be a safe pick.
0802136834|5.0|This was my summer beach read, and I found myself more interested in this wonderful book than the ocean!! Very well documented, and researched, yet still gripping.  This is not a dry history book, but a re-telling of the lives of these facinating women.  The photo section was interesting, and well worn by the time I was done.  You can get a feel for who these people really were, not just their accomplishments. I am off to start her book on Henry's children.
B00005BJPO|5.0|THIS FILM IS WONDERFUL, THERE IS JUST SO MUCH IN IT THAT YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT A COUPLE OF TIMES TO KEEP EVERYTHING STRAIGHT, BUT IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT AND MONEY FOR THIS ANIME CLASSIC.  THE NEW VERSION WAS A LITTLE WEIRD BECAUSE OF THE NEW VOICES, BUT THE SOUND WAS INCREDIBLE AND THE VISUALS ARE STILL SOME OF THE BEST NON-COMPUTER GENERATED IN ALL OF ANIME.  THIS ONE WILL NEVER DIE.
B00005N5S5|4.0|If you've already layed out money for the bare-bones DVD, as I did, you would do well for yourself to lay out more for this one.  The 5.1 surround sound is excellent, if limited by the original mono soundtrack. The improved video transfer, still a bit grainy due to the style it was filmed in, makes this the best-looking video ever released for the film.  The real selling point, however, are the bonus features.  There are two informative retrospectives with interviews with most of the cast and crew.  But the true jewels are the deleted scenes with director commentary.  Watch them and see some of the plot devices that set up the sequel.  Ever since the release of the T2 &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;, the original Terminator DVD just seemed sadly lacking.  Finally, this &quot;Special Edition&quot; places this great film in the light it deserves.
B00005JGAB|5.0|They were so stupid they were brilliant. Their songs were so short they were mini-symphonies. The formula was so obvious it took four drug-addled kids who could barely hold their instruments, much less play them, from a suburb of New York City to discover it... and once they discovered it, the world of music would never be the same. The Ramones--Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Tommy--were the least likeliest of geniuses, and that is what made them great.<br />The Ramones were the troublemakers at the pearly gates of rock'n'roll, and when no one was looking, busted the party wide open way back Bicentennial 1976. Trampling over the bloated likes of the Eagles, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd, the Ramones paved the way for a whole rowdy slew of malcontents. All the upstarts, the dreamers, the misfits, the outcasts, the loners who didn't quite have the courage to begin before then suddenly found the Ramones holding the freak flag high: &quot;Hey-ho, let's GO!&quot; and it was all up for grabs...<br />I'm not going to get into the old argument about who the first punk band was. That's not really what this review is about. But this is definitely an album that every punk rocker owned back in the day when there were about three punk rock albums ever, so think about that!<br />You know the drill: songs under three minutes, most not reaching two-and-a-half, three buzz-saw guitar chords, a nasally, Brooklyn-by-way-of-the-UK singer, and the cute/dumb cartoon lyrics:<br />&quot;Beat on the brat<br />Beat on the brat<br />Beat on the brat<br />with a baseball bat<br />What can you do?<br />What can you lose?&quot;<br />&quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; opens the album, and if ever there was a more perfect Song One, Side One, then I don't know it. This is what the Ramones always would be about: a glorious, blissfully infectious tune celebrating the sheer unstoppable joy of rock'n'roll.<br />A baker's dozen of classics, hot on the heels of this one, follow in breathless, breakneck speed, slowing down only so Dee Dee can count off one more time: &quot;1-2-3-4!&quot; The minute-and-a-half &quot;Judy is a Punk&quot; introduces the type of characters that will populate Ramones' songs for the next two decades.

B000002TQV|4.0|A very solid band begins down a path of brilliance with the song.  Who knew how far they would go.
B000002UAU|5.0|First of all, let me put in writing that I don't like the Beatles.  I don't like John Lennon, I think George Harrison is a middle of the road guitar player, and I think Ringo Starr is a joke as a drummer.  I like Paul McCartney's writing and I like how he puts across his music.  Second of all, let me say that I don't like this album, as I think the music is boring.  I bought the album when it came out in 1967 and, frankly, I was a kid and didn't know what to make of it, and I didn't really get into any of the songs, except maybe &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;, which I thought was the best musically.  Now that I've said that, let me say that you cannot listen to rock music at any level, without first listening to this album.  The point of the album is that all rock music after this time is directly affected by this album.  You cannot possilby ever understand what you are listening to, unless you listen to this album first.  This album did the following for rock and pop:  Before this album all groups came out with the same sound for the duration of the group's existance.  This album allowed a group to change and expand it's music.  This is the first concept album.  The is the first Progressive Rock Album, the first Art Rock Album.  This album gives every group that came after this the license to do what they do.  Experimentation.  You wouldn't have progressive, alternative, metal: you woulnd't have nothing without this album.  This album gave Rock credibility as a music form, and as an art form.  It gave Rock sophistication.  It allowed future groups to do intricate things.  It allowed the listener to think, because there was something to think about.  Horns, they put in horns.  Rock was silly little tunes up to this.  They had horns.  Strings.  Swing jazz type drumming.  This album made the music grow up.  After this album eveyone had horns and strings.  And concept.  And different types of Rock.  There were no different types of rock, just little tunes.  &quot;I WantTo Hold Your Hand.&quot;  That was the depth of the lyrics.  This was talking about the reality of life.  When you buy this album, first buy &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;, and then play the first cut.  It's an astonishing difference.  Put yourself in 1967 and you will see what happened when we put this on for the first time.  I was startled.  We never heard anything like it.  I probably never will again.  You have to buy this.  This is where the music you listen to comes from.  It is a brilliant moment in Rock/Pop history.  It is the most important album of the 20th century.  It allows your music to behave as it does.  I don't like the Beatles, but they are the most important musical group of the 20th century and possibly of all time.

B00003CWN3|5.0|This must be one of the best films I have ever viewed.  It is extremely touching, but some pieces are hard to view.  This film shows many of the aspects of an often shunned disorder, and it's social consequences.<br />This film shows a gripping look at gender idenity disorder, and how it is publically viewed as wrong.  It is the story of Brandon Teena, and the love of his life. But of course since he was anatomically a girl, this was viewed as wrong since the one he loved was a woman. Since others in his close community of &quot;friends&quot; could not handle thw truth they killed him.<br />It's a wonderful film, but be prepared to feel ill, and in some scenes, turn your head.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I love Diana Krall. I own all her earlier releases, and this is refreshingly different from all those that precede it. I'm no music expert, but the overall theme of this CD seems to derive it's flavor from the international jazz movement of the early 1960s. Especially reminding me of what Antonio Carlos Jobim created through his Bossanova spirit. Be warned, if you love her piano playing of previous albums, this one doesn't swing like those. And her vocal stylings are sometimes similar to Astrud Gilberto's of &quot;Girl from Ipanema&quot; fame. Yes this is different, but I love it too.
B00005NB0H|3.0|The playing is incredible, no doubt. No other band in rock history even comes close to blending musicianship with this level of ferocity. Keith Moon, who is an absolute neuroligical wonder, sounds like he's got eight arms, and his drumming is so sophisticated, innovative and original that he reminds you how uninspiring most other rock drummers are. The first disc should have its own museum it's so damn hot. However, I have heard better versions of Tommy (Tanglewood 1970 is the best). Roger Daltrey, who is my all time favorite vocalist, seems tired in parts and it's so obvious he re-recorded the vocals for &quot;Listening to You . . .&quot; It's a shame, because his singing at Tanglewood was spectacular. Why release the one version of Tommy where he Daltrey isn't at his best? And if you are going to re-record his vocals, take his vocals off of another concert from that era when his voice didn't sound completely different that it does today. Not only did he lay on new vocals, but Pete and John's background vocals have disappeared. And are we ever going to get the full version of &quot;Young Man Blues? The complete version includes portions of a Pete Townshend solo. I love these guys so much I would buy an eight track of Entwistle taking a dump that's how huge of a fan I am. But they have made some strange decisions with the Live At Leeds over the years.
B000002LKU|5.0|I have been listening to this for the past decade. This is folk and folk rock at its best. The accompanying music and harmonising blend superbly. My favourite is 'Will you miss me', but I like 'all' the numbers in this album , which is rare. I think Knoffler is getting back to his roots these days ( circa 2001)and it is interesting to compare this album with the latest on offer , and of course with the music of Guru JJ Cale. The Notting Hillbillies should get together again for another creative burst. The time is right.
B00005MP58|5.0|I've read some other reviewers complain about the special edition, especially about the quality of the color. I admit that some of the scenes in the first disc are a bit white washed,(then again I never liked the yellowish tint of the VHS copy) but any difficiencies in color are more than made up for by other features. The widescreen is absolutely wonderful and gives new depth and dimension to a variety of scenes, and the picture is crisp and clear. I feel it was well worth the money.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Does anyone not like this movie?  This and Red River are tied as my favorite John Wayne films.  The scenery and cinematography are simply spectacular, and it's a joy to finally see it in wide-screen.  There isn't a dull moment in Hatari!, and while the subject matter (catching wild animals for zoos) may be &quot;politically incorrect&quot; by todays thinking, it's a terrific film for the whole family.
B00003CY3W|4.0|This is a teenage angst film based on the comic strip, starring Thora Birch as Enid, just graduated from high school and wearing a militant, too-cool aloofness, and Steve Buscemi, playing a shy retiring blues-vinyl-collecting nerd 30 years her senior.  The movie shifts back and forth from the course of their relationship and Enid's more-or-less aimless roaming around the city, making cynical AND paradoxically poignant observations (&quot;The bus doesn't stop here anymore&quot; -- &quot;You don't know what you're talking about&quot;).  The best scenes are the ones in the remedial high school art class, where the teacher values cheesy, sophomoric political messages over artistic self-expression and skilled technique.  Also, the curmudgeonly swipes at clueless elements in our society are funny because they are ubiquitous:  the teenage video store clerk who's never heard of &quot;8 1/2&quot;, the barfly who values a young, raucous pseudo-blues band more than THE REAL THING, and, toward the end, the immediate suspension of all perspective, proportion, and due process for anyone denounced as having acted in a manner interpreted (correctly or not) as racist.  The problem with the film, however, is that it drags about one half to two-thirds of the way through.  Delighted after 30 minutes, I was hoping it would never end;  toward the end I was looking at my watch.  I think the plotline, so suitable for a comic strip where it is doled out in small portions, is too flat for a continuous two-hour presentation (i.e. a movie).  Thora Birch's performance begins to seem like it's stuck on the same note, and begins to get a wee-bit tiresome.  I can't tell if that's just Thora Birch (too early) or the script.  Pretty good film, though, and a much-needed respite from the horrors infesting movie theaters this year (Glitter, Pearl Harbor, etc).
B000035Z3K|5.0|I'm not about to describe this film and it's plot, as everyone is familiar with the story of Count Dracula.  I'll concentrate rather on the disk itself, which anyone with more than a passing interest in old horror flicks will appreciate.  <BR>Besides having a nice transfer of the original classic, the spanish language production is here as well, and is a real find.  Filmed on the same sets as the Bela Lugosi version, it was filmed with an entirely spanish-speaking cast, as opposed to the subtitles and dubbing that are so often used when transfering a film to a different language.  But the differences don't stop there.  The atmosphere, emotion, and erotic inference are all hightened here, making this a very pleasant suprise.  Subtitles can be switched on for those (such as myself) who aren't literate in Spanish.  Highly recommended!
0780631684|3.0|While I enjoyed this movie, the director had a schizo moment about halfway through it.  The first half of Final Destination is a good horror flick.  It has excellent suspense and mood.  The second half of the movie is tongue-in-cheek humor or black comedy.  Which is also well done for that type of movie.  The sense of shock to my system from starting to watch a horror movie and ending with a comedy caused a large amount of consternation.  Had the movie been one genre or the other, it would have been really great.  But, instead we have an ugly hybrid.  I would love to see this re-edited or re-done.  As it stands, I can't really recommend it to anyone.
1559409002|5.0|It's all been said before, but this is a very influential and enjoyable movie, and is finally getting attention from more than just a handful of enthusiasts.<BR>Criterion is known for putting together an impressive package, but their release of Carnival of Souls sets a new standard.  Beautiful transfer, LOTS of extras, and the eerie, hypnotic film itself...wonderful!
B000059TEP|5.0|I had seen GHOST originally in a movie theater and shortly after I bought it for my private collection. The movie works very well as a love story, thriller and comedy, especially with Ms. Goldberg playing the medium. Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze are just fine as the romantic leads although Ms. Moore does tend to downplay quite a bit. Mr. Swayze is handsome and energic as the leading man (must be his dancing background). The plot is good and quite different. I have to say, though, that Ms. Goldberg's<BR>appearance and her funny, funny turn as the medium really made the film enjoyable for me. She deserved her Oscar!
B000000H6D|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM - LISTEN TO IT . they are great musicians with some actual inpiration rather than the usual &quot;hate me&quot; or &quot;ihate you&quot; lyrics. I espielly love &quot;black #1&quot;i have both versions of this cd because i am a maniac that way- if i like anyone ,band,author ect. i have to have everything by them , the other version has suspended in dusk on it but does not have we hate everyone. &quot;Blood and fire&quot; is also fantastic. {and the girls are kissing on the other cover , thank the goddess for small favors ...i love it, even if i am girl!}
052594527X|5.0|When I first bought Girl with a Pearl Earring, I thought it was going to be just another historical fiction book...nothing more.  How wrong I was!  When Griet, the protagonist, goes to work at Vermeer's house I wondered what was going to happen.  I quickly found out.  Besides getting herself into one awkward predicament after another, she meets a very original cast of characters.  There's Vermeer's mother-in-law, Maria Thins, who is a very intimidating woman...or so she seems, Vermeer's wife, Catharina, who is pregnant most of the time, the butcher's son and of course, Vermeer himself.  Vermeer is portrayed wonderfully.  I thought that if I had ever met Vermeer he would act exactly as Tracy Chevalier had made him act.  This book goes by faster than you will want it to.  I guarantee that after you read this you will never look at a Vermeer painting in the same way again!
B00001NFCY|3.0|I really liked the song &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; so I decided to purchase the human clay album. After listening to the album I realized that this was the only song from creed in which I liked. Everything else on the album tended to sound the same or not really intrest me. I guess I just have a different preference when it comes to music. Although, I'm not saying this is a bad album it just took me by suprise when i realized how heavy the rest of there music is. I don't regret buying the cd but, simply would suggest sampling it before purchasing.
0425170349|5.0|Another great book by the master of the genre, Tom Clancy. Carrying on with his trend of introducing new characters and then following their exploits across many novels, this time we are treated to something different. Instead of Jack Ryan in the spotlight, we get two individuals that have grown in importance in the last few books, mainly since (and  primarily starting with) Clear and Present Danger; John Clark and Domingo Chavez. <br />The President in this book (Ryan, but never mentioned by name that I recall and not an important character) orders the creation of Rainbow, a multi-national (primarily NATO with some Israeli particpation) anti-terrorism task force. Based in the United Kingdom, the highly secretive organization is comprised of two teams, one always on duty, set to respond to hostage and terrorists activities anywhere on the world at a moment's notice. Clark is called up to be pretty much in charge of it, with Chavez as a right-hand man. Rainbow is formed and trained, comprising American, British, German, and other nationalities, and is ready for action.<br />They don't have to wait long as a series of terrorist and hostage situations occur in Europe, first in a bank in Swizterland, then in a private residence in Austria, and then again in a Disney-esque amusment park in Spain. What is the linkage, or is there one? Why the sudden rash of terrorism? Rainbow deals with each indicedent very effecitively, but is something larger at work here?<br />It isn't long before the reader finds that there is someone behind the attacks, at least some of them, though it is while before events become clear to the reader (and much longer to the characters in the novel, not only the members of Rainbow and the intelligence, military, and law enforcement communities that support them, but also in the guise of former KGB agent Colonel Dmitriy Arkadeyevich Popov, who works for the main antagonists in the book, but does not have the &quot;full story,&quot; at least at first).<br />The main villains, it is revealed, are members of a very secretive cadre of very hard core environmentalists, ones who are experimenting with biological warfare, with the goal of wiping out all humanity except for a elite few, ones who can properly &quot;appreciate&quot; the natural world. How this ties in with Popov, Rainbow, and the rash of terrorism is revealed, and it is chilling. Soon, the all of humanity is at stake here. <br />Some have criticized making environmental terrorists the key vilains in this epic novel. Some have said that this represents Mr. Clancy's views on protecting the environment. Personally, I thought the villain choice was unusual and interesting and made for a great story. He has already dealt with Irish and Arabic-Islamic terrorists, I think he was going for something that he (and others) had not explored previously. While I don't think he was condeming all environmentalists and conservationists, he clearly felt (my opinion here) that some are capable of such actions, and I don't think he is that off base. Not all terrorists and mass murderers come from Northern Ireland or the Middle East; one need only look at Jonestown Massacre, Oklahoma City Bombing, and the Heaven's Gate mass suicide. The scariest thing is that those in government might not see the next source of terror, one that might come from among its own members, and Clancy explores that with skill. Clancy does not discount all of the concerns of these very radical environmentalists, but he makes clear that their ultimate goal in this novel is postitvely ghastly.<br />A good book, a few flaws, but all in all highly enjoyable.

6300182355|3.0|Wow, this movie is painfuly bad.  I mean, it's great for a laugh but honestly, what were the writers producers thinking.  If you know the show Mystery Science Theater 3000, this is exactly the kind of movie they would bag.  Flash has the combined looks and intelligence of a drugged up surfer and a football player who's been in one too many tackles.  Between enemies that look like Gangus Khan, Robin Hook, and Lego people, and Flash's shining oafishness, this movie ranks right up there with movies like &quot;Parts the Clonus Horror&quot; and &quot;Soul Taker.&quot;
B00005OAJ1|1.0|As a long-time fan of \\"The D\\" I'm sorely disappointed with this album.  First of all, their warm and entertaining \\"two ... with acoustic guitars at amateur night\\" act is completely lost since they perform their trademark songs with a full studio band, drums and all.  The skits are only funny the first time you hear them.  After that, it's a chore to listen to the album as you have to keep grabbing the remote to skip the tired skits and get to the next song.  The best part of Tribute, the Stairway to Heaven excerpt, has been dumped.  Many of their funnier songs aren't on the album: Sasquatch, Bowie, the Star Trek theme with lyrics, and Jesus Christ Superstar.  I hope JB and KG read this review and realize how they've betrayed their fans.  I'd rather have purchased a compilation of their live club performances or their HBO appearances.

B00005N9CV|3.0|As a big DK fan I can just hope the next one is better. This Cd is just &quot;nice&quot; but it lacks the strength and the freshness of all the previous material. She is so young, why did she want to sound like Nina Simone or Gal Costa, the song selection was for them. &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; is a 40 year old song and it's sounds strange and it sounds obvious she was not very comfortable singing in spanish as oposed to &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;: WOW! that is my Diana. I know she will surprise us in the future.
B000002UAU|5.0|This bealtles alblum has many differnt styles of songs.  I like the way in some songs change the melody so sundanly in the middle of the song.  The Bealtles are muiscle genuises, they even wrote music to insterments they've never even played.  That ends my review
B00003CX5A|3.0|I gave this movie three stars because, well, I am a partial fan of Tim Burton.  To me, he is the Robert Smith (of The Cure fame) of the film world.  However, if you've seen one Tim Burton film, you  (almost) have seen them all.  Why? Predictability.  Design is always the same.  Stick figure-esque, almost surreal imagery is in every flick.  I recall seeing the previews for Planet of the Apes and before I knew who directed it, I said, &quot;It's a Tim Burton film.&quot;  Those in the know, get my drift.<br />This however, is a pretty middle of the road effort that just kind of works.  I think this is the first time that Depp has teamed up with Burton since ES, but I could be mistaken.  In any event, Depp gives a pretty solid performance.  But, I am somewhat partial to Depp too, so take that opinion with a grain of salt.<br />Depp is, of course, somewhat outshined by Christopher Walken.  But, in a manner of speaking, that truly goes without saying.  Walken almost always exudes a vibe of a complete sociopath, even when doing something horribly mundane such as accepting an award at the VMA's on MTV.  It's almost as if Walken is the possessor of the answer to some great riddle, we are alll working to solve.<br />But, you want to see a truly awesome scene with Walken??--check out the Christoper Walken v. Dennis Hopper scene from &quot;True Romance.&quot;  If ever there was a scene more worthy of memorization, I haven't found it yet.<br />At any rate, back to the movie at hand.  Again, if you're at all familiar with the folklore behind this flick, it's pretty darn interesting.  Beyond that, it is not something that you will repeatedly watch.  Great scenery, good mood, predictable &quot;surprises,&quot; and decent effects.  You know Tim Burton, you know what to expect.  However, I think that you'll find Tim Burton works best when doing his own material, and not a rehash of stories told before.<br />Rent it, watch it, save your twenty-five bucks for something a little more worthy.hy.
B000002I57|5.0|An alternate name to define this CD could be collaboration. Two giants of the jazz field stepped into the studio to record something that resulted in sheer straight ahead jazz beauty. Uptempo call and response, executed with such precision and total harmony that it is hard to differenciate where one begins and one ends as they both articulate on instruments seemingly incompatible yet bound by melody. The gentle side of Coltrane meshes perfectly with the soft sounds of vibes as played by Milt Jackson. &quot;Bags and Trane&quot; features a tightly interlocked musical piece that includes the thumping bass of Paul Chambers that makes it hard to sit still. &quot;Three Little Words&quot; features a rich introdutory solo by Coltrane that is quickly forgotten as Jackson takes over where Trane left off. This continues for seven minutes of bliss as each band member takes a turn adding an element of his own &quot;voice&quot;, but it is Coltrane and Jackson who showcase their talents most. Bluesy and meloncholy at times, as in &quot;The Night We Called it a Day&quot; both Coltrane and Jackson share the limelight in a subdued manner, reflective and forward at once, it is the perfect title for this song. The Dizzy Gillespie composition,&quot;Be-Bop,&quot; is at such a frantic, almost frenetic pace, that although it is old it fits perfectly with the fast paced lives and times we live in today. The three bonus tracks add an addional 20 minutes to the original Atlantic recording. Of the three I personally prefer &quot;Centerpiece&quot; as it features Jackson playing in complete harmony to the point where one has to listen very carefully to hear the vibes when they are playing simultaneously. A straight ahead jazz number this is the epitome of a classic jazz song, easy going yet swinging enough to make one bop his head to the rhythm. &quot;Blues Legacy' shows yet another side of Coltrane as he plays in a more rhythm and blues style that sounds more like Ace Cannon or possibly Maceo Parker. The rootsy side of Coltrane eventually gives way to the unmistakeable sound of his that has often been immitated. It is a classic number with rhythm and blues roots. In order to get a good profile of Coltrane this is an essential recording to see a facet of him rarely seen. By no means am I giving less credit to one of the founding members of the Modern Jazz Quartet, remember I started by saying this could have been aptly titled colloboration. Two giants of their instruments creating one sound, jazz at it's finest. Add this to your collection, file it under still cool.arker.

B00004XONN|2.0|I think reviews from non-RH freaks are much needed here!....sure radiohead is a good band with balls and artistic integrity...but this time one must admit they almost blew it. Roughly half of the track are decent....the other half is junk or fillers....could someone honestly think that treefinger is not crap? What about those 3-4 minutes of silence in the last song....sorry guys but this artistic statement has been made countless time before.....enjoy the silence?....please! Morning bell is a decent song but for those of you who think the drum is genius....well listen to closer from Joy Division and you will hear that exact same beat. I think this album is kind of an adverse reaction to the stardom they were forced into following OK computer. In summary this album has been completely overrated...it's sad when hardcore fans can't admit their group had somewhat of a failure.

0316776963|5.0|This is how funny this book is.  I had read it 2, maybe 3 times before I ever attempted to read any part of it out loud to anyone.  It's so funny I still couldn't make it past about the third paragraph without having to stop reading because I was laughing so hard.  I stopped every other paragraph throughout, choking and snorting and gasping with laughter.  Really it was a shameful performance on my part.  But this isn't the best indicator of how funny the book is.  What should really tell you how funny the book is is that even though mine was not exactly a smooth or even fully comprehensible reading, my listener still laughed.  A lot.<br />These essays are amazing.  At times I thought that Sedaris has just had an unusually funny life filled with strange characters, that he has better material than the rest of us.  But then I thought, shoot, I've taken language classes and spent time in a country where I didn't speak the language, and I didn't get even one really good story out of it.  It takes talent to have seen the humor in many of these experiences, and talent to have preserved that humor on the page.  Throughout the book Sedaris makes much of his drug-addled brain and mediocre intelligence, but he's clearly a genius.<br />I'm reading it for about the fifth time now, and I'm still laughing too loud.

B00005NI5Y|3.0|Dylan remains a thoughtful artist, always willing to just do his own thing and do it well. In this new collection he offers some good songs and fine, dark blues. However, I'm sorry, but Bob Dylan's voice has gone to hell. It's been that way for a while, and it's not about to improve with age. This isn't merely a question of singing style - I remain a big fan of his strident, raspy singing from earlier years. No, things sound like they have gone way beyond that into the realm of medical conditions. Quite apart from the fact that he looks like he needs a transfusion on the cover, he really sounds like his throat is in pain, and it's hard on the ears. There's good raspy blues and then there's nasty buzz saw. Honestly, now, if you didn't know who this was, and you heard this music objectively, would you run out and buy an album of someone singing like this?
B000002J2F|5.0|This is my favorite Genesis album, and it is also probably the best album for any new fans to buy, since it contains a good mixture of both old (progressive) and new (pop) styles. Duke has the atmosphere of their earlier efforts and just enough pop stylings to make it more or less palatable to both camps of Genesis fans. The strongest tracks on the album are the series of tracks that make up the so-called &quot;Duke Suite,&quot; Behind the Lines, Duchess, Guide Vocal, Turn it on again, Duke's travels and Duke's End.<br />If you like this album, I'd recommend either Trick of a Tail, Abacab as your next purchase...

B0000046X0|5.0|As the title states, this is the only RTF album that Bill Connors appears on (except the Anthology). At first, I was skeptical about hearing someone other than Al DiMeola, but I was quickly appeased. Mr. Connors plays some searing stuff on this disc, and it is very much like Al Di's playing on other RTF titles.<BR>This is a very interesting jazz-rock disc. There are two seemingly dedicatory pieces: Stan Clarke's 'After the Cosmic Rain' takes its title from Coltrane's 'After the Rain', while Chick Corea's 'Theme to the Mothership' seems to invoke Parlaiment's 'Mothership Connection', which Stan Clarke and George Duke would later cover on their first album.<BR>The rest of the pieces are Corea originals, including the humorously titled 'Captain Senor Mouse', which grooves.<BR>This is a must have of the heavier Polydor era RTF....

B0000262QW|5.0|The first incarnation of the Return to Forever band, which continued on 'Light As a Feather', then dissolved. Every track is beautiful. 'What Game Shall We Play Today', one of one and a half vocal tracks is extensively documented on the 'Light As a Feather Collector's Edition' 2 disc set. Flora Purim has a voice that is intoxicating; much better, dare I say, than Gayle Moran, who appeared on some of RTF's later albums (as well as on a couple of Mahavishnu Orchestra albums). Flora's style mixed better with Chick Corea's musical vision, I think, since Ms. Moran was perfect in her appearances with John McLaughlin.<BR>All the musicians on this disc play impeccable music: Joe Farrell concocts whispery flute lines and sax runs that seem to mimic the human voice; Stan Clarke does his best to be Stan Clarke and there's not much more I can say about him, his name says it all; and then there's Airto, possibly the best percussionist in the business.<BR>If you own 'Light As a Feather', then you must own this. They are like companion pieces that one must appreciate together.
B000002AGN|4.0|I'm new to Jazz, and have been mainly listening to Classical and Pop music.  This album is very good for Jazz beginners, and extremely good exposure for Classical listeners.  It doesn't follow the usual music timing, but the mix and match is done very well.  Melody on 3 of the songs is fantastic: &quot;Take Five&quot;, &quot;Three to get ready&quot; and &quot;Kathy's Waltz&quot;.  You can really tap your way through a mundane chore listening to it.<BR>The length of time for this album is short though, but considering this a Classic Jazz album, I feel it's sufficient for the money I paid.

It wasn't until later that I found out where mom had picked that familiar phrase up, just like it wasn't until later that I realised how wrong I had been.<br />This novel is about kids, and how their peaceful little town was transformed into a place of racism and hate by one lie told by a white farmer.<br />Jeremy Atticus (Jem) and Jean Louise Finch (Scout), the children of a lawyer in the town of Maycomb, spend their time just like any ordinary kids.  That is, until they meet Charles Baker Harris, better known as Dill, and the three of them start plotting how to get their mysterious neighbor Arthur (Boo) Radley to come out. They are blissfully unaware of it when a negro man, Tom Robinson, is accused of the rape of the daughter of a drunkard farmer, Robert E. Lee Ewell (Bob).  But when spring comes and their father is appointed to defend young Tom, the children, along with the whole of Maycomb, are drawn into the swirl of strong feelings, racism, lies and hate that is building up aroundthe case.  One of the best scenes of the book is the trial of Tom Robinson.<br />I'm not going to tell you any more about it, but I'lll let you in on one secret. The two storylines: That of the children and Boo Radley, and that of Atticus Finch and the &quot;rape&quot; of Mayella Ewell, will be tied together into a perfect bow.<br />If you aren't interested in the book after reading a few of the reviews on this site, I'm very surprised. This book is meant for people of all ages, not just adults. I'd even read it to my 7 and 9-year old siblings.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Overall, a strong effort, but Krall has definately reached a certain plateau.  Her vocal skills are in full bloom, but the instrumental arrangements drag down the recording to the point where there only seems to be two distinct tempos, which makes repeatedly listenings difficult.  Krall's previous release was a high point, and this one doesn't mess with the recipe for success, but one might expect more from such a huge talent, especially with the long lag between recordings.
B00003CX9W|5.0|That is a must have item. Your kids will love it but those who will really appreciate it are the parents. The music is excellent and when visualized by Disney himself it is just magnificent. <BR>The sense of humor on places is just great and you will love it. <BR>You will need a large screen to really enjoy it in full.
0780020685|5.0|Oh my!  Cinematograhy, plot, drama, acting...  I can't believe this movie was made in 1956...  I can't believe it has subtitles and is so engrossing...  I can't believe it is not butter...<br />In a word... &quot;wow!&quot;  <br />If you haven't seen it, see it.  The stills are worth it alone... A marvelous still of the mill wheel in the creek, a &quot;blow you away&quot; shot at the end of the movie in front of the grave yard, stunning vistas of the village...  This is not an in your face block-buster presentation...  It is a technically sound film in ALL aspects, done with simplicity and grace.  The result is POWERFUL!<br />Top 3 movies of all time?  * Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, Apocalypse Now
0380817683|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  I could not put it down.  I was emotionally involved during the entire book.  My heart is still in spasms over Rachel and Luke.  I have never been in rehab, but I felt like I was right there with her.<BR>Must read this one.  I am going to read it again......and maybe again.......
068818071X|5.0|This was a wonderful read !  A book I'm giving to all my friends for Christmas, including Watermelon ( a must read , too!). Marion is a top notch writer . Very ( I would say 100 very's) entertaining!
B000002HIK|5.0|ICBYD is the perfect marriage of the confusion and humor from the rdj album, the grating beats of afx, and the smooth tones of saw.<br />If I could have only one album I would choose this one.
B000050XEI|3.0|First off, in my mind it is unconscionable to place a mere 35 minutes of music on a medium that will hold twice that, and still charge full price.  In addition, there is no information such as track times that would alert the consumer to the abbreviated length of the cd.  That is the reason I give the recording three stars.  If the music were not so enjoyable, I would have rated it two or less.<br />If you enjoy Enya's music, you will enjoy this recording.  The harmonics are lush, the melodies are beautiful in their simplicity, and the lyrics have a kind of spiritual quality.  The flow of the selections is perhaps the most cohesive of any of her previous offerings.   <br />If you do not like Enya's music, it is doubtful this cd will change your mind.
0441172717|5.0|This masterpiece was written to stand the test of time. Herbert's avoidance of specific technology makes the story plausible even after 35 years.<br />Aside from its enormously entertaining plot, the creative exploration of alternative cultures, religious fanaticism, war, and political intrigue will tweak you view of the world. In light of recent tragedies, this novel gives a fresh perspective into the mind of Jihad. <br />Perhaps we are finally ready for our own version of the Orange Catholic Bible??? If you would like to contribute to such a project, contact me.
B00005A46T|5.0|yo, i like heavy metal, slipknot is the stuff you should be listening to if you want real music.  Dont listen to those other wannabies like korn and Slayer.  Another band i reccomend is Mudvayne, Slipknot and Mudvayne are the two best bands!!!!!!!!!
B00005LB9O|4.0|I'm new to Travis, this being my first CD of theirs and I was pleasantly suprised by it.  I'm not too keen on 'Last Train' but I'm sure that will grow on me, the rest of the tracks are fantastic, especially the happy 'Flowers in the Window.'  Buy this album if you want a good mixture of nice pop tunes and slow meloncolic ones :o)<br />I heartily recommend it.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This updated version of the classic Terminator movie is by far the best this movie's ever been. The sound and picture quality on this DVD are top notch, and you'd never guess the movie is over 15 years old. The sound must be heard to be believed, with the remixed 5.1 digital making good use of all surround sound channels. I personally rent for the extras and buy for the picture/sound quality, but the extras on here are very nice as well.
0515123447|2.0|To enjoy this book you have to buy into a whole lot of coincidences.  Huge coincidences.  The first being that the main character just happens to get off the bus in a small town in the middle of Georgia, gets arrested for murder, then finds out the dead guy is someone he knows and hasn't seen in years.  You have to buy that a police officer will fall instantly in love with a murder suspect/drifter.  You have to buy that the police routinely go along with the execution of the bad guys without even bothering to take them in for questioning.  You have to buy huge leaps of logic that are passed off as reasonable deduction.  You have to buy that no one else in the federal government would be involved with this particular investigation.  I could go on, but I don't want to give away too much of the plot for anyone that still might want to read the book.  I'd give it one star but I'm cutting the author some slack since this is his first book.
0380730367|4.0|This is the fifth and last book, so far in the series. Have read them in order and would advise anyone to do that. I thought the language was much worse in this one. Maybe it was like this in the first four but I don't remember it if it was. Story line was good, held my attention. Kenzie and Gennaro work well together. Lots of action and a fantastic ending. Bubba, well, Bubba is Bubba. Think Hawk could take him but maybe not. If you like fast action with lots so use of the F word you will like this.
0312979479|5.0|If you ever wondered why Agatha Christie has gotten such acclaim and praise, read this book and you'll find out why.<br />  Ten strangers, completely unknown to each other (except for one couple) are invited to attend a party at the mysterious new mansion built on Indian Island by a Mr. and Mrs. U.N. Owen, who is unknown to all of the guests. When they get there, they discover that the host and hostess are nowhere to be found. They soon realize that they have been tricked into coming to the island, a mistake that will ultimately cost their lives.<br />  When I first started reading this, I have to admit I was a little bored with the exposition. In fact, I stopped reading it after Chapter 1 for a few days, uninterested. But, I eventually decided to try reading more, and thankfully, I got hooked. As soon as the first person dies, your eyes become instantly glued to the pages, not wanting to put the book down. I know that's what happened to me. And when the killer is finally revealed, it's one of those moments when you hit your forehead and say, &quot;Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't realize that!&quot; All of the other 270 pages definitely pays off with the last 5 pages.<br />  If you love whodunit mysteries, or if you loved the show &quot;Murder in Small Town X&quot;, I highly suggest you read this. It's heart-pounding excitement at its best.
0151003084|5.0|When I was a boy, my mother read to me the short poem of Solomon Grundy. It went - Solomon Grundy, Born on a Monday, Christened on a Tuesday, Married On a Wednesday, Took ill on a Thursday, Worse on a Friday, Died on Saturday, Buried on a Sunday. This is the end of Solomon Grundy.     I don't remember how young I was, but I was startled by the short life of this Solomon Grundy character. It also made me wonder about death. Not in a depressive, fearful way, but in a curious way. Even though I wasn't intellectually tuned to metaphor , my unconscious understood that though we don't die in a week, we do die - whatever dieing meant to me in those days. It was a lesson. A lesson wrapped in a tale for the young at heart.     Edward Gorey's The Gashlycrumb Tinies teaches us the same lesson, but it also contains the one ingredient we need to extinguish the fear of death ( for a time ). Humor. We see the calamity of it's characters and we laugh. But we laugh because we are kin to the absurdity. The greatest ill a parent can do to a child is to deceive that child from the truth. The Gashlycrumb Tinies allows us to tell the truth, one step at a time. Laughter and death, something we all have in common.     Solomon Grundy or The Gashlycrumb Tinies - thanks Mom.     Otto
B00003CY5H|3.0|The Score is a good film that would have been much better had Brando stopped reading CoEvolution Quarterly (Whole Earth Review) long enough to really put his hand to the plow. Ed Norton  turns in a brilliant portrayal of the kind of punk we've seen in real life. The surprise ending calls for a sequel where ex-con Norton comes back angry for revenge and gets nailed again.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|I loved this movie :-)  I felt it gave Sandra Bullock a chance to indulge in her comedic side as well as the dramatic.  Can't wait till my DVD gets here!
0688152023|5.0|If you really want the true experience, GET THE VHS or DVD!!  Read the reviews for this video workout - it is absolutely AMAZING (and a perfect supplement for the book).  I think what the reveiws say about it will help your decision.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I won't wast any time with saying this movie is good go see it....the best movie I've seen so far this year....how the acting and direction is great and must be seen to be belevied.<br />I won't do that it you want that then read the other reviews.  What I will tell you is if you don't see this movie you are only cheating yourself out of a good time.<br />You are also cheating yourself if you read any reviews about it...you will apreciate the way the movie flows if you don't know anything about it.<br />This is the only movie that lets you become the leading charecter and you are able to feel for him.
B00005ASHM|4.0|I'll start by saying Pet Sounds is by no means flawless.  For instance some of the harmanys hit a high that isnt meant to be reached unless you're training a dog.  this im will to disregard though.  my main qualm with this record is that it displays all the tinybopper traits of every other beachboys record.  Wether he was giving into the record company to make a hit, or just likes write little girl music i dont know.  <BR>   that being said songs like God Only knows, and Caroline No makes you forgive brain for making you get up and skip past songs like sloop john b..   the two instramental are suff of legand, he has a way of sticking off cords into regular progression and make them sound as off as cutting butter.  even more imressive is wilsons nac for the catches, you'll find every song here has at least one.  <BR>  A would be odd favorite is Don't Talk(put you're head on my shoulder) its somber and woefulness is enough to make turn on Black Sabbeth to lift up you're spirts.  <BR>  brain wilson almost killed himself making this album, his blood is all over every one of these tracks. I know this isnt for everyone but if you have any concept of what good music is, you owe it to you're self to at least give it a try.
B000002GF8|5.0|If somebody ask to me what the album represents the 80's,<BR>i'm sure about answer. Sincronicity is the best album from Police and the best album from decade. Sincronicity 2, King of Pain and Every Breath you take it's a peace of cake.
0743420373|1.0|The authors have several charts and tables in the book citing a specific percentage of millionaires by ethnicity. They leave out the Blacks in America. Before you stop reading this note, take heart to what I am saying and try see this point from the perspective of a Black millionaire. If we are not represented in literature of &quot;perceived fact&quot; in our national writings then we will remain the lost &quot;tribes&quot; here on the American continent. Some of us belonging to the Original Americans who owned this continent. <br />Although Native Americans are mentioned in one chart, none of the charts, tables and/or text mentions Black Americans, where other specific ethnics are called out, such as Russian and Asian. Both groups settling in The Americas long after Blacks were &quot;introduced&quot;. (I use the term loosely.) <br />Black millionaires are well and healthy in the United States and should not be over looked. In fact, most should be held-up as an ethnicity who has overcome barriers far greater than any other Americans, to obtain their wealth. Few Black millionaires were produced through windfall, family inheritance or other types of instant prosperity. <br />I feel strongly about this issue and have advised all of my friends and associates to either destroy this book or to disregard it if they have not purchased it already. I do not want my children to read a text of which they rightfully should be a part yet are missing. <br />On a more positive note, the book contains good information about how to become a millionaire, how to identify millionaires and the basic statistical behavior of millionaires, and strategies millionaires use to remain in their chosen group; a group with which most  Americans are not particularly familiar. <br />I wish the authors had made a concerted effort to be racially balanced, as I am sure there are a significant number of Black millionaires in the United States to warrant a mention in the text or on one of the charts orgraphs. Additionally, the authors could have made a footnote or addendum entry citing the millionaires that were in smaller numbers than the 0.04% which they cite for one of the groups. <br />I left my copy of this book on the train in Europe in hopes someone reads it and is misinformed over there versus over here. Here -- we have enough misinformation perpetrated upon Black America, both wittingly and unwittingly by insufficient, illequiped authors, investigating subjects with limited intellectual tools, in the name of literary prowess.
B00000255F|5.0|For the longest time I held something against Bruce Springsteen. I'm not sure why; without really knowing any of his music I had this vague dislike of him. It was quite unfair. Finally, I relented and decided to pick up this album. It was a good decision. I'd like to preface this by saying I have not listened to any of his other albums, I haven't had a chance yet, so anything I say is based solely on this album. There are certain times in music where I think of the music scene as flooded with crap and the crap is in danger of snuffing out the flame, the torch, of true rock music. At this time it is necessary for someone to come along and hold the torch up above the water saving rock and preserving it for future generations. Dylan did this, the Beatles, U2, Nirvana, my promising local band Danny and the Mustangs. Well maybe not my band. But Bruce did. I don't really know where he went from this point in his career, but here he made an album of pure, unadulterated rock n' roll. Maybe it's a bit too centered on cars and girls, but hell that's rock, and its forgivable in this instance Sure, there are some gimmicks, but its soul is pure and it's obviously written by a man who gives a damn and that's all I ask out of music.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Its hard to follow up a great record like &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot;, but Dylan does a fine job on this set. It may initially come across as a grab bag as the tracks do not have the production, feel or blues groove of &quot;Time&quot;. Instead Dylan relies on his touring band and incorporates some distinct pre-war pop song styles into his repertoire-with &quot;Po' Boy&quot; being the most successful in my opinion. My favorites are the blues based tunes &quot;Cry Awhile&quot;, &quot;Honest With Me&quot;, &quot;Summer Days&quot; and the trad. country &quot;High Water.&quot; The best two cuts however are less derivative and more standard &quot;Dylan&quot;- &quot;Mississippi&quot; and &quot;Sugar Baby.&quot; Both are outstanding and feature intriguing lyrics (as do the rest of the tracks.) &quot;Mississippi&quot; seems ripe for more covers- Sheryl Crow covered it approx. one year ago. It would work well as a country western song. A great followup to &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;. Play it several times and get used to the variety within.

B000002C4J|1.0|Celine Dion has being inflicting her dreadful and sickening musak upon the world for quiet some time now.<BR>All her past albums have been full of sugary adult pop songs (Adult pop?) and melodramatic over-blown ballads and love songs and, 'Lets talk about Love' is no exception. It sticks firmly to the tried and trusted Cleine formula. The Titanic theme song is probably the best thing about the album, keeping in mind that it is a terrible, terrible song, while other tracks such as 'The Reason' and 'Immortality' just show up how weak a voice Celine has actually got. Hitting those high notes is fine, but honey, you gotta stay in key!?! There are those who will completely diagree with my views of the album and there are people out there who love it. Well fair enough what ever you are into, it just was not my cup of tea. Some of her earlier work (especially 'Falling in to you' moved me to tears)So come on Celine!!!! I know you can do better just try that bit harder.

0784011796|4.0|&quot;Pi&quot; is a tough film to pin down.  Some people go in looking for a complex dissertation on number theory, an explanation of the magic code that will explain the universe, and the true name of God.  I think this tact is a mistake.  Sure, all of these elements and questions are here, but they're not meant to be taken seriously.  Director/writer Darren Aronofsky and writer/star Sean Gullette have distracted their audience with a nifty little McGuffin (Hitchcock's term for a device or plot element that drives the movie forward, but is inconsequential enough to be discarded after it's done its job).  The movie is not about the 216-digit number that Max accidentally stumbles across, and is nearly killed for.  What we're really watching is a portrayal of obsession.  What happens when one man puts on his blinders, plunges forth into the abyss, and nearly destroys himself in the process?<br />I'm not going to tell you what happens, but I will tell you this: it ain't pretty.  Much of the stuff here is pretty gruesome.  Gullette looks every bit the tortured math genius: wild hair, constant 5 o'clock shadow, empty eyes, hunched posture, pale skin, bony fingers.  He begins the film as a tortured loner, and proceeds to descend from there into a state of self-imposed madness.  It is gradual, but palpable.  Gullette does a fine job detailing Max, showing his angst and torment quite clearly.  I would have liked, however, if he gave Max some humanity by also giving him some humour.  Thankfully there is some humour injected into this otherwise dark tale in other places.  Max is repeatedly confronted by what can only be described as a hip-hop Kabalist.  The character of Lenny Meyer adds some much-needed levity to the film.  He torments Max in coffee shops and on the street with his motormouth ramblings about how number theory intersects with the Kaballah.  Max, for his part, looks on with bemused frustration, further portraying his difficulty when dealing with actual people.<br />Aronofsky, who is a proficient visual stylist, gets his first chance to shine here.  Techniques that he would later expand and abuse in the engrossing but ponderous &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; make their first appearances in this lower budget effort.  One particularly stylish device uses manic quick cuts to portray the rhythm and the ritual of Max taking his headache medicine.  It was overbearing when used in &quot;Requiem&quot;, but fits in nicely here.  It is repeated over and over, a technique Aronofsky also likes to employ with his dialogue.  There is one story that opens the film, about how when Max was a little boy he forced himself to stare into the sun, which pops up from time to time.  We don't understand the implications of this story right away (apparently it is the cause of Max's migraines), but after hearing it several times, and living with Max in his own personal hell, it becomes more potent.<br />I usually not go for movies that double as surrealistic mood pieces, and judging from the other reviews here I wouldn't enjoy David Lynch's &quot;Eraserhead&quot;.  But &quot;Pi&quot; has a couple of my favourite cinema motifs: obsession, loneliness, and genius.  Throw in a healthy dose of mathematical theory (but not too much) and the remnants of a thriller plot and you've got a movie that dares to engage both your mind and your senses.<br />[*Shakespeare's &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, 1.1.62-3]
B00005N9CV|4.0|I have two of her other albums and have to admit this is the lesser of the three. Having said that, I've listened to the CD 8 times in a row today and I'm not even close to getting tired of it. I do wish there were a couple of up tempo, fun songs on it but it is still a very good CD. If you like mellow, clean music you won't be disappointed by this album.
6305508550|5.0|Watching this movie for the first time you will think it is funny. Watch it again and it will be even funnier. Your 3rd, 5th, etc... you will start to memorize all the lines because its so good. Every line is great, thats what makes this movie so good. Every part of the movie from beginning to end is hilarious. I mean how can you beat the jump to conclusions mat and the samir.. naga.. ahaga... not gonna work here anymore lines. Also the lasting appeal is awesome... the reason you should buy it. I don't usually watch movies more than once or twice, but this movie is so good that i never get sick of watching it. Each time you watch it you will pick up on something new and laugh and laugh and laugh. Don't even think twice, seriously, just buy it. If you don't like it then i'll pay ya $20 bucks!! Even if you are young, a teen, or old this movie will appeal to you.
B000005RS6|5.0|Are you open minded enough to read another opinion? 'Cause &quot;Live in Olympia&quot; is the best live album of Purple, that makes me see &quot;Made of Japan&quot; today, as an old fashioned boring ego trip of Blackmore. I don't have much patient anymore for long guitar solos - if you want to say something - do it shortly! &quot;Made in Japan&quot;, like Zeppelin's &quot;Songs remain the same&quot;, was the best heavy metal album in the 70's, but does'nt do anymore. Unlike the two, Olympia is a miracle of a great band, that for many years seemed to be dead, but suddenly came alive. Why? In one word - Blackmore. In 3 words - Blackmore and Morse. All other members of the band, as well as the fans, should send flowers to Ritchie, for leaving the band, and congratulate the other members for bringing Steven. Suddenly we can listen to the classics, of &quot;Maybe I'm a leo&quot;, &quot;No one came&quot; (my favorite) and others that we could'nt even hope during the Blackmore era. Morse is probably the reason for the good albums that the band released during the late 90's. Anyway, everyone of them sounds as young and fresh like in the golden years of the early 70's, and if you like Deep Purple and want to listen to a great classic of the band - buy it, althogh the price is high.
038532653X|5.0|I just finished this book a moment ago and am in awe of it's beauty, intelligence, and elegant use of magic realism. Like the characters in Skellig, one must look deeply and listen carefully to capture all of the symoblism surrounding the birds, William Blakes' poetic references, nature, and the human spirit. I am a bookseller (and former teacher) that specializes in young adult fiction and highly recommend this book to parents, teachers, and anyone else looking for an inspiring read.
B00003CXDG|5.0|Yeah so Dougray Scott was in this film and no one seems bothered! Any red blooded female out there surely cannot watch it without noticing the fineness!! So I gave the film 5 stars purely for the facial talent!
B00004WGAA|5.0|I have seen this film quite rarely on TV here in the United Kingdon and it is not available in the shops.  I read last year there was to be a remake of it.  Don't bother.  This film is a classic like Jacob's Ladder and to mess with it would be sacrilege, besides it would never equal the original, like the Phantom Menace it would be a huge disappointment.  Also would many people get it now, you have to be of a certain intelligence to enjoy something like this, I mean clever and individual. I love the freaky imagery, the sheer uniqueness, especially for the year it was made 1962 (the year I was born), the conservative early 1960's   I am not easily impressed but if I saw this in HMV (one of the biggest music store chains here in the UK) I would  grab it very quickly.  I am more a 70's fan for music and films, with the exception of Funny Girl which I saw when I was about 7 years old at the cinema but this has to rate as a masterpiece.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The womens auxuliary re-enactment of the attack of Pearl Harbor (as done by Monty Python) is as accurate and was more entertaining.

0792156684|5.0|The expectations were incredibly high for this film when it was released, and remarkably, it exceeded them all. What a vivid, wonderful victorian world we are shown! The re-creation of the most famous ocean liner ever is breathtaking. Perhaps the plot of the young lovers is well-worn, but Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring such charm and sincerity to their roles, we fall in love with them as do with each other. The TRUE star of the film, however, is the gigantic ship herself. The story unfolds from one end of the ship to the other, showing off all the detail work put into this feature. The love story aside, the events depicted really happened, and perhaps no film could or should depict the true horror of that fateful night in the north atlantic. However, this film gives an inkling of the terror those poor peole faced, and the courage they exhibited in surviving. This film is old-time Hollywood at its best, and one can't help but wonder why films like this seem only to come around once a blue moon.
0613033574|3.0|We know the end from the beginning: that a young man walks into the wilds of Alaska, makes a few fatal mistakes, and dies, a victim of his own ego as much as the unforgiving wilderness.<br />Krakauer follows the journey of Christopher McCandless aka Alexander Supertramp in an attempt to recreate the fatal adventure. The author identifies somewhat with the doomed McCandless, having followed a different drummer himself. But I can't help but think that Krakauer would have been more cautious, although he makes allowances periodically for the flawed judgment of McCandless. In fact, Krakauer includes some of his own story as he picks through the debris of McCandless' fateful journey.<br />There is little attraction in this image of McCandless, albeit his friendly persona as a self-styled King of the Road. Interviews with those who met McCandless along the way reveal only dimension, and that gregarious. The darker side, with enough hubris to challenge nature on her own turf, is barely glimpsed. The folly of youth is evidenced in the blind leap into the unknown, McCandless' only provisions a bag of rice, a Waldenesque assortment of paperbacks and a .22 caliber rifle. He was either hopelessly naive or a blatant fool. One is left with a question after all: so?

B00000IOSU|5.0|Two months ago I had never listened to Sarah McLachlan, I only had to listen once to &quot;Surfacing&quot; album to become a fan. I am slowly digging in her discography. This is one of the best recordings I heard from her.<BR> <br />She brings out energy and punch to the songs needing it (&quot;Building Up a Mystery&quot;, &quot;Ice Cream&quot;, yummy) and emotions when required (&quot;Adia&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;) or even the mix of both (&quot;Tumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;). The live versions are fair to the studio ones, often even better and enriched. My personal highlights would be &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;, &quot;Good Enough&quot;, &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;, &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; or &quot;Tumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, but all the songs in this collection are classics, and none is to be skipped.<br />If you are already a fan, it is a must have. If you are not familiar with Sarah's work, this live album is a good sample from all her previous studio recordings. It will give you a good idea of Sarah musical and vocal style.
0812550706|5.0|This book is definitely one of the best books I have ever read(ecclipsed only by the others in the series)<br />Although this book was the first one published, Mr. Card intended Speaker to be the true book and I like to look at it that way.  Ender's Game is more of a prequel than anything.  But that certainly does not mean you shouldn't read it.  It's sci-fi action at it's greatest, and I doubt you could find a book children would be more willing to read(save Harry Potter)<br />If your a pre-teen fan of this book, wait a few years before you read the sequels and entertain yourself with &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;
B000024D4R|5.0|How ANYONE with an ear for good music can dismiss this classic album as &quot;mediocre&quot; is beyond me. Anyone who can dismiss an epic like &quot;Dogs&quot; in favor of &quot;Pigs On The Wing&quot; simply because it's shorter and more easily digestible to the ear seriously needs to sell off their Floyd collection. If you're thinkin that way, you simply don't GET Floyd. Nothing wrong with that, everyone has their own musical tastes. For instance I don't care much for Hendrix--shoot me, I just don't, and I'm sorry for that. But I digress. &quot;Animals&quot; is one of the best Floyd recordings ever. Just felt like I had to scream that.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I hold that this album is among the greatest albums ever made by any musical group - anywhere. <br />Many have claimed that all Blink 182 sounds very similar.  This is entirely true.  However, if you like one song - you like them all. Its that simple.  (save the Party Song, which, for the record, is one of the most irritating songs I've ever heard)<br />Highly reccommended.

0767802470|5.0|I am updating this review to encourage fans of the movie to get the newly released \\"Original Uncut\\" version. This version is the one originally aired as a mini-series on German TV and is approximately 5 hours in length. It goes into much greater detail about the crewmembers and shows some critical dialogue and battle scenes that were left out of the theater version and the directtor's cut.        Get this DVD!! It is far superior to the VHS version. Watch the movie in German with subtitles to really get the flavor of the dialogue. The English dubbed version is, to me, sanitized.    Das Boot recreates a combat patrol of a German submarine operating out of France in 1941. The prologue explains that the war in the North Atlantic is turning against the Germans as the British have developed superior Anti submarine tactics. Nevertheless the Captain (brilliantly portrayed by Jurgen Prochnow) takes his baby-faced crew into harm's way in an effort to do his duty as a German Naval officer, even though his distaste for the High command is evident.    The movie was extremely well made. You really feel like you are inside this cramped 200' long piece of sewer pipe that was home to 50 sailors. The claustrophobia, boredom, lack of hygene, and loneliness all are effectively portrayed. Someone once wrote that being a soldier in wartime was 97% boredom punctuated by 3% of absolute terror. That axiom is evident throughout the film.     The DVD version has enhanced Dolby sound, which makes the depth charge attacks all the more realistic. In one sequence the depth charge attacks are so intense that it seems that the sound alone will destroy the U boat.    Some consider Das Boot an \\"anti-war\\" film. I am not sure that it really falls into that category. It certainly doesn't glorify war, nor does it really offer much commentary on the merits, or lack thereof, of the German war effort. The Officers onboard never really discuss politics, or what the war is about. Their attitude is, rather, that they are there to do a job and that's what they're going to do. Only one officer, a clean shaven die-hard Nazi expresses any real commitment, and he's made fun of by the others.    No, Das Boot is a film about war, and those who are called upon to fight it. It is intense, gripping and moving. You'll never spend $23 for a better DVD.    Walter
B000002WYT|5.0|It's got a few new tracks and some tracks from the old days, good stuff, excellent transition from the small venues to the big time.
0446310786|5.0|I rate this book a 5-star-plus!  I read it for the first time in the 9th grade and have read it two more times since then.  When I read it about 6 months ago at the age of 22, I couldn't believe how exciting it was, even though I already knew what was going to happen.  I think this is a classic and a must read for older students and adults.  Even though it happened in another time and place (for me), it is easy to relate to and offers many life lessons.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|This is not a review of the movie, this is a review of the DVD. If you haven't seen or heard of Ghostbusters before, what are you waiting for?! It's an awesome movie! And this is one cool DVD. I never thought Ghostbusters would get such a lavish treatment for it's DVD release, but here it is.<br />First of all, the film looks so good! Compare it to your VHS copy and you'll see the difference. No more full-frame that cuts off half the picture or a muddy print where you can't see anything, this is in beautiful widescreen with sharp colors abound.<br />And the extras are fantastic. You've got the original theatrical trailer (along with bonus trailers of two other Bill Murray movies), and a few featurettes that are fairly interesting. One is by the special effects crew that worked on the film and they're very informative and seem like a bunch of fun people. You get two documentaries on the film with the actors themselves (one is a short piece that looks as though it was made as an ad for the film's original release, and one is a modern featurette with a weird Dan Aykroyd).<br />There's also a storyboard compare for those that are into that and production photograph gallery. The photos have a tendency to get a little boring and redundant as you flip through them but it's interesting seeing the monsters and logos that didn't make the cut.<br />The deleted scenes are really interesting too, although one can see why they were cut. There are a few gems in there though for the diehard fan. It's really amazing that these scenes were kept for 15 years or so since the films were released and are worth it for just that reason.<br />Last but not least, you've got production notes in subtitle format that can run the entire length of the movie and a commentary with Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman. Not only is this informative, it's done in a cool way, with silhouettes of them in a Mystery Science Theater way. It provides more of a level of fun that a commentary doesn't always have.<br/>Final words: A stellar DVD for fans of the film.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie is fantastic and the dvd has so many features.  It is by far the best dvd ever.
0671799320|5.0|Being on the downstream side of the oil business, my curiousity was piqued by the title.  It was interesting to see the history of the business so well laid out.  I am the third generation in the business and I can verify some of the events mentioned in the book, personally.  All-in-all, a well written book.
B000050FEN|4.0|Seven is the serial killer movie that lingers over every other attempt made since Seven.  This is not so much for the story, which a little too clever and gets a little too shocky for it's own good, this movie created the most oppressive, despair filled world seen in the movies for quite sometime.  Where Blade Runner had pollution and huge overbearing buildings in the future, Seven finds darkness and sickening inner sanctums in the present world.  It's amazing what director David Fincher does with something as simple as an apartment to make it a frankly, disgusting environment.  Morgan Freeman is the lynchpin that holds this whole world together, without him this movie would have failed.  He is the character that the audience can empathize with, and watch with him as the world falls apart around him.  I watch this movie in amazement at just how depressing it is, and how much atmosphere and dread is fit into a 2 hour running time.  Now onto the DVD.  As with all Fincher special editions, it is great.  4 Commentaries, numerous deleted scenes, alternate endings, trailers, behind the scenes, and on and on.  It's overwhelming at first, but there isn't anything about this movie that isn't touched in the dvd.  I love Finchers commentaries, he genuinely seems interested in telling his audience how and why he picked certain set-ups, and how he got the movie made and all of those juicy tidbits you and I have grown to love.  I have grown tired of directors seeming bored and detached as they spout on and on, about the actors and how great they were, and really not saying a whole lot.  Fincher is different, and I appreciate his willingness to do the kind of in-depth stuff he does, because it really does get people to appreciate the movie a lot more.  I have gone way off track.  As you can see, I love this dvd.  The movie has it's flaws, they aren't numerous but they're there.  The DVD however, is a must-buy and a definite for anyones collection.
B000056NX5|5.0|Being a huge fan of musical theatre, I am very picky and like to think I have good taste.  This interpretation is fabulous, in my opinion.  Having read through the other customer reviews, it seems people either love it or hate it.  True, there are some who fall into the &quot;middle&quot; category, but that was generally not the norm. <br />Personally, I think the singing is far better - in fact, this is the best recording I've heard.  Jerome's Judas has an &quot;edgy&quot; quality to his voice, which I like, and I think fits the character.  Glenn's Jesus is wonderful as well - he plays his role with patience, and at times, with frustration (slamming the table in &quot;Argument&quot;).  Some reviewers commented that this was a flaw - like he couldn't make up his mind if he was angry or not.  I think it's wonderful, really.  The whole POINT to JC Superstar is that Christ was HUMAN.  As a human, he is entitled to having tantrums here and there and conflicting emotions.  He also has a beautiful voice, capable of hitting all those high notes.<br />I thought the Nazi costumes were absolutely brilliant!  They are indeed very menacing.  Same goes for the pharisees.<br />True, the movie is very...raw (as ALW put it), but it's also REAL.  A crucifixtion is not a trivial little thing.  It's a bloody, gory mess, and if you want to be true to the facts, it should also be portrayed as such.  I have seen pictures of crucifixtions, figurines, movies, etc... my entire life.  After seeing them with such frequency, it really starts to desensitize you to what a crucifixtion really is.  But this movie really, really, opened my eyes.  It was as if I'd never seen a crucifixtion before in my life.  It was *SO REAL* and really made me think about how us humans *treat* other humans.<br />So, this movie really moved me.  I think the 1973 movie was a bit dated, to say the least.  This version reaches out to younger audiences (like me) who weren't born yet in the early 70's!  I think this movie was a breath of fresh air, and really breathed life into the musical.  It is now, without a doubt, my favorite.
B000002MNR|5.0|I bought this CD over four years ago, shortly after hearing it at a dinner party.  Not only does it personally remind me of a great time, but it has time and again soothed my frazzled nerves after a day at work and fighting traffic.  It contains a variety of music styles (Celtic to Classical to Jazz); sure to please many tastes.  It has become one of my few all time favorites.  I keep hoping for a sequal.
B0000025RI|5.0|An album packed with Rhythm and sounds that goes back to 'Off the Wall' and 'Thriller' but at the same time incorporates ideas that are imaginatively new. This is 'the' most expensive album ever to be made spanning six years of hard work and perfectionism. Michael wrote and produced all but one song ('Cry' - R Kelly) with the help of others - particularly Rodney Jerkins. It is believe that Michael recorded 60 out of 100 songs and choose just 15. The 16th 'Cry' will not be appearing as it was donated to the bereaved families of America for radio play. (God Bless them) <BR>No one can ever predict the 'Pop' industry these days but no matter how many sales, this is probably Michael's best. It has been engineered and made to reach the modern day listener but still holding onto Michael's distinct style and originality with precise sound mixing and studio work which can only reach perfection. <BR>Michael is a man of exceptional ability who deserves absolute respect for what he is there for.<br />The full length 13min 'You Rock My World' video is an unmissable watch. The song it self can take a little getting used too if you are not used to the style, but it is very soon becomes a some what toe tapping - body moving heart thumper, with a bass riff that 'Rocks!', the vocals of which took Michael only one take to record.<BR>As for the rest of the album, well I'll let you find out, but '2000 WATTS!' is very similar. Track 3 - 'Invincible' is a ground breaker that is amazing. The whole album however has a fluency that has been carefully mastered and refined...
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Lord, the 203 reviews should tell you something! After sifting through all the hype, you'll probably find most of the praise effusively verbose. I found most of the one star reviews to be whiny, arrogant and generally lacking in insight.<br />Take it from me (a reluctant Dylan fan) this is a terrific album. But I like the blown out vocals and Southern gothic imagry. I also find the Tin Pan Alley/Vaudeville trappings of &quot;Bye And Bye&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Po'Boy&quot; to be more evocative of Hoagy Carmichael than Leon Redbone. To me they're generous helpings of Dylan's playful side, not seen much since NASHVILLE SKYLINE.<br />Picking up right where TIME OUT OF MIND left off, the new found vitality is still there. In my humble opinion, this record keeps up the same energy and focus he exhibited all those years ago on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS. But with an opening title like, &quot;Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum&quot; I was worried that I might have another RED SKY on my hands. Listening to the lyrics, I soon realized this was not the case. It's just as menacing as anything off TIME OUT OF MIND. The second cut, &quot;Mississippi&quot; is a gem of an outtake from it and I was glad he found a home for it here.   <br />To me this record is all about that old adage, &quot;amateurs borrow, professionals steal&quot;. Tunes like &quot;Highwater&quot; and &quot;Floater&quot; go to show that he's lovingly stealing from the hands that fed him all these years. Echoes of Blind Willie McTell and Charley Patton abound as he coughs up a guided tour of the Old South complete with bootleg whiskey, boarding houses and moonlight serenades.  <br />A major stand out for me is &quot;HIGH WATER&quot;. Larry Campbell's driving banjo and Dave Kemper's crashing symbols come on like a flash flood crashing down. With tunes like this, it's hard to take the band for granted. <br /> True, Dylan's always stolen from the past but as far as I'm concerned, LOVE &amp; THEFT goes to show hecertainly isn't living in it. Maybe, all those years of constant touring haven't shaken his aim, so much as steadied it.

B00005BJ9W|5.0|Easily one of my favorite CD's from my favorite rock `n roll decade, Rio holds up well, even after many hit CD's from the 80's grow tiresome and hollow. Songs like \\"Hold Back the Rain\\" and \\"The Chauffeur\\" prove the versatility of Double D's music and Simon LeBon's voice. Of course, \\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" \\"Save A Prayer,\\" and the title track helped cement the band's reputation as radio favorites and MTV darlings, but I love all the songs here. I also must say that, before \\"New Religion,\\" I had never heard a song that uses two different choruses simultaneously.
B000002BFL|4.0|Supposedly, Bruce Springsteen based the title of this stark connection of acoustic songs on John Steinbeck's Okie farmer/idealist from 'The Grapes Of Wrath&quot;---but I can't help but to think that it was every bit as much Kurt Cobain's ghost that haunts his 13th album as that of Mr. Joad. Whether in his punk seperatism he realized it or not, Cobain batteled the same pressures Springsteen's battled throughout HIS career---and I think Bruce knew it and was pulling for him---so much so that Cobain's heroin-overdose death---a year before this album's release---probably affected him at least as much as Neil Young, who found one of his most famous lyrics---&quot;It's better to burn out than fade away&quot;---quoted in Cobain's sucide note. In fact, one could read the title track's standout lyric &quot;The highway is alive tonight/But nobody's kiddin' nobody 'bout where it goes&quot; as an answer to Young's lyric. And the stories told here---of the forgotten and dispossed in America---set in California, a state that's one hell of a lot closer to Cobain's Washington State than Springsteen's Garden State of New Jersey--were metaphors for Cobain's despair---none more so than the sarcastic album closer, &quot;My Best Was Never Good Enough,&quot; which might have been the last words Kurt said to Courtney Love---or what Bruce said to HIS wife after Cobain killed himself....

6305013578|1.0|When I first found out that Metropolis had been produced in DVD I was thrilled. When I played it, I was disappointed to say the least.<br />I had expected the DVD would be of the American release of the 80's (two thumbs-up from Siskel & Ebert) with the rock music score (which it was not) but the quality of the video is the real disappointment  --  it would have to improve to be poor  --  unwatchable when compared to the copy of a copy of a tape I already had.<br />I should have read the other reviews before purchasing. I now have a shiny... beer coaster.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Simply put this memory card has tons of space to store several different games. It is a marked improvement from the PS1 Memory card, which had very limited storage space, 15 spots, some games required 2 to 5 for storage which meant your PS1 memory card got filled up fast.<br />I've had my memory card for several months now and its still a long way from being halfway filled. I am so glad they created this card so much bigger than it's predecessor. I always hated switching memory cards for different games, now I don't have to.<br />(Beware of 3rd party peripherals for the PS2, their quality is always much less than Sony products)
B00005N9CV|3.0|I have four of Diana Krall's albums and thought her &quot;When I look in your eyes&quot; was MORE than deserving of a Grammy win. A truely astonishing singer, Krall ranks way up there. Butttttt, I was disappointed in this CD.  That is not to say this is a CD with no redeeming music - it is simply inferior to her previous CD. I found three things on this CD especially disappointing: One, virtually all of the songs are melancholy - how they chose to load this with so much sadness is beyond me. If you're even close to having a bad day, don't put this baby on - you'll end up tossing yourself through the window. Second, her rendition of Besame Mucho clearly sounds like an American TRYING to sing a latin song . . .. it loses something to hear an American singing in Spanish.  Third, Krall has some superior muscians - outstanding guitarists, bassists, keyboards, drums . . . To add a symphony loses that intimate jazz sound. A good CD worth getting but be prepared to continue giving more air time to her previous CD.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I really loved this movie, although once it ends it leaves you wondering what was that all about.  But if you just stop and think about it for a few minuets it should come to you.  Ive seen in some of the other reviews that some people didnt like the fact that there was no clear cut &quot;bad guy&quot; or &quot;good guy&quot; in the movie, but I think that is what makes the movie so great.  I mean think about real life, most of us are neither bad nor good, just somewhere in that grey area of both. And thats how it is in the movie, yes some of the people do bad things, and you hate them for that, but then, they do somting good, and you forgive them, isnt that how it works in real life??  I really love anime, and after I saw this movie, I loved it even more. This movie is really worth it too see.

6305657947|3.0|I think, first of all, that &quot;old Bolingbroke&quot; should stick to a review and refrain from criticizing fellow reviewers. Details do matter in filmmaking, and if I read &quot;Bolingbroke's&quot; biography right, I doubt he would appreciate playing fast and loose with his faves.<br />That said, I was diappointed with this movie. It had some nifty spots, but not a lot of emotional punch. Renee Russo getting all gooshy over the Thomas Crowne character was hard to understand, given that she was introduced as a sexy, confident woman.<br />A movie about intrigue should have some intrigue, and a movie about art theft (and how clever one can be) should be a lot more realistic.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I love this movie, it's funny, but it's also poignent, and based on Roberto Benigni's father's experiences in a concentration camp. If you liked this movie you should check out Robert Benigni's other films, Johnny Stecchino is absolutely hysterical, you must see that film if you liked this one.
B00000K19E|4.0|Mr. David Jones rated this movie as a chilly excitement for the masses... sorry, I disagree. The message behind the script is not just an &quot;idea&quot;, but a deep critic to the modern western society. The tremendous value of this &quot;chilly&quot; kick and hit movie is that such a message is not just said... you can actually feel it.

B00001NFCY|5.0|This is the first piece of modern music that I have listened to and enjoyed in a very long time. My exposure to Creed was the song \\"What's this life for?\\"  After doing a little research, I learned more about the band and both of it's albums.  They are both excellent. <br />The three hits \\"Higher\\", \\"With arms wide open\\" and \\"Are you ready?\\" are not the only good songs from this album.  Others like  \\"Faceless man\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" are every bit as good and you hear them alot less often.  <br />... One, I personally never listened to these other bands which tells you it took Creed to introduce me to this newer rock sound.  Two, anyone that says any 'new' band has truly got their own sound is ignoring the fact that it's all been done before. Musicians and bands become the inspiration for the newer, younger bands being formed. That is not a bad thing, it's just a fact.  <br />I anxiously look forward to the release of their next album.
6303168507|5.0|When I heard &quot;Jews Town&quot; without even knowing about the existence of &quot;The Schindler's List&quot;, I got terribly sad, totally disarmed. The music by it self transmitted to me the exact feeling that the movie did later, when I finally watched it.<br />This film tell us a very sad story, that unfortunately is part of the human History. But it tells the horror in a very delicate manner. This film is poetry and history at the same time. If you are ready to cry with dignity, don't miss this master piece.
B00005N9CV|2.0|'Steppin Out' is by far my favorite Diana Krall album -- the vocals are not quite as polished as in later releases, but the piano work is superb and the song selections are mostly up-tempo. With each successive release she seems to be moving further from the strengths that make 'Steppin Out' such a success. <BR>On 'The Look of Love' Diana's vocals are out front -- not a bad thing, of course, but the piano work takes a backseat and appears mostly as single-note-at-a-time filigree. The orchestral arrangements are evocative of bad pop music from the 1960s and 70s. All of the songs would sound better in classic jazz trio format -- with a more prominent piano part, of course. <BR>In all, I found this work to be a big disappointment. <BR>I am going to one of Diana's concerts in December and hope to hear more of the early stuff. I'll take a 'Frim Fram Sauce' over any of her more recent recordings....
0064407667|1.0|I checked this book out of the library because I'd read a lot of good reviews on it but still didn't want to spend nine bucks to buy it.  It was one of the best decisions I've ever made!  Though the Baudelaire children do not display any charisma (they are slow and dim-witted), Snicket nevertheless pulls readers in by making us care for them because they are poor orphans.  This is a clever ploy by Snicket, because I wanted to finish the book to see if the Baudelaires ever do become happy.  But true to form, they do not.  Even more slow and dim-witted than the Baudelaire children are the adults around them, who realize too late that the menacing Count Olaf is evil.  This book is frustrating to read because all of the characters are so bumbling and stupid.  Unless you like to read books about children who are in an endless circle of misery and are too dumb to get themselves out of it for longer than five minutes, do not read this book.
630542845X|5.0|I read the cons of this movie and was pleasantly surprised to find that there were no gay overtones to this movie. I feel sorry for the poor fool who saw some in it. It was a brilliantly written and produced film with gifted actors to portray compasionate people. What is more science fiction that the fact that there is a compasionate side to humans.<BR>Sean Patrick Flannery did an outstanding job as Powder.I wonder how if felt to play that part. He did an excellant job.
0440539811|3.0|The childish, one-dimensional take on civilization was written badly enough to make me laugh. I recommended it to my friends for the humor. Unfortunately, there are people, like the authors, who take it a bit more seriously than I do (or do they)?Generally, people whose minds are blown by this sort of thing know beforehand what direction they want to be blown towards. <br />The book's predictable conceptual framework of unnecessarily associated dualities such as order and chaos with slavery and freedom, woman and man with biology and society, et cetera.. and the silly Freudian psychology.. were limiting and frustrating crutches that could not compensate for the lack of coherence. It was sad to see such an interesting topic diluted by Wilson's dull portrayal of stereotyped worldviews. <br />It's also sad to know that reasonably intelligent people who could be out there doing something to solve real problems are sitting around fantasizing about fnords. Books like this are comforting to people who want to believe in the power of human intelligence. However, the philosophy in this never gets beyond the musings of an average college kid on acid. Could this explain Illuminatus's popularity? Nevertheless, it was worth the laughs. For a more serious version of the trippy metanovel, try something by Pynchon (who, by the way, Illuminatus! copies from)

0375430563|5.0|Bryson's book In a Sunburned Country is great. Bryson travels on his four Australian journeys, where he travels from Sydney through Perth and up around the boomerang coast, Sydney up through Cairns, Darwin to Alice Springs and Sydney through Adelaide, to Melbourne. He shows how different, same, and all around interesting Australia is compared to other countries. Like how Sydney isn't special it's just like any other major metropolitan city, but Canberra is like a huge park with buildings, and Adelaide is like Portland, Oregon, U.S.A. full of parks. He talks all about perils, dangers, and events in Australia and it's history and how they react (or more often don't react) like the fact that Australia's prime minister was at the beach and just disappeared and no one saw him ever again. The fact that Australia has the five most dangerous animals in the world and it doesn't really matter much to people. Those included his great ponderings about why the box jellyfish uses a tentacle with poison powerful enough to kill three humans when it eats shrimp, and that isn't the half of it. Bryson's evenings are spent drinking and chatting in the hotel's bar, (or just drinking). In his cynical ways he makes use of boredom to comment and tell about plain things that are very amusing and delightful to people from other countries. Bryson looks up strange names in the phone book (like tittybong), reads the newspaper and comments about it, scares his friend and he also walks 6-7 miles and is still happy even with a sunburn that makes his face tomato red because he saw an example of one of the two echinoderm species in the world. I give this book five stars.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is nothing short of amazing. Every track on here was very well done, and very original. They are all very different, but they all share the poetry and creativity of Billy Corgan, and the mad instrument skills of the rest of the band. &quot;Mayonaise&quot; is my favorite song on there. It really shows the beauty that rock music can bring. This album is, and has been for a long time, my favorite album ever. If you want 1 album from The Smashing Pumpkins, get this one. This was Billy in his purest form.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Track by track review<BR>Hotdog- 1 out of 5 funny the first time but come on saying 'f word' 40 times is not music is it?<BR>My Generation- 4 out of 5 I like this good guitars and dj is good at the end, but lyrics are average.<BR>Full Nelson 4 out of 5 I like this to, better lyrics than my generation but the guitar aint as good very good start to the album so far.<BR>My Way- 3 out of 5 You have heard it make up your own mind!<BR>Rollin- 4 out of 5 Same as above!<BR>Livin it Up- 3 out of 5 Good lyrics and guitar but not enough depth.<BR>The One- 5 out of 5 This is very good slower than rest but you can relate to this song. Very good lyrics and a very well thought out song.<BR>Getcha Groove On- 2 out 5 I like meth and redman but i do not like x to the z man.  good beat but gets boring.<BR>Take a look around- 4 out of 5 Another catchy tune with good guitars and Freds same old lyrics but i do like it.<BR>It will be ok- 3 out of 5 I am not a fan of this one but i know lots of people are and i just do not get it!<br />Boiler- 5 out of 5 The new song and a very good choice my fav on the album just a really good song with ace lyrics.<BR>Hold On- 3 out of 5 Again like 'It will be ok' i just do not get this track but lots of people do so there.<BR>Rollin Remix- 4 out of 5 Method Man Redman DMX you just know its goin to be good and it does not disappoint.  Dj lays down the beat but it sounds like DMX could of given him a helpin hand.  One thing Meth and Red do blow Fred away with their skills.<br />Overall if you have bought this album and liked it and have not got sighificant other wot are u doin get it now.  Dont listen to the people sayin limp bizkit have sold out just wait for boiler to be realeased and if you like that just buy this album.
B000003N89|5.0|Oh, you're going to love this one!  No a bad track on the entire CD.  Ms. Krall has such wonderful talent at both vocals and piano that makes you want to listen over and over again.  Even my fourteen-year-old has a big infectious smile on her face everytime the FRIM FRAM SAUCE starts up. A total joy that makes your whole day better...
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is one of the best movies, I've ever seen.  It's about time it's on DVD.
B00000634L|3.0|Drinking In L.A was such a good track, i heard it months before the single was released and it took me a long time to find out who sang it. I then proceeded immediately to buy the album and guess what- i was very disappointed. Why? well because i was expecting more of the same and when i didn't hear it i immediately dismissed it as rubbish. Where i differed from the people who completly dismissed it was that i tried listening to it again while putting my expectations for a Drinking in LA-esqe album aside. <br /> Guess what, i was pleasantly suprised. I found 'Forest' and 'Rainshine' amazing, these tracks like most of this album are very diverse but i found most of the other tracks to be mediocre, while some verged on the unlistenable. <br /> In conclusion a decent album which includes a trio of gems which i recommend you to borrow or to buy at a reduced price.
B000021Y74|5.0|This film is unique, energetic, exciting, and enthralling.  It presents a deep viewpoint in an outrageous way.  The film is about a woman who, in an attempt to save her boyfriend's life, runs around trying to find alot of money.  When I heard this description, I was a little hesitant about the quality of the film; when I say it though, I was amazed.  The themes and situations that occur are truly unique.  I would definitely recommend this film
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is a momentous film, anime or otherwise. It provides deep insight into a possible future of the Human race and it is extremely cleverly written. Anyone who doesn't like this film clearly didn't understand it. Both the animation and the story are out of this world and the music is great too! The ONLY downside to this film is that it was based on a Manga (Comic Book) and a lot of the story from the Manga hasn't made it into the film, so unless you're very quick on the uptake you may have to watch the film at least twice to understand it fully. <BR> A great film, buy it now!
B000002HD5|5.0|The Afghan Whigs, in my opinion one of the best bands ever, are a taste that the public didn't seem to fall in love with, but have a fierce cult following and for good reason. <br />Gentleman is my favorite cd of theirs, though all are exceptionally good especially 1965 and Black Love as well as the Honky's ladder EP. <br />Every song on Gentleman is great. Dulli's sultry voice is the perfect vehicle to launch his tales of lies and love betrayed. Revel. If you don't have it, you must get it as soon as possible, believe me the Whigs sound is irrestible.
B00004W510|5.0|I have always loved the music of The Band, and this album is one of my favourites, not only of theirs, but of all the classic albums I own. They were truly a terrific group of singer/songwriters/musicians. This is how a band should be. And this reissued, remastered edition is fantastic. The sound is perfect, and the inclusion of no less than 7 bonus tracks makes this a must-have, even for those people who are still clinging to the original. (I wish the Eric Clapton remasters had come with some nice extras like bonus tracks and a good booklet like The Band's remasters have). With this album, comes a 16 page booklet with tons of photos and a very interesting essay on the group and this album. Highly recommended!
0684869713|5.0|This book is truly a great one, but you really have to attentive and persistent to &quot;get&quot; it all and get through it.  I especially had trouble staying focused for the first 200 pages (paperback).<br />One the book does take off, it is a rewarding ride, a thought-provoking journey through a time in America when things were vastly different (but - in so many ways the same?).  Especially interesting is some of dialogue surrounding freedom of the individual vs. the perceived primacy of the masses, enhanced even more so given the backdrop of our events of 9/11/01 in the USA (GBA!!!!).  Some of the dialogue is downright eerie in this context, and it almost seems that you could peel some of it out and use it as an editorial without it seeming anachronistic at all.<br />Overall, a great read, and absolutely worth it if you can spare the time.
0140157352|5.0|Simply the very best for the foundations for every type of negotiation. Great book!
B00005JKES|4.0|To echo the sentiments of my fellow reviewers, I gotta say its a complete DISCRACE to release this first part WITHOUT the pilot... In saying that, the series is simply steller! If indeed it is the case that David Lynch himslef has some control over releasing the series in this format, minus the pilot - I would have to say - &quot;...SELLOUT...&quot; I'll be buying this edition, but with a large degree of distaste! ...
B000002UAU|5.0|Even though this album was in the shops since 1967,you can still listern to it.I would recomend you listern to &quot;A day in the life&quot;
B000059RL3|3.0|The sound clips for listening to samples for this great collection of songs does not do the album justice. The clips are on the avg. of 15 seconds, it would be nice to hear a minute or two, or the whole thing honestly. Just enough of a taste to tantalize the listener but not satisfy them, must be the best way to suck people in to buying CDs etc. without hearing too much. Sad, Amazon lenghten your sound clips !!
0792844890|4.0|The movie Is already only a 4 so I didn't take any points away for the crummy commentary. Its really the worst commentary track I have ever heard, he adds very little to the movie, while he spends alot of time laughing at this own jokes, and repeating random lines without commetn, and again laughing. Every once in a while he starts talking about an actor or someoyd, but it usually ends up being a bunch of nonsense ending with, &quot;he is really a great actor..etc. I hope he is doing well&quot;. No great insights, nothing new to learn about this movie, just lots of random stories about people you won't care about, lots of laughing, and mel brook repeating lines for no reason. <br />The commentary is nearly impossible to watch.
B00005OAIE|5.0|There's no justice in this world if John Mayer doesn't make it big.  It's worth the price of this CD just to hear him play guitar.  His songs are terrific - wonderful melodies and lyrics that are witty, complex and always intelligent. I had the opportunity to see him perform live at a small, smokey venue in Cleveland recently and I was just blown away.  This kid has talent jumping out of his pores. You should buy this CD just so that you can count yourself as one of his first fans.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is a great return to form.  The album is very heavy yet melodic.  Like somewhere in time the band here entered a very experimental period, songs such as &quot;dream of mirrors&quot; prove this as none of the other albums would suitably accomodate some of the songs on offer.  What one must consider when buying this is that this a new type of Iron Maiden (three guitarists, etc.)  The album does have many great songs (the wicker man, ghost of the navigator and dream of mirrors being awesome!) While it is not as good as &quot;number of the beast&quot;, &quot;powerslave&quot; and &quot;seventh son of a seventh son&quot; it is still a great album to own.  Some of the songs could have been cut down a little (dream of mirrors, nomad and thin line... could have all had two minute edited off them!) still this is a great attempt to ressurrect the maiden name and after awful albums like &quot;no prayer for the dying&quot;, &quot;the X factor&quot; and &quot;Virtual XI&quot; this a masterpiece.  On the whole I liked it and while it is not always in my cd player like seventh son or number of the beast it is still a worthy addition to the brand.  The difference in stylle makes it effective, however three guitarists certainly is not required!  Get rid of Janick Gers and the classic maiden line up is back!  Hopefully like after somewhere in time another true classic shall emerge...
B00005N5S5|4.0|This special Edition isn't full with high tech special features but the story boards are cool and original beginnings (screen story). I waited 17 years to own a copy the story. A Classic, in that It blends Sci Fi with a feel of creepiness; like the Old Outer Limits Episodes or 'Things to Come'.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I bought this album on the same day as the WTC disaster and i mean spooked dosn't come close to covering what i felt listening to this just after it had happened. This album seemed almost prophetic. Musically though this is amazing throughout and Thom Yorke features on three tracks so what other reason do you want for buying it. This album is hopefully to PJ what The Bends was to Radiohead. This is certainly one of the best album's of the year so far. PJ manages to maintain her raw edge on this album despite the more melodic feel to the album. A must have for any collection.
B000001IPL|5.0|Ahh yes &quot;Smash&quot; the Offspring album that produced such classics as &quot;Nitro(Youth Energy)&quot;, &quot;Gotta get away&quot;, &quot;Genocide&quot;, &quot;Come out and play&quot; &amp; &quot;Killboy Powerhead&quot;.  Anybody who owns &quot;Americana&quot;, and wants to see the real Offspring should really pick this one up.  From the hilarious introduction &quot;Time to relax&quot; all the way up to the ending track &quot;Smash&quot; this album pushes the envelope.
B00005B4GU|5.0|After years of waiting, radiohead head came, as the sound crashed into my ears, i realised i love radiohead get off my case. Okay so it dosn't quite go like that but you know what i mean. If you're reading this and your not yet a fan you've been looking in the wrong place. This album to me is almost Kid A meets OK Computer meets some form of musical utopia. Pyramid song is the best thing radiohead or any one else have ever made. Trust Thom Yorke to come up with something as heavenly as this. 'We all went to heaven in our little row boats' I just pictured my soul rowing accross an ocean to where souls go, Radiohead heaven. 'nothing to fear nothing to doubt' just sums this up perfectly. I might be wrong, Thom and irony at it's best again death is mentioned a recurring theme on this album. This album is certainly not the death of Radiohead. If you appreciate immense talent and glorious music buy this and feel as LUCKY as i do to own it. This album is so consistently good throughout i couldn't believe it. Not as avant garde' as Kid A in places but more so in others. Unbelievably luminous. This is not KID Amnesiac it is so much more. Album of the year 2001.
B00005MP58|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend after considerable difficulty finding it. I usually find period peices boring, but started paying attention upon her insistence. To make a long story short, we were up until six in the morning watching all 5 hours in one sitting. It pulls you in. Very cool.
B000056K04|4.0|I've been a fan of the DMB since well before most people had ever heard of them.  I've been to 11 shows, I've got countless hours of shows on tape, and they're always going to be one of my favorite bands.  However, even though I like Everyday, it's just not &quot;true&quot; DMB.  Personally, I blame Ballard, but who am I to judge?  Obviously, the band must have liked this album, but maybe they enjoyed the fact that it wasn't going to drive you to suicide like Lillywhite's seemed ready to.  In any case, I'm not sad that I missed this tour.  While Everyday has some stuff really worth listening too, most of it is dreck.  This album just doesn't work like the others...even the live versions of these songs don't grab you like the older stuff.  No jams, not even a place to build one, and all very radio-ready.<br />Speaking of which, it used to be said that there were old DMB fans and new (radio) fans.  Sadly, I think Dave &amp; Co. finally succumbed to the radio mentality, which is &quot;have a radio hit, be a success.&quot;  They were already there, which makes this redirection even more tragic.  Perhaps this &quot;failure&quot; will make them realize that you don't have to be popular to be good...you just have to be GOOD.
0767020308|4.0|My girfriend love this. A must for any Austen fan, and much better thatn Gwenyth's Emma, I'm told. I find it boring, but I liked Pride and Prejudice.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I can never say enough good things about &quot;teacher&quot; movies.  Dead Poets Society, Stand and Deliver, Hoosiers, etc. are all fantastic at what they do.  But Finding Forrester took such a different direction that even I ran short on good things to say.  To have the real teacher be the bad guy, and to have the students (both old and young) save the day in such a non-formulaic manner...THAT'S the essence of good film.<br />On top of it all, this film has it's educational qualities, too.  Dead Poets didn't teach you anything superbly literary, nor did Stand and Deliver teach you calculus.  This film, however, is a classroom unto itself.  While Forrester does not go into massive detail, there is enough here to teach with.  The movie goes a long way in showing that writing is not a gift, but a practised art.  One does not pop out good words in a moment, nor can everyone write successfully (by this I mean something people OTHER than your mother will read).  You don't become good overnight, and you're a damn fool to think so (eh, Prof. Crawford?)  Finally, this film shows the most important aspect of  its art, which other teacher films have not always hit as well as they hoped: If you want to go somewhere with your talent, just get out there and go, no matter how difficult the journey may actually be.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden's new album is definitely great. I won't listen to any other opinions. It's great. It rocks! Iron Maiden is the same heavy quality British metal. Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith are back and Iron Maiden became sextet and rocks till hell and the heavens.<br />Iron Maiden in &quot;Brave New World&quot; continues the sound tradition that has developed since &quot;The X Factor&quot;, marked by heart-piercing guitar solos and clear loud drums and cymbals. Vocals of Bruce Dickinson are, as always, great. Thankfully, Bruce Dickinson has got rid of the rasping and growling vocal type that was in &quot;No Prayer For The Dying&quot; and &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;. He is back to his strong, clean and high vocal range.<br />Conceptually, as you may have noticed, &quot;Brave New World&quot; is similar to &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot;. The lyrical mood tends to be in close relations with that album, which is great, no doubt. The lyrics of &quot;Brave New World&quot; are about wandering in search of something, anger towards this cruel world, despair of song heroes, mood of loneliness, thoughts of the question of life, love and death.<br />The title &quot;Brave New World&quot; is like a sarcasm thrown to the world of the 21st century. Brave new world that sweeps people into the height and throws others into the bottom.<br />Anyway, enough of this philosophic review. &quot;Brave New World&quot; is great. It rocks! Up the irons!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I own many punk/hardcore/hard rock albums, but this is the only one that gets me pumped everytime I put it in.  There's a certain realness and passion here that's not found in todays commercialized hard music world.  Tracks like &quot;Sleepwalk Capsules&quot; and &quot;Cosmonaut&quot; are amazing.  This is some of the most unique and fresh music around, but it also is closer to the original punk rock spirit than all of the Green Day clones around.  The guitars and vocals are adventurous and hard hitting, and these songs are very textured and well developed.  Every song is very catchy, but they aren't so hook-ridden that you're left with a sugary taste in your mouth.  This cd takes a few listens to &quot;get&quot;, but once it hits you, you'll realize that this is an amazing album.
B000002B82|4.0|AFter the glam-oriented NO REST for the Wicked, came NO MORE TEARS. What a masterpiece. Punching, melodic, great lyrics, great guitar work by Wylde, great vocals ( the last time Ozzy vocals seemed fine).
B00004XONN|3.0|First id like to point out i am a huge Radiohead fan. I have been listening and loving them since \\"Pablo Honey\\" came out. Kid A is...this is very hard for me to say...not that great. Now it hurts me to say a cd made by my favorite band isn't good, but what i see alo tof is Radiohead fans like myself who jus like the music because it's Radiohead. THey could record 2 cats fighting, slap radiohead on the cd and there would be HUNDREDS of 5 star ratings. Personally my favorite cd is \\"The Bends\\". One of my fav albums of all time. Everything i loved about Radiohead was taken away from me. The guitars, the drums, the beat. And replaced with electronic ... that jus gives me a headache listening to. I admit there are a few songs i love, (Hence the 3 stars) but overall this is a band trying too hard to be different. And in the proccess taking away everything i loved about them. If you are a Radiohead junkie(like myself) go out and buy this cd(like you havent yet =P). Otherwise if you're new to radiohead buy \\"he Bends\\" then move to \\"OKComputer\\".  Radiohead is still the best band out there.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Well... unfortunately the much hyped &quot;Episode I&quot; did not live up to my expectations. I was expecting some amazing sci-fi action, and the classic good storytelling of George Lucas. Instead, Episode I is a mass marketed exploited fest of fake digital effects and weak storyline. In short... the story was no longer written to be a good story, but it was written to be a money making film (A lot of money).<br />Hopefully Episode II will be better.
B00005N5S5|3.0|I don't understand who is in charge of soundtracks for DVD's.  I just finished watching Dead Presidents and it has one of the best soundtracks I heard in terms of bass, spaciial sound and rear surround.  So here is this special edition and the sound is barely audible.  Dead presidents was made in 1995 and sounds better than half the DVD's I own made in 2000!  I would think a special edition would be special.  The movie, picture and specials are fantastic but I bet all will be dissappointed with the audio
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer..what can I say? One of those albums where nothing is wrong..there are few of those..Besides this album is like a lot of years ahead...first i thought i would write about each of the 12 songs..but then i thought that it would be better if you download a song and listen to it. any song..and you won't be disappointed.. you'll probably order ok computer after that...thanks..
B000000WJZ|5.0|Most people who recognize the name smashing pumpkins but are not fans immediately equate them with the irritating screaming whine of the lead singer billy corgan. I admit I too had such thoughts, however with some coercing from a friend and a newly opened mind I gave the band a chance. <br />The key is this, listen to what is going on behind the lead singer. Turn to \\"mayonaise\\" (with headphones on preferably),  sit back, and listen to everything that is happening. If compelled to, listen again and I guarantee you will find twice as much hidden there. Pick any given song and try and individually pick out instraments. You will soon come to realize that every single member of this band, every single layer is full of heart soul and incredably skillful playing. <br />As an album this is the first smashing pumpkins album I suggest you get. It has some good singles (today and disarm) as well as incredably soft and sweet songs (such as spaceboy and luna). If you take the time to listen to the whole album from front to back, you will realize there is not one bad song within the 13 tracks.<br />If you are able to listen to the album in relation to the entire band and the songs in their entirety, perhaps you will come to realize that the lead singer's voice isn't really annoying. You may realize as I did that it is actually very fitting, and belongs there in the same way as every other instrument in these layered songs.<br />I urge you to look past the surface of this band and really give them a chance. This band has the power to touch people in ways that most bands don't even take the time to try.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Thats all I can say!  Very, very funny.  Lots of adult humor that the kids will laugh at because you are laughing.  Overall great movie!
B000021YQV|5.0|this cd represents the future of what metal will sound like. screw everybody that says, &quot;chop suey is the best song!&quot; true, its a great single, but theres a lot more to system of down than its singles.  get this and their old self-titled album.  other albums to check out slipknot iowa, staticx wisconsin death trip, and mudvayne LD 50.
B00005MAM2|5.0|i never saw this when i was a kid. i grew up on robotech though, and i must say that i am impressed with this story. it has all the great qualities of japanese animation and story.
B00005N9CV|4.0|The last time we met on these pages to discuss jazz singer/musician Diana Krall it was the summer of 99 and we talked about her newest release \\"When I Look in Your Eyes.\\"<BR>I return now to review her latest CD \\"The Look of Love\\" with the enthusiasm of a young boy who just learned for himself what love was all about. You know the feeling: that first kiss, that double beat of your heart when you're in the presence of that certain someone. Listening to Krall dish out tunes such as \\"I Remember You,\\" \\"Cry Me A River\\" and the title song \\"Look Of Love\\" puts me in that same mood.<BR>Although the jazz songstress doesn't offer anything new to the compositions, we don't expect her to. We expect her one-of-a-kind style with her soft, sensual voice rolling over the lyrics of these standards like the second hand of a Swiss watch gliding gracefully from second to second.<BR>Time passes smoothly listening to Krall's intimate style that fits well with Claus Ogerman's no frills arrangements and the backing of two symphony orchestras - the Long Symphony and the Los Angeles Session. <BR>On \\"When I Look in Your Eyes\\" Krall augmented her songs from a standard piano trio format to a quartet with orchestrations. The Johnny Mandel backgrounds proved a great catalyst for her blazing contra-alto vocals, even enhancing a brilliant rhythm section. <BR>That sound is maintained in \\"Look Of Love.\\" As she reportedly said at a recent performance: \\"We worked really hard on making sure all the parts fit together correctly. Really it's a jazz group improvising as usual - the strings are just considered another instrument.\\" <BR>Yes, it all fits well together on \\"Look Of Love.\\"
014028009X|5.0|I read this as light reading over the summer, and read it again, then again.  This was a very non-threatening book--not very long, no lengthy paragraphs, no large odd-sounding words (except for occassional British terminology)--and I picked it up randomly off of a library shelf.  When I read it, and found out that it had been made into a movie, I just had to go see it.<BR>Of course it wasn't as good.  But it was good.<br />I was also an avid Jane Austen fan, and the frequent overt references to Pride and Prejudice were funny and good at tying the plot together and giving a better perspective of what the author wanted the characters to seem like.  I'm not quite sure about this cover...a little scary (the one I read had a woman writing in a diary on it).<br />Anyway, the heroine, Bridget Jones, is a British woman feeling her biological clock tick--and feeling others feeling that tick for her.  Her garulous mother and Smug Married acquaintences persist on ribbing her for not having a boyfriend, and don't even believe her when she finally gets one.<BR>Bridget is drawn to her attractive yet irresponsible employer, Daniel Cleaver, and finds herself constantly bumping into Mark Darcy (get the name hint at all??), the dull divorcee barister that everyone is trying to shaft upon her.<br />Think Ally McBeal and some of Meg Ryan's more neurotic roles.  Bridget Jones is a normal, healthy woman obsessed with her weight, smoking and drinking habits, and self-help books.  Social satire and hilarious situations abound.<br />(it's much, much better than this review, I assure you:)
6304708521|4.0|Everyone loves to trash this movie. But like Paul says, he defends this film because of the music videos of the Beatles playing songs that are absolutely some of the best rock to have ever been recorded. DO you want to see a video of I AM THE WALRUS, then step right up. What about the Bonzo Dog Band doing DEATH CAB FOR CUTTIE? Then here you go. I have the DVD, and let me tell you, that is the ONLY way to go, if you want to own this. That way, you dont have to watch the whole movie, if you just want to enjoy the music. And it is worth the $$ just for the videos, really. Also, there are a few cool newsreels tacked on for bonus footage, and a little essay about the Magical Mystery Tour film's history. (Did you know that they were going to release this as a full length feature film? Were they tripping?) For years, this film was not available, and BEATLES fans, who were not old enough to see it in 1967, had to contend to hearing second hand from hippies, about what the film was like. WEll, now you dont need some burn out trying to remember their mescaline trip, to discover what the film was about. Now, if NEMS would only release LET IT BE, life would be complete, eh? Go ahead and buy this. Compared with some of the rock musicals out now, it's a no-brainer that the BEATLES stab at independant film, is GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME.
B000002JS6|5.0|When I'm writing a song, I'm trying to capture a single image or emotion and transfer that to the listener. Because I have a limit of only a few minutes and a few words, that concept must be simple. Another rule is that I usually don't want to describe the idea directly; I want to talk around it, to allude to it. The audience has to be able to make some contribution to the act of creation, and using too-literal lyrics defies that. You don't sing, \\"I had sex with her and I really enjoyed it\\"; you sing, \\"The walls were shakin', the earth was quakin', my mind was achin', and we were makin' it, and you...shook me all night long\\"!    I don't really think about it in such detail. I just rely on an instinct of what will work and what won't. The boys in AC/DC are quite aware of what they are aiming for, and their instincts in this regard are sensational.    On this album, AC/DC has captured and perfectly transmitted the idea of MASCULINITY. It's a man's record full of men's images and urges. Rock 'n' roll is basically a man howling about his desires, and he often desires women, liquor, and guitars that sound like sheets of metal being destroyed by power tools. It's a very simple thing, really.    Normally, live music loses its edge in the recording process, becoming more bland. To combat this, producers try to enrich the sound with effects like reverberation (echoes that create a sense of space), chorus (modulating the pitch to make the instrument or voice sound thicker) and equalization (boosting or cutting certain high or low frequencies). The equipment used to do this changes from year to year, and therefore the more effects are used, the more the recording sounds 'dated.' Reverb machines from the early 70's had a very different sound from those used in the 80's, or 90's, for example.    Back In Black has very simple production, with almost no discernible effects. But it isn't bland. It's savage in the intensity of its tone. How did they do that? (Gibson now produces a model of guitar pickup named after Angus Young. I'll be buying a pair.)    Angus and Malcolm Young have created a lot of the catchiest guitar phrases in the entire body of rock music. Their masterpiece is the collection of gut-wrenching licks on the title song here. These will achieve timelessness because the average guitar player can learn to reproduce them--but never with the Angus touch.
B00001NFCY|2.0|I am a big fan of My Own Prison, which I thought was one of the better CD's to hit the mainstream in quite some time when it burst out.  Human Clay, however, just seems like a conscious attempt to turn the attention they earned into a cash machine.  It obviously worked, as Human Clay has sold over 10 million copies.  I think there are decent tracks here, but I honestly can't find anything that holds up to my favorite tracks from My Own Prison (the album ending pair, &quot;What's This Life For?&quot; and &quot;One&quot;).  I don't understand how a song like &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; can get so much praise.  It's a decent track, but trying to believe that it's better than, say, &quot;jimmy&quot; by Tool just leaves me confused with the state of music.  It may not be in a state of complete dysfunction, but it seems somehow hijacked.  Which, appropriately, is basically how I feel about Creed.

B00004RFCM|5.0|An absolutely charming and witty show about the travails of 4 30-something New Yorker single gals, all quite different but smart, sexy, successful and with a lot of personality. The show takes a humorous and original look at the perils of relationships in the space age. These are women and men who want it all -- but are having some trouble figuring out what the 'all' is.<br />Although the primary viewpoint is female, the show's not anti-male. Rather men are looked upon like strange, wondrous and often infuriating creatures -- much like they in turn think of women.<br />None of this tells you how GOOD the episodes are. My wife and I watch one a night, sipping them like fine wine. All four co-stars are extremely natural and convincing in their parts, and the supporting male actors are generally excellent as well. If you like witty, thoughtful and original comedy, you need look no further.
B00002R0MC|5.0|These 4 cd's should be dipped in gold and hung over the gravestone of Bob Marley. Marley, is my all time favorite musician and hearing his truthful soul being expressed on his acoustic or his Gibson les paul makes a tear of joy form within my eye. I can not express the musicial power that comes from these 4 cd's, it is unknown how much talent and frustration Bob might have expressed if not for his horrible loss to cancer in 1980, but this box set does a great job as a synopsis of his brave career as a man first and a political icon and teacher as well. the greatest box set in music history!!!!
B00005LKHW|4.0|American Pie is a throwback to the classic teen films of the 80's with the gross-out, raunchy humor of the 90's mixed in.  The film follows the attempts of four friends to lose their virginity by prom night of their senior year in high school.  Hardly an original plot, but the actors all give refreshingly honest performances and rise above what could be characatures of teenagers.  There are some gross but hilarious scenes including sex with an apple pie, drinking tainted beer and reaction to drinking a laxative.  Jason Biggs, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Allyson Hannigan, Sean William Scott and rest of the young actors all give hilarious performances, but it veteran actor and SCTV alum, Eugene Levy who steals every scene he's in as Jim's understanding dad.  American Pie is a funny movie that will appeal to all ages.

B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a rare movie that succeeded on all levels.  It was a box office smash ranking among the top five highest grossing movies of all time.  But it was also a critical darling, garnering across the board praise and a truckload of awards.  The movie became a cultural phenomenon, spawning cook books, quote books, a top ten soundtrack album and lines like &quot;stupid is as stupid does&quot; and &quot;life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get&quot; have permeated our dialect.  The movie has a nostalgic, feel good vibe thanks to the dimwitted Forrest's trek through 60's and 70's touchstone events.  Underneath all those warm feelings lies a darkness.  Bad things happen to just about everyone Forrest comes in contact with.  His best friend Bubba is killed in Vietnam, his other friend Lt. Dan loses both his legs, his mother dies of cancer and his beloved Jenny dies of AIDS.  Even the famous people Forrest comes across meet with disaster, President Kennedy &amp; John Lennon are assassinated, George Wallace is shot and Elvis Presley dies young.  There are superb performances all around.  Sally Field is feisty as Forrest's mama, Mykelti Williamson is funny as Bubba, Gary Sinese as Lt. Dan is a perfect rough edged foil to Forrest and Robin Wright as Jenny portrays the confusion that young people of the times felt perfectly.  While all those performances are of high quality, Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks' tour de force.  He is utterly brilliant as Forrest.  He is in virtually every scene of the movie and never once does he fail to astound.  He becomes Forrest and makes you care what happens to him.  Mr. Hanks deservedly won his second consecutive Best Actor Oscar for the role and cemented himself as the best actor of his generation and one of the best of all time.
B00003CXA3|5.0|The French Connection is a gritty, tough and unapologetic film that is based on the true story of two New York City narcotics officers who scored the biggest heroin bust in history.  Gene Hackman stars as the rough edged Popeye Doyle.  Popeye is not above doing anything in order to make his bust, whether it be coercion or violent force.  Teamed with his more leveled-headed partner Cloudy, played by Roy Scheider, they follow a hunch of Popeye's to the record bust.  The movie is one of the ultimate cat and mouse thrillers as Popeye and Cloudy stakeout the Frenchmen who are importing the heroin.  The famous car chase scene still holds up even thirty years later as one the greatest ever filmed.  Mr. Hackman is incredible in the role of Popeye and the over the top blind rage and fury he brings to the character is perfect.  Mr. Scheider is also great and his sanguine performance provides a nice contrast to the fiery Mr. Hackman.  William Friedkin's grainy filming style perfectly captures the feel of the movie.  Mr. Hackman won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor, Mr. Friedkin took home the Best Director Oscar and the movie won for Best Picture.  After thirty years, The French Connection hasn't lost one bit of its power.

0062502182|5.0|Paulo Coehlo wonderfully entices the reader into the world of Santiago, the boy who is on his quest to find his personal legend.  I recommend this book to anyone who dreams,  has aspirations of travel to faraway places or just fantasizes about a change in their life.  It's highly uplifting, spiritual, and inspiring.  Dependant on where you are in your life, if you're where you want to be, on the way to getting there, or there and just want to read about someone else's journey, read this book!  And I don't mean to make it sound like this is a self-help novel or anything, but moreso an intricate tale of the beauty  and depths of the human soul.   This is one of the best pieces of fiction that I have ever read.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|When I heard this DVD was going to be released I was estatic. Almost every video done by Whiney Houston is included, from the early videos such as &quot;How Will I Know&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Love Of All&quot; through the Bodyguard era hits like &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; to her recent smash hits such as &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; and &quot;It's Not Right But It's Okay&quot;. <br />But to me what makes it so special are the extras, such as live performances at the Grammy Awards, in concert in South Africa, her performance of the Star Spangled Banner, and her first performance on the Merv Griffin show. <br />Also included are interviews with Whitney, Clive Davis, Missy   Elliot, Wyclef Jean, Diane Warren, and others. <br />A must have for any Whitney fan or any other person from the MTV generation who has been touched by Whitney's music.
0060975768|5.0|This ran in Army Times. In addition to being one of the under-reported stories of 9-11, it seems like a remarkable footnote to a remarkable book.<br />`The bravest man I ever knew' <br />After a lifetime in which he cheated it many times, death caught up with Rick Rescorla halfway up the south tower of the World Trade Center.<BR>But like a good soldier, he didn't sell his life cheaply. Death took him only after he had cheated it again, helping to save 2,700 lives by relying on the instincts and the preparation that had served him well in battles on two continents.<br />Rescorla was a retired Army Reserve colonel and the head of security for Morgan Stanley's Individual Investor Group at the World Trade Center. But many readers will be more familiar with him as Lt. Rick \\"Hard Core\\" Rescorla, one of the heroes of the 1965 battle of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam.<br />\\"Rick was the best combat leader I ever saw in Vietnam,\\" said Pat Payne, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment's reconnaissance platoon leader in Ia Drang.<br />Featured in book<br />Rescorla's role in that battle is recounted in detail in the book \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young,\\" a searing account of the action by retired Lt. Gen. Harold \\"Hal\\" Moore and Joe Galloway. In 1965, Moore was a battalion commander in the center of the battle, and Galloway was a UPI reporter who covered the entire engagement.<br />Even those only vaguely familiar with the book have seen Rescorla's image - he is the gaunt soldier on the cover with the 2-day old beard and the bayonet fixed to his M16.<br />When Rescorla showed up for Basic Training at Benning in 1963, he'd already seen more adventure than most soldiers do in a lifetime. Born in Cornwall, England, he joined the British army's Paratroop Regiment as a teen-ager, then became a military intelligence warrant officer. He served in that position in Cyprus during the violence that wracked that island in the 1950s, then left the British Army for a London police job in Scotland Yard's famous \\"Flying Squad\\" of detectives.<br />He left England for another military job, this time as a commando in the Rhodesian Colonial security force in Africa. From there he came to seek his fortune in the United States. <br />After breezing through basic training, Rescorla was picked up for Officer Candidate School. Last year he was inducted into the OCS Hall of Fame.<br />He graduated as a second lieutenant in 1965, just in time to ship out to Vietnam with the 1st Air Cavalry Division. In November of that year, still a British citizen, he would draw on all his youthful experience in the battle of the Ia Drang.<br />Headed the `Hard Corps'<br />Ia Drang was the Army's first major battle in Vietnam, and one of its bloodiest. The battle claimed 305 American lives, soldiers who died in fierce combat with a North Vietnamese regiment that also took heavy losses. Rescorla commanded 1st Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and was almost worshipped by his soldiers, who called themselves the \\"Hard Corps\\" after his nickname. But his courage and infectious optimism resonated beyond those under his immediate command.<br />Payne remembers Rescorla \\"leaping off [a] chopper and strutting into our small very beat-up group of survivors\\" during the night. After placing his men to fill the gaps in Payne's line and pausing to speak quietly to each soldier, he walked toward Payne.<br />\\"I was so amazed to see him walking around because we had all been crawling on our stomachs for eight hours,\\" Payne said. Speaking in a low, confident voice, Rescorla complimented Payne on establishing good fields of fire.<br />\\"Then he looked me in the eye and said, `When the sun comes up we are going to kick some ass.' I will never forget his words or the look in his eye. He said it in a confident, matter-of-fact way. He was not boasting, it was resolve.\\"<br />Rescorla earned a Silver Star for his actions at Ia Drang, and, in Moore's words, \\"went on to establish himself as a living legend in the 7th Cav in Vietnam.\\" <br />But behind the swagger and the self-confidence, Rescorla hid a keen intellect, according to Dan Hill, a former captain who met Rescorla at basic and remained his best friend. This fine mind served Rescorla well when he left the Army in the late 1960s and put himself through college and law school, before going on to establish himself as a specialist in security for financial firms.<br />His will to live came to the fore again three years ago, when he was diagnosed with inoperable cancer and given six months to live. Against the odds, he beat the disease into remission. <br />As Morgan Stanley's security chief, Rescorla brought his belief in the \\"seven Ps\\" - proper prior planning and preparation prevents poor performance - to bear, to the immense good fortune of his co-workers.<br />Morgan Stanley was the largest tenant in the south tower, with about 2,700 employees in 20 floors. But incredibly, only six, including Rescorla and two security folks who worked for him, still are missing. Everyone else made it out alive.<br />Obsessed with preparation<br />Those survivors owe their lives in no small part to Rescorla's quick thinking at a time of crisis, and his obsession with being prepared for every eventuality.<br />\\"He'd take every possible contingency that could happen, and he'd come up with a plan for it,\\" Hill said. When the first plane hit the north tower, the Port Authority told workers in the south tower to stay put. But Rescorla disagreed and immediately executed an evacuation plan he had made the employees rehearse twice a year. <br />The plan worked, and when the second plane hit the south tower, almost all Morgan Stanley employees were on their way to safety. So was Rescorla, who made it to the ground floor, singing \\"God Bless America\\" to calm the nerves of the evacuees.<br />But he insisted on going back upstairs to check for anyone left behind. He was probably still climbing when the building collapsed.<br />His wife, Susan, and his two children likely will remember Rick Rescorla for his generosity of spirit and his dry English wit.<br />But middle-aged veterans of a hellish battle long ago in the sun and the elephant grass are more likely to remember Rick Rescorla as Bill Lund, another second lieutenant in that battle, does: \\"This was the bravest man I ever knew.\\"
B00000BKDX|5.0|Ahh, the days of big arena shows with towers of amps, pyrotechnics and a giant Eddie!  Plenty of spandex and awesome guitar solos.  None of that big hair crap, though!  These boys were here to rock.<br />This was one of the best tours I have ever seen and the fact that I get to relive it everyday in rush hour is that much sweeter.  No other band that I have seen has been able to reproduce their music on stage as well as Maiden.  The fact that these guys are still putting out albums (thank God Bruce and Adrian are back) with that distinctive sound tells you of the enduring quality of their wares...You will not regret it.<br />Up the irons!
0345413377|1.0|Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy presents God as an evil puritan who hates sex, and presents Satan as good guy who brings knowledge. I'd laugh if it weren't for the fact that this [junk's] already old; the Satanic Bible was published more than 40 years ago, and Pullman does nothing to advance the Satanist vision. His writing reads like a humorless episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br />I read an interview with Pullman in a British paper. He thinks that the US is ruled by \\"fundamentalists\\" and that it's illegal to teach evolution here. What a dope.
B00003CXV4|4.0|I thought this movie was very good, very well done.  I am not a big Keanu fan, however, and found him to be out of his league in some parts.  By the end of the movie I liked him in it, though.  Charlize is a goddess...great for the movie.  I have liked her in everything I've seen her in.  <BR>I disagree with the person that said this movie was too much like &quot;Autumn in New York&quot;, and then proceeded to say that it was better than this movie.  I thought &quot;Autumn&quot; was ridiculous from the start and this movie was way more believable.  On the other hand, I agree with the person that said that the drag queen neighbors were out in left field and of no use to the story as a subplot.  Also, Keanu singing was really dumb too.  Besides that, I liked it a lot.<BR>I always try to watch movies with an open mind and see where they take me, and this one moved me more than I was expecting.  The theme of celebrating life and not taking it for granted should be emphasized more.  I was a bit disappointed that the trailer gave away Sara's illness...if I hadn't known that I probably would have enjoyed the movie more.

B00003CXZ4|4.0|I went to see &quot;Memento&quot; opening weekend with 2 of my friends. I really liked this film but neither one of them did. They didn't like the feeling of being manipulated. I was as intrigued as when I first watched &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. Later on you try and see if there were any slips and that's where the DVD will offer endless hours of fun to the hyper critical.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Everyone calls it the best album of 1997. Many people and critics consider it to be the best album of the 90's. Some even call it the best album in the history of music, amongst strong competition by The Beatles' Revolver, Rolling Stones' Exile On Main Street and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On?<BR>Why, you might ask? Is OK Computer really that good? Damn straight it is! This, ladies and gentlemen, is top of the bill... an instant classic. I must have listened to it hundreds of times, yet still it doesn't seem to bore me. Why? This is pure magic. Every single song is mind-blowing all the way. Singles Lucky, Paranoid Android, Karma Police and No Surprises prove this. Yet, songs like Airbag, Exit Music [For A Film], Let Down, Electioneering, Climbing Up The Walls and The Tourist are just as stunning. OK Computer deserves every single inch of attention it gets. It's a one way ticket to one of the highlights in one's life. This is what music should be all about... addictive, hauntingly beautiful, yet powerful electronic pop music. I can't say a bad thing about this album. There is no possible way anyone can. All of my friends agree with me,... this is a `must-have' album. Surely I'm not expecting for everyone to love this album as much as I do, but this is great music nonetheless. Anyone who dares to disagree, either has a very bad taste of music or no taste at all. I can imagine it's hard for music lovers to pick an all-time favorite album, but thanks to OK Computer it's easier to make the right choice. I must confess that I became a die-hard Radiohead fan thanks to this album, and I love every album they released so far. But OK Computer definitely hits the spot. Change your life forever. Buy this album now! If you already have it, buy another copy. Thanks for reading.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I love Diana Krall, but this CD is just not that fun to listen to. It sounds like she is on cold medicine and makes me feel the same way. It is waaaaay too slow. Waaaay too little instrumental usage. But...I still love Diana and her singing, but please give us a bit more entertainment in a CD. The only time I listen to this one is if I need to go to sleep.
B0000029DD|5.0|Most every review here says it, but I must chime in and say the same: this CD is exquisite. Jeff Buckley's voice is utterly emotional and moving. There is a certain raw, obvious pain in his voice that feels as though it's lingering just under the surface - not hiding, just simply on the verge of release. Jeff's high pitched voice trembles, though not out of weakness - he has total control of it. But this trembling carries emotion, and desperation, and longing. This music triggers feelings. From soft beauty to moments of louder desperation, there is hardly a moment where Jeff fails to show himself. There is something very vulnerable about his voice, his sound, and he is not afraid to show it. Finding music with substance isn't always easy, but it's very possible if you look in the right places...but Jeff is beyond &quot;music with substance&quot;. There is a &quot;realness&quot;, a presence that is felt in his music. It deeply, deeply saddens me that Jeff never got to grow further as a musician, but I believe this work stands alone and needs no follow-up. I don't believe it ever could have been topped anyway. Rest in peace, Jeff.
B00005NW02|5.0|This album is the best album of the new year.  After System of a Down's first, extremely heavy album, which was itself a beautiful album, I was excited to pick this one up after hearing the radio single, Chop Suey!.  After listening to this CD, it is obvious that SOAD's sophomore effort is better than their first, and their radio single was outdone by a number of other songs.  Overall, the lighter songs are better, but even they have bridges between heavy and melodic and beautiful.  The Armenian band's close proximity to the MidEast is shown through the album, especially on songs such as Science &amp; the 2nd part of Aerials.  Overall a brilliant effort - best songs are ATWA, Toxicity, Aerials, Science, and Chop Suey!.  Oh and definitely the most beautiful part of the album is the bridge of Deer Dance - they should write an instrumental based on that solo.
B00001SIES|4.0|A classmate of mine introduced me to Muse. At first, I was in love. This CD starts out so beautifully. The whole CD is enjoyable, I have no real complaints. The lead singer's voice is slightly reminiscent of Jeff Buckley in his high-pitched moments. This CD has a lot of potential, particularly starting off the way it does, from gentle piano and singing to crashing, burning emotion. It hooks you right away...however, something seemed to be missing from this album. I don't know that I could define it...it seemed a bit empty underneath it all, lacking some ultimate feel or meaning. But it's worth listening to... Definitely an enjoyable CD.
6302968100|5.0|Simply put:  this movie rocks!!!  Everyone in it is absolutely awesome.  It definitely keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini deserve Oscars or some kind of award just for their scene together.  Magnificent film making!
B00005NTN5|4.0|... I give it high marks for suspense, and for very nice plot twists. It's a film that draws you in and keeps you involved from beginning to end. The script, acting, cinematography and direction are all solid, much more so than one would usually expect from a relatively unknown cast and crew.
0670858048|5.0|It may take a while to understand HOW the book actually works, but that's only part of the story, the transitions will make your child imagine how they happened.

0684857219|5.0|I bought this book this past summer to get some additional insights into new exercises but, more importantly, to understand the mindset of a champion.  If you read this entire behemoth of a book you will take away valuable insight that can also be applied to your life.<br />One example of this would be to train your weakest body part first.  While a very simple thought, you can tell from looking at people in the gym that most people don't use this at all.  I have seen way too many men with huge arms, chest and shoulders but pathetic backs and legs.  If you are into bodybuilding this is key.  You can apply this to your life by focusing on whatever your weakness is.  Do you have a temper, wake up late, or need to get an education to provide for your family?  While it does require looking at the book from a different framework it can help.<br />Arnold provides numerous exercises, talks about intensity and fatiguing the muscle and, of course, what kind of nutrition is required to grow.  He talks about cariod workouts, prepping for contests, posing etc.  This is like Bodybuilding 101 in a book.  If you aren't into bodybuilding but want to learn more about fitness just skip the contest part but this book is nothing short of awesome and well worth the price.  I have read the book once and gone back to different sections twice since I bought it this summer simply to try new stuff to fatigue my muscles in new ways.<br />If you are a beginner and don't know anything about weightlifting try Body for Life, as it deals with more of the emotional issues associated with weight and is very much a bodybuilders routine.  Just easier to follow and will help prep you for this bruiser of a book.
B000050XEI|4.0|Some People do not like &quot;Sail Away&quot;. I do. And it is this enchanting song that first introduced me to Enya. Ever since hearing that song I have been mesmerized by her voice. In this new CD, Enya has once again brought her best voice forward. &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;, is perfect to listen to on the way home from work, or at any time you are feeling stressed. Something about Enya's voice that makes you forget about all your troubles and worries for a while. Great music all around. I can go a day without rain, but not Enya.
0425098478|4.0|There are three simple precepts, which the One Minute Manager establishes with his employees: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praisings, and One Minute Reprimands.  This makes the basics of the book very simple to understand.  I was quite stunned to find the content extremely useful.  Strangely the simplicity of the book is deceiving. This book is good for those that are looking for a quick read and who are either currently managing people or wanting to manage people.<br />Goal setting is all about making sure employees understand perfectly what their duties are, what is expected of them and that there are no surprises. The Praisings and Reprimands are simply managers acknowledging that the employees are doing there jobs or not and how to deal with the situation and how to convey it to the employee.<br />In my opinion the book is pretty good but I think everyone should read Leadership and the One Minute Manager rather than this book as Leadership is essential and it is what differentiates great companies from good ones.  The key, like most books that are self-help, is to apply these principles each and every day.  Catch yourself when you slip and find ways to incorporate them into your value system.
B00004STUL|4.0|After numerous times watching on free-to-air TV &amp; recently saw this movie on DVD. The sound and image transfer are superb. The wild shootouts and explosions certainly provide effective rumbles. I will not go through the plot, but I like seeing this film which has plenty of hilarious one-liners, and high-voltage action scenes.
B0000062FJ|4.0|this band's debut album was so powerful and original when it came out in 1969. i do feel that some of the instrumentals sometimes sound a bit too much alike, but that's a minor complaint. how different this was compared to the bulk of albums of 1969! i like the superb soul sacrifice the best. evil ways is a great tune, but it has been played to death on the boring big stations. i  also like you just don't care, a fine bluesy number and the somewhat psychedelic shades of time. the playing by this group is always top notch. too bad greg rolie would go on with another santana alumnus, neal schon , to form journey, a dreadful arena rock band. their best moments were with this aggregation. carlos santana is certainly one of the best american guitar players of the era. a very solid debut.
6304196784|1.0|I got this video because I was told that it was funny.<BR>I did not find it funny. The language was very offensive.<BR>I couldn't count the many times the f-word was used.<BR>I am surprised that John Cleese did that film. He doesn't<BR>have to be crude to be funny. I would not recommend it<BR>to anyone.
B00003CX9E|5.0|While I enjoy the DVD versions of the movies with lots of visual and sound effects.  My favorite DVD movies are black and white movies.  The black and white seems alot crisper than the video copies.  I was waiting for this one to come out on DVD.  This movie is wonderfully acted and the cinematography is excellent.  Its a shame that this movie was made before Panavision.  I do agree with some of the reviews that this movie is slow but there are more to movies than car chases.<br />Excellent flick.
B00000099Y|4.0|I have been playing drums for 22 years and I am extremely impressed with Tools drummer.  His playing is precise and flawless.  Cap it off with pounding guitars and meaningful lyrics and this album absolutly rocks.<BR>I gave it four stars because I don't care for every song.
B00003CWTI|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen in my life. The movie was so stupid that I began laughing at the stupidity. Right around the scene where all the characters are singing together is where I came the very close to pushing the &quot;stop&quot; button on my remote control. After that I had given up all hope for this being a good movie. That's disappointing too because the beginning of the movie is so good. The stories they show in the very beginning are interesting. The stories they show during the movie are not only confusing but boring. And not one story has a satisfying ending. The little boy genius story was the most interesting but it went absolutely nowhere. Tom Cruise was the worst. He did a great job acting but his character was so disgusting that I felt embarrassed just to be watching it. Each story can be connected but to do so is stretching it...A LOT! I love how it rains frogs and nobody seems to think anything of it. At that point you can tell that the director has given up on this and he just wanted to get it over with as soon as possible.<br />I would also like to give 1 star to the song at the beginning of the movie, &quot;One Is The Loneliest Number.&quot; I thought that song would never end. I was hoping for a power outage at my house just to shut that girl up!
B00000251N|5.0|I have always love the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull and fell in love with the record soundtrack in the 70's. The digitally mastered CD is even better! The music is reflective, peaceful and soothing. It truly transcends time and I highly recommend it especially to those who love the music of Lee Holdridge. The instrumental of Dear Father is simply gorgeous.
0375703764|5.0|...well, not really, only twice, but I'd love to.  Danielewski is a brilliant man, yet I refuse to believe he wrote the book.  It taints the divine image I have of it. Johnny Truant is, in my eyes, the author who has brought together a book that occasionally touches reality when an Editor from some outside world adds his comments. An unbelieveable protagonist for a story.  The outline is wonderful, the way everything is portrayed is amazing.  I became obcessed with the book the first time I read it.  I tucked dozens of note pages cluttered with sketches, notes, quotes, thoughts, and anecdotes inside the front flap of the paperback, scribbled in the margins, whatever I could.  When you read it, it's like falling into an abyss.<br />I love this book.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|The film is the most echanting ever...I was 8 years old when I first saw it. &quot;E.T.&quot; just found a permanent special place in my heart. It made me cry then, and still makes me cry now. In my opinion, &quot;E.T.&quot;  is more a story of frienship between a 10 year old boy and an alien, than a sci-fi movie. The music is  glorious and magical. But most of all, &quot;E.T.&quot; has wondrous special effects. IT'S AN AWESOME CLASSIC !!!
B00005LB9O|2.0|This record is quite [bad].  'Side' and 'Afterglow' are standout tracks, but most of the record shows little evidence of growth from \\"The Man Who\\".  I've given it 2 stars because I am a Travis fan, but this isn't a record that you'll keep in your CD player unless your collection is already pretty weak.
B00005A1VG|5.0|That exchange in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was first drawn to my attention because it was used in the frontspiece of a trashy book about Flynn's being a secret Nazi spy. Well, I don't know whether he was a spy or not, but Errol Flynn was the best swashbuckler I've ever seen, and this movie is the crowning acheivement of his career--maybe one of the ten greatest films released by Warner Brothers, too.   <br />While Flynn is the star, I must admit that my love for this film is rooted not to his performance, but to those of Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains. After all this time, I still can't determine which actor does the better job. Rathbone is Sir Guy, Robin Hood's nemesis, who hates him not only because Robin is a threat to the usual evil usurper plans, but because he senses correctly that Maid Marion is in love with Robin Hood. His striking good looks are used to full advantage--in some scenes, such as when Robin is sentenced to hang, Rathbone actually looks like a figure in an El Greco painting. And of course, there's his skill with a sword. The prolonged duel at the film's conclusion would never have been as good if Rathbone weren't so agile and malicious. When my three-year-old nephew happened to see this scene, he became hopelessly hooked on swords and armor! (Although, to be sure, Robin and Guy wear no armor in this scene, but toddlers tend to overgeneralize sometimes.)<br />As for Claude Rains, he's a wickedly good actor! His Prince John is a wily schemer, overthrowing his brother's regent by playing on others' greed for advancement. He himself never lifts a sword, but he manages to get very far on the metal and mettle of his co-conspirators. Just listen to the way the words just trip off his tongue: he's one jaded Plantagenet, all right.      <br />It's a beautiful-looking film, too, as if a Howard Pyle or NC Wyeth book just popped up and came to life. The costumes, the sets, the cinematography--everything comes  together for a feast for the eyes. Topping it off, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Oscar-winning score underlies every scene magnificently.<br />If you're looking for a film for a special family holiday or a romantic evening with your honey, or just a night in by yourself with a pizza and a pint of ice cream, look no further than &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;--and by St. George, you'll see I'm right on target!
0201485672|5.0|I first encountered this book on the job. In combination with the other XP texts by the author and the contributors to &quot;Refactoring&quot;, it helped shed light on the underpinnings of modern programming practice.  The approach presented by these authors has a self-consistent logic that I find inspiring. Although I read several &quot;XP books&quot; on that job, this is the one that I'm buying for my own collection.  The sheer volume of useful patterns in this text alone make it a valueable asset.
B00005LB9O|5.0|My close friend rose used to always rant and rave about how travis was so touching and inspiring.  I never really payed much attention to her because i was more into the punk/emo scene.  However, after just listening to this CD once, i got hooked.  It stayed in my car cd player for over a month, and being heavily rotated after that.  If you know me, the car cd player is a very prestigious place and only the best cds go in there.  Excellent CD.
B00000DRA9|5.0|The movie has been one of my favs since I first saw it.  The soundtrack measure right up there with the movie itself. From the classic opening track and movie theme, the instrumental bliss that is orchestrated throughout the remainder of the album is great.  &quot;Ivory Tower,&quot; &quot;Happy Flight,&quot; and &quot;Mirrorgate&quot; have to be the standout tracks in my mind.  All in all if you love the movie, you'll love the CD.  And if you only love the title theme, you'll love the CD too.  Plain and simple, if you buy the disc, it'll be on an neverending play once you pop it in the player.  I know it is for me....I haven't taken it out since I acquired it!
0393312836|5.0|After reading the first few pages of Clockwork Orange, I thought it would be too painful to continue, but the word substitutions gradually became clear, and the story evolved into a powerful and-surprisingly-humorous narrative. Gang leader Alex rebels against society in every way, rejecting decency, work, and even language. His mischief eventually leads him to prison at age 15, and mishaps there result in his being selected for criminal rehab by association. The rest is what turns the novel into a classic--the criminal becomes victim, grows more charming in the process, and learns how to grow up.
0385501560|3.0|In this novel, Chuck Palahniuk covers a great deal of the territory which will be familiar to readers of his earlier writing.  But, this book -- while not as stunning as &quot;Fight Club&quot; -- is still remarkable.<br />Here we are confronted with the story of Victor Mancini -- sex-addict, con artist, drop out, would-be messiah, etc.  Definitely an interesting character.  And Palahniuk provides a voice for him that is totally believable.<br />The novel starts with Victor telling us that we shouldn't read it...which only makes us want to go ahead and read.<br />And it won't be the last time a reader is unwittingly manipulated by Victor's seemingly innocent narration.<br />From there it moves on to his description of telling scenes from his childhood and details of his relationship with his crazy mother.   Convinced that her relatively petty (mostly) crimes are situationist acts which will awaken the masses from their mental slavery, Ida Mancini definitely manages to impress Victor with an unique world view -- when she isn't doing time, that is.<br />Victor is a smart guy...even if he is twisted.  And, throughout the novel, his viewpoint and the opinions he expresses are interesting.<br />But the plot wears thin -- in spite of the fact that it deals mostly with Victor's concerns about his mother's failing health and what he could or should do to save her.  Pretty heavy stuff.  But this seems like something we've seen before.<br />We get a lot of information along the way about Victor's strange sexual predilections.  And have no trouble by novel's end imagining how this character could have gotten to be so far from normal.<br />Palahniuk's writing is first rate throughout.  Unfortunately, the ingredients of this novel seem to be assembled following a successful recipe.  <br />What's different here is not all that different from what we've seen before in Palahniuk's work.<br />At one point, Victor comments about &quot;jamais vu&quot; -- the opposite of &quot;deja vu&quot; -- seeing something again but feeling as if it is for the first time rather than seeing something for the first time and feeling as if it is oddly familiar. <br />Palahniuk can't expect us to forget his earlier work.  He'll need to work harder to make his future work every bit as good and ever more original.
B000002J2F|5.0|Genesis struggled a bit on &quot;And Then There Were Three...&quot; to find their new musical sound after Steve Hackett's departure.  On this album, the follow-up, there can be no doubt that the growing pains were over, and Genesis was ready to enter the 1980's with their new blend of powerful drumming, uniquely melodic keyboards, and intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics.  The album opens with the powerful Behind The Lines/Duchess/Guide Vocal suite, a keyboard-driven extravaganze unlike anything Genesis had ever done before.  Misunderstanding, one of the first Collins-written songs done by Genesis, was one of their first big hits, and is probably the best foreshadowing of their future work.  Turn It On Again, another hit from this album, is a great combination of pop and prog styles.  Another excellent instrumental is the closing Duke's Travels/Duke's End suite, which is highlighted by repeats of the themes from Turn It On Again, and Behind The Lines.  The remaining songs all have a little more of a &quot;prog&quot; feel to them.  They are generally quieter and more introspective, and all show the softer side of Phil Collins' voice to good effect, which we would all come to know so well on his solo work.  An overlooked gem on thie album is &quot;Please Don't Ask&quot;, a powerful, emotional song about the regrets of divorce and separation from one's kids.<br />All in all, some of Genesis' best work, although incredibly far removed from their early work.  If you haven't heard this album, you are missing out on a gem!
B000002B49|5.0|I bought this cd on a whim ..willing to try ethnic music (and no not just different places in America ethnic...ie country to inner city rap but world ethnic). If you like to be relaxed and if you like new age-ish music, I recommend this cd. I'm unable to put anything else down in words, as from today's music and style, Deep Forest's Boheme is really different to compare it to anything else. But if you're willing to try something different, I say why not start here? :-)
B00003CXRM|2.0|I love movies.  I'm the person who comes out of the movie that's left everyone else gagging and says &quot;what?  I kind of enjoyed it.&quot;  This bored me.
0446604844|5.0|this was the first novel that I have read by David Baldacci, and I was quite impressed.  This book was an outstanding tale of suspense and action.  I could not put this book down.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride, how does one sum her up?  I don't think anything that I say can even bring her justice.  Her voice is incredible, she's leagues beyond most every other country singer.  She sings songs that matter instead of the average cookie-cutter songs.  Needless to say...this CD is the GREATEST!  The absolutely only thing that could have been better is if there were more songs on it.  Of course, it was probably a huge challenge to choose the songs for the greatest hits, for Martina has always song such excellent songs, it's hard to choose the greastest...they are all worthy of being the greatest.  Of course the disc contains all the big songs of her career so far, &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Wild Angels&quot;, &quot;Valentine&quot;, &quot;I Love You&quot;, &quot;Whatever You Say&quot;, &quot;Safe In The Arms Of Love&quot;, and of course what is known as her career song, &quot;Independence Day&quot;.  The power of this song about domestic violence is incredible.  No one could have sung that song the way Martina could.  Having all Martina's hits on one CD is great.  The better part of this disc however, are the four new songs.  Just when I thought she couldn't get any better after the material on her &quot;Emotion&quot; CD...well...I admit that I was wrong.  And I'm glad of that!  Martina is one of those artists who tops herself every time.  &quot;When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues&quot;, the current single, is simply fun.  It's got attitude and for anyone who says no one sings country music anymore...listen to that song!  &quot;Where Would You Be&quot;, I don't even know where to start...this song shows Martina's incredible vocal range.  After you hear this song you'll know why many think Martina has the greatest voice on the planet.  &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; is a song about child abuse.  You won't be the same after you hear this song.  You can't help but be affected by its message.  This is because Martina sings with such emotion and you can feel that when she sings.  &quot;Blessed&quot; is an uptempo number and makes you realized how lucky you are, even the small things matter (&quot;I put my feet on the hard wood floor, I get to hear my children laughing down the hall through the bedroom door&quot;).  And I myself feel Blessed that there is a singer out there like Martina McBride who sings with such emotion and passion about real issues and things that matter, a woman who isn't afraid to speak up about social issues, a woman who cares about music.  That is Martina McBride.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is Walt Disney's cinematic treasure, a story undiminished by its age and now restored once again to the highest technical standards available. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was the first of many Disney feature films noted for their great emotional power. Although enthusiasts of the Grimm version have criticized Disney's retelling as being too cute and maudlin, the film does contain some genuinely fear-inspiring moments and parents should be cautious about having smaller children view this film. My daughter is a teenager and she still can not watch it. The animation is powerful and consuming. In a true visual representation of the confrontation of good and evil, the climactic chase of the queen by the dwarfs brilliantly demonstrates the power of animation. The coloring of the heavens, the shadows, the falling boulders, and the two apocalyptic vultures that lurk above, swooping downward after the queen plunges to her doom are all well conceived indelible images of the forces of evil being vanquished. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a classic film. It is an outstanding example of the wonder and brilliance of Walt Disney's animation, and a technical milestone. It is an icon in the history of all cinema let alone animated cinema. Of all the DVD extras, and there are many, I really enjoyed the segment on the history of Disney chronicled by the release and numerous theatrical re-releases of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS. It was really good to see Fess Parker (Davy Crockett) and Dean Jones host some of these segments. Concerning the restoration of the film this time around I found the audio restoration incredible. For a film that old, the sound especially the score sounded brilliant. This is an essential DVD.
0446310786|4.0|I loved this touching story, as told by 8-year old Scout Finch, about growing up in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama amidst racial turmoil and the depression.  It was just a great story.<br />Now that I am finished with the book I already miss Scout, Jem, Dill, Atticus, and of course Boo.<br />If you are looking for a book with a great story written by an author who knows how to write and use the english language, above the Grisham level, then this is a book for you.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? All I can tell you is that this album is perhaps the best that has been produced in the last twenty years. The memories alone that I have of listening to this album in the past are enough to make me love hearing it over and over. I've never tired of it. I have perhaps five albums by various artists that I could listen to non-stop if I wanted, and this is one of them. Another is Signs of a Vacant Soul by Virgos Merlot, and another is Tool's Aenema. Surprisingly, I can also listen to Slipknot's Iowa, Sarah MacLachlan's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Metallica's Master of Puppets nonstop as well. Yet Radiohead's OK Computer sprawls over all of these and engulfs them. If you don't listen to OK Computer and immediately get caught up in it, well, I hope you didn't pay too much for the lobotomy.

B00003CXZ4|4.0|An anonymous, sun-drenched wasteland of motels, diners, and strip-malls is the backdrop for Christopher Nolan's hypnotic tale, Memento.<br />Memento's protagonist is Leonard Shelby, a man living for vengeance; to punish the man who raped and murdered his wife.  But Leonard is no typical vigilante.  He suffers from short-term memory loss--he cannot make new memories.<br />Leonard is never fully awake, nor fully asleep.  He is constantly waking from a dream that he can't quite remember.  It is almost never nighttime in Memento.  Life is one unending day.<br />Leonard must keep himself in a state of coiled readiness.  Pearce's body is lean and sinewy, all tendon and muscle, ready to lash out against threats, real or imagined.<br />Nolan runs the film in reverse, so the end of the story is Memento's opening scene.  The movie lurches backwards in jagged chunks of time.  Rather than spoiling the fun, this trick includes the audience in Leonard's disorientation while letting them know what's going on before he does.<br />I have racked my brain for a film to compare with Memento, and the best parallel I can draw is to Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo.  Though very different characters, Pearce's Leonard and Jimmy Stewart's Johnny share a terrible sense of desperation and loss.<br /><br />Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano give expert supporting performances as Leonard's acquaintances, but the molten core of Memento is Guy Pearce's Leonard, a man teetering on the brink of madness, clinging desperately shreds of  reality.  As he searches for his wife's killer, he is sad, brave, and demented.  Leonard is a man driven to horrifying extremes--such as tattooing important information on his body--to keep his life in some kind of order.  One of the film's unforgettable scenes shows Leonard frantically searching for a pen to write down a critical piece of information.  Such is life for Leonard--always desperate, always searching, a moment away from oblivion.  Memento's conclusion is immensely satisfying, but the greatest thrill of the movie is watching Leonard's tragic struggle for survival.  Leonard is like a fish drowning in a tidepool--desperate, driven, and, ultimately, doomed.
0375703861|4.0|Smith does a great job with her characters, its hard to believe this is her first novel.  She is very wise for her age.  We read this book for my book club and it offered us a lot of interesting discussion, which is an accomplishment since we have been meeting close to 10 years now.  My only criticism is that she goes into detail on some characters that never amount to anything in the book, making the book a bit longer than needed.  Also, like most modern novels, it was short on plot.  However, I did still enjoy it and will definately read her next book.
B00004T9VY|5.0|This is my favorite album by Stevens. Tillerman serves up stevens musical genius with non-stop great tracks. Also shows stevens ability to switch up styles from &quot;Sad Lisa&quot; to &quot;Longer Boats&quot; although this is not a difinitive collection of Stevens this is a must have for any true Cat Stevens fan. A classic album by a classic talent. buy this and then check out his other albums this one pleases and can serve a purpose for any occasion as well as being a piece of classic musical genius unto itself. Make this your first Stevens album if you are a new listener or fan.
B000002L9Y|4.0|I suppose I'm a little hypocritical when reviewing the final two Lindsey Buckingham-fueled Fleetwood Mac efforts, MIRAGE and TANGO IN THE NIGHT. Truth be told, in comparison with the mammoth 70's staples FLEETWOOD MAC and RUMOURS, not to mention the art-film eccentricity of TUSK, these albums come off as very leightweight, further departing from the band's initial bluesy sound, and even from the emotional leverage of their early days together in the B-N incarnation. However, while they're not as good as earlier Mac albums, they're not exactly &quot;bad&quot; albums either! Each album has its strongpoints and weaknesses, its little idiosyncracies. TANGO's strength comes from Lindsey Buckingham's production-- highly unlike anything the Mac had released previously, similar in sound to Buckingham's solo release GO INSANE, and when you listen to it now, obviously a stepping stone towards the sonic gaden of eden Buckingham created on his solo album OUT OF THE CRADLE. While it's true that the songs themselves rarely match the productions or techniques, the quirky arrangements do make the album very interesting, and real ear candy to listen to. Most of the album's strongest numbers made their way to the singles chart-- Buckingham's wonderful &quot;Big Love&quot; (one of his best and most commercial since &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;), and ever-reliable Christine McVie's &quot;Little Lies&quot; and the sublime &quot;Everywhere.&quot; Elsewhere, Buckingham's songs are very interesting, much quirkier than his sedated MIRAGE material. I've always really liked &quot;Caroline,&quot; the rhythms of it are very intriguing (I'm a percussion major!). The title track itself is a great slow rocker in the style of &quot;I'm So Afraid,&quot; featuring some wonderful guitar work (missing from much of the last Mac album). &quot;Family Man&quot; gets on my nerves though-- it's something about what he's actually singing about, and how it has little relation to his actual life, it's just a strange song that I can't imagine relating to. Christine and Lindsey collaborate on two delightful songs, &quot;You and I Part II,&quot; and the enchanting &quot;Mystified.&quot; This time around though, I just didn't get into Stevie Nicks' stuff. I've heard her involvement in the whole project was very minimal, and it sounds like it. &quot;Welcome To The Room Sara&quot; is just rambling, and &quot;When I See You Again&quot; has some very annoying &quot;what's the matter baby&quot; repititions. . . seriously, it grinds the pace of an otherwise bittersweet, touching song, to a raspy pompous halt. (The bridge at the end, &quot;And the dream says I love you, And the dream is gone. . .&quot; is very moving however.) All in all, a very nice album, and a good farewell from Lindsey Buckingham, certainly better than BEHIND THE MASK. Check it out! This one's pretty good!!
B00004SU5J|5.0|I love Navarre (Saint Germain) of all of his albums I prize this one the most. His beats and jazz fusion are seemless and often times peotic. Very sophisticated sounds surround the listener throughout this album. Playing this at a party people will beg me to buy or borrow this cd, they will go out and bring back blank tapes to record this album, Germain has reached king midas status with this as everyone this EP touches comes away thinking of it as solid gold, great for relaxing with, parties, chilling with friends, making love to,... a great album with great beats and blends from all different musical disciplines, if you have come this far and are looking at this cd wondering if you should buy it do it, it will not dissapoint.Peace

B000050XEI|5.0|Enya's CDs follow a formula --- short instrumental, something upbeat, something mellow, something in Latin, something in Gaelic, etc., etc.  And of course there are the requisite 6,000 tracks of Enya's voice.  Yes, this could become boring after a time.  &quot;Memory of Trees&quot; was sort of stale, but &quot;Day Without Rain&quot; brings back &quot;Watermark&quot; and &quot;Shepherd Moons.&quot;  I know, everyone loves &quot;Only Time,&quot; but my personal favorite on this album is &quot;Flora's Secret.&quot;  Am I the only one who *loves* this song?
B000002KXO|4.0|If you listen to Fleetwood Mac's MIRAGE with any sort of expectations, you're going to be disappointed. It's not a proper follow-up to their brilliant 1979 disc, TUSK, nor does it really reach the heights and depths of RUMOURS, which they clearly aimed to accomplish. And sometimes you do get the feeling this is a band going through the motions. However, if you listen long enough, it becomes clear that while there's no new ground being broken, or any incredible sonic surprises, this is a very intelligent, well-made album, featuring material from all three songwriters that might not represent their best work, but is all on par with eachother, in a way that creates a very unified album. And the sound does recall a bit of RUMOURS, and a bit of TUSK as well-- they'd already broken through the wall, you can't exactly go back and pretend nothing had happened. Christine McVie's songs are just as catchy as ever-- &quot;Hold Me,&quot; a teriffic single with a great duet with Lindsey, &quot;Only Over You&quot; (with a special thanks nod to Dennis Wilson-- his influence is clear), and the opener &quot;Love In Store&quot; are all very quaint tunes, all about eagerly expecting new love yet remaining fragile enough to be a little hesitant. Maybe Christine was predictable, but she was also reliable. Only the Elton John-ish &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is a little subpar. Stevie Nicks' songs on this album are teriffic, there's very little of the welsh witch ramblings that occasionally bog her songs down. They're well written, personal songs, almost as if her recent solo ventures had spawned a bit of a change in her own persona. Most people don't like it, but I'm a big fan of &quot;That's Alright.&quot; I think it's a wonderful song, especially the chorus-- some great chords in there. &quot;Gypsy&quot; is a ready-made classic, one of the Mac's (and Stevie's) best. And &quot;Straight Back&quot; is also teriffic, even if musically it's a lot like &quot;Sisters Of The Moon.&quot; Themajor disappointment is Lindsey Buckingham-- after the wild ride he took us all on with TUSK and his first solo album, it's almost like he took some valium before recording the record. But just the same, his songs are very catchy, and he does manage to sneak a few little idiosyncracies into the proceedings (the way his voice cries on &quot;Can't Go Back,&quot; the 50's-style &quot;Oh Diane,&quot; and of course the incessant Eyes Eyes Eyes chant on &quot;Eyes Of The World&quot;). And Lindsey's now a full-fledged producer on the album-- his attention to detail and arrangement are evident throughout, in ways this record is more complex and interesting than RUMOURS. All in all, nothing spectatular, but a very smart, quaint offering by Fleetwood Mac. The next album would have more innovations, but this one's certainly pleasent. Buy it, but don't have any expectations!
B000002UTT|5.0|This album was the first from Roxette released in the US!<BR>This one was released in North America when &quot;The Look&quot; came at No. 1 in the States... Then, the other singles from the album were &quot;Listen To Your Heart&quot; came at No. 1, &quot;Dressed For Success&quot; came at No. 2 and &quot;Dangerous&quot; came at No. 2.<BR>The best songs on the album are the greatest hits above and &quot;Chances&quot; that was a great song!<BR>So, this is a worth buying! That's why I gave 5 stars...
B00005221L|5.0|Ok so the dvd is not great and could use a sepcail edition later on because all you get here is a trailer for the movie but on the good side you get DTS sound!.<BR>but you have a damn good action movie so i can live with the dvd being just ok.....<BR>this movie kicked off a whole line of products, from many many comics (they just had a Justice league vs predator comic and a superman vs predator comic!) so that tells you how good this damn movie is.<br />if your an Arnold fan or just a fan of action movies then do pick this up, or if you read the comics or played the many games but never seen this then you MUST watch it.
B00004SU5J|5.0|It was instant karma. Love at first listen. Jazz lovers will not be disappointed with this CD. This is one of those albums that you just don't get tired of listening to.
6302765536|4.0|I have been a fan of Mr. Culkin since the film Rocket Gibraltor.  He is a fine fine young talent and simply seems to walk through his parts.  This particular film is not quite as good as the first Home Alone, but that's not Mac's fault, or anyone's that I can see--I still enjoy it a great deal, however, and recommend it to anyone who hasn't already seen it.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Hands down the most perfect action flick ever made!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie is romantic, funny, witty, glamorous, and it has a great plot.  Being a fan of Ewan McGregor, I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies he has made.  Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing with their own voices and &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; makes the soundtrack great.  Baz Luhrmann has outdone himself again, with his wife being his costume designer.  Moulin Rouge is my favorite movie and I'm rating it 5 stars.
6305342768|1.0|The last time I viewed this film was probably about a two years ago. I am still seeing a therapist and having violent dreams of confusion more than anything. Old Bob, the Southern robot friend of the heroes, still haunts me to this day. By the way, why the SOUTHERN accent? Screenplay: ENTER OLD BOB, A LOVABLE, FLOATING, BEAT-UP GARBAGE CAN WITH A SOUTHERN ACCENT-Clearly written after a night of heavy drinking. I still can't decide if that was used to make him more likable or so when he finally dies the viewer is supposed to feel a sense of relief. The other robot is very well spoken and articulate, so in order to make Old Bob appear more inferior, what does one do? PUT A FEW DENTS ON HIM AND GIVE HIM A SOUTHERN ACCENT. Works for me. At least they're not implying anything by doing that. A special guest appearence by Howard the Duck would have given that movie more science-fiction merit. Finally, Maximillian...c'mon now. Is it me or were we supposed to get the impression that he was banging the robot?  Listen for the sounds of the spinning blades that come out of his hands, when it wakes you out of your slumber that's your cue to take it out of the VCR and unrinate on it. Not a bad movie though I must say. Really held my interest. Any word on a sequel?
B00003CY5H|3.0|Only slightly less so than de Niro's last big caper thriller, &quot;Ronin&quot;, you could be forgiven for thinking &quot;The Score&quot; was made in the 70s.  Only the presence of Edward Norton and the liberal use of the f-word link it loosely to the present.  It's also very obviously targetted at a lately adult &quot;born in the 60s&quot; audience.  It screams &quot;sophisticated adults only&quot;, from the big name cast to the cod-jazz soundtrack to the faux-european setting (Montreal doubles for what probably should have been Paris or London).  To its credit, with the exception of &quot;The Crimson Rivers&quot; it is the only big-budget film this year with a plot that keeps working all the way to the end of the 3rd act, and where the French film's plot finally collapses into the improbable this one stays true to its self-imposed &quot;reality&quot; and delivers an obvious but effective double-twist.
B000050XEI|5.0|I've heard &quot;Only time&quot; all summer long.I really enjoyed the single,but not enought to buy Enya's CD,&quot;A Day without Rain.&quot; After 9-11,and what we have all been through,&quot;Only time&quot;  really has special meaning.Its a song to heal,and bring peace to everyone who wants peace.Even the opening Instrumental,&quot;A Day without Rain,&quot; brings confert to our souls.You can't stop thinking about the people who lost there lives,and the loved one's they left behind when you play this song  and &quot;Only time&quot;for some reason,but we know there at a better place.My other favorites,&quot;Deora ar mo chroi.&quot;(This one is outstanding)&quot;Fallen embers,&quot;(A beutifull love ballad)and &quot;Pilgrim.&quot; The last number,&quot;Lazy Day,&quot; would be another fantastic single.If anyone is having trouble getting back to listening to music,&quot;A Day without Rain&quot; is a great begining.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|I've never seen the D live, but I intend to after hearing this album. It's not the greatest disc ever put together, but it's one of the most enjoyable cds put out this year. The banter, which will likely lose its touch with most listeners after a few playthroughs, is hilarious. It is thankfully pushed to the side by the tunes themselves, which are well constructed in some places, and schizophrenic in others. Standard structure is thrown out the window for almost half the pieces, and the result is surprisingly fresh and entertaining.<br />Highlights are the powerhouse opening track, tribute (love the vocal jam), wonderboy, the bursting energy of the one minute that is lee, and the chaotic city hall. Definitely worth the purchase price for those with a taste for good pop/rock and an open mind.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I dont know why everyone is saying that it is so bad cuz i thought that it was a really good movie! all i gotta say is josh hartnett is really hot!! and hes from minnesota like me!  i thought it had enuf about that war that was basicly all that it was about so i dont know why people are saying that it had too much of the love story part and not enuf about the war... but it was a really sad movie too at first when ben dies... and then the end was the saddest part ever when josh dies!! but it was the best movie so i think that everyone should go out and see it or rent it if you havent see it yet... i dont know why you havent?
6300214184|2.0|Some friends and I watched this now-18-year-old flick last weekend, and all I can say is . . . what a feeling.<br />The plot concerns 18 year-old Alex, welder by day, dancer by night, who lives in a converted Pittsburgh warehouse loft and dreams of becoming a ballerina as her grandmother once was. (How Alex has managed to acquire exceptional dance AND blowtorch skills by her 18th birthday is never explained.)<br />As Alex \\"chases\\" her dream (she can't even work up the nerve to take an application to the local dance school from its frosty secretary), things happen. What happens and why is also largely unexplained, but the main sub-plot concerns the blossoming relationship between Alex and the owner of her construction company (who is perhaps twice her age but owns a Porsche). One minute Alex is shy and reluctant to date the boss; the next she's slipping off her bra while asking him if he's ever \\"seen\\" the music. On a later date, she's seductively sucking crab legs in a chic restaurant when his ex-wife (looking like some lost tsarina in her enormous fur hat) comes out of nowhere and provokes a verbal cat-fight, provoking Alex to reveal her revealing \\"tuxedo vest.\\" And when Alex finds out that her man has used his influence to get her a dance audition at the school, she transforms into a wild-eyed, chain-smoking, trenchcoat-wearing hellion. (There's also a sub-plot about rescuing a friend from the \\"bad\\" nude dance club--as opposed to the good one where Alex dances--that is little more than melodramatic filler . . . well, there's a lot of filler, and still the movie barely makes 90 minutes. Not that that's really a bad thing.)<br />The soundtrack is engaging; some of the dancing is exhilarating (even though Jennifer Beals didn't do most of it!). However, this movie is neither a romance nor a drama: it's a long, warped music video. Taken as such, it can be fun. Enjoy for some '80's nostalgia--what a feeling indeed.
0803723865|5.0|I think that The Gruffalo is a really good book for young kids. It don't matter an how big you are just as long as you are happy. It shows that even though you are small or not you can still be happy and have a good time with others.
B000002HRE|1.0|Metallica doesn't want their old fans to call them sellouts. Metallica whines about Napster. Metallica wants us to buy anything that they release. Well it ends here folks. I was looking forward to the release of this album after hearing &quot;Fuel&quot; on the radio. I thought that maybe they had gone back to being Metallica. I hoped that the days of &quot;Bleeding Me&quot; were over. I know what they are capable of, and I was anxious. Well after hearing this album, I was not anxious anymore. I was nauseous. <BR>&quot;Fuel&quot; a good song and is worth one star. All of the rest are awful. Listen to &quot;The Memory Remains.&quot; Marianne Faithfull sounds like a hurt animal. &quot;Unforgiven II&quot; just pisses me off. The first &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was a pretty good song, but this is just so bad I can't even explain it. And I think the one laugh I got out of this album was listening to &quot;Better Than You.&quot; Was James trying to sound like a backstreet boy on purpose? Let's not even talk about &quot;Low Mans Lyric.&quot; <br />Metallica doesn't want me to call them sellouts, but I went to Metallica.com just to see how James is doing in rehab, and it said that I had to pay sixty bucks to become a member before I could enter the &quot;real&quot; website. Metallica doesn't want me to call them sellouts, but they have stopped playing anything from Kill 'em All in concert now. Metallica wants me to believe that they are &quot;evolving&quot; musically, but to me this is not evolution. They are NOT improving anything that they did previously. They are making music that is radio friendly. They are doing ANYTHING for a buck. If that isn't selling out guys, then what is? Metallica may not have &quot;sold out,&quot; but whatever they did, it sucks. I have lost all respect for Metallica.
B000002MG1|5.0|REM is probably the best band of the past 20 years.  This is some of their best music. <br />I can't think of an REM album that doesn't have at least one truly great song (and I mean capital G Great), but what sets Automatic for the People apart is that probably half the songs are that good.  If I were being sent to a desert island and could have one 90-minute tape to listen to, &quot;Drive,&quot; &quot;Try Not to Breathe,&quot; &quot;Nightswimming,&quot; and &quot;Find the River&quot; would all go on that tape.  And that list shows the depth of this recording, because I'm guessing that &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; would be on a lot of people's lists and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; would be on a few more.  <br />This is a more contemplative, quiet record than much of what REM's done, and this may be yet another measure of their greatness as a band, that they can do both styles successfully.  You might want to know of the difference in style before you buy this, but even if you're a rock fan and question this style of music, try this record.  It's just that good.
B000003NA3|5.0|Let's keep this review simple. If you like Coltrane you will love this CD. If you are not that familiar with him these are the best live recordings of Coltrane. They capture his artistic genius and the improvisational techniques that are matched only by his innovation. Take for example his ability to try an unconventional assembly of instruments and sidemen to further the art of jazz. Case in point is his featuring Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet, and other sidemen playing contrabassoon, oboe and the oud. If you think you've heard plenty or enough Coltrane this recording will change that outlook. To say he was innovative in his approach to jazz would be an understatement. Each disc ontains five or six songs but each song runs in the 10-15 minute range bringing in each disc at  an hour plus. Included are 22 peformances over four days, all captured here in brilliant sound by Rudy Van Gelder, who was Trane's favorite recording engineer that captured those moments in 1961 in New York. Although some of the songs are repeated on each disc it doesn't matter because they are treated and performed differently in each case. There are four different versions of the Indian sounding modal &quot;India&quot; which is played in the style reminiscent of his alto reworking of &quot;My Favorite Things.&quot; Another song featured in variance several times is &quot;Naima,&quot; one of his classic trademark songs most easyly identified. His version of the tradional song &quot;Greensleeves&quot; is unconventional yet recognizeable. Words are hard to describe this CD  and fall short  as it is nonverbal communication. In an attempt to convey some feelings to describe the music here a few thoughts that come to mind. The music is powerful, illuminating, haunting, spiritual, revolutionary, overwhelming,transcendental, joyful, exhausting, exhillirating, insightful, gritty, deep, fascinating, timeless, complex yet melodic but always stretching the known and unknown for the advancement of jazz. I only own a couple of box sets and this one is possibly the best and nothing short of fantastic.  The box set is small(a plus)  and  comes with his complete discography on Impulse, each disc is in it's own case, has fantastic artwork and photographs and a booklet that is filled with plenty of information about Trane and these historic sessions. This is essential desert island music. Buy this now.nly own a couple of box sets and this one is possibly the best and nothing short of fantastic.

B00003CXP1|5.0|this movie grips the viewer virtually from the start and doesn't let go....the actors do an amazing job and aronofsky's directing and use of unique visual representations combine for a great movie and DVD.....watch it if you like things that are different, slightly attack your sanity and cool
B00005NZBN|5.0|This is a two cut CD that harks back to his acoustic days a reworking of 100 miles and The Times They Are A'Changing. Both compliment the somgs on LOVE AND THEFT
B00004Z511|3.0|Sure, there are a lot of interesting sounds on this album. And a few of the songs are even brilliant. However, it lacks the impact and originality of OK Computer. While many see it as a transformation of the band, I just see it as a rebirth of sounds that have already been covered by such artists as Aphex Twin and Brian Eno. I think Radiohead should have stuck to what they were good at.
0517122707|5.0|Very funny book.  I couldn't put it down.

6302787556|5.0|Denzel Washington is one of the most influential black actors since Sidney Portier and Morgan Freeman in my own opinion. I loved this movie, and I think nobody could have portrayed  Malcolm X, a icon in African American history better than Denzel Washington. I think somebody else said it best when they said &quot;Denzel has been robbed&quot; because this movie was definitely one of the rawest biographies I have ever watched.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|It is clear from the DVD edition that Disney has put together for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; the beloved film enshrined in cinema history as the first full-length animated film, that this is the standard by which all future Disney releases will be judged.  Your kids or grandchildren might find the animation to be somewhat quaint, but they will certainly be impressed by this &quot;Immersive 2-Disc DVD Experience.&quot;  There is so much to do with the extras that they might even forget to actually watch the movie, which has been digitally restored.  However, this would be a big mistake as you are not going to be able to solve the puzzles and win &quot;Dopey's Wild Mine Ride&quot; game if you have not seen the film.<br />Everything is hosted by either Roy Disney or the Magic Mirror on the Wall (you have to love that that dry sense of humor), and what they have on the first disc along with the movie is enough to thrill any fan of Snow White.  You can listen to Barbra Streisand sing &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; or you can all sing the Karaoke version of &quot;Heigh-Ho.&quot;  Then there is &quot;The Making of 'Snow White'&quot; documentary, the aduio commentary and even the Silly Symphony cartoon &quot;Goddess of Spring.&quot;  And all of this is before you even get to the second disc where you are simply going to find what must be EVERYTHING Disney has relating to this film as we explore &quot;The Legacy of 'Snow White.'&quot;  There are not just deleted scenes and a deleted song (&quot;You're Never Too Old To Be Young&quot;), there are abandoned concepts for several scenes, such as a &quot;fantasy version&quot; of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come.&quot;  Just look at the Edition Details for this DVD: have you ever seen a list that long?  It took me the entire weekend just to get through MOST of what is on this DVD.<br />Yes, you bought the Disney animated films on videotape and then you went out and got them on DVD.  But the extras alone are worth the price of this first &quot;Platinum Edition.&quot;  Most importantly, Disney has clearly made a covenant with its audience that this is indeed the level of excellence they will do with their entire collection of classic films and I only hope they do this not just for &quot;Pinocchio&quot; but also for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; as well.  This is what happens when a studio cherishes its classic films as much as we do.one are worth the price of this first &quot;Platinum Edition.&quot;  Most importantly, Disney has clearly made a covenant with its audience that this is indeed the level of excellence they will do with their entire collection of classic films and I only hope they do this not just for &quot;Pinocchio&quot; but also for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; as well.

B00005NWM3|2.0|When I heard This Is How You Remind Me on the radio knew that I wanted to get the CD.  I was hoping that it would have some great variety as the song itself had but I was wrong.  The CD just sounds like it's the same song played over and over again.  I bought it for the one song, so that was my fault but I guess higher expectations just hurt my rating of the cd in general.... sorry if I have offended anyone.  I just feel that their last CD was better in my opinion.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Everyone's a critic these days, or so it seems from the opinions on here.  Come on!!!  This CD is really good -- much better than I thought it would be, having heard all of Ryan's earlier discs including those from Whiskeytown.  It calls to mind lots of very excellent influences -- such as the Rolling Stones (seriously) in Exile on Main Street form, Van Morrison, and Counting Crows (even has Adam Duritz singing backup).  It is extremely listenable, rarely boring and quite varied.  The musicians and singers backing Ryan up are fabulous and the songs themselves are truly good -- his best to date, for sure.  It's sort of a rocking-singer-songwriter disc that doesn't rock too hard and doesn't put you to sleep.  If you like any of the noted influences, you are likely to like this one.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|WOW! This is one heck of a DVD! The extras are endless and a blast to boot, I spent over 3 hours just with the features alone, there are interactive tours, video games, commentaries, music videos, old animation scenes, and tons of other stuff. The movie speaks for itself, classic disney, the transfer is excellent for a film of this age. With this DVD Disney shows us that they can make DVD's that can appeal to anyone, young or old, this ranks up there with the Terminator 2 DVD as one of the best ever, if you are a fan of this movie or if you have kids, don't miss this DVD

B00005J6RE|4.0|It seems like quality control has waivered as the series releases have slowly rolled out.  Look for spelling errors in the enclosed documentation.  I even received the wrong insert in one of the volumes I ordered (Vol.29)  Sound and video is just as good as watching it on TV (4:3 ratio, stereo sound.)<br />If your not expecting bells and whistles, as might be expected, you will be disappointed.  However, if you just want to collect Trek, you will be pleased.
B00005N9CV|2.0|There's probably no bigger fan of Diana Krall around then myself, but I have to say that with each CD she moves farther away from what made her special in the first place. She is experiencing what I call &quot;George Benson-ization&quot;. Let me explain...<br />A long time ago, George Benson showed promise as one of the great jazz acoustic guitarists, in the mold of Wes Montgomery. After he released more than a few tunes with vocals, it seemed that his guitar playing became secondary as he became more of a pop singer than an &quot;artist&quot;. Soon, he was irrelevant within the genre of jazz. If one listens to early Diana Krall, we hear her superb piano style, as well as her rough but greatly interpretive vocals. But with each successive album, and in keeping with her expanding popularity, her albums are increasing string-laden and, well, syrupy. The arrangements not only overwhelm the vocals, but in many cases seem to lack any relation to the emotional viewpoint of the song. And where's the piano?<br />My feeling is that her record label is pushing her toward the mainstream, when they should be letting her follow her muse and allow the mainstream to come to her due to the force of her talent. Either way, I hope that she will again someday get back to the jazz combo sound that made her special in the first place.
B000008H1Y|5.0|Here, for me, was where my obsession with Tull began.  A badly dubbed copy from an old highschool friend drove me to believe that I really AM Ian Anderson's long-lost illigitimate child!<br />This collection is divine for any lover of folk, fine music... or have a touch of fey running through their veins.  Spritely tunes about spritely creatures like the Jack-in-the-Green, to the warming love tune Fire and Midnight, the whole disc frolicks and meanders with a technical mastery I have only seen from Ian and the Boys.  A must have for any Tull fan, fantasy freak, or folklore lover.  'S magick, I tell ye.
B00005LKIM|3.0|&quot;Hannibal&quot; was a pretty O.K movie except for the fact that Jodie Foster wasn't in it. As a southern woman, I must say that Julianne Moore had one of the worst southern accents I have ever heard before, and she didn't bring any justice to Clarice Starling. However, I did love the story, and I thought it was a good thriller. It wasn't necessarily what I thought it was going to be. When you say a name like Hannibal Lector you think of cannibal, but in my opinion he hardly did any killing, and those he did kill weren't killed in the fashion that I thought Hannibal Lector had become accustomed to. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a classic, but I guess you could say that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a fairly good movie, certainly not one of the best though.
0930289331|4.0|This book is pretty good. It has a greta intirpritation of how bataman came to be and about a young police cop named Gordan.  This is great because it shows batman bleeding and not always succeding like in many other books and movies. it shows him learning as he goes along. The thing that dissappointed me was that I felt like this book could of gone on for a couple more pages.  it has a great plot but i thought the ending happended to quickly.  It's still a great book though and hopefully the next batman movie they make will be based of this book.
0380778556|5.0|As an inspirational romance author, I found Rebecca to be intense and gripping.  Daphne DuMaurier did a wonderful job of capturing the flavor of the era.  Her characters were real, even the dead Rebecca, the first Mrs. De Winter, invokes her evil through her loyal servant Ms. Danvers.  And, when the innocent second Mrs. De Winter enters the scene, she discover Manderley is not a fairy tale land as Mrs. Van Hopper described, but a breathing, seething, bleeding house with many secrets, buried and alive.  Life will never be the same for the innocent Mrs. De Winter as she discovers, learns and fights for her own destiny.  I couldn't put this book down.  And, now I'm reading it's sequel, &quot;Mrs. De Winter&quot; by Susan Hill, and so far, I'm not disappointed.  If you're in for a cozy thriller with plenty of twists and turns, then this is the book for you.  Good reading, and I bid you good dreams.  By Kelly R. Stevens, author of &quot;Ragdoll, Song of the Cimarron,&quot; and &quot;One With the Wind.&quot;

0790734591|5.0|I am one of the biggest Bruce Willis fans. Let me tell you, if you like action and Bruce all rolled into one, then you will definitely love this movie. Bruce was sharp, smoothe, and clever (as always)playing a private detective Joe (Joeseph)Hollinbeck assigned to protect stripper Cori, played briefly by Halle Berry. Damon Wayons also puts on a excellent performance too as Jimmy (James)Dicks an ex football star. In my opinion this movie has it all, corruption, action, blackmailing, and murder.
B00005A46T|1.0|Why why why oh why isn't 0 stars an option?  How stupid are all of you people?  Any idiot can jump around in a clown suit screaming swear words at the top of his lungs for an entire album while 8 other people in clown suits bang on their instruments like a bunch of 2-year olds in the background....If this is supposed to be metal, take me back to the days when those little things like melody, lyrical content, and, oh yeah, the ability to SING meant something...Slipknot is just another manufactured fake-offensive crap metal collective, and it is a shame that so many young fans are being duped into listening to this crap...I would rather listen to nails on a chalkboard than submit myself to this vile, putrid mess of an album again....If this is the future of music, shoot me now
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I loved this movie and the soundtrack is definitely just as good..I love El Tango de Roxanne, and everything seems pieced together beautifully.  The real highlight of this album is the last song, Rufus Wainwright's fabulous salon song, Compliante de La Butte, he's wonderful and perfect for this ong.<BR>The album is very good and I recommend it highly, but seeing the movie also helps; to see all these songs in context is just thrilling!
B00003CXE7|2.0|Ugh. I consider this movie a total waste of time for anyone who has been to see more than 10 movies in their lifetime. That's because anyone who might have,has seen every lame trick in this movie used again and again. I don't know where to begin as the list would be too long.<BR>I liked Russell in LA Confidential and that's about it. The mere thought of him having a Best Actor trophy makes me shudder.I  mean, come on-all he had to do to prepare for this role was cut out 5 hours of sleep every night. His routine with the scowling and talking raspy got so old after the first half-hour, I still ask myself why I didn't leave the theatre at any point thereafter. My bad. <BR>I will give the movie credit for the few fightscenes that came across as very brutal and somewhat epic, but these moments are basically few and far between. Sets are pretty much flawless and the costumes are well done, both of which create total believability in the environments. Ok, enough with the compliments.<br />Overall, I feel Im being generous giving Gladiator 2 stars, but had it not been for the re-re-re-re-hashed plot, the look and style of the film could have made it the classic so many seem to think this is. Avoid this fesces.
0767851900|5.0|I think this one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Not only was it funny, but it had a great message.  Let's hear it for Jersey Boys done good!!
0767853946|4.0|I really love this movie because Martin and Will both light up the screen. Will Smith proves he can be serious, and Martin is just Martin (as always). I thought it was very highly action packed, and not boring at all.
B00005BF9Z|3.0|ok, don't get me wrong, I LOVE Clandestino, play it, sing it, can't imagine the world without it bla bla bla. So the day Esperanza comes out I go buy it without bothering to listen to it. That's what real fans do. Well, I like it, but it sounds &quot;rechauffe&quot; as we say in french, or &quot;reheated&quot; or &quot;recalentado&quot;. It sounds THE SAME as Clandestino. Which is fine. But I don't think I'll get #3 so eagerly.
0783226063|4.0|David Lynch's film version of Dune became a highly controversial work. Although it is considered one the most impressive failures of film history, it has also become a cult film among many &quot;Dune&quot; fans. Even today, almost 20 years after it was made, opinions towards it are most of the times polarized.<br />In the early 80's, Lynch was a young director who had just made himself a name with &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;. Curiously enough, instead of relying on a mature director, Dino de Laurentis offered him the direction (and the writing of the script) of his next big production: &quot;Dune&quot;. Lynch at those times had not even read the novel!. The charge of the production was to be given to another relatively new comer: Rafaella De Laurentis (Dino's daughter). Lynch was given tons of resources to make a classic: a tremendous cast, excellent technicians, magical special effects (for that era), shooting on live locations and many, many etceteras. What resulted from all this was almost great...almost. <br />Yes, the task of translating Frank Herbert's Magnus Science fiction opus to a film has to be considered gargantuan, nevertheless, the film fails not in the &quot;gargantuan&quot; aspects, but in its finesses. Specifically, I consider that the film fails due to its blurred script. Probably it was an error to let Lynch write the script. The issue maybe was that at that time he was not &quot;immersed&quot; enough in the Dune universe so as to achieve a clarity that could make the general public grasp what was going on this complex story. We can give thanks to Lynch that we did not get a kind of &quot;Star Wars&quot; plot that would have been far worse, but as it is, the film remains clueless to many common spectators. <br />I also consider that some of Lynch's added personal details like the heart plugs of the Harkonnen soldiers, the bloody scenes of the Baron, and the terribly awful rain ending are negative points that to my humble opinion can be consideredof simply bad taste. Cheap errors that the great cast would have managed to surprass in the case that they would have been given a congruent and effective script.<br />Taking this aside, we can consider &quot;Dune&quot; an impressive achievement in many fields; let's just mention some of them:<br />* An excellent cast lead by a consistent (with the Herbert book) Paul Atreides played by Kyle MacLachlan (whose career unfortunately never went too far), a majestic Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis), an excellent noble Duke Leto (Jurgen Prochnow), a superb Gurney Halleck  (a young and impetuous Patrick Stewart!), a loyal Duncan Idaho (Richard Jordan), a tough Stilgar (Everett McGill), a mysterious Dr. Keynes (Max Von Sydow), a wise Thufir Hawatt (Freddie Jones) and we could go on and on. The casting question mark was definitively Sting unconvincingly playing Feyd-Rautha: he never fits along the great group of actors that were around him. Also, to my personal feeling José Ferrer is quite stiff playing the Emperor Padishah.<br />* Nicely developed creatures by Carlo Rimbaldi (take for example the navigator and the worms...considering 1980's standards) and credible special effects lead by Kit West.<br />* A beautiful music score by Toto who managed to create a distinctive &quot;Dune&quot; feeling with an effective synthesis of classic and pop elements. A track by Brian Eno (The Prophecy Theme) added even more weight to the musical part.<br />* Well chosen desert filming sites (it was in Mexico), exuberant costumes and beautifully created and constructed stages (for example the Emperor's Throne Room, The scenes inside Sietch Tabr main room, the Arrakeen and Caladan palaces, etc).<br />Overall, this is a magnificent production marred by an erratic script, which nevertheless is worth viewing.
B00005QATY|5.0|I think this was George Clooney's best ...he was GREAT!  My entire family as well as friends watched the movie and the next day went out and bought the sound track and have been playing it almost constantly.  good entertainment...THANKS GEORGE!
B00005ASOI|2.0|the 2 stars are for the soundtrack I have been waiting eagerly for this DVD to hear it in DTS surround. Even up on volume 15 the music is struggling to get thru. It sounds so very suppressed. The music on the soundtrack is better. I remember seeing this movie 24 yrs ago and the music was deafening in the theatre.<BR>Apart from that the picture quality is excellent with vibrant color. Shame about the sound
B00003CX9E|5.0|I'll be succinct.  This is a high quality, classic film of lust for power, position, and love.  It is a gripping wonderful story from genius in the golden age.  Even though it doesn't have flashy effects, violence, or nudity it is an entertaining experience, one far more powerful than any contemporary film. It may not be the best movie ever, but it is a great film.  Anyone that says otherwise is either too dense or has too short of an attention span to understand this.  If you enjoy art and a thought-provoking plot, buy this DVD.
B000003CMB|5.0|With two killer guitarists and the distant thunder of two drummers The Allmans were a monumental outfit. Nowhere was the grandeur of their sound captured better than on this legendary live-set. Though the music is largely blues-based, the Brothers carry you through an array of vast American soundscapes. Everything they say about this is true. Go for it.
B000000W5L|5.0|THIS IS IT...THE BEST ROCK AND ROLL ALBUM EVER MADE.<BR>Just thought I'd'get that part out of the way immediately.<BR>I first listened to this album at the tender young age of 15, when of course I could never even come close to understanding what it was about. But that sound....that raunchy Keith guitar...that fogginess....the emotion in songs like Loving Cup and Torn and Frayed....ah, the pain of it. The sweet pain.<BR>Has there ever been a better album kick-off riff than what we are treated to in Rocks Off? A better campfire singalong than Sweet Virginia? A wierder Stones moment than the switchover of songs at the beginning of Just wanna see His Face? Too many unforgettable moments to mention in one review.<BR>I have listened to this album in all phases of life, and in every imaginable state of mind I have found myself to be in.<BR>I have every Stones album and this one remains closest to the heart. I mean, it is just there.<BR>This album just takes you to another place. <BR>If it's not an instant grabber like , say &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; or &quot;Some Girls&quot; is, please....give it a few more listens. <BR>You will realize. And you will be hooked.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Lucas has lost his touch.<br />First off, if you have a somewhat poor script (written by Lucas himself, if I'm not mistaken), then you get an entirely CGI character thrown at you, which you have to act like you're interacting with, and then half the time you're put in front of a green screen (or blue) with nothing real around you, how are you going to act well? You don't. Even Liam Neeson (a usually excellent actor) did a flat job.<BR>Jar Jar Binks stinks like nothing I've ever seen in a movie. A complete waste of film space, and completely unnecessary! He nearly RUINED the film. A few scenes could have been incredibly powerful were it not for him swaggering around with his floppy ears filling up half the screen. There are even people who have taken the time to make Jar Jar hate sites! A total goof ball... agh... I can't go on writing about him.<BR>Lucas even managed to inject more eastern religion psyco babel. It's a bunch of rot, and really annoying. &quot;Ooh, there's some weird little things called 'mediclorians.' The more of 'em that I have, the cooler with the force. Whoa.&quot; (not a direct quote!;)<BR>Other than the poor script, the flat acting, the bad story flow, the egregious Jar Jar, and a mediocre soundtrack for Williams (except for Duel of the Fates!), the pod race and saber fight still make it worth watching!<BR>Just rent it when you don't want to watch the old ones, but still want to see something like the old Star Wars (it has an essence, but a very weak one at that).
B00000IAU3|5.0|I was sceptical about purchasing this at first.  I only knew the re-released 'Thank you' track (which originally appeared on the 1997 movie 'Sliding Doors)' but after one listen I was hooked.  The opening track 'Here With Me' gives you a clue what you are in for: brilliant tracks.  Sure, there are weak spots but in fact only one!  Yes only one weak spot on the entire album - the track 'I'm No Angel'.  Key favourites of this masterpiece include 'Don't Think of Me' (surely a possible single), 'My Lover's Gone' and the dance song 'Take My Hand'.  Note that 'Take My Hand' could do very well as a dance hit if it got the airplay.  <BR>I hope we hear more of Dido, as she is refreshing, brilliant and deserves every bit of success.  I rarely give an album 5 stars but this one is richly deserving.
0375751513|3.0|When I first began reading this book I was intrigued. The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.<br />However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;.
B000002GQG|5.0|Say what you want about this CD sounding outdated now, the bottom line is that it remains a pure smorgasbord of beautiful sounds and pleasure to the ears!! And let's be honest : it is a happy album...a feel good album, if you will. Nothing like walking through the woods still wet with rain and letting a song like Voices in the Sky drift through your headphones. Or how about Dr. Livingstone, I presume or The Actor....peace of mind prevails after a listen to this gem. You can hear it in Justin Haywards'voice - he has found it, as should we...<BR>Get it ... and enjoy......

He notices differences that he's never seen before.  His perfect little town seems to come to start losing its appeal when he learns more about the \\"outside.\\"  This is a great book for children to read, and a great book for older kids to look into the \\"hidden\\" meanings.  I encourage people of all ages to read it.<BR>-MM, Sunapee High School.
0440219078|5.0|The book &quot;The Giver&quot; is an excellent book! I have read it twice, and I am not tired of it at all. In fact, I could probably read it over and over again, because there is so much emotion in it. When I read the book, I became overwhelmed at how society could become so uncaring, how all of the memories from the past could have been eliminated and forgotten. Sometimes, the society in the book didn't seem that far off from our society today, which is a little scary! I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good narrative story that is a little out there and that really makes you stop and think, &quot;Wow, could this really happen today?&quot;
B00003CXZ4|5.0|There isn't much to say about this that hasn't already been said in the other 260+ reviews. The fact that this many people can review a film and still have it rate close to five stars ought to tell you all you need to know about it.<br />For my money, this is one of the most clever and innovative movies I've ever seen. The scripwriting is phenomenal. The acting is first-rate. There are enough clever twists and turns in it to hold your attention. And it bears repeated watchings, which only tend to make it better.<br />What more can be asked of a movie?<br />Please do yourself a favor and rent -- better yet, buy -- this unique movie. You won't be sorry.
B000002UA2|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the most underrated albums in the history of music.<BR>This is Pink Floyd at their absolute best. This is an album that deserves to be regarded as being on the same level as The Wall, Wish you were here, or Dark Side of the Moon. <BR>For some reason, it's not nearly as famous. Perhaps because it was rush-recorded in a weeks' time, sandwiched in between tours and sessions for Dark Side. A few months in the studio to iron out the rough edges might have been the difference.<BR>But I still say it's right up there.<BR>The album begins with majestically with soaring Gilmour guitar in Obscured by Clouds, which leads into When you're in. The stage is set for what's to come..<BR>And that is Burning Bridges, which contains some of the most beautiful moments Gilmour and Wright were to have together on record, definitely more so than the following years' Time.<BR>Then a fantastic rocker : The Gold it's in the..., followed by the pure magic of Wots...Uh the Deal. Wow. I can't even find the words to describe the atmosphere created in this song. And what about Mudmen, then... I read another review mentioning that this could have been the perfect candidate for an extended jam, a la Shine on...<BR>You couldn't be more right. Put it down to the limited time they had to get this baby done.<BR>Again, I'm at a loss for words when it comes to the brilliance of Childhood's End. Geez, what was Gilmour on during these sessions...the sheer fire and intensity of this song is second to none....I guess it was just the pure adrenaline of being in one the best bands that exist and about to conquer the world at that...Whatever it was, this stuff is just incredible!<BR>Then finally...here he is...Roger! Free Four was his first dabble into the topics of insanity, life and  death (most notably the death of his father in WWII - mentioned for the first time here), and rock 'n roll excess, among oh so many other things.<BR>Then we find Richard Wright reaching his personal zenith with the gorgeous Stay. Aaaaaaaah, man. What can I say, you just gotta listen to it. It might not grab you the first time. Give it another listen. And another.<BR>Oh yeah, and the album ends with a track as weird as anything Floyd has ever recorded in Absolutely Curtains. If anyone can tell me where that final singalong clip comes from I'll be eternally grateful.<br />Happy listening and enjoy the magic!
B000001E18|5.0|This CD completely blew me away - I knew not to expect classic U2, but this was more than I could have ever imagined! Each song has a certain quality about it (each and every track has radio playability) and was unfairly reviewed by critics at the time of its release. There is a track for every occasion. BUY IT!
0440219078|4.0|In a community where people know nothing about real life, Jonas must learn the memories of humankind that have been hidden for generations.  His simple, yet new and amazing, discoveries open his eyes to the miserable, opressive conditions under which people in his society live, and his relationship with the giver develops into a strong bond as the novel progresses.  <br />An excellent piece of juvenile literature, The Giver provides a warning for civilization not to become too \\"civilized.\\"
B000002KHB|3.0|As many, i used to see MH as Purple's best ever, but time changed my mind. Though I continue believing that MH is one of the classic trilogy of the band (the other 2 are &quot;In rock&quot; and &quot;Fireball&quot;, of course), I put it now on the 3rd. place. The earlier &quot;In rock&quot; is sharper and more interesting (sadly, the band does'nt do much of it in concerts, besides &quot;Speed king&quot; and &quot;Child in time&quot;) and &quot;Fireball&quot; is a clever semi-progressive album, that sounds today almost fresh as it was in 1971. In its time, MH brought heavy metal to every home, like the Floyd's &quot;Dark side of the moon&quot;, that introduced the world the progressive rock. Now we don't need it anymore. I'm not saying that the album is bad. It includes music that is made for live concerts more than a studio. &quot;Highway star&quot;, &quot;Lazy&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the water&quot; sound much better in &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. &quot;Maybe I'm a leo&quot; and &quot;Pictures of home&quot; are better in &quot;Live in Olympia&quot;. So MH is an important album for the band, in historical point of view, but not that important to the 21st. centuey listener.
0553269631|5.0|I'm a teenager who read this book as part of an English assignment and about 15 minutes ago finished this book while strewn across the chair with tears streaming down my face.<BR>It is har to find books that truly reach inside you and shake you up, but when you do, it's like visiting with a long lost friend.<BR> The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is one of those books.  It is about a small southern town and all the people that exist in it.  Exist isn't quite the right word though, it is more like they are standing on the outside looking in.  Each character- Mick, Jake Blount, the doctor, Mr. Brannon, are hopelessly lost and the truth is just out of their grasp.  They each have a piece missing and seek to fill it with drinking, sex, music, or just hiding from their problems.  I find it ironic  that the only one they can tell their problems to is the deaf-mute, Mr. Singer, for he is the only one that listens.<BR>It was so real in some places that I was amazed that someone didn't read my mind, such as when Mick was talking about entering the &quot;inside place&quot; where music existed.<BR>This book and its story will surely stay in my mind and haunt me for a long while.
B00000BKDY|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say that everyone who is trying to rate which album or song is the best, worst, or whatever, is wasting time. Iron Maiden is just the best heavy metal band of all time period. Every album that they have cranked out is fantastic, with the possible exceptions of the 2 with Blaze Bailey- nothing against him, it's just not Bruce or Paul, (in my opinion, the vocals didn't cut it and the songs seemed to be written without much direction, and it all seems very repetitive. I also don't care for Steve playing bass chords too much.) But back to the review: the synthesized guitars added a new dimension to their sound, but it still grabs ya by the right spot and rocks you hard. I really regret not seizing the opportunity to go see them live for this tour, I kick myself often. I have seen them 3 other times, though, all wonderful shows! This cd is definitely a great one, but your collection absolutely has a gaping hole in it without each and every one of their cd's. This band is the epitome of musical genius!!! Somewhere In Time is definitely worth having. Ironhead.
B000005RG5|5.0|Regardless of what some people might say, this album has aged very well. Like all of Nazareth's best work, there is more diversity here than on alot of releases from that time period and certainly more than you hear on hardrock and metal discs today. The title track still  hits as hard today as it did then and though even some die-hard fans may take shots at &quot;Love Hurts&quot;, we all know no one's ever done a better song of this nature. The reality is Nazareth pretty much created the &quot;power ballad&quot;, but don't hold that against them, it's not thier fault that most everyone else has done them so badly. Looking back , I realize now more than I did then what a great album this is.  Nazareth's music sounds a lot less dated than alot of the giants of the time that so many still  worship today. Led Zeppelin and many others can only wish they aged so well. Anyone who wants to debate that fact needs to go back and listen to Zep's &quot;In though the Out Door&quot;.
B000002JSP|5.0|In through the out door is one of zep's best albums.Fool in the Rain, Hot Dog, and All of my love are awesome songs exemplifying John Paul Jones' talent with a keyboard.  South Bound Saurez has a feel good groove, but IN the Evening is up there with when the levee breaks and kashmir in powerful repition of chords producing a hypnotizing effect.  THis cd is awesome, one of Zep's best, an d should not be overlooked.
B00000JGEI|4.0|Ok,  this movie is really good.  If you've seen the first one you know that in the future(well acctually Judgement day...According to the movie,  was suppose to  have happened 4 years ago)a program called Skynet has waged war on mankind with an army of robots.  However a man, John Conner,  insures the victory of the humans over the robots.  Knowing its own doom,  Skynet created a new type of robot.  Something that feels no pitty, no pain, no fear...The Terminator.<BR>Skynet sent the terminator back in time to kill Coner's mother before he was even born.  But Conner,  sends back a soldier to stop the terminator.<BR>    Now in this,  the sequal,  young Conner is with foster parents and his mother is in a mental institution.  Skynet,  in an attempt to assasinate Conner,  sends back another Terminator in time to kill him.  However, Conner(from the future) reprograms another Terminator to protect  young conner.  Now,  in the preasant day,  the two terminators fight a battle wich will decide the future of the planet and mankind.<BR>With alot of action and some neat terminator effects,  this movie is on of the best around, though the original &quot;The Terminator&quot; will always remain a classic.  I very highly reccomend that you see this movie and the original terminator.<br />Did you find this review helpful?  If you did, I ask that you please vote.  Thank you.
B00005QATY|5.0|I haven't seen many films in recent memory that I am so impressed by as the one I just watched this evening.  &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou&quot; is brilliant, not a word I use in reference to many American films.  Truly, the Coen Brothers are cinematic geniuses I now acknowledge!  &quot;Fargo&quot; was excellent, but not great as this one is.  I didn't see all five nominated films for Best Picture this year, but I cannot believe that ANY one was superior to this one.  Granted, the Coens were not marketing the film to the usual 14-year-old money-making mentality of most of the recent blockbuster American films, but  in its comedic brilliance, the Brothers skirt thither and yon with articulation rarely seen; they combine the best nuances of the Foreign Film with the power that American films can (but usually don't) produce.  The clever literary allusions crocheted tantalizingly with Southern Depression lore was excruciatingly<br />&quot;to the point,&quot; and with refreshing originality (another rarity in Hollywood)!  And George Clooney--who'd have thought he could pull off such a role (one tends to remember him as that doctor on that tv program) deserved his honors, and, again, I cannot believe whoever it was who won the Oscar did a better job of acting. (Yes, Mr. Crowe, I mean it!)  Yes, the box office won again, which is the downside of American movie awards, it seems.<br />Clooney's two sidekicks hold their own, easily--actually, they do more than that:  they keep Clooney aloft!  Charles Durning, John Goodman, and Holly Hunter merely gild the lily.  Homer, indeed, is impressed, spinning in his grave, as he must be, to see &quot;The Odyssey&quot; in such a new, and invigorating, light.  With all the bravado and the zany activities, the Coens squeeze in, sometimes subtly, sometimes not, more than a few lessons in social significance, yet without preaching.  One doesn't have to be well-versed in this period of American history (although it must help to recognize the  allusions!) to appreciate the film.  Tomorrow I'm even buying the sound track, so remarkable it is.<br /><br />I've long been a critic of American films, as I've felt most were not worth watching, intellectually.  This one is.

B000002LRX|5.0|I've always been a fan of Mr. Bungle ever since my friend gave me Caliafornia late last year, and I immediately got Disco Volante and the debut, as well as the annoying but brilliant Adult Themes For Voice. Espescially in Bungle, I knew Patton was an ingenius and daring man in music who could hardly be matched. What was better than the endlessly eclectic arrangements was that he was also lyrically talented. Now I know that Faith No More, which maintained a more controlled musical enviroment suited for alternative conoisuers, was just as fantastic. The lyrics are dark in all their beauty, as is the music:<br />&quot;Land Of Sunshine&quot;: A sardonic funk metal number about angels of generic dreams and green minds getting what they deserve, a mixture of laughter and lecture questions along the way.<br />&quot;Caffeine&quot;: Angstish rock at its best. Opened by howler monkeys.<br />&quot;Midlife Crisis&quot;: Geniuses milked to impress, thoughtless middle aged men with jingling pockets and razor incisions of perfection. &quot;Your menstruating heart ain't bleeding enough for two&quot;. Hiphop metal.<br />&quot;RV&quot;: Hilarious song of self pity told through the eyes of a lonely man in an RV, spoken over a piano waltz. &quot;My pants fall down every time I bend over...&quot;<br />&quot;Smaller &amp; Smaller&quot;: Definitely one of the best tracks, disturbed and contemplating. A good attack against fascism.<br />&quot;Everything's Ruined&quot;: More sardonicism. A staged aristocratic family loses all when their posed son is revealed to be fake.<br />&quot;Malpractice&quot;: Sex frenzies, death metal and deranged screams. This breaks in the middle with childish bells to say &quot;Knuckle White, Ruffle White&quot;.<br />&quot;Kindergarten&quot;: Another tale of pity, but this one seems more serious. A guy who keeps failing kindergarten...rock balladry.<BR>Waiting. Bell's not ringing.<br />&quot;Be Aggressive&quot;: Male behaviour in chords. This song is also humorousdue to a chorus sung by cheerleaders.<br />&quot;A Small Victory&quot;: One of my favorites, includes some hiphop sound effects to aid the metal pop.&quot;IT SHOULDN'T BOTHER ME...BUT IT DOES!!!&quot; More angst, they even made an overlooked video for it.<br />&quot;Crack Hitler&quot;: Easily one of the craziest tracks, includes a demented man talking about &quot;bodies floating in the river like fine champagne&quot;...a sarcastic look at Hitler? THere's even what appears to be a Nazi march call in it.<br />&quot;Jizzlobber&quot;: Sounds like some of the recent death metal rap I've heard lately, this song would probably be popular for the Korn generation around now. A good song nonetheless, plus it ends with church organs and medievil choirs. <br />&quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;: No introduction needed here. Sounds like the original...a good ending.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (chosen by horror novelist Ramsey Campbell as the most terrifying movie he has ever seen, well everyone as at least on traumatic Disney viewing experience in their youth - for me it's Bambi) set the foundation upon which ALL of Disney's follow up animated features would be built.  Any fan of Disney, or animated movies in general, will see this as a required addition to their libraries.<br />The almost limitless 'immersive' DVD features will take months to watch and allow people a rare look into the creative process of mounting such a technically challenging project (the first of its kind) as this.<br />The film itself looks flawless, no speck, no grain, no fading, the colors just as bright and vibrant today as they were in 1937.  It is a mint condition presentation of a platinum standard film that set the mold.  Not only highly recommended, but, as I said, a required addition to any film buff's library.

What was better than the endlessly eclectic arrangements was that he was also lyrically talented. Now I know that Faith No More, which maintained a more controlled musical enviroment suited for alternative conoisuers, was just as fantastic. The lyrics are dark in all their beauty, as is the music:<br />&quot;Land Of Sunshine&quot;: A sardonic funk metal number about angels of generic dreams and green minds getting what they deserve, a mixture of laughter and lecture questions along the way.<br />&quot;Caffeine&quot;: Angstish rock at its best. Opened by howler monkeys.<br />&quot;Midlife Crisis&quot;: Geniuses milked to impress, thoughtless middle aged men with jingling pockets and razor incisions of perfection. &quot;Your menstruating heart ain't bleeding enough for two&quot;. Hiphop metal.<br />&quot;RV&quot;: Hilarious song of self pity told through the eyes of a lonely man in an RV, spoken over a piano waltz. &quot;My pants fall down every time I bend over...&quot;<br />&quot;Smaller and Smaller&quot;: Definitely one of the best songs, probably the most serious. Seems to a claustrophobic attack at fascism.<br />&quot;Everything's Ruined&quot;: More sardonicism. A staged aristocratic family loses all when their posed son is revealed to be fake.<br />&quot;Malpractice&quot;: Sex frenzies, death metal and deranged screams. This breaks in the middle with childish bells to say &quot;Knuckle White, Ruffle White&quot;.<br />&quot;Kindergarten&quot;: Another tale of pity, but this one seems more serious. A guy who keeps failing kindergarten...rock balladry.<BR>Waiting. Bell's not ringing.<br />&quot;Be Aggressive&quot;: Male behaviour in chords. This song is alsohumorous due to a chorus sung by cheerleaders.<br />&quot;A Small Victory&quot;: One of my favorites, includes some hiphop sound effects to aid the metal pop.&quot;IT SHOULDN'T BOTHER ME...BUT IT DOES!!!&quot; More angst, they even made an overlooked video for it.<br />&quot;Crack Hitler&quot;: Easily one of the craziest tracks, includes a demented man talking about &quot;bodies floating in the river like fine champagne&quot;...a sarcastic look at Hitler? THere's even what appears to be a Nazi march call in it.<br />&quot;Jizzlobber&quot;: Sounds like some of the recent death metal rap I've heard lately, this song would probably be popular for the Korn generation around now. A good song nonetheless, plus it ends with church organs and medievil choirs. <br />&quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;: No introduction needed here. Sounds like the original...a good ending.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Besides being repetitive, the reviewer below is absolutely incorrect about this CD (oh wait, I guess I can't say that since it's his opnion). Well, suffice to say, I DISagree with said reviewer, and have found nearly every single song on here &quot;worth listening to.&quot; I'll repeat, this is worth the money, and nearly every song is worth listening to. Since every song is worth listening to, this is definitely worth buying...if you like CDs where every song is worth listening to. This is the CD for you if you like getting your money's worth. Most songs are great, and what a bargain!
B0000021RD|5.0|People who think of Chicago as the band that sings light pop ballads from the late 80's and early 90's would never recognize the group in their second effort.  To begin with, the album contains two absolute classics, &quot;25 or 6 to 4,&quot; which has become a rock standard, and the wonderful &quot;Colour My World,&quot; which I believe will be remembered as one of the greatest love songs of the last 100 years.  It's that good.  The album is loaded with great tunes, but the strength of the disc is the band's attitude.  At this early point in their career, they were not afraid to take chances and experiment.  These songs contain brass arrangements that are truly alive and vocals to match.  The entire &quot;A.M. Mourning,&quot; &quot;P.M. Mourning,&quot; and &quot;Memories of Love&quot; section features some of the most emotional, moving music I've ever heard in any genre.  The album closes with what I call &quot;protest variations&quot; in &quot;It Better End Soon.&quot;  It's interesting to compare their feelings of war then (Vietnam) to our feelings now in light of the terrorist attacks.  If they were singing it now, maybe the tone would be different.  Maybe, maybe not, but it's a great testament to how war affected people over 30 years ago.  Every part of this disc is wonderful.  What a risk it must have been to put out a double album of experimental pop music by a relatively new group.  But you can easily tell the group cared about this music and had a lot of fun making it.  That sure doesn't happen much these days, does it?
B00004Z311|4.0|WHY??? do you have the release date for this title as Jan 1, 2010 under Technical Information? When the dvd release date is to announced.
0783219172|4.0|This film is horribly underrated and appreciated. It deserved so much more attention. This Peter Jackson directed film stars Michael J. Fox as a sort of ghostbuster. But he's a con. He has two ghost friends that he sends out to haunt somebody so they can call him and give him some business. Then he is put to the test when a ghost believed to be the grim reaper starts terrorizing the town and taking souls. The identity of the ghost is not who we originally thought it was. The movie is filmed with a cold, spooky, eerie feel. Michael J. Fox does a fantastic job as Frank Bannister. Former &quot;Addams Family&quot; star John Astin is absolutely unrecognizable as the ghost named 'Judge'. He is really impressive in his too short role. Dee Wallace Stone also turns into a magnetic performance. The first opening minutes are a classic. Worth your time.
1563896656|4.0|The characters are classic Victorian heros, the art is from Mad Magazine (Mort Drucker) and the story is fantastic H. G. Wells on opium. I look forward to more, the closing panel is the Martian cylinders falling upon London.
B00000DGRX|5.0|I bought this because I only had the original on LP, I thought the packaging was neat, and I love the songs on it.  What I ended up with is the best sounding remaster that I ever heard.  Put any Led Zep Remastered CD on after hearing this and you'll be shocked at how bad the Led Zep disc sounds.  Lazy has never sounded better.  The other reviewer who said this album wasn't worth the price must be listening to it thru a $50 walkman with $5 headphones.  Even if you are only an audiophile and not much a DP fan you'll love this album just for how great it sounds.  The recording sounds better than a lot of 21st century recordings.  I don't know how they did it, but you have to buy this album.
B000003CMC|5.0|This album defines the Allman Brothers, it has long jams, Mountain Jam is great to sit and jam too, it also has the catchy tunes like one way out or melissa. It has my favorite ABB song, Blue Sky, i love this song and got to see it live this summer, great concert. Any Allman Brothers fan has to have this album, even if your not, if you are into classic rock or jam bands this is a must have album. The jacket is very cool too, when stoned you can stare at the inside picture for hours looking at all the psychedelic mushrooms and the incredible imagery. Buy this album.
B00005AFMT|5.0|I'm sure most people who consider buying this already have it in another form (i.e. LP, CD, or tape) and already enjoy the music.  Looking at this title with that frame of mind, and comparing it to the older version of the CD, the sound is slightly improved.  In addition the casing is shaped and designed like a small version of the LP release.  The insert also has some nice reads that weren't included in previous releases.  I would recommend purchase of this only if you have an audiophile system and can appreciate the slight sound improvement or if you'd like the great packaging.  If you only have this on LP or cassette, it's a no brainer to buy this.  If you want to hear some unbelievable sounding remasters check out Deep Purple Machine Head 25th Anniversary Remaster or the Beatles One.  These will make your jaw drop at how great they sound and make you wonder why all remasters can't sound this good.  I guess source tapes.
0553277472|4.0|An enjoyable book. A good read, and Pirsig has some very good points. <br />But still: the author sets out to define \\"quality\\". It is the whole purpose of the book and the journey. And he ends up saying that it can't be defined!<br />Quality is not that hard to define. It is simply \\"how well something works according to its purpose\\".
B00005NB0H|5.0|It seems like just yesterday when MCA reissued the `new' Live at Leeds (it was actually in 1995). Expanded to almost twice the length of the original album, it was reissued in two different packages: the first was a standard CD, the second was a limited edition album-sized package containing all the inserts from the original album. Now MCA has released yet another version of the infamous 2/14/70 concert from Leeds University. This time, it's being touted as the `complete' show (it's not, however) on two CDs, digitally remixed and remastered. Pete Townshend supervised the remix himself. <br />For the new `deluxe edition,' the label added the complete performance of Tommy. What they didn't do, is keep the show in its original running order. The Who tours of 1969-70 all featured Tommy in its entirety, but it came during the middle of the show, rather than at the end. The new liner notes reflect this. Diehard Who fans will be disappointed by this; but for those who don't know otherwise, this makes perfect sense. You can hear Tommy from start to finish without having to change discs. The other thing that keeps this from being complete is the omission of \\"Spoonful\\" in the middle of \\"Shakin' All Over.\\" <br />If you're not a diehard Who fan, though, you can't go wrong with this new version. This album has long been considered one of the best live albums ever produced, and with good reason. The performance is outstanding, and the new packaging is cool too--even if the inserts are reduced to photos inside the booklet. There are new liner notes and photos, and the `crackling noise' that was deemed \\"OK\\" in the past has been corrected. Even if you have a copy of the original unedited show, the new deluxe edition of Live at Leeds is a required addition to any Who collection.
B00000I952|5.0|Not by any chance the typical Abba album, &quot;The Visitors&quot; shows the world a totally different reality than the one that was experienced through their previous recordings. If &quot;Ring Ring&quot; or &quot;Arrival&quot; featured innocent and candid lyrics, and &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; or &quot;Super Trouper&quot; were deeply involved with the disco-revolution that the world was living, &quot;The Visitors&quot;, stands out as the best Abba album because of its strength. This is a pop record, made by people who know how to make pop sound like pop. <br />Probably a big part of the strength of the album had to do with the lives of the members of the band during the recording. With guitarist/composer Bjorn Ulvaeus and singer Agnetha Faltskog already divorced since 1979, the band had to suffer the divorce of the second marriage, between keyboardist/composer Benny Andersson and singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The result of these hard situations are the most sincere lyrics ever written by this band. <br />From beginning to end, the album is astonishing. &quot;The Visitors&quot; is the first (and the best in my humble opinion) track, and features an amazing Frida lead vocal, and altered all-band vocals for the bridge and chorus. The theme of the album goes through all these marriage complications, and it's mostly Frida the one who gets to sing the most intense lyrics this time. &quot;When All Is Said And Done&quot; (re-recorded in Spanish as &quot;No Hay A Quien Culpar&quot;, this version is available on the &quot;Oro: Grandes Éxitos&quot; compilation) is a strong &quot;goodbye&quot; song, ironically with Benny playing an amazing piano part. We see Frida on her best vocal way also with &quot;I Let The Music Speak&quot;, a track that explores the not always well apreciated theatrical vein of the band. The beautiful, haunting closing track (and a good farewell track for the band) is &quot;Like An Angel Passing Through My Room&quot;, the one and only Abba track that does notfeature a single vocal harmony, not even in the background. The song is sweet and tender, it sounds like Frida is sending her children to sleep.<br />While Bjorn pays his personal tribute to The Beatles with the Pepper-ish &quot;Two For The Price Of One&quot;, Agnetha gets the chance to sing on &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, a great poppy track; the haunting &quot;One Of Us&quot; (the only song from this album that made it to the &quot;Gold&quot; compilation&quot;), in which she shows yet again her talents as a vocalist; &quot;Soldiers&quot;, which is an ambient surrealistic track resemblent to the anthem &quot;Eagle&quot;, released on 1978; and &quot;Slipping Through My Fingers&quot;, the sweetest song of the bunch, talking about how hard is for parents to handle the growing of their children. This song was also re-recorded in Spanish as &quot;Se Me Está Escapando&quot;<br />The B-side to the &quot;One Of Us&quot; single was &quot;Should I Laugh Or Cry&quot;, another breaking-up song, strongly sung by Frida. The next Abba singles were &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot;, probably the Abba song with the greatest lyrics ever and &quot;Under Attack&quot;, ironically a much lighter love song. Those along with their respective B-sides &quot;Cassandra&quot; and the silly &quot;You Owe Me One&quot; can all be found in different issues of this album, and in different compilations. Those are for giving the costumer a complete view of the moment Abba was experiencing while recording &quot;The Visitors&quot;. Their strongest record was surrounded by the sense of having grown up, the sensation of maturity and the need to do more innovative stuff in the fields of music. Benny and Bjorn took their chance and let the music speak for them. They were totally splitting up, but they let the world know about it. Surely they didn't think that was true, but it was anyway. It's sad that after a masterpiece like this a band like Abba broke up. It would have been great to know their achievements in the fields of the complex 80's music scene, but one must think that everything has a planned end, and there's nothing left to do when that happens.<br />Don't expect this to be the regular Abba CD. It is much more innovative and &quot;experimental&quot;, if you want... But it is an Abba record anyway. You recognize them not only because of the vocalists, but also because they're &quot;letting the music speak&quot; by them. And that's what they always did.
0792839129|4.0|Our son is a huge fan of movie musicals with Mary Poppins as one of his all-time favorites.  This movie not only features Dick Van Dyke but the music is written by at least one of the musical team members responsible for Mary Poppins.  The movie is imaginative, creative with many humm-able songs.  It is surprisingly dark at one point where they are looking to hunt down all the children, but that hasn't seemed to bother our son too much, but some viewers might find it a little scary.  Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as always.  If your child has an active imagination, loves music and dance, this is for you.
B00005B36H|5.0|This cd has really opened my eyes to modern progressive heavy rock.It took a couple of spins before I began to think this is'nt music it's art. The whole cd  manages to keep you completely mesmerized from the superb opener the grudge which will blow you away. Other noteable tracks being the atmospheric,  the patient which slowly builds into a complete masterpiece. Schism in my opinion is the finest track on the cd which again builds into a monster.Parabola is a belting track with a banging baseline and superb guitars, not to mention the vocals,which are faultless the whole cd.A cd which gives you something new to listen to everytime you play it.Buy it now,don't miss out on this modern masterpiece!!!
0060245867|5.0|My 3 year old LOVES LOVES LOVES this book.  She can almost read it to herself now.  The illustrations are great and the mouse is an endearing character that kids will love. There is minimal text on each page, so it keeps even busy spirited kids interested with so many cute pictures.  Also, the mouse is a &quot;he&quot; in this book as well as the boy who gives him the cookie, whereas,&quot;If you give a Pig a Pancake&quot; is the &quot;she&quot; version with both female characters.  They make great companion books.
B0000584V3|5.0|I will admit, I've never been a fan of death metal, black metal, prog metal, any of that sort of thing. Indeed I've strayed closer to the likes of Tool, Nine Inch Nails, VAST, and more musically challenging bands. Something drew me to Opeth (the cover art, believe it or not), and I decided to check them out.<br />It was definitely worth it.<br />No, I haven't been a fan of Opeth's since they started, but that doesn't mean I can't tell good music from bad. I listened to some of their older work after discovering Blackwater Park, but I'm sorry, this is simply superior to any of it. The melancholy vocals and acoustics are beautiful, and at times even work with the death metal vocals, which I am usually turned off by. Here I find myself listening to it for hours on end. Not many CDs are over an hour long with only 8 songs, yet these 8+ minute opus-like songs are incredible, and worth every minute.<br />My choice songs: The Drapery Falls, Dirge for November
B00003CXDG|5.0|Previous reviews slating the limited plot are obviously missing the point of John Woo movies. There wasn't much of a plot to Hard Boiled, but that didn't stop it being one of the best action movies of all time. Not that this is as good as Hard Boiled or The Killer, or indeed the majority of John Woo's Hong Kong output, but it is vastly superior to the likes of Broken Arrow and Face Off which Mr.Woo has presented us with since arriving in Hollywood. The action set-pieces are fantastic and that's what John Woo is all about.He makes THE BEST and most spectacular action scenes ever to be put on celluloid.So quit your whinin' about the wafer thin plot and become a John Woo fan!
B0000048V8|2.0|This movie is just so-so.The animation is blurry,but the story is fair.This may keep kids entertained for about 10 minutes or so,then they'll get bored and go do something else.Only rent this if you're truly bored and there's nothing good on TV.
B00005NWRS|1.0|even when listening to the best whiskeytown had to offer, i couldnt help but thinking there was something insincere, forced, hackneyed about their sound. Whereas every note and syllable Uncle Tupelo spewed forth resonated with genuine, visceral emotion, WT sounded like a bunch of kids trying to ape Gram Parsons most of the time and UT some of the time. When Adams went solo and those Dylan rip-offs came fluttering from my speakers, it became clear that he was descending further into that concentric circle of musical hell known as full-blown derivativeness. GOLD is, in a word, horrific. Bland, gleemy-slick -n'sleek production and songwriting ooze in such thick globs from this boring album that the first thing i wanted to do was grab the lava and take a long, hot shower. another review was dead-on with the mellencamp reference - this is psuedo-folk AOR for music fans who dont know the real deal and are either too afraid, lazy or ignorant to seek it out. Adams is going the Eagles route to stardom - watering down &quot;influences&quot; into sacchariney doses of musical pablum that slither down the ears nice and easy. at this point adams is phoning it in, probably have long since figured out he doesnt really need much more than to create a stir with some bad-boy westerberg-wannabe antics, write some half-baked tunes copped from bad-era stones, then laugh all the way to the bank as the mindless, unwashed masses swallow it hook, line, and sinker.

B00005OAJ1|4.0|This is a hilarious disc. I wish D would have thrown in some of their kicking live tracks. I love their dedication to Satan, now that is rock-n-roll. Keep your children and pets away from hearing this disc. They might become seduced by the tunes and hurt you, listener. (Just Funnin', People, Come on)
B000002H7I|5.0|Every time I buy a Tracy Chapman CD I say, &quot;this is the best one yet&quot; and it's true.  Crossroads is one of her first, the lyrics are enlightening and inspired.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00002N9ER|2.0|Poor quality plastic brackets .Not up to mag light standards.
B000059XUI|4.0|I ordered the Superman 2 online on Sept. 7 and received it shortly after the Sept. 11 tragedy in New York, and I must say it made me see one of my all-time favorite movies in a slightly different light.  First of all, you can't miss the World Trade Centers prominently displayed on the DVD cover.  The movie then opens with an attempted act of terrorism on a world landmark, the Eiffel Tower, and also includes scenes where the villains attack both Washington D.C. and Metropolis (New York City).  The scene with Superman flying with the American Flag gave me goosegumps, since never before had I seen the flag displayed more proudly and reverently than in the days following the disaster, not only to remember the victims, but to show our patriotism, and the way in which this country can pull together when our values are under attack.  I found myself wishing that Christopher Reeve's Superman had been around to save some of the people that lost their lives in the WTC disaster.<br />Regarding the movie itself, it has its flaws.  You have to swallow the fact that caucasian, English-speaking aliens land in a caucasian, English-speaking country.  But if you're able to suspend your disbelief, Superman II remains one of the best, if not THE best, comic book movie of all time.  I only wish I could have seen the version Richard Donner envisioned, and that John Williams had done the score.<br />I gave this DVD four stars instead of five because of the sad lack of extras.  Hopefully we'll see a Collector's Edition sometime in the near future?
B000021YQV|5.0|What can I say? Amazing? Unbelieveable? The best of the year? The first album is great, but so is this one. Great and a little bit more. Chop Suey is one of the most beautiful songs Ive ever heard. And the video for this one is really cool. One of the best albuns of the year, just as PODs Satellite.
B000002LOE|4.0|I'm still not sure where i rate this in comparison with the other 11 official R.E.M. albums , probably just below the middle.<BR>  It's good , but not good enough to compete with albums like 'Automatic for the People' , 'Murmur' and 'Up'.<BR>Radio Song - Feat. Rapper KRS-1 , it starts the album off on a weak note. It really does get on your nerves after only a few listens.<BR>Losing My Religion - I don't have to tell you , this is one of the top five R.E.M. songs of all time!<BR>Low - A real grower! After the first few listens I thought it was too long , too monotonous and pretty bland. I actually like it now. Just give it some time.<BR>Near Wild Heaven - The first of the two songs with Mike Mills on vocals. It's more or less just a lush country pop song. Average.<BR>Endgame - An instrumental. Just to seperate the two sides of the album I would assume. Can't see sny other real reason for it's inclusion.<BR>Shiny Happy People - A much maligned upbeat pop song. I think I'm one of the few people who actually still likes it.<BR>Belong - Another song which blossoms with repeated listens. Features hushed vocals from Stipe and a moaning chorus.<BR>Half a World Away - This is where Out of Time hits it's straps. The last 4 tracks are pure classic R.E.M. You'll love this first time you hear it.<BR>Texarakana - The second Mills song . But this works much better than Near Wild Heaven.<BR>Country Feedback - Second best song after Losing My Religion! Great lyrics and an urgent Stipe vocals make this flourish.<BR>Me In Honey - Really upbeat like Shiny Happy People , and also feat. Kate Pierson. I love this song! It seems to get better with each listen. Also has my fav line on the album ; 'Seems a shame to waste your time with me!'<BR>     Well that's it. Overall if you're an R.E.M. fan this is a must. It's drawback is Radio Song , Endgame and Near Wild Heaven.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I should first admit that I was a big fan of &quot;X-Men&quot; comics as a youth, especially during the Chris Claremont / John Byrne collaboration era in the early 1980's.  I collected those monthly issues religiously, even though my weekly allowance of a measly dollar a week made comic book collecting nearly beyond my means.  So it is likely that my opinion of this film adaptation may be more than a little biased.  With that acknowledgement out of the way, I want to say that &quot;X-Men&quot; is easily the best movie adaptation of a superhero comic book that I've ever seen.  Before seeing it, I, like all the other fans of the comic book, was wary about how accurately the characters will be portrayed.  We have really no reason to trust Hollywood to be faithful to the original comic book considering their incompetence in previous similar efforts.  Man, I still can't believe Superman took Lois to the Fortress of Solitude and that Batman revealed his identity to some stupid girl, even if she happens to be Kim Basinger.  However, I had no such complaints about how the X-Men were translated onto the screen, and in fact, fans of the comic book will be hard pressed to come up with any significant differences between the movie versions of Professor X and Wolverine and their comic book counterparts.  I am especially delighted that the filmmakers decided to retain the moral grayness of Wolverine and his lack of compunction over the act of killing.  I also liked how many of the plot elements were left unresolved, because it means that a sequel will surely follow.  Another likely bonus for X-Men fans in the upcoming sequel is the appearance of Kitty Pride and Iceman, who were both briefly introduced as young students at Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted.  In an effort to be objective, I will admit that the story did suffer from excessive expository dialogue and unnecessary scenes that appeared to have been inserted only to serve as descriptions of the respective capabilities of each mutant.  But heck, that just means the sequel will be even better since the writers will only need to concentrate on the story.  Overall, this movie will make you forget the real world for 90 minutes and will make kids wish they could squeeze into a microwave oven in order to mutate themselves.
B00000JCB3|5.0|I THINK SIGNIFIGANT OTHER IS ONE OF THE BEST CD'S I'VE HEARD IN   A WHILE.
B00005A46T|3.0|Picked up a copy of Slipknot's \\"Iowa\\" CD because I wanted to find out what all the buzz was about. Maybe it's got something to do with Halloween comming. What \\"The Exorcist\\" was to horror films is what \\"Iowa\\" is to music - Terrifying!<br />Slipknot may not take their own music too seriously, but you'd better believe their teenage fans do. They chant vows of loyalty and allegeance to Corey Taylor as if he were a reincarnated Kurt Cobain - providing a voice to the youth of America. With songs like \\"My Plague\\", \\"Everything Ends\\", \\"Left Behind\\" and \\"I Am Hated\\" - this is not the voice America's youth needs to hear.<br />\\"Kansas\\" was a progressive rock band that made America's heartland proud. Slipknot justs tells us the story of failed youth in the heartland, and it's not a pretty story. \\"Iowa\\" is beyond teenage angst, it is pure agression without any real cause. At least the band \\"RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE\\" and their music had a cause, granted their beliefs were mostly anti-government, but Slipknot doesn't even seem to know what they're angry about. Corey Taylor seems to hate his parents, hate his life, hate society, hate his peers, hate his country, and most of all - hate himself. Whether Slipknot believes it or not, that's the way their music comes off.<br />...<br />The 14th track on this CD is the title track \\"Iowa\\", renamed from it's original title \\"Killers Are Quiet\\", and is the most promising of all the tracks. Still, it is better suited to play from speakers on Halloween night beside your fog machines and fake graveyards. In fact, it's better than most of the halloween stuff out.<br />Alice cooper used to stage cutting his own head off with a guillotine in concert. Ozzy Osbourne bit the head off of a live bat. We knew, however, that it was entertainment. When the show was over we knew reality. Slipknot's musical message of death, decay, murderous plots and mayhem can be played twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week - and our kids may start believing this message is reality - and that's the big difference. Slipknot is dangerous to our youth. That's my opinion, and as an American, I exercise my right to say it. Feel free to disagree with me and tell me that Slipknot's \\"Iowa\\" is just entertainment if you want - but I'll still say you're wrong.<br />...
B00005J6UP|5.0|Part preteen mystery novel, part shiver-me-timbers adventure trek, &quot;The Goonies&quot; is a classic example of crowd-pleasing entertainment that needs no logic in order to tell its story. Director Richard Donner seems to have gathered this seek-and-find journey from the childhood fantasies of every child in the world a dozen times over, and the result is pure, unrelenting fun from beginning to end!<br />The plot is the simplest one imaginable: Mikey, Mouth, Data, and Chunk, a group of friends who call themselves The Goonies, stumble across a centuries-old map of the upper West Coast, near their homes, where there is a treasure believed to be buried somewhere along the shoreline. Despite the disagreement of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, they leave in search of the treasure, in hopes that their newfound riches will save their homes from a greedy developer. <br />Their hopes are somewhat thwarted when the path to the treasure lands them face-to-face with the Fratellis, a mother-son crime team who begin tracking the kids once they realize that there is money at stake. As they all make their way deeper and deeper into the caverns leading to the pirate ship, they encounter dangers that will keep kids on the edge of their seats. <br />This is all done with a high level of laughter, lightheartedness, and surprising enjoyment. Each character is given a certain demeanor, different from others. Mikey is crippled by a speech impediment, while Chunk, like his name, is husky and clumsy; Data has a pseudo-James Bond fascination about him, and Mouth is outspoken and crude. All of their personalities combine with hilarious results, a special part of the film's magical charm. <br />The cast also seems to be having a tremendous amount of fun with the movie. To scrutinize their performances is completely cynical, for their is little that can be criticized. The dialogue is corny from the start, but everyone takes it all in stride, and together, they polish off each moment with comedic joy and humor. <br />As a child, I enjoyed this movie immensely, and as I look back on it, the adventure was quite suspenseful, due to my age and experience with movies. The journey through the underground caverns, the booby traps, the children at the hands of the not-so-cunning crooks... all of this is pure magic for a kid, without being overly frightening. Now, as an adult, the movie has a much different effect on me, allowing me to recall my childhood fantasies, and the vast enjoyment I had for this film. <br />&quot;The Goonies&quot; is a classic adventure that appeals to many, kids and adults alike. It's got a charm and sense of humor that grow on you, and its indulgence in its own corniness is, in its own way, appealing. For those who experienced it as a child, to watch it now is to recapture a pleasurable memory from childhood; for those new to the experience, it recalls your own fantasies and beliefs as a kid, and leaves you smiling with satisfaction.
0440219078|2.0|Written at a 6th grade reading level, The Giver has very little literary or stylistic value.   It is filled with cliched rhetoric such as \\"intelligence\\" \\"integrity\\", \\"courage\\", and \\"wisdom\\" -- words fit for a middle school graduation.  Lowry creates a futuristic world that seems too much like a follow up of Orwell's *1984*, and is really a very bland version of *Brave New World*.  The themes and ideas can hardly be called original.  Though for a children's book, it is quite valuable in its effective warning against modern society's trend toward regimentation and sterilization.  As for anyone over 12 years of age, read Brave New World if you want intellectual stimulation.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I first heard some cuts off this soundtrack on my way to the airport: I played 4 of them over and over, and by the time I parked I forgot to look at the CD to see what it was. It took me 5 weeks to track down what it was, and it was a looooong wait.<br />Now that I have it, I might have to glue it in the CD carousel. I can hear these pieces hidden in so much other folk (and country) music I like -- Paul Simon, Ry Cooder, and just about every other song I heard on NPR while living in Eastern Ohio.<br />Great stuff; worth every penny.
0393039765|5.0|How good is Fight Club?  So good that I've been buying copies of the book just to give away to people who haven't read it yet.<br />Fight Club is a welcome, refreshing blast of everything that literature needs; anti-establishment philosophy, the strangest group of characters ever to come together on the page, anger so sharp you'll start bleeding before it starts hurting, all coupled with the unique ability to sit back and laugh at the whole ungodly mess.  Fight Club is a novel that doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is, an unsightly lump of sweat, bone, and blood.<br />It is about a group of men who are becoming increasingly frustrated with the emptiness of their lives, and who set about to change it.  And while their method may not be the best, they do manage to tell the rest of us about the power available to us all; as long as we're willing to pay the price to get it.<br />People will change when they need to.  Lester Burnham in American Beauty smoked pot and almost had sex with his daughters' sixteen-year-old friend to try to change his life; Tyler Durden let people punch him in the face.<br />To each their own, brother.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|OK, I know what you are saying.  What could I possibly say that you haven't heard about this CD?  Well I can start by telling you that I am a huge Tenacious D fan.  I saw them in concert once already and have tickets to see them again soon.  Now I had the oppurtunity to listen to this CD before it came out but I decided that I would wait for it to be released and listen to it in full force.  Justlike most of you I read all of the reviews that said this album was overproduced and it wasn't the real D.  All of that.  So when I heard this album I truely thought that I wouldn't like it.  I listened to it once and fell in love.  I have not listened to another CD since I bought it.  Now here is what you need to understand, if you have ever seen the D live you know it is just JB and KG and their two guitars.  I think a lot of people were expecting that when they bought the CD.  Everybody knows how great Jables and Rage are, but what surprised me was how well the songs that I loved sounded with drums and keyboards and electric guitars.  Everybody has to admit that Wonderboy sounds great with the drums and keyboards.  City Hall kicks butt and they go back to their acustic roots with Karate and Kyle Quit the Band.  The fact that these songs rock both on the CD and live should not be taken lightly.  The skits on the CD are extremely funny and sound like they haven't been rehearsed, just simple JB and KG.  And that is funny stuff!!!  Do yourself a favor, if you don't own this CD, buy it.  And if you have it and are disappointed, give it another listen and open your mind. You will sing these songs for the rest of the day before long.  Obey the D!!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Think you've seen this film before?  Well, so did I ... once in a movie theatre in the 1960's, then again on VHS and LaserDisc in the 1990's.  But after viewing this Platinum Edition on DVD, I now realize that in truth, I have only seen pale imitations of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in the past!  That's how incredible this newly restored animated classic looks on DVD. Never before has the picture looked so crisp, clean, and gorgeous in vivid three-strip Technicolor; never before has the soundtrack offered such an amazing range of clarity.  All the critical superlatives that have become cliches through overuse genuinely apply here: the video and sound transfers are dazzling! amazing! breathtaking! exquisite!  If you, like I, have in the past respected the film mainly for its historical importance as Walt Disney's first full-length animated feature, prepare to reappreciate it as a phenomenal visual experience.<br />As if the feature were not more than enough, the Disney Company has gone all-out in packaging the DVD with a plethora of bonus features that will appeal to a broad range of viewers.  There are a &quot;sing-along&quot; for the tykes; a video game for the kids; deleted concepts and original storyboard drawing for the film buffs; and much, much, much more.  Literally, I have spent over two hours exploring all the extra features, and still haven't experienced them all!  The two discs are delightfully  overwhelming, and represent an incredible value for your money.  This is one DVD package that is instantly a classic in - and of - itself, and a must-have for your home video collection!
0451197968|5.0|The Running Man is a fascinating account of a future America in which game shows are reality and people who hate the government attack 100 story buildings with jumbo jets.<br />I've just read the book for the 4th time and this has been the most depressing read of them all.  All along I felt the end of the book was justifiable, but events of recent weeks have made me rethink.<br />Of course, it's easy to see why it seems justifiable in the book.  The government is a giant TV network and they require everyone to own a television so that they can watch undesirables be dispatched at an alarming rate on the many game shows that run all day.  The poor are treated as villains and there is no regard for basic human rights.  It's Jesse Helms' dream of America.<br />Ben Richards enters the top show, The Running Man, to try to win enough money to get his daughter a doctor and cure her pneumonia.  As he runs, he realizes that far more is at stake than his daughter's well being and he becomes a crusader for the downtrodden.<br />Of course, the network distorts his messages and vilifies him.  But clearly the tide is turning as people actually find themselves rooting for him to win against incredible odds.<br />His final act is heroic and liberating.  You see that the world will forever be changed and that it will be for the better.  But now you have to stop and think that the terrorists on September 11th were thinking the same exact thing.  Clearly violence is never the best solution, but to some it seems like the only way to deliver their message.<br />Over the 15 or so years since I first read the Bachman Books I've seen many things in our society that make me refer back to two of them.  Rage involves a student who goes on a shooting rampage.  It's now become an all to common occurrence.  When Survivor premiered I thought, \\"Here we go, Stephen King was hitting the nail right on the head.\\"<br />After the World Trade Center attack, everyone was saying, \\"I never thought somebody would actually crash a jet into a building.\\"  I did.  I don't know how many times I sat in a stadium, or looked at a high rise, and thought how easy it would be.  Stephen King put it into words that made it seem all too plausible.<br />King wasn't the first to come up with something like that.  Years earlier, in Black Sunday, Thomas Harris described crashing a blimp into a stadium.  After the WTC attacks people started thinking about that and worrying that blimps shouldn't fly over sporting events.  Maybe they should have been thinking about these things all along.  After all, clearly some people were.ually crash a jet into a building.\\"  I did.  I don't know how many times I sat in a stadium, or looked at a high rise, and thought how easy it would be.

0440219078|5.0|The Giver<br /> Imagine living in a world where someone else is controlling your life. Those people make important life decisions like whom you will marry and what your career will be. This is what Jonas's life is like. He lives in a perfect world where there is no hurt or fear. Jonas figures his life is good, until he receives his lifetime assignment and his eyes are opened to all of the things he has been missing out on.<BR> The village elders control everything in the community where Jonas lives. When Jonas turns twelve he is given his life assignment as the next receiver of memory. The present receiver is Jonas's teacher and trains him by giving Jonas memories. <BR>Through his training Jonas learns about things like colors, choices, love, hate, and war.  These things didn't happen where he lived because they were thought to be dangerous. Jonas's job is to remember lessons of the past when people made their own choices. The Giver shows Jonas people in the past making bad choices that lead to hate and war. However, he also shared happy memories of people making good choices that led to things like love. Jonas is angered that his world cannot have these things. He wants to live in his own world where he can make his own choices. <BR>This book reads quickly but is very well written. Lois Lowry did an incredible job of showing us what a &quot;perfect&quot; world would be like and makes you realize that you would never want to live in one.
0689505698|5.0|Definately reccomended! I got just as much of a kick out of the story as my daugter did. This is definately on of my favorite childrens books to read. The illustrations are just as good as the story. Wonderful, wonderful book!!!
B00000IAU3|4.0|This one is a must if you like Sade, Mono, Olive, Sara McLaughlan or EBTG.  This one isn't a sleeper, more like a tear-jerking rollercoaster of emotions put to very smooth music.  Dido can go from acoustic guitar to electronica in a few beats without shifting gears.  Great CD
0451191153|5.0|Read just about any four or five star customer review and you have a fine summary of this book.  It is not necessary for me to repeat what has already been said.  I myself would like to talk about the individual characters which keep me rereading this book as much as the philosophy does.  Roark, Keating, Toohey (shudder), Dominique, etc., all represent facets of humanity, good and evil.  But characters like Keating and Wynand are more complex than the characters in Atlas Shrugged.  Yes, they are Randian archetypes but they have taught me much about human nature.<br />Keating, had he a little more backbone, might have actually been able to make something of himself.  Unlike the villains of AS, he was somewhat sympathetic.  He was in love with Catherine, a woman who may not have possessed the glamor and poise of Dominique but who was right for him simply because they were happy when they were together.  Fool that he was, he instead opted for what he thought he was supposed to, just as he chose architecture over his true calling, painting.  His story is a lesson for all of us.  To detractors of the book who call it contemptuous of people I say you don't HAVE to be this way.  Don't be a Peter Keating.  It is up to you.<br />Ellsworth Toohey is a villain for the ages, somebody you just love to hate.  I won't even describe him as a man.  I relish the creepy, slimy feeling I get rereading the passages about him.  Every patronizing, smarmy sentence that comes out of his mouth is designed to make one cringe.  The fact that he DOESN'T seek out wealth, or even happiness, makes him all the worse.    <br />It is through him and this book that I learned what is evil: holding society and &quot;the greater good&quot; over the individual.  Now, whenever I read or watch the news, I am acutely aware of the malice in people who would say they are trying to protect society when their actions result in harm to an individual, or worse, equate society with an individual as I recently heardfrom a prominent proponent of the death penalty.  Again, he is a lesson to all of us: beware the Ellsworth Tooheys of the world.  They are out there.<br />Rand wrote Roark as the ideal man.  He certainly is that.  I could never expect to be as he is but I firmly believe that he is something to strive for.  He had the courage of his convictions.  He did not care what other people thought, except those whose opinions mattered to him, such as his mentor, Cameron.  Such is the lesson I learned from him.  If I find myself jealous or resentful of somebody, I asked myself what my weakness is because fear of one's own shortcomings is from whence hatred and jealousy arise.<br />If it is difficult to relate to a man who does not even see you, as he is frequently described, consider for a moment why it is important for him to see you and why you feel your own worth is based on how others see you.  Then consider the friends that he makes in the book,  competent and intelligent people who feel about the world as he does.  And finally consider what true friendship is.  It is not alms to be doled out in the name of compassion.  It is respect and love for those whom we enjoy having around us.<br />Dominique Francon is a strange bird (Rand said that Dominique was her in a bad mood).  Her motivations are complex but when I think about them, they make sense to me.  I see her as somebody who has so much contempt for the world that she doesn't think it deserves a man like Roark (or a woman like her).  Hence the reason she works against Roark, not to deprive Roark of a living but to deprive the world of Roark.  Clarifying the reasons behind her actions also clarifies that controversial rape scene.  It is the ideal man saying to the ideal but obstinate woman that the world cannot destroy him.  They spar violently to show how strong they are.<br />Gail Wynand is less interesting to me but an intriguing character nonethless, the man who could have been.  He had the drive and the intelligence but, like Dominique, too much contempt.  His contempt for humanity at least was purer and cleaner than Toohey's love for humanity.  I wonder if, had his childhood not been so brutal, he might have gone a different direction.  But then I think that had Roark had a brutal childhood, he still would have come out the same.  Such is Wynand's weakness.  A sad waste, really.<br />Atlas Shrugged is THE definitive Rand book.  I myself certainly feel this way.  Nevertheless, The Fountainhead has virtues that one does not find in that mighty tome. As in AS the characters are largely archetypes but interesting in different ways. Even though Atlas Shrugged is several hundred pages longer than The Fountainhead, it also feels more streamlined.  The characters are more complex in the latter (except, admittedly, for Roark), maybe because where Atlas Shrugged deals in the steel and railroad industries, The Fountainhead deals in the more aestetic field of architecture which, incidentally, Rand describes beautifully.
B00003CX5P|5.0|It was a great roller coaster ride. Everyone secret loves this movie, it's just the cool thing to bash it. This DVD will be a number one seller, just like the VHS was and the movie itself was.
B00005N5S5|4.0|The terminator had the best secial effects at the time and to this day it has not been ridiculed and so i state that it never will. Once you see this movie you will remember it, not for the special effects, not for the actors but for the general idea of the perfect killing machine(The Terminator). I was terrified when i first saw this movie and i cannot recall another movie which had the same impact on me although the 'Predator' is a close bet. It is a must see movie and definitely worth buying on dvd with the great features. Get it and be happy.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is my 3rd Home Theatre DVD Review and &quot;THE TERMINATOR - Special Edition&quot; gets it right on the second time around. Now that Home Theatre is more common many early released movies are being re-released with many enhancements &amp; extras.<BR>This movie definitely set Arnold Schwarzenegger to the super star level. Under the direction of James Cameron (Titanic) this scfi thriller has Schwarzenegger cast as the ultimate bad guy in the futuristic bombed out Los Angeles (2024 AD and 1984 AD). A complex plot with lots of action &amp; special effects that we expect from a Schwarzenegger movie! <BR>Brief movie summary - 2024 AD LA is ruled by Robots &amp; Arnold plays a Killer Android sent from the future to &quot;TERMINATE&quot; a woman who will bear a future &quot;PATRIOT LEADER&quot;. In turn the &quot;Patriots&quot; send a human warrior to safe guard this woman from the Killer Droid. This makes for a real interesting twist of fate for the woman. <BR>This DVD is All new Master from a HI-DEFINTION TRANSFER / Enhanced for WIDESCREEN 16:9 / NEW 5.1 Stereo Remix. In a nut shell - AWESOME VIEWING &amp; LISTENING!!!! Lots of extras including Interviews with Schwarzeneggar.<BR>If you love the BIG THEATRE this one brings it home!!!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Not only should you buy this for the movie but for the dvd itself as well. It is the best dvd i have come across yet with fantastic special features and running commentaries. The movie is a must see and in my eyes it sinks the 'Titanic' even further to the bottom of the sea. The acting and plot is combined brilliantly by Ridley Scott to make this movie one of a kind. This is a legendary film. A classic. An epic.
6305736650|5.0|what can i say about this movie that hasn't already been said? any praise would be waxing poetic, critisism, redundant. it is a beautiful movie. watch it - many times
B00000JZIK|5.0|This is the best ever film i have seen. Forget 'The Matrix', forget 'The Gladiator', this is a masterpiece in film making. The acting by all the suspects are amazing and kevin spacey plays his part with all inspiring class. The plot is full with detail, thrill and suspense and i dont think there is anything more you can ask from a film. The best film i have seen yet with no exaggeration. Just watch it for yourself.
0060245867|5.0|Simply put, this is a wonderful book.  Our 19 month old daughter has enjoyed this book since she received it on her first birthday.  The story is simple and easy to follow and the pictures are big and bright and wonderfully drawn.  There aren't alot of words on every page so if you have a younger child that likes to turn the pages frequently, this makes it easy to keep the story going. Although the story is whimsical and involved enough for an older child to enjoy as well.  We have read this book so many times that my daughter has memorized some of the words on every page and pretends to &quot;read&quot; it herself.  Personally, I feel this is the best of the &quot;If you give a .....&quot; book series (we have them all).  I think the only improvement this book could use is if it came in a board book version as the paper pages in our hardback version are quickly becoming worn from all the frequent reading and toting around!  A true classic that I feel any parent with a young child can't go wrong with.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Many people including me were awaiting this adaption of the cartoon and comic series and i, along with many others, were not let down. The movie is filled with action, a great plot and most of the great Xmen heros. As i soon as i stopped watching i could not wait for the sequel and iam still saying it. The dvd itself has a lot of special features and a coll outer card case but if you buy it you wont care about that, you'll just be thrilled with the movie itself. It's the best comic adapted film with Blade ever.
B000000HTO|5.0|every song here is execellent.  it's a perfect song cycle starting with the more direct and straitfoward Pilgrams leading into the subtle beginnings of Still Life, building in its passion and expressions.  The next song La Rossa (later a coming up again on Hammills solo album Over) is a strong driving song with good percussions. La Rossa has the strange metaphor of comparing the relationship of a oragan grinder and his dancing monkey to the relationship of a Hammill and his desires.  With inspired saxaphen playing by Dave Jackson, My Room is a graceful song that eases the intensity a bit between La Rossa and what is to come- Childlike Faith in Childhood's End- And this is the mother of all Hammill/VDGG songs- interesting intrumental passages (though not as spacious and dynamic as earlier songs, bit more subtle), intense lyrics along with intense and strange harmonies all sung by Hammill- and of course the thing Hammill is always trying to find - the grand finale
0812550706|5.0|The book Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a fictional story about the future.  The eleven-year span of the book follows the life of a boy named Ender from the ages seven to eighteen.  After being trained at pilot school Ender ends up being the hero of the world.  This action story centers around the theme of good verses evil.<BR> The author uses Ender's relationship with his brother to illustrate the theme of good and evil.  He also uses the alien characters that are trying to take over the world called the buggers to contrast good and bad.  In the end good wins out over bad and Ender, who represents goodness, is the hero of the story.  He ends up saving the world through his mental toughness.<BR> The author uses conflicts between Ender and the buggers to make the reader wonder what is going to happen next.  Descriptions of what things are like in the future make the setting intriguing.  The book made me wonder what the future will be like.  Things like the space center and the virtual, real life computer games make the reader curious about the years ahead.  <BR> Although the strange names help to make the story feel like it isn't happening in the present, it is sometimes difficult to keep up with the characters and their unusual names.  The difficult names are a bit distracting to the reader.  However, Ender's Game is an interesting book that gives the reader some idea of what life could be like in the future.  I found it to be an exciting and suspenseful science fiction novel.
B00004RIUV|5.0|I looked over a year for this album, even ordered it twice only for it to be cancelled becuase they couldn't get it in.  Then randomly I saw it in an import section of a record shop ignored the price and did a slight jump for joy.  This is a truely beutiful album that has many layers of music combining many different styles all with Gene Clarks soulful words and music ideas at their core.  Some misunderstand builds and builds and has such a great sense of love behind it for who he is singing about- it makes the album worth its rediculous price by itself.  If you like anything that the Byrds ever made. if you like any music ever made in the 60's or 70's or any other time you will love this album.<br />  The funnest way I have found to get into this album is to listen to it in the background while your doing something else- slowly you will find yourself turning it up every once in a while until you have dropped what you had been doing and are comepletely in attention to these songs.  Now, I don't think every song is a masterpeice but there are some songs in here that definitely deserve an adjective of that degree, and the ones that don't are unfortunately only really good.  The album cover rocks by the way  Highly recommended
B00005ASHM|5.0|I think it's cogent to note what an average non-fan, responding to the hype, is going to experience listening to this album for the first time.<BR>This was my first Beach Boys album, and upon listening, I did not experience any major paradigm shift - it basically sounds like, y'know, the Beach Boys.  Apart from the theremin, and the staccato breaks in &quot;Here Today&quot;, nothing really stood out as being particularly earth shattering.  That's the thing - taken on it's own, without knowledge of the rest of the band's LP catalog (esp. pre-1966) it's hard to appreciate the fact that this is the only Beach Boys album that sounds like this.  The consistency and unity of the album only becomes apparent after discovering the lack thereof on most of the groups' other LPs.  But that's still a minor issue.  The point is, The Hype, for the most part, is well deserved, but it's misleading for yr average exploratory listener.  It doesn't, on first listens, announce itself necessarily as a Major Work, not in the way, say, Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, or Pere Ubu's The Modern Dance, or My Bloody Valentine's Loveless tend to on their first plays.  It takes time.  It takes time to realize this album's place in 60's music.  It takes time to discover how unique an album in the Beach Boys' catalog.  And, especially, it takes time to realize that theres not a single album made before or since that sounds like this (though not for lack of trying).  Once it takes hold, you'll cherish it forever.  And of course, you're going to have to search out SMiLE (the REAL SMiLE, not Smiley-Smile) to hear what Brian intended for the encore.  It may take some doing, but you won't be disappointed.  Trust me, it's out there.  All you have to do is find it.  The tragedy, of course, is that Brian's creative breakthrough was, admittedly, so very brief - that's the reason people still debate his 'genius' status.  Apart from a few scattered pleasant (and pleasantly bizarre) moments on some 70's LP's, this is pretty much it, in terms of what's been released.  But let me set the record straight - Brian Wilson was a genius.
630542845X|5.0|I am supposed to tell you, the reader, whether or not you should see or buy powder, and whether or not its worth your time. The answer comes in many forms. The main answer is that powder is an overlooked work of art and if you stand back and take a breath, can see the many religeous implications that you can get from viewing. I have been hesitant in reviewing powder for the past few months, because I feared that I wouldn't do it justice. I wanted to prepare myself and grow in my writing skills so that you would understand exactly why Powder is so effective.<br />When you think of enduring characters, you may think of Citizen Kane, or William Wallace, maybe even Forest Gump, but due to the unabashadly blatant remarks from Hollywoods critics you are unlikely to think of powder. This is a shame. Though powder is not the all time greatest film, nor will it ever be, it falls into the category of \\"timeless\\". The special effects were done with next to zero computer effects, so that when C.G. are so realistic you can't tell the difference between real and artificial actors, powder will still be terrific in appearance style wise.<br />At the heart of the story is Jeremy, an albino that is cursed and blessed with multiple abilities. His mind is plagued with clarity and soaks knowledge like a sponge. Jeremy's body is electromagnetic and can manipulate the energy around him. One of the many scenes that catches you with your mouth open, is when his teacher brings in a Jacobs latter (two rods that channel an electric current which climbs up them in a strand). Jeremy grips his desk as a thick electrical bolt rushes him and raises him into the air by his heart.<br />Jeremy is surrounded by people that love and hate him. Or, like the sherrif, just don't understand him. Though his eyes must be shielded from the light of the sun, Jeremy radiates and equally bright amount of love and care on those that need it. To show some what he sees and feels, he makes them feel the pain of the violence that they deliver.<br />Sean Patrick Flannery Gives the performance of his life, and the character he creates, and the humbleness he uses is unforgettable.iolence that they deliver.<br />Sean Patrick Flannery Gives the performance of his life, and the character he creates, and the humbleness he uses is unforgettable.
0688002307|5.0|This book  changed my life. I've read it several times, and each time I get something new out of it. It is the defining book of the 20th century. Pirsig redefines what Quality means in our culture. You will never look at material objects in the same way again, in fact you will be forced to reevaluate the way you live. <br />His narrator gets inside your head and sets up shop there. His narrative is intriguing, thought-provoking, emotionally shattering, and often times so complex you will find yourself re-reading passages to make sure you understood them correctly.<br />Told as much as a mystery, as an adventure tale and a dissertation on how we live with technology; with all it's intellectual depth and probing of ancient Greek philosophers, it's remarkably easy to read, clearly written from the point of view of the layman. This book should be a mandatory read for every high school student. <br />The 25th anniversary hardback edition is beautiful as well, and features a new introduciton by author, Robert Pirsig. Take the time to read this masterpiece. You'll thank yourself, over and over.

B00005NWRS|3.0|From the Springsteen cover parody to the Zep-on-the-road hotel room interior shots (guns! booze! smokes! dead groupies!); from the circa '72 vibe to the son-of-a-legendary producer producer, this tries soooo hard to be one of those great jaded, fagged-out, world-weary, decadent masterpieces. (Think &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; meets Gram Parsons meets &quot;Tim&quot; meets &quot;Turn the Page.&quot;) And yet.... It's just soooo painfully obvious that the kid hasn't earned it/learned it yet. Plenty of tell-tale signs. My favorites: he sets his scenes in both NYC and Hollywood cause he's heard they're both centers for this kind of thing. (This is clearly Hollywood decadent-jaded for the record.) And he seems to have gotten Sylvia Plath mixed up with Roxy Pulitzer. Or maybe Zelda Fitzgerald. But damn, it's a weary, messed-up world, anyway.Which is not to say that Touch, Feel &amp; Lose and Tina Toledo aren't killer tracks. Or that the world won't beat a path to C.C. White's door when it hears her backing chops on both.Finally, I only wish that this year's other entry into the world-weary decadence sweepstakes -- Rufus Wainwright's Poses -- were half this loose. Also for the record:  Ryan's not half the retro-visionary that Jack White of the White Stripes is.
B00000I2PG|5.0|This is quite simply one of the landmark albums of the 80's and one which sounds as fresh today as when it first released in 1982.  I first heard ABC through the single Tears Are Not Enough, I have to say that I wasn't all that impressed.  The next couple of singles though (Poison Arrow, The Look Of Love &amp; All Of My Heart) hooked me on this band, which sounded like no other at this time.  Most albums are essentially the singles with a lot of fillers on (some good, others not so good), this album quite simply keeps up the high standard all the way through - I've even re-evaluated Tears Are Not Enough.<br />There a number of  reasons why this album is regarded so highly.  You can start with Martin Frys exquisite lyrical genius, oozing romanticism (not the New kind either).  You can add the lush strings of Anne Dudley (Art Of Noise) into the mix.  You can then finish off with a polished production by Trevor Horn, although you also can't forget the gorgeous backing vocals by Tessa Webb.  <br />Outstanding tracks on an outstanding album : Valentine's Day, The Look Of Love (the breathy spoken refrain), All Of My Heart.  This album was re-released with some extra tracks on a couple of years ago.  Don't even think about it, just get this one.  The Lexicon Of Love is too perfect to be heard in any other form, all you need is the original 10 tracks and a stereo you can turn up fairly loud.  This is an album for all music lovers transcending most genres with its sheer gorgeousness.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rougue was an enormous surprise to me. I walked into the theatre not knowing this was to be a musical! Nicole Kidman's singing talent really shocked me! I was so surprised to hear such a sweet voice. Ewan MacGregor is just plain adorable, and his angel voice makes him drop dead gorgeous!<BR>The imagery and style of this film really blew me away! I would reccommend this movie to ANYONE looking for a great time at the movies! You'll be singing the songs for days!
B000002HFU|5.0|\\"Return to the 36 Chambers, The Dirty Version\\" is an incredible work of a hip hop genius. From his insane rantings, to his crazy stories, ODB is arguably the most colourful emcee in hip hop. This album showcases ODB's colour in all its glory.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Okay. Radiohead has been one of the most popular groups in recent music for almost a decade. Now they've come out with their best album to date.&quot;Amnesiac&quot;. It's best song is &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; which has to be on my list of 100 GREATEST SONGS EVER! Also a great instrumental guitar set is &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; which is beautiful and complete. Now, &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; is good (because every RH song is at least good) but it isn't great. It's a popular one with the hardcore's (which I am) but to me it seems to be missing the special something that the other tracks all have. &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot; is a clean cut and solid sond flourished with genuine Radiohead spirit. &quot;Knives Out&quot; is a really great song with vocals and guitar that is another genuine RH song. &quot;Life In A Glass House&quot; is a truly weird saga of piano and vocals that in the end sound really good. &quot;You And Whose Army&quot; is another GREAT Radiohead mix with brilliant old-sounding vocals and amazing piano/guitar teamwork. Now &quot;Packt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box&quot; has been hailed to be a great for the RH fans library, but I think that it's a really good for an RH fans library.But I don't call it in the same league as &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;You And Whose Army&quot; but it would be in &quot;Amnesiac's&quot; runner-up section for the first prize. &quot;Like Spinnng Plates&quot; gets to the point were it's just a little TOO weird. It's still a good track, it just gets a little to over the top with strangeness at parts. The thing about this album is it has to be agian, On another one of my list! I would put the album on my list of GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL-TIME! Because it is one of the GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL-TIME!
B000002WPI|5.0|The Wu-Tang Clan's now classic debut album changed hip hop forever. From RZA's myriad of beats to each member of the group's unique style and flow...<br />RZA: This cat is the main producer for the clan but he occasionally blesses the mic with his flow. Not one of the stronger members of the clan vocally, he could still rip 90% of the industry on the mic. His solo projects under the name Bobby Digital have been pretty solid.<br />GZA: It is said that if the Clan \\"formed like Voltron\\" then GZA would be the head. He's undoubtedly very intelligent but has a pretty plain voice. Still, he is very gifted lyrically and his solo work is the most introspective of any of the clan's members.<br />Ol' Dirty Bastard: This album shows off his crazy flow and unique style as none of his solo projects ever have (note that I actually liked \\"Return to the 36 Chambers, The Dirty Version\\", his work on this album is just better).<br />Inspectah Deck: A very underrated member of the clan he consistently comes rough and produces solid verses on many joints on this album. His solo work has been a little disappointing.<br />Raekwon (the Chef): Now known only as Raekwon. \\"The Chef\\" possesses a very unique voice and flow and comes with the best verse on several joints on this album. His solo album \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" is flat-out incredible.<br />U-God: In my opinion the least talented member of the Clan. He's still a very solid member of the group and occasionally drops lines that practically force your hand to the rewind switch. Like Inspectah Deck, his solo work has been mostly disappointing.<br />Ghostface Killah: Although I love his solo projects (\\"Ironman\\" and \\"Supreme Clientele\\") they can't quite reach the sheer joy listening to his flow on this album evokes in true hip hop heads. He's got a singsongy flow that can come hard and quick at any moment.<br />Method Man: Probably the most well known member of the clan, his verses on \\"M.E.T.H.O.D. Man\\" are some of the highlights of thisalbum. Check out his album \\"Tical\\" to see some of his best solo work.<br />The bottom line is if you like hip hop at all and don't already own this album then it should be the next one you buy. We're talking about three or four emcees that fall in the top fifty of all time, a great producer, and a solid supporting cast here. An absolute must-buy.

630588255X|5.0|After moving away from home, I found myself without a job. With the last few dollars I had, I went to the dollar theater. &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; was playing. I had heard it was good. After that first scene, I stopped worrying about my sorry situation and realized life was much bigger than I had allowed. <BR>That is why this has forever been my favorite movie.<BR>Now, does anyone know where I can pick up te soundtrack???
B00005OAJ1|5.0|All I can say is wow. These guys have so much talent. They are two of the funniest people I have seen. Their show Tenacious D is really funny and you should check out those episodes before you think about buying the album. More than half the songs from the album come from their show so you probably wouldn't get them. I personally think Jack black and Kyle Gas are hilarious and will lokk forward to seeing them on halloween. And if they read these I hope they now that sas a friend wrote this........Actually you better tell them it was sas-quatch they might not know which friend you mean.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I have to agree with some of the reviews that were posted about the soundtrack...it did leave out some very important songs that were awesome(&quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; &amp; &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;). However, I think the soundtrack is worth the money spent on buying it and is great, in it's own right. There were songs on the CD that weren't in the movie, which added a little bit of variety to the song list. Almost all of the songs (except for a portion that are slow love songs) are upbeat and can be danced to! It's an awesome CD and I think it's got a great line of songs. Definately worth listening to, especially if you've seen the movie and can recall the scenes the song was from. It just adds more enjoyment to the listening of the CD.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Colorful, stylish, and brutal. Argento has always been known for his lavish imagery, and Suspiria is the film that gave him that reputation. Bright primary colors (enhanced by the technicolor film process) give this film a surreal, garish feel. Don't expect any well structured plot, the gallio genre of horror films is know for the duality of weak plot/strong imagery, and Suspiria is no exception. The 3 disk special edition has a ton of extras, encluding an informative documentary and (more importantly) a cd copy of the amazing, atmospheric soundtrack by Goblin.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Now THIS is what Iron Maiden is supposed to sound like. For those of you who grew tired of the worn out, ... attempts by Blaze Bailey ..., then you are in for a treat. The return of both Bruce Dickenson and Adrian Smith has Iron Maiden sounding like their 25 again ....Either way, this album is definetly a must for die hard Iron Maiden fans, as well as those who just appreciate classic metal. One thing Maiden has a talent for is they stick to their guns, yet they don't sound repetitive every album. You always know it's them, without saying \\"yeah but that sounds exactly like their last album.\\"  I'd give this one 4 1/2 stars.
B000002J09|5.0|It is a pity that this album should have, and continue to receive so much attention.  It stands on its own merit, a beautifully crafted collection of songs which gets mired in the overwhelming response it has gotten over multiple overplays and stigmatizing.  I wish I had never heard of the band and of this album - then I would simply enjoy the album for what its really worth
0440219078|5.0|Lois Lowry's, &quot;The Giver&quot;, is the best book that I have read in a long time!  I couldn't put it down and I read it in less than a day!  It is thought provoking and original!<BR>In our world of war and contention it is a major eye opener to see a picture of what could happen if we became overzealous in our efforts to &quot;purify&quot; our world from the affects of pain and suffering.  This is a great example of the consequences that come from trying too hard to completely separate ourselves from the sometimes-horrifying world we live in.<BR>This is a book that I will read over and over again.  I would recommend this book to anyone for a class project or a plain ol' good read.  If you haven't read &quot;The Giver&quot;, then you are missing out!  Run as fast as you can to the nearest bookstore or log on to the first website you can find and purchase this book.  You won't regret it!
B00005NSB8|1.0|CAn somebody tell me what is this? Managed by Rod Smallwood's Sanctuary (from IRON MAIDEN), hiring the services of famous producer Cris Tsangarides and hot on thw wheels of two great albuns (KEEPER I and II), Helloween had all the ingredients for making a sucessful new album, who would be only their fourth full-lenght studio album. All this taking in consideration the fact that one of their founders, ace guitarrist Kai Hansen, had left, due to not succumbing to commercial pressures and also by not handling so well the rigours of touring endlessly. His replacement, Roland Grapow, was a veryg good player and also a songwriter.<br />Anyway, come the time and Helloween releases its new album, PINK BUBBLES GO APE. I think that, by judging the cover art, it should not have been a surprise what was inside... They just dropped the ball.. The sound is clean, clearly commercial. The lyrics hit an all-time low never seen before, unbeliavable silliness. To put it shortly: only KIds of the Century, SOmeone's Crying and The Chance are worthwhile here... More incredible: after this very weak album, they managed to release one still worse, the maligned CHAMELEON, that resulted in loss of management, loss of record company, loss of drummer Ingo Scwichtenberg (R.I.P.), loss of singer Michael Kiske (one supposed to lead to band to bad music). Now, led by greedy guitarrist Michael Weikath, they continue do go on. But the &quot;spark&quot; was lost forever when they released PIN BUBBLES GO APE...
B00003CXA2|4.0|I am biased when it comes to talking about &quot;Forest Gump&quot; the movie. To start with, Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are two of my favorite actors. On top of that, I have been taken with Robin Wright ever since her role as Princess Buttercup.<br />I was a much different person when &quot;Forest Gump&quot; was first released. I held to a world view that looked down upon its blatant appeal to sentiment. For the obviously good acting job that Hanks did, I did not then feel that this film deserved to win best picture. Over time, my views have changed. While I still view &quot;Gump&quot; as a little too sentimental, I have to admit that it is one heck of a picture.<br />Great performances abound in this movie. Hanks is the most obvious. He is indeed Forest Gump. I doubt any other actor could have pulled off this role so convincingly. Sinise is outstanding as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. He manages to be over the top without becoming absurd. Wright's Jenny is a moving counterpoint to Forest. Mykelti Williamson does a great job with what he is given.<br />The world as seen through the eyes of Forest Gump is definitely not &quot;reality.&quot; That said, we get enough &quot;reality&quot; every day. Zemeckis &amp; company took what could have been shallow escapism and instead they fashioned it into a lens with which to view different parts of ourselves more clearly.<br />I recommend &quot;Forest Gump&quot; very highly. All the bells and whistles on this DVD version only make it more attractive. Get it.

B00003CX5P|5.0|The Phantom Menace is the most over castigated movie in the history of cinema.  It has received criticsm from virtually every camp of people, and I believe that this is a gross misjudgemet of this film.  This film is beautifully shot with sweeping camera shots that reveal the glory of this new land.  People say that it doesn't compare to the previous three movies in content or execution.  I believe that people have canonized the original trilogy without really investigating the claims that they are making.  The original trilogy is poorly shot, replete with bad dialouge, and could not have worse acting.  It is beloved by everyone because it was so revolutionary at the time.  Just on terms of filmmaking the Phantom Menace is a much better picture.  It has a more consitent plot than any of the originals.  In general, I believe the Phantom Menace should be regarded more highly among Star Wars faithful.
B00000IMTF|4.0|RAINBOW was always characterized by changing its member as one changes its clothes... RISING, their second album, maintained only Blackmore (of course) and Dio from their first album. In came: Cozy POwell, Jimmy Bain and TOny Carey. In only six songs, these guys prove how they can play, sing, orchestrate, arrange and compose !!! What great songs they are indeed !!! The typical RAinbow sound forever.
B00003CY0V|4.0|When I went to see this movie I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised: this movie is awesome.  It has obvious action elements, a tease of romance (for the ladies), a bit of technolust, and it is mostly quite realistic making it quite believable as a possible real-life scenario.  The soundtrack too is very awesome (techno).  I'm not going over the plot as it would spoil it. Just see it, trust me.  ....  The only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is because its not a cultural megaphenomenon of a movie (you know, like LotR or Star Wars, etc..)
B00005B36H|2.0|Unnecessary repeat of the Aenima and Undertow sound, but without the hooks.   Very mediocre effort.<br />   *Undertow* is a great cd.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I usually will not add my review if a CD or book or video has already lots of reviews.  I mean:  what is left to say?<br />I felt, however, after reading about 20 reviews of Diana Krall's new THE LOOK OF LOVE that I wanted to write what is obviously a minority point of view.  I LOVED this album.  It reminded me of the Frank Sinatra &quot;theme&quot; albums like &quot;Only The Lonely&quot; where all the songs on the disc were of one mood.  Here is Krall singing one gorgeous love song after another, accompanying herself, as always, on the piano with a small jazz combo and backed by a studio orchestra and the London Symphony.  The orchestrations are lush, the sound on the CD is terrific and Krall is singing like I've never heard her sing.  Every number is tops and done in Krall's signature throaty, sexy, husky style.<br />I especially enjoyed Schwartz and Dietz's &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; which is, in my opinion, one of the finest pop songs of all time and which cannot be allowed to be forgotten.  Since the horrors of September 11, alot of songs with first rate lyrics take on all new meanings and here is a song which says, &quot;We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here/Time hurries by/We're here and gone.&quot;<br />This is a cuddle by the fireside with someone you love album.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000051S3Z|3.0|Though partially cut from the same cloth as &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; and &#34;El Dorado,&#34; Howard Hawks' &#34;Rio Lobo&#34; (1970) remains a solid Western and a fitting end to the veteran director's career. With a &#34;comfortable&#34; John Wayne back in the saddle, the film is highlighted by impressive action sequences and splendid comic relief from Jack Elam. Apart from Jorge Rivero (who establishes a nice rapport with the Duke), the younger actors are a bit weak . . . and it's a shame that Robert Mitchum was unable to co-star with Wayne as originally planned. &#34;Rio Lobo&#34; may not represent Hawks' best work, but it's a lot of fun.
B00004WLXZ|4.0|I've owned a VHS copy of this film for 20 years or so and was eager to replace it with a DVD. I'd hoped for better quality than this. On the other hand, the optional running commentary by historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro is worth the price of admission. If you want to understand the evil that was Adolf Hitler and Naziism, you gotta go to the original source material and this is the Real Deal. This is how Hitler and his people wanted the world to see them and, given the perspective of history, it's far more revealing than they could have known at the time.<BR>No wonder than Frank Capra borrowed heavily from Triumph of the Will when he wanted to show the sinister aspect of the Nazis in his &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series of films for the U.S. armed forces.<BR>If you're serious about history or film (or the history of film), this DVD belongs in your collection.
0140434135|4.0|In the first chapter of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, Jane Austen introduces Catherine Morland and pretends to apologize for having such an unromantic heroine. In the next few chapters, Catherine appears to live up to her creator's apology, while the author appears to forget all about telling us about the abbey for which her novel is named. <br />The presence of the two shockingly audacious and impudent Thorpes--John and Isabella--almost makes up for this. Never did I want to slap and/or kick two fictional characters more. The ways in which they try to foil Catherine's hope of romance with Henry Tilney--and arrange a marriage between the artful Isabella and Catherine's innocent, unsuspecting brother--are enough to make readers gnash their teeth. Ironically, the scenes with the charming Henry and his kind sister Eleanor ramble along in comparison to the explosive scenes &quot;graced&quot; by the outrageous Thorpes. <br />I liked the last twelve chapters better. Actually set in Northanger Abbey, they are a hilarious satire of the nineteenth century Gothic novel. Catherine stumbles into misadventure after misadventure (if I may be so generous as to call them such), thanks to her wild imagination and voracious novel-reading. It is wonderful to be caught in the excitement of a (pseudo) Gothic mystery that readers know is not real, but that they understand _could_ be real. It's the excitement of telling ghost stories around a campfire then trying to get to sleep. Everyone believes that anything could happen, though anything rarely does. It's nice, safe, thrilling fun.<br />In my opinion, Jane Austen was having so much fun herself, in writing these scenes, that she did not sufficiently develop the romance between Catherine and Henry. They have few scenes together and Henry's character is too agreeable to be as interesting as John Thorpe's--or even General Tilney's. (Jane Austen should have apologized for him instead of for Catherine. Henry Tilney is more a Mr. Bingley thana Mr. Darcy.)<br />Despite this, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; has the expected happy romantic ending--with the author still giving cheeky asides to the reader. I'd still recommend this book . . . but only after &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, of course.
B000056N8X|4.0|This was a great movie. The creators incorporated characters from the movie series and the tv series. They explain many events which occured in the first movie and events from the television series. When these events occured, viewers said,&quot;O.k. So that happened. But why?&quot; <BR>  This is a movie that can be watched many times over with the same excitment as the first time watched.
0140380221|5.0|The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession. <br />Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.<br />Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.<br />I am never tired of rereading this part.<br />The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)<br />There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Pearl Harbor was the best movie i saw all summer long. I loved it. It had a great story line and great actors.i dont see how anybody can not like this movie. it cant be compared to movies like Titanic because they were completely different. i gave this movie 5 stars and would give it more if i could.
B00005N5S5|3.0|Anyone reading this already knows this is a sci fi classic and much better then the overhyped watered down t2 that got a great dvd treatment last year in a cool tin metal case, Why did they have to make this dvd as lousy as it is. First off the transfer is ok, although not much better then what you would get on the old out of print dvd of the movie. The sound though is great especially if you have a good sound systam, I don't so it did not matter as much to me as it will to a lot of the people who will buy this movie.The features are medicore a few deleted scenes with very breif commentery from cameron[.]   There are many storyboard and stills that aspiring artists will enjoy and they will take a good hour to go thourgh all of them, as well as the orginal story treatment of the movie which was a lot more dark and violent then the cut is now the terminator skins people and it's pretty gross, I prefer this version, but it's intreasting to see the way it was in the begining. There are a few documentries including a new one that I haven't watched yet and the orginal featurette that was on the live video release which is pretty  entrtaining. My main problem though is this disc is a flipper and I hate that, I refuse to buy goodfellas not only because it's barebones, but it is the only other movie I know of other then T2 that is a flipper. This makes me angry because I have poor cordanation and you have to be very careful holding the disc to not smudge it up, I have already done that, Although it has yet to effect play, But it will wear out much quicker then all my other disc's. Last week warner released a two disc citzen kane they did not have to put it all on one disc,  I would have gladly paid a extra to have it on two discs, Instead of having to eventaully buy another one of these ....
B00003CX9E|5.0|Well being considered the greatest movie of all time, it comes with the territory.  By nature, any time something extremly subjective like a movie is ranked number one people are going to be divided.  Personally I don't think this is the best movie of all time, it's in the top five for sure but not the best.  That honor has to go to my all time favorite the Godfather but that story is for another review.  <BR>The movie Citizen Kane is a radical departure for most people.  Raised in the short attention span theater, alot of people don't have the patience to sit through this movie.  But for those who do, and are in the mood to think a bit, this movie is great.  When you first see it, on the surface their isn't much their.  It's a good story but why all the hype.  Well the impact of Citizen Kane actually hits you when you turn off the movie.  You sleep on it, or you do something else and the next day you start to think about it.  You realize that this is damn good cinematography, not just for 1941 but for 2001.  Their is a ton of great shots in the movie from when he drops the snow globe to when he takes a picture of the reporters he stole away.  You then begin to think about Rosebud.  Sure everyone already knew what Rosebud was, but why is it so important to a man who seemingly has everything, and yet nothing at the same time?  You also begin to see that for all his success, his failures far out weigh them.  All this stuff starts seeping into your mind and you suddenly realize the impact of this movie.  His unraveling at his failed attempt to make an opera star out of his wife, his failed attempt at running for governor all make you think.  <BR>   So for those of you who &quot;get&quot; Citizen Kane, you already knew these things, but for those of you who have seen it and don't like it, watch it again and like the quote at the end of American Beauty tells you, &quot;look closer.&quot;
B00000064E|5.0|Nick Drake's debut album Five Leaves Left is a hauntingly beautiful album.  Mr. Drake's folk music is backed by the baroque sounds of chamber music.  This provides a lilting background to his deep, introspective lyrics.  Mr. Drake had problems with depression and there is a sense of melancholy that permeates the album, but not near the degree of his later album Pink Moon. &quot;Fruit Tree&quot;, &quot;Day Is Done&quot;, &quot;The Thoughts Of Mary Jane&quot; and &quot;Way To Blue&quot; stand out amongst an album's worth of stellar music.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|Finally, the new kings of comedy rock release a studio album.  Tenacious D, with their well-supported yet shortly-lived HBO series, as well as their constant live input, have earned a highly esteemed reputation of being f*cking hilarious, but at the same time f*cking good.  Sexual innuendo, daring taboos...it's all there, and the D aren't afraid to tackle it.<br />I myself have followed the D and have known for pretty much a year and half now, and because of this the songs on the album are unfortunately familiar to me.  Nearly all the songs are brilliant on the album, including the racy opener &quot;Kielbasa&quot; and rock opus &quot;City Hall&quot;.  Some songs fail to match the excellence of songs like these, including &quot;The Road&quot; and &quot;Lee&quot;.  &quot;Lee&quot;, a song from the HBO series, is a much better song on the series.  Which brings me to my next point of the album: some songs require the live &quot;feel&quot; to them in order to be truly fascinating.<BR>&quot;Lee&quot; is a perfect example of this as well as &quot;Tribute&quot;.  This does not mean that the songs flat out fail on the album...hardly.  Like I said earlier, all these songs are high caliber songs that are rarely achieved with such musicianship and skill in comedy rock (case in point: Weird Al doesn't hold a candle to these guys).  The single &quot;Wonderboy&quot; contains all the wonderful (or terrible, depends on how you look at eighties hair band rock) qualities of the power ballad.  Excellent song.<br />The skits on the album are generally funny.  &quot;One note song&quot; is excellent and probably my favorite one at of all the skits.  The skits achieve a &quot;laid back&quot; atmosphere, and generally give us a break from the &quot;extreme potent power of the D.&quot;<br />The production of the album is quite good, as anyone would expect from the Dust Brothers.  Although at times the electric guitars sometimes drown out Kyle Gass's superb acoustic guitar skills, all in allthe instrumentations besides Kyle and Jack's acoustic guitars is well used.  Note Dave Grohl's unbelievable drumming skills.<br />All in all, despite containing songs I myself already know, for all the virgin ears out there that have not had the chance to engage in the D, now is the time.  You've been warned...
B00000064G|5.0|Nick Drake's final album, Pink Moon, was recorded over the span of two days.  Unlike his first two albums, which contained backing of strings, woodwinds and keyboards, Pink Moon is stripped down to bone.  Mr. Drake's expressive guitar takes center stage and the bleak arrangements feed the depressive lyrics.  The title has become famous thanks to its inclusion in a Volkswagon, but it is only one of many stellar tracks.  &quot;Things Behind The Sun&quot;, &quot;From The Morning&quot;, &quot;Road&quot;, &quot;Harvest Breed&quot; and &quot;Rise&quot; all contain dark, brooding, deep and thought provoking lyrics that show a man with clear inner demons.
B00005R23S|5.0|Great 1st disc - which is the HBO Telecast.<br />2nd disc includes 11 songs never before seen including the epic 'Jungleland' &amp; 'Thunder Road'.<br />Don't forget to turn your amp up during 'Land of Hope and Dreams'. It'll knock your socks off! <br />Simply, A Must Have!
B00000064F|5.0|Nick Drake's second album, Bryter Layter, is the &quot;lightest&quot; sounding of the three he released during his lifetime.  While not happy by any means, there is a breezy sound that flows throughout the album that adds a lighter touch to such brooding tracks as &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Poor Boy&quot; and the two &quot;Hazy Jane&quot; songs.  The standout track on the album is the incredible &quot;At The Chime Of A City Clock&quot; which digs at the depths of the man and he confessionally lays his thoughts on the table.  Another striking album from the troubled yet talented singer.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|this movie is just awesome, unbelievable, and wonderful!  Angelina Jolie is just breath-taking and an amazing actress and a hottie!
B000035Z3K|4.0|Navigation through the disc is trying, however well worth it for the content. I purchased this for the Phillip Glass soundtrack but also the spanish version filmed on the same set is priceless for those who love this movie. The grey tones were exceptional.
B00005AAFS|5.0|The latest effort from an excellent band lives up to the Rammstein reputation! Till Lindemann's incredible range of vocal expression is backed up by flawless guitar work; it doesn't have *quite* the presence of works like _Wilder Wein_ (from Live Aus Berlin), but tracks like &quot;Mutter&quot; and &quot;Sonne&quot; still make it well worth the purchase.<br />While I'm writing: certain people like to claim that Rammstein are Nazis, apparently because they sing in German. News for you guys: Rammstein are from Germany, and still live there when they're not on tour. They are Germans. They speak German everyday. How is it a political statement for them to sing in their native language? At any rate, I speak German, and while I have no idea what they believe in private, there's no political element in their lyrics. It's basically American metal themes, in a language perhaps better suited to such beautifully guttural music.
B00005N83M|5.0|I'm a big fan of Jennifer Lopez and I think she's a very talented actress and singer. Sure, she may not have the best or most powerful voice ever, but she sure makes up for it in her music! J. LO is just a fun, uptempo dance album to listen to with your friends - perfect dance club music! This album is definitely better than the clean version because there are no cuts or bloops on the album. ON THE 6 had some good cuts (like &quot;Let's Get Loud&quot;, &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot; and &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;), but even I'll admit that it wasn't all that impressive. But J. LO the explicit lyrics most definitely impressed me! ON THE 6 was very heavy with ballads, I'll admit. But there are more upbeat dance tunes on J. LO.<br />My favorite tracks on this CD are &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot;, though I'm getting a little tired of it from the numerous radio plays; &quot;Play&quot;; &quot;I'm Real&quot;; &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;; &quot;We Gotta Talk&quot;; &quot;Carino&quot;; &quot;Secretly&quot;; &quot;Walking On The Sunshine&quot;, and especially the 'Murder Remix' of &quot;I'm Real&quot; with Ja Rule. There is so much variety on this album - there's a huge mix of pop, Latin, R&amp;B, and even techno music. There are a few ballads - definitely less ballads than there were on ON THE 6. And most of it's uptempo dance music. I don't see how people cannot like this album - it's very fun, not really meant to be taken all that seriously. J. Lo might not ever win a Grammy for her music, but it's cool and hip all the same. Besides, the best artists and musicians never win Grammys, anyway (like the Backstreet Boys). So buy this album - it's a must have!
B00000JCOV|5.0|In my opinion Slipknot is da best metal band out there (2nd place is Mudvayne and 3rd is System of a down) and you HAVE to get this CD...all the songs on the album are sweet, and what could be cooler that 8 total freaks wearing bizzar mask and beating the hell out of each other on stage? if you are a slipknot fan i also recomend geting there video &quot;there goes the neihborhood&quot; you will not regret this purchas, these guys are a nice break from all the boy band crap they are playing on tv now a dayz
B00005A46T|5.0|Ah yes, Iowa is the sound of life. For those of you who refuse to see reality for what it really is,please return to your regular programmed existence, no one can force you to begin to care. Why make music devoid of soul? Radio and MTV are murder to the human spirit. Why so angry? You wouldn't understand, take a step back- view life through another's eyes. <BR>Iowa has the best qualities of underground music; Harsh vocals, mind bending guitars, destructive bass lines, experimental noise, and yeah the drums blast! A few of the lines of the lyrics are silly but overall very insightful, honest lyrics. I love the fact that so many people hate Slipknot.Life is so ironic. Your parents will not approve so ENJOY!
0553278398|5.0|Prelude to Foundation was the first Asimov novel I ever read and I am currently reading it again for the fourth time !  Many people told me to read his famous 'Foundation Trilogy' in my youth (20yrs ago) but I never got around to it.  Fortunately by the time I did 'Prelude' had just been published, so it seemed a logical place to start !! I did not regret it..<br />Prelude to Foundation is just one episode in Asimov's sci-fi tapestry woven from several independent series of novels and short stories, all set in the future but with some connecting threads. It comes after the 'Robot' and 'Empire' novels and sets the scene for the later 'Foundation' books.  <br />Its setting is about 20,000 years in the future after mankind has invented hyper-spatial travel and populated the galaxy. We are introduced to Hari Seldon a math professor from a small planet Helicon, who travels to Trantor the galactic capital of the empire to attend the 10-year math conference.  There he makes the claim that the future of man might be predicted mathematically, since the net actions of quadrillions of humans become more predictable rather than less so (just like for atoms !)  Whilst Hari realises that his theory is correct but impractical, it excites the interest of the emperor's minister Demerzel. The emperor Cleon, is fearful of assassination, so would like the future to predict a long and successful reign..  Soon poor Hari is in over his head as both imperial forces and their enemies seek to use him as a pawn to further their political aims.<br />With the aid of the benevolent Chetter Hummin, who wants Hari to actually work on his prediction theory called 'Psychohistory' in order to save mankind from an impending collapse of the empire Hari escapes, but only proceeds from one mishap to another. He is encouraged in his work on Psychohistory and also protected by a colleague of Hummin, the adorable red-head Dors Venabili who is a academic historian, has great legs, but can also wield a mean knife...!  <br />The plot is fast moving and varied, with a hint of mystery. As usual with Asimov there is a twist or two in the tail..<br />I think 'Prelude' is a lot of fun and more enjoyable each time I re-read it (I have gone through Asimov's history of the future three times now!!) I think it is my favorite - it has a feel-good ambience pervading the book and I'm sure Isaac had a lot of fun writing it..no doubt there is a lot of himself (a former biochem asst. professor) in the Seldon character  !! <br />Isaac Asimov has left a staggering legacy and an irreplaceable hole for his multitude of fans. Asimov's work is highly complex and not always accessible, some of his writing is now half a century old. Asimov has done a great job in 'Prelude' in linking up many of his future-based novels. In his preface to Prelude he gives a potted history of his future universe and indicates how his books fit chronologically together. As he says some inconsistencies arose since the books were not originally planned to form one future.. but it kind of evolved that way !!     <br />For newcomers to Asimov I encourage you to go no further and start here, many of you will become hooked for life...<br />For afficionados of 'Robot'-lore and the 'Empire' this is a continuation of these novels and the action is all set on magnificent Trantor in its heyday and splendor.  It will not dissappoint.  The master sci-fi story teller was also at his mature best.  A partial solution to the question of what ever happened to the spacers of Aurora is also revealed...  <br />For first or second 'Foundationers' this book is a beautifully crafted piece linking the different halves of Asimov's future together, where Seldon is the fulcrum. <br />I wonder if his works will still be read in 20,000 years and what they will make of it all....
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD does its job reminding Beatles fans young or old how this group established itself as the world's premier Rock`N Roll segment of all time. Although The FabFour couldn't be gathered into any particular track arrangement, this title gives listeners thorough indication of what they're getting. Even though previous owners of the red and blue anthologies (like myself I admit) don't really have a great necessity for this disc in their collection(s), this arrangement nevertheless could impose a respectful finale to their sixty or so Hit/Live CD's they have made available over the years. Unique over others with its format, it no doubt helped inspire makers of the recently mastered Elv1s disc. However, there probably won't be another of these set arrangements from any other band or artist for a while now that The Rolling Stones recently released 40 Licks... Had that set been condensed into a single disc and only included their big hits it may also have had enough top songs to fit this #1 title theme as well. [Breaks I thought I would include with edit]. The Who/Eagles might have enough cuts to fit this title but I would be wrong to say for sure. I don't know enough offhand about hit rankings from Bowie (new disc out anyway), Stewart and Dylan etc. to determine whether they too might qualify. Abba/The Beach Boys/John/Jackson/Madonna? They can decide their status for themselves, not that anyone gives a note either way. Because neither The Beatles nor their fans became satisfied with any #1 success is how ultimately this disc made itself available. This CD not only supports the group's past achievements but should especially remain a nice keepsake for generations to come. They're the greatest Rock `N Roll influence ever and history doesn't promote such phenomena only to entertain itself...
B00000J6AG|4.0|I got this album for my 14th birthday in November of '99. 'Who the hell is Moby?' was the response I got from most people. I played a couple of the tracks for my friends way back when, and they thought it was so strange. I thought it was brilliant. Of course, at that time, you had only heard \\"Porcelin\\" once in a blue moon then. And \\"Bodyrock\\" was popular in commercials...but the absolute best of this album are the piano driven, soulful tracks. \\"Rushing\\" has always been a standout to me, along with \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\\"<BR>I especially like the guitar numbers, such as the epic \\"Everloving\\". And the last track, \\"My Weakness\\", is surpringly powerful, different, and is so...Moby. I love it.<BR>Skip the hit, \\"South Side\\", as well as \\"Inside\\". I NEVER liked \\"South Side\\". I don't even have the edition with Gwen Stefani on it.... But considering popular music right now, Moby is the delightful artist, and deseves his fame, rightfully so.<BR>Anyway, go buy it. It deserves it's accolades.
B0000203Y5|5.0|I discovered this group, watching a video of them in my cousin's house, the cinematography is great, particularly showing the beauty of Cuba and Habana, it looks like a beautiful city caught in a time warp: Vintage cars that are well maintained past their useful life with everything running, in the backdrop of paltatial buildings of old architecture and the ocean. It showcases the revival of Cuban music from the Mainland to the audiences of US, Holland and the world. It starts as a project by an American guitarrist of great renown Ry Cooder visiting Cuba in Search of this musicians, they first showcase, a Cuban crooner very reminiscent of Nat King Cole named Ibrahim Ferrer and we go into his home and shares stories about his life, loves and music, and they go through each member of Buena Vista Social Club, which was a nightclub showcasing Cuban music and becomes a musical group in its new formation made up other great Cuban legends: Compay Segundo, Ruben Gonzalez, Eliades Ochoa and great Cuban songstress Omara Portuondo. They show session and rehearsal work with Ry Cooder, their shows in Amsterdam and New York Carnegie with Ry Cooder as one of the guest musicians, and it is very uplifting their simple demeanor of this musicians and awe and wonder of New York City, and their deserved sell out audience at Carnegie Hall, and this shows that maybe they are not so different from us, in spite of our difference in politics from them.
B00004Z459|3.0|Here's the track-by-track review:<br />1. &quot;Papercut&quot;: A good head-banging tune.  Very hard and anger filled.  Sometimes it's confusing then turns into a very clear song.<br />2. &quot;One Step Closer&quot;: Nice little guitar intro, then turns into a hard song.  A 'depressing' mood to this song.  I actually remember when this song came out, didn't listen to it whatsoever.<br />3. &quot;With You&quot;: Interesting beginning with a turntable sound to it.  It has that 'rapping-a-message' thing in it.  Another anger filled song, a bad relationship gone wrong in this song.<br />4. &quot;Points of Authority&quot;: Kinda sounds like Aaliyah's (R.I.P) &quot;Try Again&quot; at the beginning.  Then has the turntable style of &quot;Nookie&quot; by Limp Bizket.<br />5. &quot;Crawling&quot;: Possibly the best song on the CD.  Beneath that screaming voice, Chester has a good voice (I know, I'm a sucker for boy bands, etc.)<br />6. &quot;Runaway&quot;: Another hard rockin' tune/melody.  I think Chester's 'good voice' shows again.  And that one rapping guy comes in again.<br />7. &quot;By Myself&quot;: This song...ugh!  Yikes, do not like whatsoever.<br />8. &quot;In the End&quot;: Nice little piano part in it.  The calmest song on the CD (I think.)  Interesting lyrics and message in it.  Sounds like a regular rock song.<br />9. &quot;A Place for my Head&quot;: Nice little 'Spanish' guitar at the beginning.  Then turns into a weird and 'body-motion' song.  Interesting.<br />10. &quot;Forgotten&quot;: I don't know but when I listen to this I'm eerily reminded of Fred Durst.  Fast paced, can't keep up with all these lyrics!<br />11. &quot;Cure for the Itch&quot;: 'Folks, this could be the dumbest thing they put on the album...'<br />12. &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;: Kinda quiet at the beginning like &quot;Crawling&quot; then turns into a hard song...again.  It's so usual.<br />Overall review: 3 stars:  Not perfect and not bad.  A good attempt by the guys in Linkin Park.  I surprised myself by buying this CD, because I usually don't buy rock CDs, but guess what...I did.  If you like to rock out, buy this CD.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this album, apart from the beautiful voice, the musicianship on the album to support her great vocals is equally great: &quot; In Paradisum&quot; goes down easy, beginning the album, my other favorite tracks are the title song &quot;Eden&quot; it has a beautiful melody with a Gregorian chant, &quot;So Many Things&quot;, &quot;Bailero&quot;, she also takes a stab at easy listening pop with her version of Kansas's &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; just like the Kansas version, it has the accoustic guitars and violin, the only difference is Sarah lending her superb voice, no ofense to Kansas, just different that's all, and she equally delivers a good rendition like the original. &quot;Tu&quot; is another great track, a sensuous easygoing song, just her phrasing in Spanish could use a little work, but I still liked it. There really isn't a bad cut. For fans of Classical to easy listening music, this album is a feast and one of Sarah Brightman's finest.
B000050XEI|3.0|i've liked enya ever since i first heard orinoco flow (sail away) so may years ago.  i even started buying cds from marie<BR>brennan &amp; clannad, enya's sister.  so i have really enjoyed this<BR>type of music.  when i first heard enya's new song &quot;only time&quot; i<BR>was intrigued,  so i bought the cd.  it's 32 minutes on the same<BR>material that she has been putting out since 1986.  i thought that after five years without an album she could've come up with<BR>some new ideas.  if you really want to hear a good enya cd,  try<BR>&quot;shepherd moons&quot;.  stay away from &quot;a day without rain&quot; &amp; save yourself some $$$.
0440219078|4.0|If you have ever wondered what it would be like to live in utopia, this book is something you should take a look at. The Giver is one of my all time favorite novels because it brings me to a new world. I find that every time I read this novel, I enjoy it even more than the last time. The story of Jonas and his journey to become &quot;The Giver&quot; of his particular society. The story becomes interesting when Jonas has to decide whether or not he can deal with this great honor. I loved the novel as a whole, but I have a problem with the abrupt ending. It just goes to show that nothing in this world is perfect. <br />-Ernest Bennett(Avon High School) ;-&gt;
B00004W3MS|5.0|I just wanted to let you people out there know what the album name means. It is kinda unfitting for a 3 album but then again they arent ordinary. 'Agaetis Byrjun means: An ok start/begining. I couldnt find their first and second album in here wich are titeld &quot;VON&quot;=&quot;HOPE&quot; and &quot;VON-Brigi&quot;=&quot;Letdown/Hope-alternatives&quot;, the second album was a remix of the first hence the name.
B00004X01U|5.0|--------<br />\\"Music\\" is a perfect follow-up to quadruple platinum \\"Ray of Light\\", a critically acclaimed, award-winning set from 1998. The 2000 set continues with the electronica theme but that's as far as the comparisons go for Madonna takes her \\"Music\\" into a different direction. <br />Musically it is much simpler and rawer than its predecessor with only few layers of instrumentations and special effects. Her vocals sound less \\"processed,\\" more soulful (e.g. \\"Don't Tell Me\\") and live. The electronic/techno sound itself is funkier and bass-oriented, which clearly acknowledges the presence of a new French producer - Mirwais - whom Madonna picked to helm this project. <br />Finally, the biggest \\"otherness\\" of this album is the folk/western feel to it and the ability Madonna and her producers fuse the modern funk/techno with old-fashioned, simple, guitar-driven folk sound. Songs like \\"Gone\\", \\"I Deserve It\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" all display a strong folk guitar presence, simple, stripped vocals with a melodic modern beat and background techno \\"noises.\\" This aspect of the album puts it along other similar projects by artists that have been exploring this growing trend of combining new with old, e.g. US3 (rap and jazz), Manu Chao and Mano Negra (ethnic techno), Afro Celt Sound System (Afro-Celtic-Techno) to name a few. <br />The album also contains the funky #1 title track, pure-pop 3rd single \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\" and `rock'n'rolling-ish' \\"Amazing\\" for top-40-radio-obsessed youth while the club goers will praise the pure techno cuts: \\"Impressive Instant\\" and \\"Runaway Lover.\\" And as a cherry on the top the album carries an emotionally heavy \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\" - a haunting, string-techno ballad with mysterious and sad vocals by Madonna. <br />\\"Music\\" is a strong album with a lot of musical diversity combined into one - logically consistent - whole. An important continuation of Madonna's musical journey (I just detest calling it a \\"music career\\" ;&gt;) and a stand-out album of the 2000/2001 period. Already a chart-topping best seller (12 million sold worldwide including 3 million domestically), it proves that Madonna has a unique ability to combine not only sounds but also her musical talent with commercial appeal.<br />--------
6305095566|5.0|Let's face it, when it comes to pure carnage, Evil Dead takes the crown. This is probably the most violent, most blood soaked movie I have ever witnessed in my life -- Isn't it just wonderful? 5 college students head to a secluded cabin for a weekend retreat. They discover a tape recorder of a professor talking about demons taking over his wife, which also awakens the spirits in the cabin and strange stuff starts going down. Ash, the main character's sister starts going loony and turns into a zombie. And of course, one by one, each of Ash's friends are also possessed by the Evil, until only Ash is left and must discover how to destroy the evil and make it out alive. Evil Dead is nonstop &quot;red&quot; action. You will be on the edge of your seat after the first 15 minutes of this flick. Sam Raimi's directing style is very intense and gives this movie it's beef. I suggest this movie to ANY horror fan. Parts 2 and 3 got just plain silly, but the original will always be a classic in my book.
B000059T5O|5.0|This is one of the best blues albums of the past 20+ years, combining John Hammond's gutty vocals and guitar with the quirky settings of producer Tom Waits (who also wrote or co-wrote all but one of the songs). It's a dirty concoction of mean streets and gutted dreams, yet elevated by the power and redemption of the blues.<br />The song most emblematic of the album's superiority is Track 2, &quot;Heart Attack and Vine.&quot; This is an almost unbelievable recreation of Muddy waters' Chicago blues, thick with deep, raw, Boomy guitars and Hammond's Louisiana vocal accents. Wonderful lyrics, and an incredible sound; it has the ambience of a live set... somewhere in Chicago 45 years ago! It also features great work on the Hammond organ by Augie Meyers. I haven't heard anything like this in years.<br />Tracks 1 and 3 also merit special praise. Hammond's quick and cutting riffs on &quot;2:19&quot;, coupled with Larry Taylor's thundering bass is head-shaking stuff. His playing somehow combines the power of electronic sound with the intimacy and personal touches of acoustic.<br />Track 3, &quot;Clap Hands&quot; fills a blues groove with the sinister spirit of a church with secrets, due, in large part, to Charlie Musselwhite's sinewy harmonica brewing darkly underneath. (It's so good to hear Musselwhite and his buzzsaw sound reminiscent of James Cotton.) The other songs take various blues routes and are uniformly excellent, including the John Lee Hooker flavor of &quot;16 Shells...,&quot; Hammond's steel guitar on the country blues &quot; Buzz Fledderjohn,&quot; the soulful &quot;Shore Leave,&quot; and Musselwhite on &quot;Big Black Mariah&quot; Of special note is the gentle &quot;Fannin Street,&quot; a folk-songish acoutic piece which, for some reason, reminded me of some of Traffic's (rock group) acoustic work.<br />There are annoying too-kewl liner &quot;notes' by T. Bone Burnett, but no matter: This is a must have for all blues lovers.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Nice packaging, lovely voice and songs, but not up to her usual standards.  Maybe more effort went into the packaging than into the presentation?
630157401X|5.0|\\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" is what I think the best of the three Indiana Jones movie. And one of the most important reasons for this conclusion is not just that it has Harrison Ford doing absolutely great, it has legendary actor Sean Connery as Indy's dad.<br />Harrison Ford is Dr. Henry 'Indiana' Jones, Jr. When he is asked by Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) to help go in search of the mystical Holy Grail since one of his main archaeologist has disappeared, he refuses. But when Indy is told that the missing man is his father, Professor Henry Jones, Sr., (whom he has rarely spoken to in 20 years), Indy, along with the help of friend Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), try to rescue his father from... who? Can it be the mysterious men who are trying to stop him from finding the Holy Grail? Or is there more to just finding his father and the Holy Grail than meets the eye? Indiana discovers that you can't trust anybody when dealing with power seeking men who want to use the cup of Jesus for evil.<br />The best Indiana Jones movie AND action/adventure movie!! And the script and plot is just perfect, with plenty of lines which are just so funny! The first part where they have 'young Indiana Jones' played by River Phoenix was lots of fun, too. I like it where the explained some things like how Indy got his famous hat. \\"Everyone's lost but me...\\"<br />My favorite parts are when Indy 'rescues' his dad but instead has to escape from the bad guys when he is caught himself and whenever Indy and Dr. Jones are arguing. One thing though is that I didn't think much of Alison Doody as Elsa. Yeah, she was real greedy and everything but I still like Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood in the first Indiana Jones movie, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". And of course John Williams score is just terrific. I can probably hum the whole Indiana Jones theme song! <br />For those of you who haven't seen this movie, well, I'm telling you to put it on you 'mustsee' list!
0790729636|1.0|This would have to be one of the worst movies I have seen. Both the story and acting if you can call it that are poor to say the least, with only the sound and special effects deserving any credibility. A total disappointment.<BR>This text refers to the DVD edition
B00000JPH0|5.0|I saw this at a film festival years ago, expecting little, and was just awed by it's unembellished view of war. I've since seen it again on video and this has only reinforced the fact that in the years since, having seen many, many other documentaries and war films, this still remains the best. Superb characterisation, pace, and tight directing. Never short of action; it doesn't ever become maudlin, boring, or jingoistic. The Actors are regular people, just like the soldiers who fought in this War; and the desperation and determination of tiny Finland holding back Russia is palpable and made utterly and frighteningly credible.<BR>Many have tried to make the &quot;definitive&quot; war movie, but none have succeeded like this Director with this Film!  Peckinpah comes close with &quot;Cross Of Iron&quot;. Purely and simply a benchmark for War films, and a Masterpiece of filmmaking.
B00003CXP1|5.0|From the moment you pop this DVD into your player, you will be rushed with a myriad images and sounds, all of them significant and all of them stunning.  The menus are cleverly structured around the &quot;Tappy Tibbons&quot; theme (you'll understand after you watch the movie) and the extras are actually quite intriguing.  One thing to stay away from in the deleted scenes: Marlon Wayans trying to ruin his only worthy work with an impression of Jar Jar Binks.<br />Now, on to the film itself.  Director Darren Aronofsky has created a masterpiece with only his second effort.  The film is beautiful and disturbing, and its impact is actually forced upon you.  That may sound like a bad thing, but it's actually not.  The main point of this film deserves to be hammered down your throat, and every young person should watch it probably before junior high but definitely before high school.  NOTE TO PARENTS: use discretion when exposing your children to the themes in this movie.  Deviant sexual behavior and graphic drug abuse and a smattering of shocking violence all show up to enforce the point of the narrative.  Every young man or woman is different, so be sure to carefully evaluate your child's maturity level before deciding when to show them this movie.  It is a film where nothing is gratuitous, and no matter how many times you watch it it will be hard to take.  The film scares you and shocks you in equal measure, and rightly so.  The theme here is addiction, specifically relating to drugs throughout, but there is also an underlying message that addiction to hope (most prominently displayed in Sara Goldfarb's case) is probably the most dangerous addiction of all.  <br />This is a masterful work not only in terms of its unparalleled visual imagery, but also in its backdrops and, most surprisingly and largely unnoticeably, in its sound work.  Listen to Sara Goldfarb chew on a piece of chocolate.  Listen to Marion's psychiatrist chomp on his food.  Listen for the tons of ambientsounds that filter through flawlessly on the soundtrack.  Listen for little, seemingly insignificant sounds (like Sara's refrigerator starting up after she talks with her son) that actually support the narrative.  <br />Every performance in this movie hits the mark so well that at times the audience will be stunned into silence.  Ellen Burstyn plays it raw and realistic, and for Julia Roberts's slightly above average &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; performance to beat her out at the Oscars is just further proof of how the Academy is into sympathy votes.  Each of the younger cast members pulls off a flawless turn as well, capturing the roller coaster ride of feelings that their characters experience and embodying the personalities of each without fail.  Most surprising turn ever goes to Marlon Wayans, with a serious, heartfelt role as an inner city young black male who has underlying psychological (that's right, psychological applies to Marlon Wayans's character) reasons for wanting to succeed in the drug dealing biz and, in effect, to &quot;make it.&quot;<br />The fact that each of the actors carries with them a sort of natural beauty further compounds the shock and impact of the audience having to see them deteriorate.  Ellen Burstyn is a beautiful woman even in her elder years, but the way she looks at the end of the film may blind you to that fact.  Jared Leto is a handsome young fellow who seems to be able to look good with any hairstyle (reference this movie and ones like &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Urban Legends&quot; to see what I'm talking about).  By the end of this film, however, he doesn't look that good at all (sorry, ladies).  With Marlon Wayans, the visual change may be hard to detect, but you'll pick up on it if you pay enough attention.  He conveys the feeling of misery quite well, I might add.  He appears resplendent and healthy in the first part of the film, but it does change.  And then there's Jennifer Connelly, one of the most underrated and stunningly beautiful actresses to ever grace a screen.  Her beauty will captivate you from the get-go, but her own character's visual transformation rivals that of Burstyn's character in its extremity.  You will hardly be albe to believe your eyes by the end of the film with respect to how these naturally beautful actors change their appearances.<br />Watch this movie and then visit the website for some irritating fun, and then read the book for good measure.  This story is not to be missed, especially by anyone who has had experience with or exposure to drugs of any kind.<br />Wanna know how to make a sensory treat out of a movie?  This one's a very good example, a true tribute to Aronofsky's style (watch for his direction of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; to show itself sometime in the future; our faith in Batman films may be restored yet) and one that outdoes his previous feature (&quot;Pi,&quot; also very good) a hundred times over.  This movie is so good that only &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; can beat it out for the title of best movie of all time.  Repeat: DO NOT MISS IT.  It stands so far above all other movies you've ever seen.
B00005MP58|3.0|This review is for the quality of the new DVD edition only, NOT of the miniseries, which is awesome, or of the the perfect Jane Austen story.<br />I have both DVD versions now and neither one satisfies completely. In the first edition, the colors are washed out flat, and the overall look is quite muddy and blah. In the second version, the colors are kind of blown out, with far too much contrast for my eyes. However, the second (newer) version at least HAS some color in it, and because of  the widescreen presentation, it is my overall favorite.<br />I'm afraid this wonderful series must have been shot with untalented lighting people using inferior film. It's the only way to explain such [cruddy] transfers...in two tries! Nevertheless, the acting and story make this well worth it, and for those reasons alone, I recommend purchase.
B00004U8JV|3.0|I thought that it was the end of the movie when malcom and shara were rescued by a chopper. All o a suden a whole new plot begins, It was like i saw 2 movies. this movie would have got a better review if the movie was left alone when they were rescued. also the movie was no were as creative as the first. I do reccommend it to everybody. It is quite a ride!
B00005KHJT|4.0|Well, let's get one thing straight.  The Halloween series was the first horror series I ever watched.  I've watched each one countless times, but I've definetly watched the original the most times.  When I heard of that 2-disk limited edition, I tried to get it, but it was gone!  So, I bought the one-disk, theatrical version, and was pretty happy with it, but then, out came this version.  I was so excited, and I thank anchor-bay for re-releasing the TV version.  When I got this I went straight to the added scenes.  I couldn't help feeling a tad dissapointed.  As you propably know, these scenes were NOT deleted, but added in 1981, when it was shown on cut TV.  John Carpenter shot these with the crew from Halloween II.  So, they do feel pretty un-even.  Whenever I watch a directors cut (Spawn, Terminator 2 Judgement Day) I always feel that the deleted scenes slip perfectly into the movie.  They make it even better, and they're not un-even.  With this though, they felt kind-of in a hurry.  I mean, in all the scenes (particularly the one where Lynda comes over to Lauries house) they seem like they're in a hurry and only have 15 minutes to shoot the scene.  That just kind-of annoyed me.<br />The first additional scene takes place directly after Michael murders his sister.  The scene takes place in 1963, with Dr. Loomis (the late, great Doneld Pleasance) arguing with the doctors at Smith Grove.  He sais that Michael Myers must be removed from the sanitarium.  The doctors say he's not even dangerous.  The scene is OK, probably my least favorite of the four that are added.  It's just a tad long.<br />The next scene is right after Loomis debates with the other doctors.  He goes into Michael's room  and says \\"You fooled them haven't you Michael?  But not me!\\"  It's actually very cool.  You get to see Michael as a boy!<br />The next addition is after Michael's escape.  Loomis is shown by a nurse the word \\"Sister\\" is engraved in Michael's door (for those of you who have seen the second, you know what that means).<br />The last additional scene is where Lynda comes over to Laurie's house to borrow some clothes.  She says that there's this weirdo following her.  I enjoyed this scene.<br />As for this DVD itself, it's not to exciting.  The picture is obviously not THX Remastered (as the other disk was) because the pictures a tad mudgy.  That's not to big a deal, but it is very noticable.  Some other reviewers have said that the TV scenes are not presented in widescreen, but they ARE!  Those reviewers need to watch this again.  <br />All in all, I'd recommend this to those who haven't got the Restored Limited Edition (if you've got that, why bother with this one?)...
B00003CXN4|5.0|I couldnt rate this DVD any lower because its a story based on the the hidden truth. A movie based and such research, realy lets you get in touch in the world you realy live in. I base this on my own experience. A hard fact of life for me and all the wictims of this epidemic. When I base these fact on my own life och the life of many more I just have to rate as high as I do. Otherwise I would do this film a great unjustice. But you have to se for your self and I promise you a story never forgotten.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I got this CD for my birthday from my aunt, even though I don't even like Britney. I tried out this CD on my stereo and was blown away by how awful it was! Britney puts great effort into singing at her very best, but unfortunatley does not succeed. In almost all of her songs she sounds like she is trying to sound like a prissy rocker chick, almost as bad as she was at The Superbowl! The only song I liked was &quot;What you see, Is what you Get.&quot; All of the other songs are unbelievably lame and the vocals are awful. I know Britney can do way better than that. Since I heard that CD, I have pretty much given up on Britney.
B000002J1B|4.0|Three tracks, 37 Minuites, if you've heard close to the edge, the layout is similar, except tracks two and three are switched (on relayer, the third track, Sound Chaser, is the most frantic song).  This album lacks the coherence of the several albums before, but it makes up for this with sheer energy.  Drummer Alan White blossoms on Relayer, providing fireworks throughout the album.  This album is rife with the extended virtuoso composition that you can expect from the band of this era, with Howe, Squire, and keyboardist Moraz trading off runs that when put together, confuse and tantalize the ear.  &quot;To Be Over&quot; has always seemed kind of out of place to me, as if Yes runs out of steam towards the end of the album, but if this song is unremarkable it is perhaps only in contrast to the first two songs.  This is, in my opinion, Yes's last great album.
0141301120|1.0|Much unlike the wonderful first book,Charlie and the chocolate factory, this book was horribly boring, and I had trouble not falling asleep while reading it.This book is definitely not one you'd want to read.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I watched this movie with no expectations or foreknowledge and was blown away.  It was funny, vibrant, great characters, great locations, great photography, great soundtrack and extremely funny.  This is the first movie in a long time that I have watched multiple times within a few weeks.  I have enjoyed it even more each time I watched it.<br />The DVD adds a lot, too.  Some great cut scenes, some great behind the scenes info and SUBTITLES are key for Brad Pitt's intentionally unintelligible lines.
B000002H97|5.0|This amazing work shows you Metallica at it's best.<BR> It opens with Enter Sandman(the 1991 oscar winner!)You must of heared this, if not then brace yourself for this energetic explosion!<BR> Then strait into Sad But True! The explosive bass of Jason Newstead (Newkid) slam your tiny mind into pulp! With James comming in with amazing lyrics about a very evil conscience.<BR> Then Holier than thou with very fast pace from Lars and Kirk.<BR> Then the song that means alot to me, The Unforgiven. The story of a young boy growing up unforgiven. The powerfull lyrics express maybe Hetfields tortured childhood.<BR> The song that is possibly the only love song that Metallica have ever done, Nothing else matters. &quot;Never opened myself this way,Life is ours we live it are way,All these words I don't just say and nothing else matters.Listen and you will be moved to tears as I have many times.<BR>                    METALLICA RULE MAN!
0790749815|4.0|Fun movie that fills me with a great sense of nostalgia every time I see it.  Eva Marie Saint was a BABE.
B000002H33|5.0|The last of Cliff.He realy seemed to put his life into this one.We all miss his talent and power he put into Metallica.<BR> The power of &quot;Kill 'em all&quot; seems to be put back into Battery as the speed blows your mind and and rips of one of your legs.<BR> Metallica realy are getting to the standard we expect in 2001 and are realy close to the final stile as James' voice gets deeper and the kind of rhythm we expect in &quot;load&quot;<BR> You must get this CD it is the best of all Cliff.

B000002H2H|5.0|This is a great CD showing the great work of Burton before the crash.<BR> This shows the master early work of Hetfield and Lars Before they were the largest rock group to hit the world.<BR> Personnaly I love track 3 with Burton raming his bass into the ground and Hetfield in the backround telling us about the theorum behind the battle.<BR> This is a must!
6304795254|5.0|Great, engaging, edge-of-your-seat kind of movie.  Loved the location filming in San Francisco.  I was terrified right up to the bitter end.  Stop reading the reviews before you come across a spoiler.  See the movie first!
0671045857|5.0|This book by Stephen King is extraordinary, I especially love the detail put into the plot.  The ideas are great and the suspence is thrilling.  It's imposible to put this book down.  Definitally worth a re-read!  Once you're done the book, don't throw it away, you're sure to come back to it another time.
0553266306|4.0|\\"The Day of the Jackal\\" is the novel that first gained Forsyth fame as a thriller writer.  The Jackal is the code name for an elite and elusive Englishman employed as a political assassin.  Both a master marksman and a master of disguise, his target is the much loved and much hated French President, Charles de Gualle.  It is 1963, and after various failed attempts on the President's life, his political enemies finally hit on a scheme with the sound of success: by employing a paid outsider - the Jackal.  Forsyth chronicles the ruthless Jackal's elaborate preparations for the hit, and his fail-safe measures that appear to ensure the success of his daring scheme.  But the mastermind can only succeed if he can elude the sleuthing bloodhounds on his tail, as detectives, police forces and secret services around Europe are fully warned and engage a huge security net to trap the cold-blooded calculating Jackal.  With nail-biting suspense, Forsyth unravels the plot, the Jackal always one step ahead of his pursuers.  The suspense increases in relentless fashion until the moment of truth, as the Jackal slowly, gently squeezed the trigger...<br />The fast-paced plot is marred only by the fact that it is not entirely clean.  There are a few incidences of blasphemy, and the unchaste behaviour of two women features prominently in the Jackal's rise and fall.  But on the whole Forsyth treats us to a flurry of action, and heart-stopping suspense and tension.  The concept of a manhunt for an elusive political assassin with a brilliant plot may seem tired, but the reality is that Forsyth was one of the first to use it.  The intrigue and accuracy of French politics is compelling.  This highly acclaimed thriller won the 1972 Edgar Award for Mystery Fiction a year after it was first published.  Lovers of espionage and thrillers will not quickly grow tired of it thirty years later, because this suspense thriller is deservedly a classic in the genre.  Once you're hooked, you will become like the chief detective - sleepless until the final conclusion.e the chief detective - sleepless until the final conclusion.
B00003CXA3|4.0|No need to say much about this film, it is a classic with superb performances and an excellent script.  The cast are all spot-on, with Gene Hackman (one of my favourite actors) fully deserving his Best Actor Oscar.<br />The 2 DVD set includes 2 documentaries, one 'The Poughkeepsie Shuffle' made by the BBC, and the other I think specially for the DVD release.  Both occasionally overlap in content of course, but are definitely worth watching.  They include interviews with Hackman , Roy Scheider and William Friedkin, and with the two NYPD cops on whose exploits the film is based.<br />The DVD transfer is very fine for a 30 year old film.  Don't worry about the atrocious grain (which almost amounts to pixellation) in the opening shot of Marseille's skyline.  The rest of the film enjoys an excellent anamorphic transfer, with only slight grain visible in a few night scenes.  This transfer is well up to the standard of the best DVDs of similar period films.  The soundtrack is also excellent.
B00005MAM2|5.0|It's bloody, it's violent, it's not at all for kids. But the harsh reality it portrays draws you in and won't let go. It's a very strange but very deep symbolism that makes the movie great, but it's not without the great action and art that so make so much Anime famous. This edition is redubbed, and I had some issues with that at first: famous lines were delivered differently, some names were changed to be pronounced correctly but seemed alien to me, etc. But all in all, well worth the money and the time.
B00001R3HX|5.0|Curious musical minds are usually rewarded for their experimentations in exploring new or unfamiliar groups.  Such was the classic case with this British wondergroup.  Fans of some of the less complicated prog scene will cherish this prize forvever -- not to say that this work is simple, just more accessible.  Cuts like &quot;Always Never&quot; &amp; &quot;Fadeaway&quot; are beautiful and emotive pieces that hint at the magnificent isolatory themes of Floyd.  A well conceived and complete record, &quot;Up The Downstair&quot; and Porcupine Tree deserve more recognition.  Until then, they're a best kept secret. A * * * * * * album.
044022425X|4.0|At first I had my doubts about the first book,only because it seems to take so long to get things moving.But once Claire goes through and ends up in Scotland not really understanding what happend to her,that is where the fun begins.It kept me truly mesmerized the whole time.Jamie is young,and so rough in one moment and kind and gentle in the next and so very protective of Claire even before they were married.I am not sure if I have ever truly enjoyed any other series more than I have these.It was a great Christmas gift that I received.
B000002GK1|5.0|My god I only got this yesterday and I have been playing it like crazy. For all of those of you wondering my favrite songs off of this album are Rust Cage, Outshined and Jesus Christ Pose.
B000003TB6|5.0|This second LP form the legendary Roots crew is probably the most lighthearted of all their releases. Black Thought was already a lyrical genius and MC to be reckoned with, but his voice hadn't yet deepened into the remarkable instrument that it is today. He and non-touring MC Malik B were still perfecting their legendary tag team skills and the arrangements were loose and indicative of the band's live shows. Bassist Leonard \\"HUB\\" Hubbard and Drummer/Producer/Sonic-Overlord Ahmir \\"QUESTLOVE\\" Thompson were already an airtight rhythm section with plenty of talent for improv and following each other through a wild maze of funky grooves. The contribution of Human Beatbox Rahzel \\"The Godfather of Noize\\" is remarkable, just listen to the classic track \\"? vs Rahzel\\" for proof! Featuring only ?uestlove (doing some of his most inventive drumming ever!) and Rahzel imitating a host of instruments, \\"? vs Rahzel\\" will have you wondering whether the other Roots are needed afterall (just kidding fellas), but his skills are incredible just the same.  If I had to pick a favorite it would be \\"Distortion To Static\\", again, great drumming, upright bass, a trippy, laughing vocal effect and terrific rhymes by Black Thought and Malik B. (his unplanned laughter on the line 'and you wonder what's next' is priceless!) that make it a keeper for the ages. All in all, \\"Do You Want More?\\" is one of the few mid 90's rap releases that still sound fresh today. By avoiding tired cliches, trends and the hate and violence that ruins so much music these days, The Roots have always been eons ahead of the pack. For one thing, they're a BAND. Secondly, they're a GREAT BAND. Do You Want More??!! What a silly question, OF COURSE!
B00004Y87O|4.0|This is a fun tongue-in-cheek adventure movie that Kurt Russell used to escape from his Disney pretty boy image.  The World Trade Center is prominently featured in this movie which adds a level of poignancy that's difficult to describe.  If you live in or love St. Louis, this movie is a must have.  Most of it was filmed in St. Louis and locals will have fun seeing the run-down Union Station (before it's renovation) at the climax of the movie.  The fight-ring scene takes place at the top of the grand staircase where now an elegant resturant is located.
B00005ATQ8|5.0|Watching &quot;BARRY LYNDON&quot;  reminds me of reading those long epic novels in English Lit. Class in High School. While some critic have accused Kubrick of being excessive in his slow-paced, long and detailed directing method, I found this film to be perfectly paced and quite rewarding. Of course, I'm biased because I love Kubrick's work, but anyone who enjoys great storytelling, fine performances and flawless direction will be more than amply fed with several viewings of &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. Part of Kubrick's genius and the finely understated acting of Ryan O'Neal is how we feel sorry for Redmond at the start of the film, but loathe him by the end. This film must be seen to be truly appeciated.<br />A masterpiece.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is stuck in my CD player. I've had this Hybrid Theory since it came out and I am still loving ever single song. Chester and Mike when singing has this surreal mellody. The Hybrid of rock/rap is totally sick. Everyone needs to have this album. You will not regret it.
B00005JGAB|5.0|This record changed music forever.It gave every freak, geek and outsider something to relate to.The Ramones made it to where any punk with a guitar and problems could just say what they had to say.

0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is very inspiring!  I liked it so much that I had my husband read it, and we both decided (separately) to give it to our parents as a gift.  I was going to pass on my copy to my parents, but my husband wants to keep it to refer to.  It is full of great life lessons.
B00002MZ2T|2.0|Savage Garden return. AFFIRMATION is not their best work. I was surprised at how much whining Darren did on this album. AFFIRMATION begins with the in your face &quot;affirmation&quot;, where Darren runs down his list of &quot;beliefs&quot; over a synth dance beat. There's sort of an annoying quality to that song. The rest of the album isn't that much better either. The only song that struck me as truly great was the hit &quot;I knew I loved you&quot;. That ballad is so light and dreamy, it just makes you feel good. The rest of AFFIRMATION deals with the heartbreak of getting over an ex. The mood is not the reason that this album is kind of dud, it's the delivery. The beats are pretty basic and it sounds like it could've all come from a casio keyboard. AFFIRMATION tries too hard with not enough steam behind it.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Probably James Cameron's best work! This movie is an all time and old favourites to those people who is a fan of the Alien movie series. To dated, this movie still stands out from the rest. While Alien Resurrection is as good as Aliens, but it still never comes close when talking about the film overall mood settings. Furthermore, this DVD boasts THX mastering plus Dolby Surround and Dolby Digital soundtrack. James Horner dark score has always been provoking. Not forgetting that this film is the definitive Director's Cut version, giving the film back it's pivotal moments to its storyline, 17 minutes to be exact. That's plenty to look at. As a proud owner of this DVD from Amazon, my trusted shopping source, I'm recommending this DVD to those who is a loyal fan of the Alien series. Aliens is definitely the best, the only movie that really sets the mood! Two thumbs up!
B000000QFY|5.0|For the longest time, I used to hear &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; on the classic rock station as a kid and later on as a teen. Of course this was way before I knew what progressive rock was, but I loved that song, so I wondered if the rest of the album was worth having and once I was able to get a hold of this album, I was not one bit disappointed. &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; was actually pretty untypical of the band and of the album, and in fact the band thought of that song as little more than a joke, so it was basically an albatross around the band's neck and they were forced to play that song live. Some people hate this song, but I love it. How about the rest of the album? &quot;Le Clochard&quot; is a gentle acoustic piece played with just classical guitar and Mellotron. &quot;Janis&quot; is a cool flute-driven piece. The title track is more or less simply a Thijs van Leer piece with just him singing and piano. This song shows that van Leer's did rather poorly in the vocal department (that's why, with the exception of In &amp; Out of Focus, their debut, their music has been 99% instrumental). &quot;Focus II&quot; is one of the more jazzy pieces of the album and show's Jan Akkerman's more jazzy side. But the real crowning glory is the killer side length suite &quot;Eruption&quot;. It starts of gentle enough but in the middle is simple really killer guitar and organ jamming. By the way, did anyone notice the band ripping off a Led Zeppelin riff on a small part of &quot;Eruption&quot;? The band totally stole the riff of &quot;Who Lotta Love&quot; before the band calmed down again and ended the piece with a wonderful piano and flute interlude. For me, I feel Moving Waves is one of the greats of progressive rock and whenever I hear this album, I begin to wonder why people listen to N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys.
B000002HRE|1.0|Sweet Jebus, do yourself a favor and listen to just about anything else: old Metallica, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, John Coltrane, the Beatles, Wendy Carlos...<br />Load is moderately okay once a year or so, but Reload is magnificent garbage.
6305558167|5.0|A gorgeously filmed, beautifully scripted, wonderfully acted tour-de-force. Absolutely the best film adaptation of the Arthurian mythos bar none, with more memorable/quotable dialogue than almost any film since &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Buy it!

B00003CY0V|1.0|This movie has just hit the cinemas in Denmark. I went to see it with some friends. We all agreed that this movie should have been sent directly to video/dvd.<br />There are so many cheap effects in it that it's amazing. There is only one actor in the movie that knows how to act, and that's Travolta. All the other actors performances are pathetic. And the 'plot'... is just an excuse to go from one predictable action scene to the next.<br />My advice is to avoid this movie like the plague...
6305014140|5.0|The story, characters, animation and fight scenes are great! Warning this video contains nudity and violence. So far this is the best anime Ive ever seen. Definitely a five star!
B000002UDG|4.0|If you want a basic overview of what James Paul McCartney accomplished after leaving the Fab Four, this is a good place to start. Most of his well-known hits are here, including duets with Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson as well as cuts that were only released as singles. Upon hearing this album you will decide whether or not to delve further into his extensive catalog. Released in 1987.
0440224764|4.0|Patrick said, \\"Did I not just walk out of the courtroom a free man?  Did I not just talk with a woman that I love dearly, a woman who happens to be keeping a small fortune for me?  The past is finally gone, Sandy.  Don't you see? There's no one looking for me anymore.\\"  Patrick then got on a plane the next day to freedom.  He went to Aix to a hotel that Leah had reserved for them.  Patrick waited a few days but Leah never showed up.  He went to Ponta Pora and stayed there.  \\"Where else could he go?  His journey was over.  His past was finally closed.  Surely, some day she would find him.\\"<br />The book takes place in the nineties but could very well happen in present day.  It is very levelheaded and realistic book.  This book is told in the third person.  The strength of this book is that it is well described and creates a picture in your mind of what is happening.  The character develops and changes throughout the book.  A major weakness in this book is that it is confusing.  The story is littered with flashbacks of what actually happened to lead up to that day.

0345442989|5.0|After the release of Kathy Tyer's Balance Point, I have found each subsequent Star Wars novel to be disappointing.  To be fair, the NJO books are more a case of central plot that bad writing, but I am also inspired by The Phantom Menace, and want to immerse myself in the old Republic and the ways of the Jedi.  Though Darth Maul's ill conceived novel was utter trash, James Luceno has come through with a ripping good yarn that delves into the most complicated parts of Episode I - the politics, and how Palpatine  manipulates them.<br />In Cloak, which has to be the ultimate Star Wars politically thriller, Luceno weaves several nefarious plots that threaten to collide, as well as sets up much of the plot to Episode I.  In it, Chancellor Valorum tries to deal both to the greedy Trade Federation and the violent Nebula Front, a terrorised organization, which soon leads to an attempted assassination and the mobilization of the Jedi Council.  At the same time, Palpatine subtly manoeuvrers all around him towards a secret and singular goal.  <br />This book is chock full of intrigue and characters, with enough action thrown in to keep us Jedi fans amused without resorting to Bad Plot Devices like Numerous Dark Jedi and silly SuperTech that Star Wars avoids so well.  Also, many characters from other books show up in amusing cameos.  But the best thing is how Palpatine stars in this book without taking center stage.  Much like the character indeed (I especially love the way both he AND Sideous are dealing with the Front!)  After his exciting entrance into the SW universe with Hero's Trial, Luceno proves himself here to be one of the best SW authors around, rising up into the ranks that contain a select few, including the unbeatable Zahn, Stackpole and Perry.  Hopefully, this will not be Luceno's last stand in the SW galaxy, and that goes double for the world of the old Republic.
B00005QCVT|5.0|This movie has to be one of the greatest films i have ever seen, altough it deal with bealk subject matter, the directing style and cuts are amazing. I would reccomend every freshman entering highschool to see this movie, it would turn their stomach's and perhaps someway alter their lives for the better. This movie is not suggested for an immature viewing audiance, no matter how old they are.
B000050XEI|5.0|At this year's MTV awards, Enya played her song &quot;only time.&quot;  What impressed me was as the camera's scanned the audience durning here performance, the look on their faces was plesant shock.  This was truley the first real music of the night.<BR>The song &quot;only time&quot; form the CD &quot;A day with out Rain&quot; is currently heard on TV and most radio stations and I am sure if it hasn't already done it, will hit the top of the charts.<BR>FINALLY THE MUSIC HAS RETURNED!<BR>The album is a another ENYA masterpiece!
B00003CWL6|1.0|I very much enjoyed American Beauty the movie, and feel confident that other reviews adequately cover its many strengths and weaknesses. <br />American Beauty the DVD is a different story for me. The DVD locks up in my DVD player after the opening screen asking for the audio preference. (The player is a Dolby/DTS JVC purchased in the middle of 1999) Entertaining as the content of this DVD is, its incompatibility with my DVD player is an annoyance. I wish that I had rented first to ensure that the DVD worked in my player.
B000002JSZ|4.0|I've just rediscovered the \\"Brian Johnson\\" era. I've never stopped listening to the Bon Scott albums, but after this was released I gave up on Brian when I heard Fly On The Wall. My mistake! I guess I always made it Bon vs. Brian. Well, this album stands up against ANY AC/DC album! Criminally overlooked (as is Powerage!)Back In Black is the only Brian album that gets mentioned in the same breath with Bon's albums, but this album is very solid! Not a bad song on here. It just didn't have an obvious hit single on it. I remember back in '83 when I got this album. I played it for all the kids in my neighborhood, and they all hated it! AC/DC was finished they said. I still know a couple of those kids today and I'll play this album and they'll say, \\"What a great album, what's it called because I wanna buy it!\\" I guess they have rediscovered Brian Johnson too!
0316548189|4.0|When I read Mandela autobiography last year, I kept thinking how good it was to finally read his first person account of the history of the anti-apartheid, anti-colonial struggle. While I had previously read many of his speeches and writings about Mandela, it  was good to see his view of the struggle. What comes out most clear in this book is that Mandela never sees the liberation of Azania/South Africa as his struggle alone. He constantly reminds his readers, as he did in the popular interview on the Oprah Wimphrey Show, that it was he and the ANC, along with the oppressed masses of South Africa, who fought and won the liberation of South Africa. Mandela clearly understands the role and purpose of organization in liberation struggle. Despite the media hype that tries to paint him as some sort of messiah, he shows that political education and mass organization are what brings about freedom.<br />The only problem I did have with his story is that he glosses over the final days or months of his imprisonment.  Any politically consciousness person reading his book would know that there must of been a lot more negotiation and deal making in order for the vicious, settler, racist European government and establishment to allow him to go free and become the head of state of South Africa. While it's clear that the European power structure was also responding to the pressures of the liberation struggle, they no doubt pushed Mandela and leading members of the ANC that the liberation of South Africa would require certain conditions so that the power structure in South Africa could maintain its economic interest. Thus, I guess it would be difficult for Mandela to fully disclose what took place before his release from prison, but somehow this account of the liberation struggle must be revealed in order that we get a better understanding of present-day South Africa.
B000002LND|5.0|There have been millions of words written about Madonna, and rightfully so.  She has influenced more than one generation with her music, and her first greatest hits package, &quot;The Immaculate Collection,&quot; is a get-up-and-dance, enjoy-the-music, mix of songs that displays Madonna at her best: as a singles artist.<br />The omission of a few songs (i.e. &quot;Who's That Girl,&quot; &quot;Causing a Commotion,&quot; &quot;True Blue&quot;) is unfortunate, but when you listen to the 17 tracks included here, there isn't a single track that will disappoint.  However, most of the key songs such as &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; &quot;Material Girl,&quot; &quot;La Isla Bonita,&quot; and &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; are presented in a studio remix version as opposed to the original album version.  And while the mixes are good - and certainly don't detract from the power of each song - if the songs were presented as they first appeared, it would make for a much better, more enjoyable hits collection.<br />The inclusion of &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot; are what make the album so spectacular.  <br />Exemplifying every inch of sex goddess within her being, Madonna's spoken vocals in &quot;Justify,&quot; over Lenny Kravitz's moaning - backed by a funky drum beat and synthesizer - are nothing more than four minutes of raw, pungent sex. &quot;Rescue Me&quot; follows suit (in terms of Madonna's spoken vocals) but puts a pulsating beat to work.<br />Now if only a double-disc greatest hits collection could be released...
B00005N9CV|3.0|I'm an on-air jazz dj. Have been following Diana Krall's career for many years. Diana Krall is a clear, luscious talent whose let herself be over produced a second time. Both this release and her last have pulled her away from her essential genious:straight up, swinging jazz in a trio setting. <br />It's difficult, however, to keep a good woman down, and her simple exquisite timing, timbre, and soul shines through nonetheless.<br />Not nearly as interesting a release as her first several, but if you love her, don't hesitate.
038533348X|5.0|I dearly wanted to review Cat's Cradle simply because I love this book. Instead, I started reading the other reviews, and I have now read through every one that precedes this one. I was fascinated to see what others saw, or didn't see, in this book. My favorite reviews, not to be missed, were by Elaine, dante999, and Jayyne. Thanks also to Chuck Schwab, Greg Hughes, toddwylie, Doug Vaugh, and many others....<br />Yes, I mean, no. This book both is and isn't about science, religion, nuclear weapons, genius, power, politics, and the future. This book comes as close as anything I've ever read to explaining human history. I'm not going to tell you what that explanation might be: just maybe I would be foisting my delusions on defenseless minds. Nevertheless, think about it, and try not to be distracted by all of the fun that you are having, as you do the Cat's Cradle.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is a revelation. While it is by far the most disturbing film of 2000, this movie is thought provoking, intelligent, true-to-life and utterly convincing. I can promise you right now this is a movie youre not going to forget in a while and a movie that is unlike any other drug movie ever put to the silver screen. Requiem for a Dream is so graphic with its violence, adult themes, drug taking and sex it may become a little too much for some people. I was frankly almost sick. So if youre a faint-hearted person I recommend skipping this movie and maybe seeing the equally good The Basketball Diaries. Okay, back to the film. It is one of the best movies of 2000 and has a unique power. As soon as this movie was over I just wanted to go back and see it again. Its official  this is the first movie in history than really properly portrays how heroin and speed and every other drug can dislocate us from ourselves. This movie has been classified as drama but it is really a horror film. It is so realistic, true-to-life and graphic about drugs and how they effect our lives that I was utterly terrified. I will never ever take drugs after seeing Requiem for a Dream and if I ever feel the need to Ill watch the movie and forget all about it. The performances in this movie are absolutely breathtaking. Marlon Wayans is a star and Jennifer Connelly is shocking and great as a girl who will do anything to get something to smoke. Jared Leto is unequally fantastic and by far the best young actor in this gripping movie. However, it is not a surprise that Ellen Burstyn gives the best performance. She is truly terrifying, believable and masterful as Sarah, who is using a dangerous diet and just wants to be on television. This movie has many memorable and terrifying scenes but I will not ruin it for you. All in all, Requiem for a Dream is a master-work of absolute terror, drama and drugs, a haunting film that will make you think twice about ever looking at another dangerous substance. <br />NOTE: Requiem for a Dream: Drector's Cut that is even more disturbing and graphic than the cut version. Director's Cut is even better than the movie itself and has alot of good features and new scenes. I highly recommend people who enjoyed the movie to buy the Director's Cut version.
B000002UJQ|1.0|it may be good compared to other radiohead cds, but there is much better stuff you could be listining to. this isn't music.
B00005NW02|5.0|When I first got this cd, I was extremely enthusiastic.  I have been a huge System fan for years, and this album has secured them as my favorite band in the world.  Their constant flow from the crazy hard metal to soft beautiful mellow music suits any mood.  This cd has beautiful songs.  A rarity coming from metal musicians.  Their Armenian background also has added a hint of Arabic flavor to the stew. Serj's raw powerful voice coupled with Daron's vibrato creates this mysterious sense of beauty that words can not describe.  All I can say is that this is the best album I have ever purchased, and I haven't stopped listening to it once since I've bought it.  It makes other music look shallow and stupid.  THIS ALBUM IS A MUST TO HAVE.  Please buy it and enrich your life with groundbreaking music, and support this top notch band.
0451191935|5.0|Simply stated, this book is the best fiction book I have ever read.  This book is actually the four early Bachman books rolled into one tremendous read.  This isn't the typical King formula of characters caught up in a supernatural landscape, but believable characters in plausible situations.  <br />I have read hundreds of fiction books.  This one is the best by far, and my all time personal favorite.  It was the first book I read by King, and hooked me to purchase other King books, some of which were disappointing.
6303481272|5.0|Yes, it is for a more mature audience...violence (blood and guts, inside of a man skull...,all the good stuff), nudity, sexual content, strong language...but hay! these are all the things that make a movie good. But if you dont like any of these things then you would be better off to watch...wait a sec, are you from this planet? <br />Well, anyways, its a good movie, lots of great fighting scenes, good storyline, great characters (Jubeis' the MAN, and Kagero is so cute when she tries to act all tough, I just wanna hug her and kiss her when she talks so mean...ok, sorry, I'm not sure what happened there), there is also a LITTLE romance between Jubei and Kagero. All in all, a very worthwhile movie.<br />Didnt really like the end though, but not suppost to tell you why, so watch it and enjoy.
B00000IQ4Q|4.0|The dialog is shallow, the acting is hammy, the plot is unoriginal and full of holes. But let's face it, this is all S.O.P. for kung fu movies, comic book movies, and often action movies in general. Some folks give it credit for the ideas of vampire society, but this is something that novelists and game designers have already been playing with for a long time now. This film gets good points with me because of the fight scenes. As a purist, and a student of two different styles of kung fu I found the opening scene to be a breath of fresh air amongst the goopy mixture of wushu and wire fighting that seems to be passing itself off as combat in so many other recent films. The beautiful sword work and overall sense of continuety of motion in this scene is well worth the price alone for me. There are some other interesting small scenes as well, but sadly, the climax fails to deliver what the opening promised; quickly deevolving into a giggley mess of overflamboyance and Highlander-ish nonsensical swordplay. But despite these last touches of disappiontment the action gets very high marks all the way.The special effects are passable, but not remarkable. The way the vampires burn away and crumble when they die is cool, the computer animated blood (again, in the climax) is not. Definatly buy it if your into action or martial arts movies, definatly don't if your looking for anything other.

Before, he was never capable of understanding the truth of &quot;releasing&quot;, now that he knows the truth he is determined to rebel and escape from the evilness of this society.  <BR>      This book is a must read for all age over 12.

0393317552|1.0|It seems as though the placement of rocks and trees must have prevented many cultures from having their Leonardo, Smith, de Tocqueville, Jefferson, Michaelangelo, Shakespeare, Aristotle, Madison, Raphael, van Mises, Hayek, Einstein, and van der Rohe.  I suppose the civilization-altering ideas of these men are not the products of genius, but, rather, the inevitable product of the earth.  As if springing up from a volacano, the ideas that transformed the world (observation and reality over fantasy, capitalism, etc.) and gave some cultures clear and indisputable superiority over other cultures had little to do with the people, but only in their placement on the earth.  A neat argument for someone who needs a &quot;white Europeans just got lucky&quot; speech.
B000002KE2|5.0|I dont understand. This is their best album... This better than Master of Reality. Master of Reality, although it is great, has som parts that just..eh. This has everything you want in a heavy metal album. Long epics, good straightforward heavy ones, nice power ballads, weird effects, heavy as hell songs, nice instrumentals, and a great album closer. Oh I know, it dosen't have 'Iron Man\\" on it. Please, and sorry if I offend anyone, but Iron man's not that great. This album has it's Iron Man. Under the Sun is that song. It's got everything. Good evil riffs, and a nice ending, with good vocals. Even FX is a good song, if you can call it that. Cornucopia is one of their unknown classics. Good stuff. Yet everyone loves (gasp) \\"Snowblind\\" or \\"Changes.\\" Those songs are good, but nothing like Supernaut or Wheels of Confusion. BLACK SABBATH FANS GET THIS ALBUM!
067942850X|4.0|Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild described in great detail the journey of Chris McCandless throughout America.  Chris gave up a successful life only to live on the streets and hitchhike.  He wandered through the western states for nearly a year and a half until he left for Alaska.  Two months after he walked into the interior of Alaska he was found dead by a moose hunter. The first few chapters are the last months of his life and then begin filling in the details.  Into the Wild is a compelling story but I found the structure hard to follow and left me wondering what was going on.  Jon Krakauer wove in his own life experiences and, unfortunately, in a manner that left the reader wondering whom he was talking about.  This book didn't follow any chronological order, which also left the reader wondering what was happening.  I was able to wade my way through the story and enjoyed it, even though it was a difficult read.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|What a movie, what a performance. Jolie was an ultimate choice to step into a shoes of Lara Croft. This movies is great, and I believe it is great fun for everyone, and specialy fans of the Tomb Raider video game. If you didn't see it, make sure you get this DVD, because after seeing special features you will appreciate world of Lara Croft more than ever.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Music, voice, and lyrics...what else needs to come together to make a beautiful album? I'm not too sure what the Amazon.com reviewer's problem is, but it's obvious he just has some kind of grudge toward the album or just doesn't &quot;get&quot; it...which is fine, we don't all have to like everything. But I seriously recommend everyone listening to this album somehow and deciding on their own if they like it, because it is simply amazing. This is one of those albums where literally every song is great, and I don't think you'll be disappointed. (Of course, it's not for everyone, but if you are even bothering to read these reviews, you are probably into this type of music, and you will like it.)
B00005A46T|4.0|Not since Metallica of old has a band been this heavy.  Slipknot is spearheading the return to real metal that the MET boys, Megadeth and other original thrash bands long ago abandoned.  This album is a wake-up to all of the Limp clones out there, your days are numbered.  While musically it is not the best album to hit the shelves recently, Iowa makes up in raw power what it lacks in melody.  #8 is lucky to still have a voice after the barrage of screaming found withing this disc.  I would prefer Taylor to sing a bit more, it still fits the music and mixes up the sound a bit more.  Ever been around a guy that yells all of the time versus a guy who does it when appropriate?  That is the main difference between Iowa and the last record.  #1 wins most improved for this album with a relentless attack on the drums that really drives the album.  #7 &amp; #4 continue to hammer out aggressive low end riffs that are at times muttled, but always in tune with the rest of the band.  After a few listenings Iowa is a must buy for fans and a worth-while risk for anyone who is sick of the monatany in metal today.  Slipknot never tries to be more than a hard-nosed metal band and they succeed admirably.
B00005NWRS|1.0|I had previously reviewed this album on the day that I purchasedt this cd and the truth of the matter is I have listened to it only a few times since then. Ryan Adams does not have an original bone in his body it appears plus he is a little too prolific for his own good. Heartbreaker was an amazing album but everything else that Ryan has done has been so spotty that it almost isn't even worth picking up. Save the money and buy something good.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Perfect casting and wonderful ensemble performances make this a good, clean and clever send-up of TV has-beens and their fans. As an aging but still somewhat nostalgic post-trekkie, this film really clicked with me. The &quot;stuck in a time-warp&quot; premise as a device to explore the dynamics of leadership, blind faith, dumb luck and circumstance, revealed remarkable depth in what could otherwise have be seen as just another throwaway &quot;Hollywood&quot; comedy. In addition to this movie being a real hoot, the actors display a refreshing depth of feeling and serious attention to their craft in making even the most outrageous characters believable.  &quot;Never give up, never surrender&quot; will be etched in my memory for a long, long time. I got pulled into the fun and, as Guy put it best in the movie, &quot;I'm just jazzed to be in the show, man&quot;.
079284632X|1.0|I wish there was an option to give negative stars, but oh well. This movie is a classic example of the 70s movie made for about 50 bucks, the actors, I use that term loosely, were terrible, wes craven should have apologized to the rest of the world for this one. Some one told me this was one of the most &quot;disturbing &quot; movies ever made, i sure was disturbed that I paid 12 bucks for this pile. My advice, if you really want this movie, take 12 dollars from your wallet and set it on fire, thats pretty much the feeling you'll get from &quot;last dump on the left&quot;
B00005NWRS|1.0|maybe its me, but he seems to get worse and worse
0553106635|5.0|G.R.R.Martin is a phenom. Reading these hugh, complicated novels is to be swept away into a Medieval world, just similar enough to our own Medieval period to invite comparison, yet with a flair for melding myth and reality which ultimately makes the reader a believer in the world the author has created.  Martin's most extraordinary gifts involve cryptic foreshadowing (even from the first book), incredible character development and even more incredible dialogue.  His belief that nothing is quite what it seems is borne out in unexpected ways within not only the plot but also in the fungible nature of the human psyche.  Good and Evil are truly opposite faces of the same coin to Martin.  How he skillfully blends these opposing forces within his major characters is to force the reader to confront the duality of not only human nature but the human condition itself.  Comparisons to other writers in the fantasy genre are difficult to make.  In my opinion, Martin eclipses the vast majority of them (including some icons like Frank Herbert and Isaac Asimov).  The fairest comparison would be to Tolkien, but here the comparison becomes trickier.  One could wish that Tolkien had had Martin's capacity for length, if nothing else.  Tolkien's masterpiece was built on his love and mastery of etymology and the Anglo Saxon period; Martin's on his complex use of personae and an astonishing depth of imaginative talent. The most frustrating issue for most readers will be summoning the patience to wait for the next book in the series. Six books may indeed be adequate to tell the story but we can only hope it takes more.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Over the last few years, the subject of a wedding has been winning formula for some of the most enjoyable and successful romantic comedies.  We had Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell in &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; and Julia Roberts in &quot;My Best Friends Wedding&quot;.  And now add to the list Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey in the delightful, &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;.<br />The story sees San Francisco's premier wedding planner Mary Fiore (Lopez, in an enjoyable performance) landing an account to head up the wedding for internet heiress Francine Donnelly (Bridgette Wilson - Sampras), and if this goes through, Mary will recieve a partner position in the business.  Things are looking up, until she is literally bowled over by handsome Dr. Steve Edison (McConaughey, definitely establishing himself in romantic comedy lead male status).  As she believes her romantic life is on the rise, thanks to Dr. Steve, Mary faces the horrible truth, and one we know is coming, Steve is Fran's fiance.  Now the tow are fighting their attraction for each other, resulting in an enjoyable, fluffy, often hilarious and cute romantic comedy.<br />All the players are suited to their roles, and the two leads, Lopez and McConaughey, share believable chemistry.  The secondary cast provide plenty of humourous support, in the form of Judy Greer (As Lopez's assistant), Justin Chambers (As a possible romantic contender for Lopez, despite her growing unattraction for him) and Charles Kimbrough and Joanna Gleeson as Fran's parents.<br />The DVD also holds interesting extras.  Apart from the usual trailer and behind the scenes segment, we have the featurette entitled &quot;The Dancer and the Cowboy&quot;, which talks about how Lopez helped McConaughey out with the dancing scenes, and McConaughey gave it back by assisting Lopez with the horse riding.  There is also commentary from director Adam Shankman, who was also the dance choreographer for such films as Boogie Nights and She's All That, and a series of deleted scenes, one which female viewers might enjoy as McConaughey pops up showing his bare chest.<br />Although predictable, the film is immensely enjoyable and should be seen, if not owned, by all.
B00005NC66|5.0|Godard's &quot;Breathless&quot; (or &quot;Out of Breath,&quot; the correct translation fo the title) still feels fresh and alive, especially when viewed in the dreary context of contemporary Hollywood cinema.  It offers a sparklingly original alternative at every turn, from the pacing of its story to the engine that drives its loopy, intentionally sloppy plot.  This is a picture that is alive on screen as you watch it, forcing you to draw yourself into the action rather than lay back and passively absorb it.<br />The film is one of the finest examples of New Wave cinema, from its jump cuts, its depiction of Parisian life, its incredibly sustained sequences of pure converstaion and dialogue, all of which dominate what is essentially a simple chase picture.<br />Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg are a perfect mix of classic and contemporary, both remaining timeless.  Their relationship really unfolds in the film's central sequence, a near 25-minute conversation in Seberg's bedroom, in which such subjects as Faulkner and fornication are explored aptly.  And that is what the film is known for----when was the last time a thriller contained the audacity to feel free to explore areas residing outside the genre?<br />Like &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; one of its distant relatives, this is a film where plot and story are present but removed far into the background, while character, dialogue and visual texture are placed in the foreground.  In its pristine black-and-white cinematography, its innovative use of camera movement and position, its raw, defined performances, and its tireless style and visual invention, &quot;Breathless&quot; is a great film and belongs in any serious film lover's video library.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|After seeing this film I have had nothing but compelling thoughts rummaging through my head, as well as a deep-seeded desire for powerful, true love.<BR>Baz Lurhmann's directorial tastes have always been on the cutting edge, which makes the film a little difficult to follow in the beginning, but the music and the youthful love story just sweep you away.  I give total thumbs up to the fantastic soundtrack as well-- nothing like it.<BR>By the movie's end I was so touched that I have been able to think of nothing else but the ache of a love like that. If you have not seen it, I recommend you do, for it's a beautiful movie, and one of the most moving I have seen in quite some time.
B00003CY0V|2.0|&quot;Swordfish&quot; opens with a superior sequence containing of dialogue----that's right, dialogue, which can, from time to time in American cinema, consist of intelligent sentences, colorful expressions, and be unequivocably entertaining.  The picture has that when villian John Travolta discusses such films as &quot;Serpico,&quot; and the hand-held cinematography, combined with extreme close-ups and carefully expeditious editing, highlights the film right from the get-go.<br />Then it gets going hill, unfortunately, unwinding into a standard thriller chock-full of stupid car chases and outrageous sequences, including the finale in helicopter.  It combines those big-budget thriller elements with computer-based intrigue, but not very well; this whole picture feels less like something newly created and rather a product that has been manufactured.<br />It's made with some style, and doesn't apologize for what it is, and the performances from Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and especially the superb Don Cheadle are entertaining enough, but don't get to play richer, stronger characters.<br />For all its fancy special effects and editing, as well as lively techno music score, the picture feels overblown, as if there is a better film lurking within all of the noise and dumbed-down situations.  Not an awful film, but a big, goofy picture we've seen many times before.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The Adventures of Robin Hood is one of my favorite movies of all time. But, like so many others, I wish it would come out on DVD so I can enjoy it with pristine sound and near-perfect picture quality for many years to come.<br />Flynn, Basil Rathbone, Olivia de Havilland, Claude Rains -- what a cast! There are even a smattering of Hollywood's most famous character actors included here, such as Alan Hale Sr. (father of the Skipper on Gilligan's Island).<br />This movie got me started on a lifetime fascination with fencing, sword fighting, swashbuckling and the triumph of good over evil. It's a classic from start to finish.<br />But, again, I ask: Why so few Errol Flynn DVDs? Granted, he wasn't the most accomplished Hollywood actor. But he was one of the most famous -- and this movie, The Adventures of Robin Hood, is certainly one of Hollywood's finest.<br />Please, whomever holds the rights to this movie, please give it to us in DVD format. I've been wearing out too many VHS copies!
B00000IO4J|2.0|Let's start off by saying that it was a nice, fresh twist to have a teen horror film that wasn't a slasher film. I prefer the slasher ones, but this will do. Kevin Williamson from \\"Scream\\" and Robert Rodriguez from \\"Desperado\\" and \\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\" team up for this sci-fi/horror teen film about a bunch of high schoolers who find out that the faculty at their school have been overtaken from some outer space parasite. The one thing this film has going for it is the cast. We get a lot of great seasoned performers : Piper Laurie, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, Jon Stewart, Bebe Neuwirth, Famke Jenssen, and Christopher MacDonald. The kids are all good. Jordana Brewster is an instant eye catcher. Very beautiful girl. There is nothing new here, but the sharp direction and choreography, as well as the solid cast make it decent enough. Pretty average.
B00003CXSP|4.0|A true stand alone sequel. The movie follows the book exactly along the plot line, but it does lack the in-depth detail and plot twist that you can only find in reading a book. I highly recommend the movie. It is a dark comedy, dark romance, and thriller all in one. It is not for the squimish or faint of heart
0451197968|4.0|King wrote many unpublished works before hitting the big time. Later, when the publishing house was scrabbling madly through his attic, searching for anything to publish, they came across a load of early stuff which they published under the pen name of Richard Bachman. When this didn't work, they re-titled stuff as 'Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman'. This seemed to work better ... shows what a name can do!<br />Running Man, though well written by anybody else's standards, is certainly not up to the usual King benchmark. It lacks the depth of the later King books. Having said all that, the story is entertaining and the characterization of Ben Richards, the protagonist is exceptional. In short, Richards is in a life or death race. He wins - he escapes poverty. He loses - he dies. Trouble is, no one has ever won. The game is televised and (fairly obviously) biased against the contestant.<br />In later years, King claims that there was no ulterior message in Running Man, though to me it seems that he highlights the problems of a generation who are glued to the television screens, how gullible they are to anything they see on the silver screen, and just how far the major networks will go to retain 'customer loyalty'. Also, as I write this, just after the awful attacks on WTC and the Pentagon, it strikes me that it was not only Tom Clancy who foresaw the threat of an aeroplane attack on a building.<br />Running Man is not a long book. It's an easy weekend read that will leave you amused but maybe a little sad about the future.
0452282152|5.0|Girl with a Pear Earring is a very exciting story about a young girl, Greit, who becomes a maid for the artist Vermeer when her father was hurt in an accident.  Griet is a protestant and is going to work for a catholic family, which makes her uncomfortable at first because she is worried about the diffrent ways they do things.  She doesnt fit in to well with the family.  Corneila the oldest daughter is a brat, who doesnt like Griet, and throughout the novel gets her into trouble. Greit become closer and closer to her Master Vermeer, and ends up being almost an assistant to him. He allows her to do many things for him that he would never let other people do, even his on family.  The family is jealous of Griet because she gets to do things they do not such as: clean the studio, go in the studio, and help make paint.  Part of Griets chores is to go get meat from the butcher every day.  While getting meat Griet and Pieter, the butchers son become quite fond of each other, and in the end they are married.  This was a great novel, and while I was reading it, it took me into a diffrent time and place. The characters in the story were very realistic and vivid.  This was a very intresting book, and I highly reccomend it.

0525457585|4.0|Bastian Balthazar Bux's life is not faring too good. There are many bullies at his school, who usually pick on him,he is fat and tubby and his father hasn't spoken to him ever since his mother's death. One day when Bastian passes a bookshop something makes him enter. When he enters he finds Mr.Coreandar, the shopkeeper reading a book. Bastian is mesmerized by the book's cover the minute his eyes are laid on it. Knowing that the book probably costs good money, Bastian picks up the book and runs out of the store. He then goes to his schoolhouse and goes to the attic where no one else ever goes. He begins to read the book ( The Neverending Story) and then is sent into the book as a hero. Bastian loves the country (Fantastica) and doesn't want to leave. People find him as the savior of their land for saving the childlike empress and also have no intention of forcing him to leave. During the book Bastian meets many friends like, Falkor, the luckdragon, and Artreyu, the hero who brings Bastian to Fantastica. This is a great read, but you will have to pay a lot of attention to the book because there are many, many, characters in the book. At times the book has it's tedious points, but I finished this book knowing that it was a 4 star book.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Are the Godfather films perfect?  NO!  Do they comprise the best movie trilogy of all time to date?  YES!<br />Are these films about power, greed and ruthlessness?  YES, but they are more about &quot;necessity&quot;.  Michael Corleone discovers that he is NOT in control of his destiny and that it is necessary for him to do certain things, certain diabolical things, just to survive!<br />Michael is not the author of his situation, he did not deal himself the cards which he finds himself holding.  He must play these cards correctly, just to live.  He could act differently, he could act more conventionally moral, but then he and his family would not be around to even have the chance to change things in the future.  Survival is after all fundamental!  If you are not here then all else is MOOT.<br />&quot;The majority of men lead lives of quiet desperation&quot;, said Emerson.  These movies encapsulate this crushing reality like no others!<br />I unreservedly include Godfather 3 in the above remarks.  For me it is a wholly fitting conclusion to the saga.  Is Michael redeemed?  NO, he simply endures a terrible loss and dies alone and ignominiously.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Well it finally happened! For the first time since the heady days of the '70s Bob Dylan has managed to release 2 consecutive good albums! Back in the 80s the finest albums, Infidels and Oh Mercy, were seperated by some pretty poor material (Down in the Groove, anyone?). Then, after Oh Mercy everything went wrong again. Under the Red Sky was a mediocre start to the 90s, and things got worse. Then suddenly in 1998 he released the superb Time Out of Mind. Arguably his finest album since Desire. The world waited with baited breath for Dylan to ruin his new-found respect with another album of folk &quot;classics&quot; like Froggy Went a Courting. But no! Love and Theft is a truly great album. If it lacks the gritty roughness of Time Out of Mind it more than makes up for it in melodic content! Mississippi is, as everyone says, a great tune! On Moonlight (and you really have to hear this to believe it) Dylan actually tries to croon! All the great American styles are present on this album, including a good dose of earthy 12-bar blues! On first playing I was convinced after the first 11 tracks that this was a Dylan classic. Then I heard the last track &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;. It made my toes curl! &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; is a beautiful and haunting song! Perhaps his finest closing song on an album since &quot;Sara&quot; closed Desire over 25 years ago. He actually 'sings' on this album. And what a performance. His heart really seems to be in the music. Frankly, so is mine.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|I loved this album, and so will you.  After hearing it, I was immediately reminded of another female vocalist/songwriter called Laura Nyro.  She was also young when, in 1968, her first and undoubtebly best album, \\"Eli and the Thirteenth Confession\\" was released.  I would like to take this opportunity to reccomend that album to anyone who seriously enjoys the music of Fiona Apple.  Laura Nyro is perhaps a step above, for while she can bring out her melancholy to a point that is goosebump rendering for the listener, she also made songs that were simply a joyous celebration of life and love.  Fiona Apple tends to dwell only on the darker moments in her life.  So, anyway, for lyrics that pull and push you to a beautiful climax, and for melodies that are sure to brighten any cloudy day, I totally and whole-heartedly recommend \\"Eli & the Thirteenth Confession\\" by Laura Nyro.
B00005A0N5|5.0|These guys are the best in what they do. Powerfull, melodic heavy metall with outstanding operatic female vocals. I checked mp3s of the band at centurymedia.com and knew right away I had to have their music. Music varies from upbeat with excellent keyboard work, great guitars and drumming to beautiful ballads.<BR>All songs are great. Highly recommend!!! Buy it!!!
B000059HB7|5.0|Rio Bravo is a complete movie experience, drama, humor, romance, music, a real plot and it is carried off with ease.  The cast is superb and the settings are great.  Dude, Stumpy and Colorado are a great support team for JW and Angie Dickenson is great as Feathers the romantic interest. At 141 minutes it is a long movie but you won't realize it until the afternoon or evening is gone before you know it. This movie is now my 9 year old daughter's favorite and she is relentless in choosing it when she gets the chance.
B00000K19E|5.0|Everyone in the world should own this film - it is packed with extras and is quite simply one of the greatest films of the past 5 years
0486408434|5.0|If you're overwhelmed with magic book titles, and don't know which book to buy to start your experience with magic, BUY THIS BOOK.<br />Keep in mind it was written before TV, so you must be a enthusiastic reader and a magic lover. It requiers a lot careful and minucious reading and re-reading, but only because of its very precise explanations.<br />The next step after studying from this book, is watching a good magician perform the sleights so you can have an idea of speed and timing.<br />Buy it only if you are truly commited to learning non self working card tricks and sleights.<br />If I had to throw away all my magic books except one, this would be it.
B000059T5O|5.0|Most reviewers have praised this album, and I'll get in line right behind them.  Before buying it, I'd  seen Hammond and his band perform the album at a beautiful outdoor amphitheater in Reno, Nevada. What I heard of the lyrics at the show intrigued me, but a closer listen at home suggested a story that the songs, when taken collectively, might be telling. It seems to be tales from a man's life, from the kid who &quot;ain't allowed in Buzz Flederjohn's yard,&quot; to the salvation declared in &quot;I Know I've Been Changed.&quot; &quot;Shore Leave,&quot; &quot;Jockey Full of Bourbon,&quot; &quot;Murder in the Red Barn,&quot; - hell, all of the songs - are things this guy has lived or seen. In that sense, I see this album as a poetic masterpiece.  The music is great, too.  This band is rougher than Little Charlie and the Nightcats, who have ably backed Hammond on some of his 90's releases.  But here, Larry Taylor (who plays upright bass rather than his usual bass guitar), Augie Meyers, Waits, Charlie Musselwhite, and an excellent drummer whose name escapes me, are perfectly in sync with Hammond's guitar style and vocal delivery. Wicked Grin can provide some direction for the future of the blues - intelligent lyrics &amp; great music without interminable choruses of instrumental solos.  Finally, after seeing Hammond's Wicked Grin performance, I thought about why he would choose to come onstage and perform only the songs on the album - it was a very different experience from three of his solo performances I'd seen between 1986 and 2000.  I concluded that Hammond wants to present Wicked Grin as a special project and a cohesive work. If that's what he wanted to do, I say &quot;Congratulations, John&quot; - you've succeeded.  And I hope it sells enough to give him the greater recognition he deserves.
B00005QATY|5.0|O Brother, Where Art Thou was a fantastically done movie.  The cinamatograpy was spectacular!  Although Hollywood seems to be stuck in a rut of remaking old classics, they sure hit a gold mine with this one!  I can't wait to buy this film!
0767800958|5.0|A terrific movie if you're into dancing - especially argentine Tango dancing. I found the byplay between the characters to be a bit irritating (mostly because I can't stand seeing people playing dominance headgames in a relationship) but overall this movie is a jaw-dropper.
0790729628|1.0|No Extras, absolutely zero extras.<br />Transfer from Film, one of the worst ever.<br />After watching the original and the Directors cut 2 times each,<br />I like the original better. It reveals more about the time, the place and mostly about Fords character. And that voice, Harrison<br />Ford has a fantastic voice over voice. It's like deleting the flame on the Statute of Liberty. If they ever issue a improved version, put both versions on the DVD and for heavens sake clean the picture up.
B000002GK1|4.0|Great record from one of the best bands of their (or any other) time.<br />Quick pointer to another review from Eric Amos from South California. The album is Soundgarden's 3rd (4th if you count the Sceaming Life / Fopp EPs CD) and NOT their debut. It is also astonishing and not the unlistenable atrocity that your review seems to suggest.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|Before I saw the movie, I thought the reviews here were pretty exaggerated, or were just a really big fan of, hmm lets say Gillian Anderson *which I am, by the way* BUT this exceeds all my expectations. EVERYONE was amazing, even if the story lines were a bit subtle than your typical mall movie. But the writing was pleasantly witty and intelligent, and John Stewart CAN ACT, guys! He's great. Really wish we'd see more of the characters they created!
6305508550|3.0|There are a lot of things to like about this movie, especially about how it gets the little things right about the perils of working in an office: the (unavoidable) doorknob that always shocks you when you touch it, the malfunctioning printer, etc.  It also nails many of the inhabitants of the corporate world: I've seen the real-life equivalents of every one of these characters in one form or another during my time in cubeland.  It also does a great job of capturing the upside-down logic of the corporate world (such as when Peter, who spends his day avoiding work, is promoted, and his hard-working cubemates Michael and Samir get laid off).<br />The trouble with Office Space, though, is that it has trouble sustaining its vision of the workings of corporate hell.  This movie is at its funniest for about the first third, when it shows a subtly amplified version of the real corporate world.  However, it soon turns into a routine caper movie, and that's where it loses it.  The movie continues to take a few jabs at the miserable life that many cube dwellers go through (such as the indignities heaped on Milton, the poor schmoe who is sent down into the roach-infested basement to work), but the parts of the movie where the protagonists are trying to exact revenge on the company (the bulk of the latter part of the movie) are not all that funny becuase they are not very realistic.  I wish Mike Judge had come up with a more clever way for Peter, Michael and Samir to stick it to their (former) employer.
0385501560|5.0|See Schizophrenia. See Dementia. See Hysteria. Chuck Palahniuk's newest novel &quot;Choke&quot; amusing look at a medical quack who sees the world as disintegrated and segmented, therefore needs to be analyzed like any biological disease. From here a treatment can be puesued. Yet, like the main character, Victor, his own needs are seemingly never met, as they stem from, like any good Oedipal Complex, the mother. It is the mother that holds the secret. The secret not only to his past, but also to his own psychological past that keeps interupting his sexual and social gratifications. Palahniuk has written a compelling story with a clever and witty style, one that is modern and fresh. See Fight Club. See Survivor. See Invisible Monsters. I highly reccomend this book for anyone interested into experiential insights to madness of the spiritual kind, as well as prose that has a flair for the darker side of comedy.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Martin Scorcese's remake of the 1962 thriller is every bit as chilling as it was when I saw it back in theatres during my senior year in college in 1991.  Robert DeNiro gives a great performance as Max Cady, who got the slammer for rape, and, upon his release, harrasses the lawyer who shabbily represented him (Nick Nolte).  Scorcese uses great camerawork, fine performances, and a reinterpretation of the original Bernard Hermann score.  It's a great thriller that shouldn't be missed, and the DVD gives &quot;Cape Fear&quot; the royal treatment it deserves.  The picture and sound are excellent, and the features include the trailer, storyboards, and a 1-hour-plus documentary.  The only thing missing is a commentary, but you can't always have it all, can you?  All in all, this DVD gets a firm recommendation from me.
0451196716|5.0|Very simple storyline: Young men walking to death. If what is important is how a story is told, that is a wonderful story. It is pity that it is written by a popular writer who calls his books as &quot;fast-food&quot;.
B00003CWN3|5.0|When I watched this film, I was completely unprepared of what I was in for. I knew nothing about the Brandon Teena case, so watching the story unfold before my eyes was something of a shock. Hilary Swank won her well-deserved Oscar for playing a woman living as a man in rural Nebraska. She befriends two ex-cons who later strip, beat, rape, and finally murder her when they find out her true gender. It's a film that is not for all tastes, but if you can stomach the violence, then this film should be added to your \\"must-see\\" list.
B00005QW5X|4.0|The main reviewer appears to be stuck in the 1950's,  as this movie is actually very cleverly done.  Granted there are some lapses in flow, the story really sucks you in and Mitchell is indeed a very dynamic performer.   I saw this not expecting a whole lot,  and was totally blown away.   Great movie!
B00003CX9E|5.0|It makes me ill to read some of the negative reviews posted for this movie. A perfect example of the MTV generation more interested in action, gore and sex than a movie as poignant and profound as Citizen Kane. <br />Don't read this review thinking of some desiccated old reviewer who remembers \\"the good old days\\" of film making, as I am only a normal 22-year-old guy, and had only seen the movie for the first time yesterday. Then I saw it a second time later that night, and a third time this morning. <br />Boring? Slow? The time seemed to fly by watching the movie. With the cinematography better than any I've seen today, and with the intriguing story of an equally intriguing man who never finds what he needs the most in anything he did in his life filling your mind with possibilities of exactly what Rosebud is. A movie that makes you think 60 years after it was made. Then again, it is probably that fact that makes this movie such a turn off for the younger crowd. They don't want to think, all they want is a mind-numbing action-packed drug of a movie, if you will. <br />It pains me to imagine a persons mind so restricted to the point where any picture outside of what is \\"normal\\" sends their minds into a fit of rejection. <br />Was this the best movie of all time? I'll have to think about it. But it certainly ranks up there with the best I've seen.<br />In case you were wondering, I will buy this movie, and add it to my collection of DVD's, and it will be the first black and white movie I own. I'm a science fiction guy first and foremost, owning Independence Day, Men in Black, The Fifth Element, Fight Club, Gattaca, Dark City, The Abyss etc. I will make Citizen Kane a proud addition to them.<br />What is the one thing a man who has everything could never get back? If you can answer this question, you know the secret of what Rosebud is.<br />Don't criticize a movie just because you don't get it. People of small minds have a problem reaching beyond the trash put out by the studios today. Believe me, most of it is trash, I try to go to the movies once a week, and have yet to see a movie this year I will buy when it comes out on DVD.<br />Rent it, borrow it, buy it. Just watch it. You won't be disappointed.<br />...
0780622553|5.0|Since the first time I saw \\"Dark City\\" It became one of my top Fiction movies.<BR>a) Direction: Proyas gives a cool example of new Science Fiction-Noir cinema with shady visuals and Gothic sets. The manage of the main characters is very good and never too predictable.<BR>b) The actors: I love Jenniffer Connelly with all my heart and I loved the scenes when she sings (dubbed of course). Rufus Sewell and William Hurt are good as usual but I loved the Sutherland character as a scientist with no memories.<BR>c) The plot: The premise of having no memories and changing who you are night after night is so cool. And then the ghostly aliens using death people's bodies and dressed like a \\"Matrix\\" buddy are very good designed.<BR>d) The production: Wonderful special effects; the transformation of the city and the final \\"mental fight\\" are very good. The City itself like a 50's dream night is o.k. too but the part that really shocked me is the WONDERFUL WONDERFUL score composed by Trevor Jones. The pulsating music, the misterious passages and the Final triumphant bombastic conclusion is Trevor in one of his best works. Good for him!  <br />The movie is a full circle and I simply love it.
0006531407|3.0|This is a good book, but the best by far is the U.S. Army Survival Manual.

B00005O3VC|5.0|The only thing special about this DVD is that it's a comedic masterpiece.  Other than that, there are no commentaries, no making of's nothing.  Unlike the version on Laserdisc that has so much more it is a farce to say that this edition is &quot;special&quot; in any way.  Amazon lists this as not yet released but I bought this version about a year and a half ago.  If movie companies, directors and distributors would wait a while and release just one version of the film without releasing second and third versions with different audio features and commentaries I'd be a little richer...
1559409010|5.0|Life of Brian is a great movie. It can be viewed as just a funny movie, but for those of us who like some depth there is also a message (namely what idiots humans can be).<BR>But what makes this a great DVD are the extras. Two (that is 2) commentaries, deleted scenes (with commentary (just one though)) and a documentary made during the making of LoB. All of these are a joy to watch/listen to. Most of the commentaries are the pythons reminiscing and telling stories which in my opinion make the best commentaries. In a word: yummy.
B00004TFK2|5.0|Much less serious than it's comic book origins, Men in Black takes a finely-keyed tone of action and ludicrousness, bolstered by some surprisingly fine performances. Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent D'Onofrio are standouts here, with standup support by Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino and Rip Torn.  Great transfer to this DVD, with plenty of interesting goodies to boot.  Good commentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld and Jones, with an intersting option to watch sillhouettes of them on the screen as Sonnenfeld uses a pen to point out things on the screen.  Highly recommended DVD for showing off your player and large-screen TV to friends.  And hey, really cool Rick Baker effects get squished reall good.
B00004W55E|4.0|In this humble person's opinion, nothing can top Rachelle's album &quot;First Instrument&quot; for its passion, vocal flexibility and variety of styles.  &quot;Individuality&quot; is a great release (can Rachelle Ferrell release a bad one?) but does pale in comparison.  &quot;Why You Wanna Mess It All Up?&quot; is an incredible track, as is &quot;Reflections.&quot;  However, the release is in one style throughout.  I miss the jazz standards of &quot;First Instrument.&quot;  Rachelle's voice is still incredible, but seems to be cornered into a style rut for this release.
0446605409|5.0|This was my second Nelson Demille novel.  The first was The General's Daughter.  I fell in love with Demille and his quick wit that all of his characters possess.  I love the sarcasm that was present in The General's Daughter and was even more pleased when I found that Plum Island was packed full of sarcasm and intrigue.  He is one of my most favorite authors now.  I have begun to buy every Demille book that I can find.
B000001FA4|5.0|In 1984 U2 released their fourth studio album, titled &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;. It was a very important transitional record for them. Throwing themselves into the brilliant producing/engineering skills of Brian Eno and his associate Daniel Lanois, they managed to produce a more melodic, more coherent sound that U2 seemed to miss on their previous albums. They don't call Eno U2's fifth &quot;member&quot; for nothing.<br />This is one of those albums that will never die or be forgotten. It brought U2 the deserving attention of critics and fans alike. It features their best song they've written in the eighties (and one of the Edge's most recognizable guitar riffs), &quot;Pride (In The Name Of Love)&quot;, a tribute to one man's courage and devotion for love and peace, the late Martin Luther King, Jr. &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot; displayed Bono's capability of writing lyric full of compassion and humanity, a thing that looks like he forgot how to do these days. <br />Adam's bass playing is fantastic (listen to &quot;Wire&quot; and &quot;4th of July&quot; - U2's only instrumental track to date) and you'll get the picture. If you're only familiar with the work that U2 does today, the listen to &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and you'll be in for a surprise. This is rock played with such passion and intensity that couldn't be done by many other bands. A truly unforgettable album. It marked the end of their first period and gave promise of a stronger U2 in the future to come.

Her father is one that can not stand a book what so ever. He hates it whenever Matilda reads. Infact he has even ripped up a library book and tore it to shreads.

Ms. Honey a teacher of Matildas is the total oppisote and finds Matilda to be a sweet little child. Matilda even likes her teacher better than her parents who are totaly weird.

B000001E18|4.0|U2's most experimental album to date has been the topic of harsh discussions and different point of views. While some claim it's their best album, others think it's just a collection of dull and crappy songs. Well, they're both wrong. It's good, fun album to listen to and it's not that awful as some people are saying, but it surely is not their best. It has its moments, fortunately more of them are stronger and more pleasant to the ears.<br />Brian Eno has done wonders for this band, but I think he went too far this time. His influence is too strong and that's what makes this record more chaotic. It starts with &quot;Zooropa&quot;, a song full of hope for the future of Europe, with a touch of satire in Bono's lyrics. Great keyboard work by Eno. &quot;Numb&quot; is, well simply put, weird. The Edge rapping?! It could have been better, but this is one of U2's least memorable songs. And so is &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car&quot; (?!). What was Bono thinking when he wrote this &quot;thing&quot;?! The rest of the album is much better. &quot;Lemon&quot; is the best one here, a seven minute great track that has Bono singing in a high - pitched voice, with backing vocals by The Edge. It also has a great video. <br />Great ballads on &quot;Zooropa&quot;. &quot;Stay&quot; and &quot;The First Time&quot; are true U2 heart - felt ballads, with one of Bono's best lyrics. The album ends with a dark tone, completely different from the beginning, with &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. Actually the whole album is dark and pessimistic, the same way &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; ended. Not a good place to start with U2, but if you liked &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, you might like this one as well. All in all, a good record.
0440219078|4.0|This book had a great plot, and message context. I felt that this not only told the story but also showed it to me in my mind. It had a terrific beginning, which started, at a very crucial part of the life of the character in this certain place. The wording in the book was easily comprehended. I felt that through out the book it deserved a perfect rating, but i also felt that the ending was a tad bit plain. It needed to go further in depth of what was happening to everything around the character and the rest of the subjects through out the book.
6305171769|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres and was wondering ok how are they going to do this.  I was not dissapointed at all I was so happy to see the refrences made to donald pleasance and to an exstent to the first halloween.  Jamile lee is awsome in her grown up portrayl of laurie strode and josh hartnets performance as a son who had to much of the boogie man is your unlce was right on the mark.  H20 did a great job in ending the series and closes out one the best horror series to hit the screen.

0871137380|5.0|The book in question describes, in most intimate detail, the battle that took place between US forces and Somali citizens in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3, 1993 and ended with 18 American and over 500 Somalis killed in action and over a thousand from both sides wounded. The author narrates the events leading to the showdown, the firefight itself and the aftermath with amazing accuracy, great attention to detail; further, the book is superbly written -- I could not put it down. Mr. Bowden puts his readers into the firefight with his vivid descriptions of the battles that took place. The book captures the heroism, tragedy and brutality of battle impeccably -- it is one of the very finest examples of contemporary military journalism -- an absolute must for anyone interested in foreign affairs and/or military history.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I am a member of Generation X.  This film was made for me.  I understand it.  Those much older and much younger do not.  But I do.  It is, in some ways, a metaphorical call to arms; a call to fight complacency and find meaning, rather than continue to trudge through the screaming pit of shallow, celebrity-driven consumerism that, until recently, seemed the primary arena of our existence.<br />The story finds an unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton) at the end of his rope.  He's about my age; has a job and an office about like mine.  Like me, he's still single - the product of divorce, he doesn't trust marriage or committed relationships.  Like me, he buys stuff in an attempt to fill the void.  Like me, he wonders if it all means anything.  He's approaching a point of crisis - a crisis of nothing.  A big blank, where life has become a pretty but empty package.  He can't sleep.  To find some emotional catharsis, he goes to 12-step meetings, pretending to have a variety of diseases.  He finds understanding.  He finds release.<br />Enter Marla Singer (Helena Bonham-Carter) and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  They upset the applecart, and together, all three end up forming a strange triangle that will lead to a darkly comedic world of mischief, mayhem, and - of all things - soap.<br />The titular concept is that of the \\"Fight Club\\" - a loosely organized group of Gen-Xers (started by Durden and Narrator) who meet periodically to test their mettle by beating the stuffing out of each other.  \\"How can you know anything about yourself if you've never been in a fight?\\" asks Durden, and he's right.  How do we know anything about the strength of our own character - how, in fact, can we even build character - without a struggle or fight of some kind to temper us?  Something that our generation has utterly lacked?<br />\\"We are the middle children of history, man,\\" says Durden, in the film's most important scene, \\"No purpose or place.  We have no great war.  No great depression.  Our great war is a spiritual war.  Our great depression is our lives.\\"  And that's what Fight Club is all about.  It is a means of providing that great test of character in miniature.  Until, of course, it gets out of hand in the film's nihilistic second half.  In it, Fight Club evolves into a full-blown movement, turning outward to soft-core domestic terrorism, and the film becomes a bleak, Strangelovian meditation on Fascism.<br />Even people who did not understand Fight Club could sense something powerful in it. One thinks of Roger Eberts' completely off-base and largely negative review that at least grudgingly acknowledges the film's solid cinematic technique.  Eberts' mistake is in thinking Fight Club attempts to be a morality tale of sorts; a simple-minded polemic.  By that standard, it certainly fails.  But Ebert is not Gen-X.  He's a Boomer, and Fight Club sails right past him.  Put simply, he doesn't get it, and probably never will.<br />The DVD is a two-disc set, with lots of goodies - at least the equal of New Line's excellent Platinum Series release of Se7en.  The package is well-designed, the extras plentiful.  The picture and sound quality are simply exquisite.<br />But what I want to end with - and this is by far the most important point - is not how good the DVD packaging is, but how relevant the film is, especially in light of recent events, when our world was changed forever by real terrorism, rather than the tongue-in-cheek icon-smashing variety depicted in Fight Club.<br />The film was right in its central thesis - we needed something to give us direction, to unite us in a common cause, to develop our character as a generation.  Tragically, and in the most horrible possible way, we got exactly that.eat war is a spiritual war.  Our great depression is our lives.\\"  And that's what Fight Club is all about.

B000002H8F|4.0|For a long time this was my least favorite Pixies album, and only recently I've kind of rediscovered it. What used to put me off a little is that although the first six songs are exceptionally strong, there seemed to be an awful lot of filler after that. Also, I really didn't much care for the recurring warbling of the theremin that seemed to characterize the album's sound (at least in my mind).<br />But this is really a strong album, all told. It has a very powerful sound which I find an improvement over the somewhat metallic nature of _Doolittle_, classic though that one is. _Bossanova_ starts off hitting the ground running with the galloping surf epic \\"Cecilia Ann\\". The lacerating, scything \\"Rock Music\\" seems to be both tribute as well as pastiche. And, simply on a visceral level, that song flat-out kicks [rear]! Following is the soaringly gorgeous \\"Velouria\\", then the 77-second rock-out \\"Allison\\", and some familiar Pixies off-kilterness with \\"Is She Weird\\". The lilting \\"Ana\\" has one of the loveliest little guitar melodies I've ever heard, as well as some cleverly subtle key-modulation that speaks to Black's quite prodigious songwriting genius.<br />With so many terrific songs back-to-back, anywhere that ends would seem to be a letdown, and that's the way it seems to me. \\"All Over The World\\" I've never been able to get into much; it's always seemed to me fairly formulaic and lifeless, like 'let's put a long epic-type song at the end of side A'. It's not nearly so convincing as the others. \\"Dig For Fire\\" is a decent pop song, and following that is where I used to always get 'stuck in the mud'. But I've realized that most of the rest of the album is great too--some highlights are \\"The Happening\\", which is a great sci-fi epic such as only Black Francis/Frank Black could ever do, the intense and cathartic \\"Hang Wire\\", and the stunningly beautiful closer \\"Havalina\\". Man, what an ending. Just that break that goes \\"walking in the breeze/in the plains of old Sedona/[Kim Deal:]...Arizona/[Black:]Among the trees...\\" is enough to bring tears to my eyes. Yes, this is quite a decent album. Oh, and the cover and insert art has got to be some of the best Vaughan Oliver work ever.Deal:]...Arizona/[Black:]Among the trees...\\" is enough to bring tears to my eyes.

B00005MNP8|4.0|Blondie was my first introduction to punk music back in the early '80s but at the time I didn't know. I simply loved what I heard. Reissuing the band's albums was a wise move because thte production back then was murky and flawed. My only Blondie cds I own prior to the reissue of \\"Parallel Lines\\" is \\"The Best of Blondie\\" and their recent \\"No Exit\\". The band's best of collection was my first exposure to Blondie's endearing music. I figure now with the reissues I ought to expose myself to the songs I haven't heard by the band by starting off with the band's seminal classic \\"Parallel Lines\\".<br />If I thought the production on \\"The Best of Blondie\\" was horrible, I can't fathom what the original \\"Parallel Lines\\" sounded like. The production on this album is clean yet raw at the same time. Three of my all time favorite Blondie songs are on this album: \\"One Way Or Another\\", \\"Sunday Girl\\" and \\"Heart of Glass\\". Those songs remain timeless classics with me and they can never sound dated to me. My favorite songs that I never heard by Blondie are \\"Pretty Baby\\", \\"Just Go Away\\", and \\"Fade Away\\". When I first heard \\"Once I had a Love (aka The Disco Song)\\", I immediately did a double take on the song. I thought my cd player skipped and replayed \\"Heart of Glass\\" which isn't necessarily a bad thing since I love \\"Heart of Glass\\" so much. \\"Parallel Lines\\" reminded me why I have always loved Blondie and never stopped loving their music. A lot of so-called punk bands today could learn a thing or two from Blondie's music if they want to their music to remain relevant to the masses over the years like Blondie's music has become.
B0000524E5|4.0|Coyote Ugly is about a girl from jersey who want sto be a song writer, so she moves to the big city to try and make her dreams come true.  Of course things happen and she has to get a job and ends up working at the bar &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;.  Where she meets friends, a guy, and well maybe a nice happy ending.
B00004NHCC|5.0|I must admit that I am an ardent fan of Ella but this album certainly puts Ms. Vaughn a very close second. She could not have chosen a better side-man of the time. I must take exception to one reviewers critique that Embraceable You sung here is one the most beautiful songs ever. Try &quot;Jim&quot;!!! I am thinking of changing my name just so I can think that she is singing to me. Oh, and Clifford &quot;sings&quot; on his trumpet. Fabulous.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This was a good movie.  It's about a writer teaching a kid how to write.  And a lot more than that.  It's a real sweet and touching movie.  I think that everyone should check it out.  And it's hard to beleive that this is the lead kid's first movie.  He was great and up against Sean Connery. Wow!  I hope to see him in some more movies.
B000003B6J|5.0|albeit hip-hop artists like schooly d & ice-t (who's actually from the east coast, just so you know) paved the way for all the ganxta rap pranksters, one group will always be associated with the genre -- and vice versa: \\"niggaz wit attitudes\\", or n.w.a for short.<br />with their sophomore album \\"straight outta compton\\" they struck the nerve of young (sub)urban america, and single-handedly changed the face of hip-hop.<br />rough, uncut beats and aggressive delivery spewing out a no-holds barred *ATTITUDE* towards everybody and everything led to platinum status without any airplay whatsoever. a note to the distributing record label priority records from the federal bureau of investigations only added to the unparalleled success of the album and the crew.<br />n.w.a catapulted themselves into the \\"hip-hop hall of fame\\" with this seminal piece and remain until today one of the five most important and most commercially successful hip-hop bands in history: dj yella, dr. dre, m.c. ren, eazy-e, ice cube, arabian prince -- any more questions? i think not. ;)
B00003CXIY|4.0|This is a funny movie.  It's also a little sick, so if your not into that then this might not be your cup of tea.  The skinny nerdy kid is the funniest thing in this movie.  The movie is about well what the title says, a road trip.  And of course all kinds of funny and zany things happen to these guys.
B00000C3G6|5.0|This is a fine collection of songs from Crosby and Nash, introspective as always, and, after nearly 30 years, still fresh.  While Graham Nash is--well, a pop artist--the importance of his contributions here should not be dismissed.  &quot;Southbound Train&quot; and &quot;Stranger's Room&quot; are songs of great strength, and &quot;Immigration Man,&quot; one of the best songs to come out of 1972.  Crosby absolutely shines on this album, although it appears evident that he may have written some songs while orbiting the planet Saturn.  But the harmonies...the chord progressions...this is great music, very deserving of a place on your CD shelf.  I'll tell you something else, if you live on the East or West coast, drive up (or down) the coastline while listening to this album (up around Morro Bay in California is an especially nice experience).  You'll see what I mean.  Then have a little wine with a friend upon your return and thank Atlantic for bringing this remastered album back in the digital format.  Note: this album is available only as an import at present (10-5-01); do not be alarmed at the price.  You'll thank yourself for the well-deserved treat and that you have the taste to appreciate it.  Enjoy.
B00005A46T|4.0|This is a pretty good cd, but get something straight here people: this is not death metal! Death metal has little to no melody at all, and i hear a lot of melody here. The first cd was pretty good and so is this one, and even though Slipknot may be influenced by death metal, this does not sound like death metal at all. Check out Dying Fetus, Nile, Cryptopsy, or Exhumed for death metal. Slipknot can't compete with these guys!
B00000JNNY|5.0|Etta James has a timeless sound!  The soft melodic sounds from this album only compliment her soulful sound.  Growing up in the 90's (yes, the 90's!), there have been some questionable artists come about.  In my opinion, not a single female artist has sung with so much soul as Etta James.  Her voice is one which has travelled for many years to touch the ears and lives of todays listeners, and she will remain to do so for many years to come.  I was introduced to her by my Mother-in-laws friend, when I was searching for &quot;that&quot; song for our first dance.  When I heard this melody and this angelic voice sail across the room, I knew... This is it!  Etta James makes me fall in love with my husband over and over agian each time I hear her.  Nobody has been able to move me the way she has with her voice.  Now that's a piece of pure heaven here on earth!
0140288503|2.0|Mark Bowden's non-fiction book Black Hawk Down is at best mediocre and should have been better researched before publication.  Shoddy journalism, coupled with one Delta operator's huge ego and one-sided opinions, make for interesting reading, but it does a disservice to the outstanding performance of our SOF warriors and their Somali opposition.  It is on paper now- thus, it must be true.  And, of course, several soldiers received their 15 minutes of fame and are naturally supportive of the book.  Just another wannabe making a dime off the real deal.
B00005O0SQ|5.0|The novel Lonesome Dove was an epic rarity - the characters were masterfully written in a way that, if you saw Gus or Call walking down the street (even Jake Spoon or Lorena), you would know them on sight.  After having read the book and loving it as much as I did, I was not ready to LIKE the miniseries.  <br />I was so incredibly wrong it's not even funny.<br />From the opening scenes of Lonesome Dove, you KNOW that the actors portraying McMurtry's characters are perfectly cast in their roles.  In fact, they were so well done that I now have difficulty picturing Gus as having any other face than Robert Duvall.  Tommy Lee Jones portrays the perfect Woodrow in this 4 part miniseries, and the other supporting roles are jam packed with incredible acting ability as well.  Danny Glover, Ricky Schroeder, and Angelica Houston are just a few of the theatrical talents who make this miniseries wonderful.<br />The story itself follows 2 retired Marshalls on a cattle drive from the sleepy town of Lonesome Dove up through Montana.  Their story is tragic in some places, funny in others, and there's a little bit of something for everybody in this movie.  <br />I would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone - I've seen it maybe 7 times before, and I will watch it probably 700 more.  It's art, pure and simple. Buy it - you won't regret it.
