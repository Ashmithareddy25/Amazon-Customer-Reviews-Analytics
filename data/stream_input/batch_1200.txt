B00441UMMM|5.0|\\"My head droops down onto my knees. I feel exhausted. All my remaining energy has been sapped away ... I've got nothing left. I've got no hope, no plans, no answers ... A tear suddenly rolls down the side of my nose, followed by another. I'm going to have to admit defeat ... I give a huge sob and bury my face in my hands. I can't believe I'm giving up. But what else can I do?\\" - Becky, at an uncharacteristic low point<br /><br />So, my wife, who usually pays no attention to my choice of books, noticed MINI SHOPAHOLIC on my desk, smirked, and said, \\"What, you're reduced to reading chic-lit now?\\"<br /><br />OK, you caught me out in my dark, secret place. Does that make your day?<br /><br />Actually, I've been reading selected, trashy chic-lit for years. Anyone who's followed my book reviews will have noticed long before this. The two biggest examples of my descent into unmanly behavior are the SHOPAHOLIC series by this author, Sophie Kinsella, and the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. Unfortunately, the latter, which I believe is about to have the eighteenth installment published soon, ran out of steam as far as I'm concerned about five volumes ago; Evanovich continues to write to a tired old script that incorporates no character growth in her heroine while hoping to extort a few more dollars out of an increasingly disenchanted fan base.<br /><br />On the other hand, Kinsella manages to keep the continuing adventures of Rebecca Bloomwood Brandon reasonably fresh by having Bex evolve through her life's important periods and events: single womanhood, engagement, marriage, discovery of a long-lost sister, pregnancy, and, here in MINI SHOPAHOLIC, child rearing. Constants, of course, are Becky's predilection for extravagant shopping and her impulsive, unrealistic solutions to problematic situations. Despite the exasperation she causes husband Luke - exasperation that would compel any more sensible man to divorce her without delay, if not sooner - Becky's great attributes are her good nature and kind heart.<br /><br />In MINI SHOPAHOLIC, Bex faces a plethora of challenges that convert to a perfect storm of perceived crises: acquisition of a long-delayed new home, Luke's upcoming birthday which absolutely demands a surprise party, and spouse-imposed austerity measures, i.e. no personal shopping, in response to a run on England's banks. Finally, Luke is insisting on professional help for their two-year old daughter, Minnie, who may be becoming irredeemably spoiled by her Mum. (Hmmph! You think?) In any case, for the first time I can recall in this ongoing series of (to date) six books, Becky's usual spirited confidence in her (misdirected) abilities to cope is brought to its knees. Then, help arrives from an unexpected source.<br /><br />In short, while Stephanie Plum is moribund, Becky is very much alive. So long as she is, I'll keep reading chic-lit.kind heart.

B0018CWW8C|4.0|Trees are best described as a slightly rockier Fairport Convention. If you know Fairport's Sandy Denny era music, you'll realize what a compliment this is to Trees.<br /><br />This band features a female singer with a bell-clear voice similar to Denny's' and the band behind her mines an organic, English folk aesthetic.<br /><br />But On The Shore features much stronger backbeats--there in none of Fairports jazz vibe-heavier guitar, and some keyboard work.Trees leaves nothing to be desired. - Absolutely solid overlooked progressive era music. Impressive. Get it!

B002ZXNZQG|5.0|I have been writing since a child, and if there were only one book I could choose to have written, it would be \\"A Confederacy of Dunces,\\" by John Kennedy Toole. I'm pretty sure I actually have one of the original 2500 that were first printed, in 1980, while living in New Orleans. My ex-husband bought it for me, and it's been well-read, to say the least. I have it zip-locked in 3 inches of plastic and tucked away so I know where it is in case a fire breaks out. I lived in New Orleans for 5 years, and Toole's character's are so real, down to the distinctive speech patterns, that it's like you're actually back on Bourbon Street, jawing with some old-timey local. The bar scenes, the crazy antics of the protagonist, Ignatius, poor officer Mancuso, Miss Trixie at the Levi Pants Co., are all just jumping out of the pages at you. It's sad indeed, that such a well-educated scholar, ended his life before he could see just how genius his work of true literary art turned out to be. I have read the book many times over the last 30 years, and no matter what, I end up laughing out loud at the absurd ironic twists of fate that Fortuna burdens Ignatius with. Every time we used to see a \\"Lucky Dog\\" vendor, we would just look at each other and laugh. I have 6 copies, now; my present husband buys me a new copy whenever we move to a new city (we're military), or finds one with a different jacket cover. Now, I have decided to devote my days to hunting down the book in the 37 or 39? languages it is written in.  I had to get it on my Kindle so that I don't have to worry about cracking bindings or spilling something on it. Toole was a true genius, and his tragic death seems to beg the question; what else could he have written after receiving the Pulitzer Prize? It's a shame that we will never know. BUY THIS BOOK!!
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I purchased this product and could not be more disappointed. I am training for an Ironman and have really started to use this product a lot. I have used several Garmin products in the past and not had a ton of issues, but this product simply does not work. I have even emailed Garmin and begged them to take this back and send me their lowest level product in its place as it just DOES NOT WORK. The bezel is hard to use, when it works. I was told by my coach that the connectors are in such a bad place that I should tape over them so not to short out the watch (which does happen when you get wet). The buttons are just plan in the wrong postion, when you sweat your wrist can activate both buttons very easy and mess up your times. The GPS takes FOREVER to get a signal, and I am with a group of 30 with EVREY person getting a signal fine. I am to the point that if Garmin does not get back to you me I will NOT be purchasing a Garmin product again. Based on other comments, I think they know there are several issues with this and should not be sold as is. BUY AT YOUR RISK.

140053271X|5.0|This is a great and simple eBook reader. It's light enough that I can hold it in one hand when reading, it's small enough that it's easy to take with me, the battery life is long enough that I forgot where I put the charger, and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain. It does one thing and does it well. Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc.
B005EP1PJQ|4.0|Aww. Where do I begin?<br />I really wish I had put more time into reading this book entirely instead of in choppy bits like I did for the last month.<br /><br />This book easily gets a 4/5 because of the steamy romance between Anna and St. Clair. You can read horror novels, thrillers, dramas, and other types but Romance will always make you happy, no matter the day. Throw in the witty and comedic dialogue and you got yourself a winner. So this book is a big WIN!<br /><br />Sure, some parts lagged and some scenes seemed a bit \\"overdone\\", but Stephanie Perkins crafts a cute, enjoyable, and utterly sexy story! Can't wait to see what she has in store for us next! Definitely one of my favorite reads of 2011.

006088732X|4.0|Pretty Little Liars was a fantastic read. There are a many things that are different from the show of the same name on ABC Family, but after reading the book I can really say I love both about the same, give or take a little slanted toward the TV show. The show gives it that creepy and \\"being watched\\" vibe a little more than I felt in this first book, but I still REALLY enjoyed it and will definitely continue on in the series.<br /><br />There were some moments when I got confused a little, especially when the name of a character was repeated several times in the same paragraph. (ex. Emily.... Emily....Emily....) But aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will probably move on to the next in the series when I've finished reviewing a couple of other novels. :D<br /><br />Final Thought: Pretty Little Liars is a series I can see myself continuing. So full of suspense and utter awesomeness. It is \\"too legit to quit.\\"
B00009P1MP|4.0|To this day, all you have to do is sing \\"And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye,\\" and someone will either smile or sing the next verse. Don McLean recorded a defining moment in American songwriting history when he delivered \\"American Pie\\" to radio in 1971, which remains his magnum opus. A sprawling metaphysical poem that covered the pop-music scene through the 60's but starting at the death of Buddy Holly, the near nine minutes of \\"American Pie\\" rivals the likes of \\"Let It Be\\" or \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" for epic singles.<br /><br />It also kind of dwarfs Mclean's same titled album. he described it as a collections of songs about the USA and people he'd known, and the music reflects that. While mostly folk-rock in the singer-songwriter vein, McLean also visited the realm of war protesters (the poetic \\"The Grave\\"), the flirtatious (\\"Everybody Loves Me, Baby\\") and the spiritual (\\"Babylon,\\" a traditional hymn McLean re-arranged for this album). This is also the album that contains McLean's second best known hit, \\"Vincent.\\" Also known as \\"Starry Starry Night,\\" \\"Vincent\\" was a tribute to Van Gogh and misunderstood artists everywhere, and reached number 15 on the charts after \\"American Pie\\" ended its 17 week stay at number one.<br /><br />McLean had a couple more hits after this (\\"Dreidel\\" and a cover of Roy Orbison's \\"Crying\\" probably the best known), but never again reached the immaculate creation that is this album. Still, what better way to be remembered than a song that will make an entire bar full of people break into song if the jukebox brings it up? It's also worth noting that this 2003 remaster sounds fantastic.
0307266303|5.0|Although I tried running long ago, my attempts at it just didn't feel right so I resigned myself to hiking and walking as my form of outdoor entertainment/meditative moments. Then I came across this this book through a friend and all I can say is \\"WOW\\"...it combined my non-conforming nature with my love of the outdoors and flamed my innate leanings towards the off-the-beaten path/road less traveled mentality while stepping (or running) far away from the maddening crowds. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, the research into the contradiction of \\"running\\" shoes and the drive behind them and the personalities that emerged from the individuals in the book. Be they eccentric, quiet, extroverted, introverted, conservative or free-flying, they all had one distinct connection with one another: they loved to run. But it  wasn't for the accolades, for the sponserships, for the free shoes, not even necessarily for the health benefits. They loved to run for the pure joy of running and becoming one with the land. I dream of running as a barefoot but more than likely, at 60 years old, I will continue to walk and hike while this story of the \\"going against the grain\\" runs through my brain. There are more of us out there than people realize but few act on it in such a life affirming manner. And even though ultra running is a lofty goal for us oldies, the message is still the same: CARPE DIEM and yes, we WERE born to run.....

006112429X|3.0|Though many portions of this book are beautifully written and cover some seriously honest, disturbing ground, I found it incredibly hard to remain interested in the often meandering musings of the narrator.  A page turner this is not and often found the passages convoluted and self important, despite the sensitive nature and the thoughtful way it was written.    I just wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, even though I'm kind of curious about the movie because, obviously, the movie will not fall in love with its own language.
B0058A119G|5.0|My on-line ordered copy has yet to arrive, so I went at lunch to pick up the Deluxe Edition of the new \\"What Matters Most\\", by my beloved Barbra Streisand.  Playing Disc 1, featuring all the new versions of Alan & Marilyn Bergman songs that Barbra has not recorded previously, I was driving home from the Mall listening and melting away.  During this time is when the earthquake rolled up the East Coast from VA and I never noticed a thing.  So much for Barbra soothing an unusual situation.  I loved the previous studio album \\"Love Is The Answer\\", and this new collection, plus a bonus disc of old favorites, adds to the brilliance that is and will always be Barbra Streisand.  I received three gifts with this album:<br /><br />1 - a new album of great Alan & Marilyn Bergman song that have never been recorded by Barbra previously.  The orchestrations and interpretations blend beautifully on all tracks.  Chris Botti lends his trumpeting to \\"Alone In The World\\".  As we've lived along with Barbra all these years, and knowing her interpretations of previous Bergman masterpieces, these are the perfect set of songs for the mature Barbra.  Highlights include a few Pourtugeuse lyrics during \\"So Many Stars\\" in one of the nicest arrangements of this hit track (previous hit for Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66).  \\"Something New In My Life\\" is a Bergman song I was unfamiliar with.  Barbra and the orchestrations take it to a different stratosphere with a great high note.<br /><br />2 - A Collection of past Bergman songs from various albums, including two from the \\"Yentl\\" soundtrack.  This could have been an album in its own right as Barbra's \\"Best of the Bergmans\\", so glad it was included with the Deluxe Edition.  It is long overdue.<br /><br />Lastly, 3 - Barbra has recorded probably my most favorite Bergman collaboration, \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\" from the film \\"The Promise\\".  Melissa Manchester's version from the film soundtrack (and has yet to land on CD or MP3) has been my definitive version since I first heard it, with a close second by Maureen McGovern.  Barbra has now made this song her own, as I've always heard her singing it in the back of my head.  Now she has, and I am so pleased.<br /><br />Fans will not miss this one.  It is also a great introduction piece for people curious about Barbra's past catalog and adding new material to it.  Alan and Marilyn hear Barbra singing their material when they write it, and right they are.  I get the same feeling, and here, Barbra has done just that.

But unfortunately this movie must have been filmed, produced, directed and reviewed by stoners. I mean ... I saw Pineapple express and even liked it but this movie can only be enjoyed high as a kite. And since I don't use any kind of drug, I was not able to enjoy it at all.  Nathalie Portman was still hot though.   Oh.... maybe if you are 16 with an IQ of 20 you might enjoy it.

034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers, Vanessa Diffenbaugh's debut novel,  may be the most talked about publishing acquisition of 2011. Ballantine won it in a fiercely fought auction. It garnered countless pre-publication raves.<br /><br />Eighteen and released from the foster care system, Victoria's adult life begins with the admonition, \\"Your life starts here. No one to blame but yourself from here on out.\\" The chapters alternate between Victoria's life at this point and eight years earlier when love-starved Elizabeth adopts her. Their bond, which revolves around Elizabeth mentoring Victoria on the meaning of flowers, is touching. Although a sympathetic character, Victoria is persistently angry, suspicious and unable to relate to others. Victoria's discovery of a means of communication and self-worth through her garden is masterfully interwoven through the book.<br /><br />Flowers convey many emotions and messages. Diffenbaugh's unique book projects honesty. Victoria's loyalty to the meaning of flowers is the one thing she holds true in her life. Her desire to gift their meaning into other people's lives is touching and honorable. Her resilience lies in the difficult journey she travels to heal the depths of her pain. The author communicates as creatively with words as her protagonist does with flowers. The Language of Flowers may be a serious contender for a New York Times best-seller list.<br /><br />The author's guide describes diligent research into the meanings of flowers from Victorian times to the present. Diffenbaugh's experience as a foster mother lends credibility to her story. A great asset to the book is her appendix titled \\"Victoria's Dictionary of Flowers\\" and an author interview.<br /><br />I thank LibraryThing's Early Reviewers Program for the advance review copy.<br /><br />Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont
1594484805|5.0|This book is an eye-opener.  It will change everything you thought you knew about human behavior and motivation.  Well-written and stocked with scientific studies and examples to back the conclusions, the book is persuasive.  As Pink says, Humans are not just smaller, slower, better-smelling donkeys when it comes to motivation.      This is a great read for managers and executives but also for anyone interesting in self-improvement.

B0058A119G|4.0|As a long time follower of Streisand, I give credit when it is due, and admit when she has goofed.  This album is good. Actually, very good! I was not expecting her to jump vocal hurdles, although I think as a fan there is always that anticipation of \\"ok, any minute now, she's gonna blow the roof off !\\"..but, about half way through, I realized it was about the songs, and not about \\"Barbra\\". Then I read the liner notes, and I guess I got it right.   For me, it's always been about the delivery with Barbra. The \\"voice\\" was always one God's greatest creations, and no one has ever had that kind of sound before or after.   The delivery, as usual, is there. The voice has aged. So have I.... which is why I no longer ride a skateboard!   For those that are expecting another \\"Broadway Album\\", now or in the future, it's not gonna happen.   On this album, she stays within her vocal limits, and doesn't try to be the vocal phenom  she once was. This is why you can always find her under the \\"easy listening\\" category. That's what this collection is about...listening.  Remember the hit song \\"The Main Event\\"?...now that was a stupid song that hit #1....why? The voice, not the content made it a hit. And I know, just like others, I will pick out one of her albums from my collection, just to listen to a song that no other singer could possibly do as well as she did, whether it is a \\"cover\\" or an original. That is what makes her unique.  She proves it again on this album. It's exactly what I expected. An excellent collection of work by some of the best lyricists and arrangers, working with one of the best song stylists ever to step before a microphone.  \\"LISTEN\\" to this album, rather than \\"PLAY\\" it.
1932100660|5.0|I first became acquainted with this book by watching a segment this spring (2011) on the Dr. Oz show.  I rented the book from the library and read it thoroughly (renewed it a maximum number for times and then decided I needed to own it).  My husband and I decided to change our diet and try a vegan life style.   We are in our 60's and want to maintain healthy weights (we've lost 35 and 20+ lbs)over the past four months and plan to enter our older years with few health problems.  It was amazing to read about all the health situations which can be prevented by eating correctly--even how cancer cells can be turned on and off.    This book provided an excellent understanding of how important it is to eat correctly and the results we will see.  My biggest disappointment is that when we share our reasons for our new eating plan with friends and family they aren't more interested in exploring this book and learning about how they can become healthier.  Our feeling was, after reading this book, that we couldn't afford to not do this.  I think people basically don't want to make changes, even if they will be healthier.
B004A8ZWVU|3.0|I'm not sure what to make of THE HELP.  Director Tate Taylor takes the comic route with Kathryn Stockett's best selling novel, so that the racial tensions at the center of the story are tempered by a succession of feel-good moments and \\"you go, girl!\\" affirmations. But what's it really all about?<br /><br />As in the novel, recent Old Miss graduate Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns home to 1963 Jackson, Mississippi to discover the shocking truth that black maids aren't given much respect by their white mistresses.  Skeeter has vague notions of being a writer, and when a NYC publisher (Mary Steenburgen) suggests that she \\"write about what disturbs [her] that doesn't seem to disturb anyone else,\\" she decides to write a book about the experiences of the black maids in Jackson.  Skeeter manages to talk two maids into helping her with the book - Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) - and their stories become the heart of the film.<br /><br />There's just something a little to \\"pat\\" and homogenized about THE HELP.  All of the white racists are so over-the-top awful that they become caricatures, which makes them way too easy to laugh at and thus dismiss.  The despicable Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who wants the governor to institute a law that all white homes in the state must provide separate toilet facilities for their \\"colored help,\\" is just so blatantly cruel and evil that she might as well be wearing a black hat as she twirls her mustache.  White trash neighbor Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) is so adorably naïve and clueless that she doesn't know enough to be racist - she just can't help but sit down and eat fried chicken with Minny.  Hilly's semi-senile mom (Sissy Spacek) is hysterically funny making fun of her racist daughter, and Skeeter's mom (Allison Janey) has cancer but decides not to die so that Skeeter can take a job in New York.  It's just all so friendly and fun, and everything works out so nicely in the end - the bad guys get their comeuppance, the good guys get revenge, and Skeeter gets her book published.  It's sort of like THE COLOR PURPLE meets \\"Andy of Mayberry.\\"<br /><br />Somewhere in all this the real racial divide that existed in the 1960's (and still exists today, if less obviously) is missing in action.  Why is Hilly such a crazy racist if her mother seems downright enlightened?  Or are we to assume that senility cures racism?  Why is silly white trash Celia Foote without a racist bone in her body?  Or are we to assume that being born poor protects us from being prejudiced and cruel?  And finally, why didn't Skeeter ever notice how blacks were treated in Jackson until she graduated from college?  And why doesn't she ever once stand up to her racist friends and tell them what she really thinks of them?<br /><br />I enjoyed THE HELP, but it also made me uncomfortable.  This is a movie that encourages black viewers to delight in their many opportunities to laugh at the stupidity of the white racist women on the screen.  There's nothing wrong with that - and some of the scenes are very, very funny.  But it's also a movie that encourages white viewers to feel better about themselves - after all, we're not as bad as Hilly, right?  No, we're like Skeeter, who loved the black maid who raised her.  As long as all this racism stuff was something that happened a long time ago, involving people so horrible we can never see glimpses of ourselves in them, then we can sit back and enjoy this film.<br /><br />I did like the movie.

B001HNE3NO|3.0|SARAH'S KEY, by Tatiana de Rosnay, is sort of a \\"Lifetime Movie\\" version of what should have been a deeply compelling Holocaust story.  The first half of the novel is written from two distinct perspectives - 10-year-old Sarah's story takes place in 1942 when she and her parents are arrested by French police in the Vel' d'Hiv roundup; 45-year-old Julia's story takes place in 2002, as she researches the Vel' d'Hiv and finds herself obsessed with events that happened sixty years ago.  This structure works to keep the story moving through its first half, although Sarah's part is far more interesting than Julia's.  Sarah's suffering and her stoic determination to save her brother are poignant and heartrending.  By contrast, Julia's marital troubles seem downright pedestrian.  And there are so many coincidences that push the story along that it becomes a game to figure out the next one before it happens!  By the midpoint in the novel, the two stories come together in a way that defies credibility.<br /><br />The second half of the novel is focused much more on Julia's life, including her disintegrating marriage, her relationship with her overly-precocious 11-year-old daughter, her mixed feelings about living in France, the possibility of a mid-life pregnancy, and her continuing quest to find out more about Sarah.  There's little motivation provided as to why Julia would be so fixated on the Vel' d'Hiv, or on this particular child.  The suggestion is that because she knew nothing about this chapter in French history, she is overwhelmed with guilt and the need to assure Sarah that her suffering would always be remembered.  But it felt more contrived than convincing.<br /><br />The novel suffers from a choppy, unsophisticated style of writing that becomes tedious by the end.  I felt at times that I was reading something that had been translated from another language - but no, it was written in English.  Sentences are ridiculously short, words and phrases are repeated for no apparent reason, and I was never really cognizant of whether the action was happening in Paris, the French countryside, New York, or Italy.<br /><br />The novel did remind me a bit of the much better SOPHIE'S CHOICE - both that novel and SARAH'S KEY are ultimately about personal guilt and the struggle to move beyond the past.  Sophie and Sarah are both placed in untenable positions by the horrors of the Holocaust, but I understood Sophie; I never really learned more about Sarah than the brief glimpses we are given in between Julia's melodramatic musings.<br /><br />I did enjoy the first half of this novel - thus the three stars.  It's just frustrating to read a novel with such potential that doesn't live up to what it could have been.  I would have liked this book a lot more had it been really about Sarah and not about Julia.  Sarah's life would have made a fascinating story - Julia's, not so much.  But this is definitely Julia's story.  Too bad.apparent reason, and I was never really cognizant of whether the action was happening in Paris, the French countryside, New York, or Italy.<br /><br />The novel did remind me a bit of the much better SOPHIE'S CHOICE - both that novel and SARAH'S KEY are ultimately about personal guilt and the struggle to move beyond the past.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I hate the alarm icon that the default clock app puts next to the time in the notification bar - I don't need a permanent icon there telling me that there is an alarm some time in the future - I know that already because I set it.    This app still reports the alarm time to the lock screen without the notification icon, which is just how I like it.  It is reliable and simple.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I got this when it was the free app of the day some time ago.  It's great.  I had been using Jorte  but decided to try this one on a whim. I'm glad I did. The widget options alone make Business Calendar a good  choice,  but now the development team has been adding other options like color customization and photo inclusion.  The reminder function has kept me from missing or being late to appointments and even reminds me to put out the trash on Tuesday nights.  Definitely worth the two dollar price for those who want a calendar application that is easy to use and does its job well.  This is the program I use the most on my phone. It makes my phone a truly useful tool.

0439023521|4.0|Every so often, there is a young adults book that comes around that has a world so fascinating, that you forgive questionable editing and writing style.  The Hunger Games is one of those books.  Set in a distant dystopian future, Collins boldly predicts the horrors of humanity and has constructed an arena (quite literally) that is as horrifying as it is engaging.  Though the story is told through a first person narrator, of a character that I find to be a tad annoying, you do root for her through her trying experience and feel her fear and pain as she goes through her journey.  The world is so carefully thought out that you just want to find out more and more, and Collins does provide and eyefull.      As mentioned, the writing is a bit on the nose at times, and when the book becomes more character oriented it suffers a bit (and the subsequent books arent as good as the first), but its a quick, incredibly memorable read that is completely worth your time.  In fact, I still can't get it out of my head and am really looking forward to the film.

B0018LMZO4|5.0|The father of modern philosophy, Ren&eacute; Descartes, shook the 17th century world with his summary statement \\"cogito ero sum\\", or \\"I think, therefore I am\\".  In the 19th century, existentialism followed suit.  The human existence, in essence, gives its own meaning to life, so that a fulfilling life, without regard to religious devotion but not necessarily in lieu of it, should be filled with passion, introspection, sincerity, and most importantly, individualism.  Most critics and reviewers of ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM miss the point entirely.  From the opening moments of the album, with the Graeme Edge concoction In The Beginning (whereby The Moody Blues call on Ren&eacute; Descartes' famous line), THRESHOLD is not an album about \\"dreams\\", not per se, but the dream concept is a valid point in examining human introspection.  However, THRESHOLD is more an examination of the human condition, of our existence, and in meaningfulness.  Bare this in mind when you listen to this wonderful work of art, a work that in modern terms, rivals the existential thinkers of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries and is still an important exercise today!  The Moody Blues are one of the rare entities in rock and roll, who examine the human experience in their music, in much the same way the Beat writers of the 50's and 60's, and some independent film makers today, examine existentialism through novels, poetry, and movies.  ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM is the crux of what the Moody Blues began in DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED, and IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD, and what they continued through TO OUR CHILDRENS CHILDRENS CHILDREN, A QUESTION OF BALANCE, EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR, and 7TH SOJOURN.  The cornerstone of existentialism is a focus on concrete existence instead of hypothesis.  In Albert Camus' The Myth Of Sisyphus, existence is urged to persevere even in the face of absurdity.  Sisyphus is a Greek mythological character condemned to repeat forever the act of rolling a great stone up a mountainside, only to see it fall back to the bottom and to begin all over again.  Camus concludes \\"the struggle itself is enough to fill a man's heart.  One must imagine Sisyphus as happy.\\"  ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM examines human existence, both loving (Lovely To See You, Send Me No Wine, To Share Our Love, So Deep Within You) and absurd (Dear Diary, Never Comes The Day, Lazy Day) in much the same way as DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED but without the confines of a clock.  These moments of pure art rock are what made the album an instant success pushing it to #1 on the UK charts and #20 on the Billboard USA.  The music on this album is highly accessible by all ages, all genders, all races, it is quintessential in approach to familiarity and to the excesses of our daily lives (\\"someone exploded an H-bomb today, `fraid it wasn't anybody I know\\").  Absurd but truthful.  A song that worries about what is for Sunday dinner seems insane, but it breaches the exact measure of our lives, we are tasked every moment of our lives with , tedious, unimportant steps which seemingly lead nowhere.  Or do they?  Is not the mere act of existing meaningful in the mere nature of existence?  Are we preordained to devote 100% of our energy and thought to searching for the meaning (as in the nature of the previous album) of life, or is the meaning in the existence of our life itself?  These are the totems which bring us to THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM.  After mulling over what's for dinner, Justin Hayward asks us to sit ourselves comfortably, and to allow the magician (Merlin by name, but it could be the great and powerful Oz hiding behind the curtain) to take us away to the age of Camelot.  This song is distinctive again as another one of the perfect collaborations between Justin on acoustic guitar and soothing vocals, and Ray Thomas' flute interweaving the lyrics and lending a magical quality to the song.  As Merlin casts his spell, the listener is whisked away into the Edge-penned, Pinder-recited poem The Dream, a Poe-styled slightly nightmarish dream that smoothes over as we are asked to \\"live hand in hand\\" and told \\"together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream\\".  After all the existential internalizing, The Moody Blues finally reach the exacerbating realization that without dreams, the human condition has nothing to aspire to.  Bookended by Have You Heard parts 1 and 2 respectively, The Voyage is an epic finale to the album.  Pinder himself proclaimed it was inspired by Thus Spake Zarathustra (most know this as the 2001: A Space Odyssey theme), a Richard Strauss classical \\"tone poem\\" inspired by existentialist writer (yes!) Nietzsche's philosophical novel of the same name.  The work is a treatise on the death of God and the birth of the Ubermensch or Superman.  And the key text in the concept is that \\"man is something that shall be overcome\\" and the Superman shall be the ultimate goal of life.  This is the central posit of Nietzsche's work and was a central inspiration to existentialist musings and music for another 100 years,  The Voyage draws inspiration from these pieces, it utilizes cello, flute, mellotron, organ, and piano in a manner reminiscent of IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD and is a riveting piece of music.  The end caps, Have You Heard which eventually lead back into the science-fictiony notes which opened the album (forming a perfect loop) have lyrics which will verify the true nature of the entire ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM album.  This demonstrates as well the unity under which The Moody Blues were working during this period of compositions.<br /><br />Now you know that you are real<br />Show your friends that you and me<br />Belong to the same world<br />Turned on to the same world<br />Have you heard?<br />...etc.<br /><br />It seems the Moody Blues discovered that the human condition is after all, more fulfilling than the Dream experience after all.Dream, a Poe-styled slightly nightmarish dream that smoothes over as we are asked to \\"live hand in hand\\" and told \\"together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream\\".

I flew through it and I am relieved to know how the characters I've invested time and emotion into turned out... but the ending really didn't feel complete to me. I read it several times, but I am still not sure exactly what happened and what exactly the goodbye is for.
B0018BB21G|5.0|A light strum of an Indian tambura, similar to a sitar but fretless and used primarily as a drone sound, opens the album which is about to transport you In SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD.  An eerie chord starts low and begins to build, a sound you can't quite identify although it is made by a mellotron, it lifts and swells while an easy-at-first, gentle voice of a Mad Hatter recites his poem introduction to the journey, his voice quickly raising to manic and breaking up into hysterical laughter...in search of...[indistinguishable]...the accompanying bass and sitar you barely noticed now disappear into a roar of electric guitar rock and roll and harmonized vocals.  It is a catchy song featuring the standard lead electric guitar, bass, drums, tambourine, and incredibly 5-part harmony vocals with a mellotron drone.  Well this IS rock and roll and Ride My See Saw has a curious distinction of being the first ever 8-track multi-track recorded single in the fast-paced evolution of stereophonic rock being pioneered by The Beatles at the time.  The Moody Blues actually pioneered 8-track stereo with DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED a year before this.  As high-energy rock fades away, the \\"search\\" is clearly in the hands of some great explorers, Dr David Livingstone, Captain Robert Scott, and even Christopher Columbus.  It is a child-friendly composition, still in keeping with the previous instrumentation, and has a Ringo-leading-Beatles-song sort of styling.  But the trip is about to take a new turn.  These Moody Blues don't do anything easy!  They even play all their own instruments.  Ray Thomas remembers being handed an oboe, the rest of the group leaves to lunch and tells him to learn it by the time they get back.  Oh very funny!  Yes Ray is a flute player, a very good one, but an oboe is a reed instrument and takes care as well as time.  None the less, The Moody Blues return and there with bleeding lips, Mr Thomas is ready to record!  Now that is dedication.  Dr Livingstones explorations of Africa have led you to The House Of Four Doors and creakily we are going to open each and every one of them!  Mind you the fabulous Moodies are going to play: acoustic guitar, bass guitar, cello, mellotron, harpsichord, piano, flute, oboe, and drums, all themselves on just this song.  Each of the four doors, as it opens during the first part of the song, leads to a new discovery symbolized by four distinct periods of western music: 1st door, acoustic guitar (lute style) and flute in a medieval minstrel gait; 2nd door, harpsichord and cello duet done in the baroque style of classic music; 3rd door, mellotron and piano in \\"classical\\" music flourish; and finally the 4th door opens to the Moody Blues classic Legend Of A Mind, a psychedelic rock piece in part homage to and in part dissociative psychology of  1960's Harvard professor and guru of LSD, Timothy Leary.  Dr Leary advocated the spiritual and mind-opening benefits of hallucinogenic drugs and published his semi-autobiographical and semi-spiritual guide writings in a book The Politics Of Ecstasy.  Ray Thomas' composition uses the flute as lead instrument in a beautiful \\"trip\\" but the solemn fact of the matter, both in lyrics and in reality, is that the search along these lines is pointless and fruitless.  As the songs closes, a drumming and mellotron reintroduction to the House Of Four Doors lets the listener know that nothing was found here in the search and so we move on.  Side two of the original album opened with the plaintively gorgeous Justin Hayward composition Voices In The Sky, a rather introspective and poetically lyrical piece featuring acoustic guitar and flute as well as the usual mellotron layers, and an Eastern music tinge with tablas accompanying the western drums.  The tabla is a membrane covered drum similar to bongos but much more tympanic giving the sound a devotional effect.  The Hindu influence in music begins to take more hold as Voices segues into The Best Way To Travel, which accordingto songwriter and vocalist Pinder, is \\"thinking\\"!  Electric guitar and sitar accompany mellotron, acoustic guitar and flute in an unusual composition which explores Pinder's thinking.  There is very wide stereo panning (commonly called ping pong stereo) which was simply captured in the day by pan pots on a 4-track console with 20 microphone inputs.  During the middle \\"exploration\\" the mellotron was set up with an intensely high-frequency register that took the listener around in a 360 degree turn.  The next song in the search is perhaps the most beautifully expressive, a collaboration between Hayward's gentle vocal prowess and Thomas' gorgeous flute.  Visions Of Paradise brings back the sitar and tambura as well as tabla drums in a melding of eastern and western musical influences.  One of the Moody Blues biggest fan favorites Justin and Ray made several well liked and praised songs together, this being the archetype of their collaborations.  Visions... then segues into The Actor by Justin Hayward.  This is one of his signature love ballads, the type of song he became famous for, \\"the curtain rises on a scene\\" and a young woman falls in love with the actor.  Of course the actor does not even know she exists so there is no requited love interest and only the fantasy of the young woman.  Ray actually plays the French horn here as well as flute, embellishing the song for a feel of the \\"search\\" by way of internalized love, but the real hero here is some of Justin's best vocals complete with catchy hooks.  The song was ripe for adult contemporary hit-making but took a while for those of us who were young back then to grow it into our arsenal of pure loving ballads.  The Word brings us back around to the beginning again, with Pinder now reciting Edge's poetry in a continuation from the Departure.  Pinder usually, but not always, read Graeme Edges penned pieces, and here we finally reach the end of the \\"search\\" with Mike Pinder's soothing deep voice who reveals that the answer is in a Word and the Word is OM!  Om utilizes every eastern musical instrument in the Moody Blues locker room (incidentally there are 33 identified instruments credited to The Moody Blues members in this album alone).  Om is the all-encompassing mystical entity of Hinduism.  It is both a vibration brought by pronunciation of the word \\"Aum\\" and the symbolized manifestation of God as the first vibration (energy) which presented itself at the creation of all things.  In western thought it would be equivalent to \\"I Am\\", how interesting that the English words I Am are just a slight variation from the Hindi Aum and in essence, they both mean the same thing, no?  and so... IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD transports us through a search for a chord, a vibration, a manifestation of the spirit that transcends the material world, and just like The Beatles said, it's the word Love!

B004518W9G|1.0|I drive a 1999 Honda Civic Hatchback DX so I couldn't wait to get my Ferrari (V12 model) until I did yesterday... was soo stoked to jump in, fire her up and go roasting the tires down the street... then I tried. Plugged it into my lighter and followed the instructions, after several times I got frustrated and decided it wasnt worth my time... it just doesnt work. Got it to for a moment but once I started to drive, it would mess up. I'm somewhat disappointed... didn't expect much out of a $40 gadget. If I were to make something of this idea I would hook it up like a tachometer so you get real results... that what most car enthusiasts want. Id spend $150-200 if it sounded and worked like it should with technology today. Hope no one else makes my mistake by not listening to everyone else... good luck.

B003L77GRO|4.0|For fans of Dexter this is a must see. This series just keeps getting better and better. I for one do not have Showtime and must wait for the release of the series on DVD and I must admit it was worth the wait.  My minus one star is not directed at the content of the show but more at Showtime or even it's parent company: Paramount for making disc five unreadable in some machines AGAIN, just like last year's series. In order to see the last episode in my house, everyone has to move to the office to see it at the computer. I guess having a Blue-ray doesn't mean it can read it all.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|A glance at the ratings show that people are all over the board with this one. I found it to be dull and rather amateur.  Most of the dialogue is so poor that the acting comes across contrived.  None of the lead actors inspired any emotion into their characters until, perhaps, the final scenes of the movie, which contains the only real drama engaging the audience.  Some will no doubt like Red Riding Hood, but it pales in comparison to Blood & Chocolate or Van Helsing.
0312323867|5.0|Something Blue is the sequel to the much beloved, Something Borrowed. I have read both books and to my surprise, I thought Something Blue was a much stronger and more entertaining novel. Darcy Rhone is the most self-centered person ever and the things she believes and says are outrageous but hilarious! Darcy is the kind of woman who judges others without a second thought, she thinks she is the most perfect person and she is not to blame for anything. Darcy feels betrayed by her best friend Rachel and her ex-fiance Dex. I won't give away too much but Darcy along the way starts to change her stubborn ways and becomes something more softer and more real. I loved this book and I love Emily Giffin's ingenious writing. Don't wait...buy this book today!
0812550706|5.0|I really like this book.  Why am I righting a review for something that already has a LOT of reviews?  To help vouch for a book that is really good, and to explain somthing.  Girls, this is a guy book.  Most girls hate this book, and most guys love it.  I am not saying you shouldn't try to read this book, you should, but if you don't like it and you wonder why thousands of others do, keep that in mind.  Trt to stick with the book a while, it gets better when you do.  Also, try \\"Shadow of Ender\\".  It's like this book, but from another's eyes.  You might like it better.  That's... all I have to say... Awkward...
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I simply loved this movie!  I won't rehash the storyline, but the characters and their stories stole my heart.  I also am not a huge fan of country music, but I enjoyed all the songs, and I'm now the owner of both soundtracks which I am thoroughly enjoying. This is the kind of movie I can watch again and again without ever growing tired of it, especially since I now have a huge crush on Garrett Hedlund and his voice!
B000000XBE|5.0|I'm in my mid-twenties, and I've come to love songs like \\"Traveling Man,\\"  \\"Pagan Baby,\\" and \\"Lodi.\\" Definitely a must-have if you enjoy good rock   from the 70's.

B005ER6SNM|5.0|I have always been a big fan of horror and thriller movies but I can honestly say that no film has ever left me stunned, almost speechless. It truly was difficult for me to explain to people what I had just watched or even if I should. But ultimately after a few days and some time to really think about the film, I have to conclude it really is quite masterful. For as disturbing as the imagery and subject matter may be I really can't think of one scene that could be lifted from the film without destroying the story. Certainly this was not a filmmaker who intended to use shock for the sake of shock, but some one who meticulously crafted each scene as an integral piece of the story regardless of how atrocious it may be. This is no mere exploitation film, and indeed a film you will hate yourself for loving.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|My 18 year old had been bugging me to watch this so we did the other night. It really isn't my type of movie as I am into things like \\"into thin air\\", \\"into the wild\\", action, adventure, suspense but not really medieval times stuff. However I was really surprised because it was excellent!<br /><br />The cinemotography, the acting, the storyline -- everything was very well done! I would highly recommend it and would watch it again.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|To state this is as akin to propaganda (as did the above reviewer) is not only a ridiculous statement but a comment written by someone who should stick to watching movies that do not contemplate the complexities of life or death whatsoever...maybe independence day or 2012 is more their style....This is an honest , contemplative movie for those who care not about liberal/conservative b*****it or common religious views or religious banter. But a movie for those who have questions, and care to have them challenged.    Its brilliant.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|a great read. It deals well with a time in history many would like to see forgotten and buried.  Stories like this remind us all to be aware of what our true history is and how that history can affect generations of families and bring strangers together.  The truth, no matter how ugly should be dragged into the light. Read it and then read about it.
0634089358|5.0|The delivery came a little sooner then expected. The book itself is easy to follow, its really a book that every bass player should take a look at no matter what your style is. I notice that I dont use the CD much, but if you have an acoustic bass this book is great to mess around with. Better than most instructional books. If your just starting skip the \\"bass basics\\" stuff, Blues Bass will see you through. Hal Leonard makes good stuff.
0062060554|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book because she couldn't put it down and neither could I!  I read it in 2 days and each time I put it down I couldn't wait to pick it up again.  Very well written and very interesting.  I read a lot of books and this is definitely one of my favorites.  I'll be sending it to my mom and sister to read.
140131046X|5.0|I started with his book Five people you meet in Heaven which I picked up by chance in an Oxfam shop. I have not regretted this move since then and have read three others of his books. He is, in simple words, just too good. He makes faith seem possible and one has to be a really hard core atheist not to find solace in his books. I just say....try it. You might find the way to believe through his simple yet very meaningful words in this book. The Rabbi and the pastor are so different and still not so as they both convey the same message and are equally dedicated to their respective beliefs emphasising only on faith. My faith matured after reading it.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Even though this is a very commercially aimed film, I really enjoyed it. It's got witty dialogue, a wonderful ensemble cast, including Pegg and Frost but also Jason Bateman (I just laugh looking at him at this point and I mean that in the best way possible) and one of my all-time favorites, Kristen Wiig, who is slightly underused in this movie, yet she shines. The bonus features alone are worth the money. This being the unrated version, many scenes are fleshed-out much better than in the theatrical version as well. Fun little weekend dvd to have around.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|Love the CD but the CD case was apparently sliced by a box cutter prior to its shipment to me.  Since I am a collector of rock documentaries and concert footage I prefer to have a pristine case or sleeve.  I have found CD cases in better shape at the Goodwill than the one I received from Amazon/Newberry Comics. I contacted Newberry Comics (which was the company shown on the return address on the mailed packaging) and they said they had nothing to do with it and passed the buck to Amazon.  I emailed Amazon regarding the damaged CD case and received no response.  If this is the way you people do business you have received my last order.

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I wanted to like this movie; I really did. However, I just did not get any emotions from the characters nor did the storyline flow well. I think my favorite is still the version with William Hurt & Charlotte Gainsbourg. BUMMER

0439023521|5.0|This book was well written and the plot well thought out leaving us with a cliffhanger that makes us want the next chapter immediately.  It is futuristic but still seemingly could happen tomorrow.  It begs the question of what would you do if put in their shoes?
B004LWZW24|4.0|I went into this not really expecting much but hoping a bit.  This movie nails what has been so often forgotten or overlooked by so many \\"would be\\" horror directors. I knew i had stumbled on something exciting and refreshing in the first 60 seconds of this film.  This movie literally drips with dreadful atmosphere, and the director was able to do on film what i have said for so long and that is this....scary things are much scarier in broad daylight.  The director successfully transformed the most familiar and comfortable atmosphere (the family's home) into a terrifying and righteously menacing space.  James Wan is single handedly saving the genre.  Not since Carpenter's The Fog have i been so buried in spooky atmosphere.  Much like another review i read, i literally felt uncomfortable in my home for a full day after viewing this film, and i consider myself a hard core and hardened fan of horror.  This film is outstanding.  I give four out of five stars only because of the slower pace of the second half of the film.  Thank you for reading.
B004ZJZQ92|5.0|I had seen this movie before on a DVD and wanted to see it in HD.  It is a good action adventure with quality actors.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Refraction is a really great game. Every level is a new challenge, and I keep coming back till I beat it. It's also got a really nice dark background which saves power on my Fascinate's screen. Even if I could, I wouldn't change a thing about it.
B00505470O|3.0|Just look at that tanned young couple on the cover art making furious love! Those rumpled, off-white sheets! Eggshell I think they're called in catalogues.

0553801473|2.0|Some don't like that Martin spends so much time describing food, clothing, sigils, etc.  I confess, I like it.  I like the way he lets me see, smell, taste and feel the world of Westeros.  He has been called the American Tolkien.  After the first three books, I thought he might well be.  Then came A Feast for Crows.  And now this.  What a pathetic mess.  It has all been said by previous reviewers.  Elvis (Martin) has definitely left the building.  For whatever reason, it would seem that he is no longer motivated.  In the July 29th issue of Entertainment Weekly he was asked about the next book, the Winds of Winter.  He is supposed to have said that he has already made some headway and expects to return to it in January.  Translation to me, he hasn't done diddly.<br /><br />It's too bad.  Such a promising franchise.  Seriously need to consider having somebody else wrap this up because I no longer hold much hope that he can or will.
B0050LJIRK|4.0|I was one of those that pre-ordered it on \\"[...]\\"<br />on june 26th. Over 3 weeks went by and kept getting \\"Its on back order\\". So I cancelled and came to Amazon. Found what turned out to a promo newunopened for a surprizing $6! When I recieved I thought finally after all the rave and it been postponed so many time its here. First off the art work really sucks! Somrthing a high school kid would do. I was thinking a \\"killer gold cobra\\" kick a** art work since it took forever to get produced.<br />The music it self rates from really good to great.<br />The rap , well a few tunes rocked but it did'nt blow me away. Sounds like they were trying to hard.<br /> It was woth the full price {9.99} but anything more would be a waste. The deluxe with extra songs was no better. tried to hard to be hard core. Waste of effeort and cash
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my Galaxy Tab. Occasional force closes but I love it so much I don't care. Great game that provides good replay. Can't wait for version 2.
B0052KJ5TK|5.0|To start off I got a great price and it was for the deluxe version. The disc has a great freshness about it. I've always been a huge fan anyway.<br />I'm one of those that if there is'nt atleast 3 hits on a disc it won't be bought. I bought this on sight only and it was well worth the risk. As for what some would pay for the deluxe ed. I sayit should have came with those tracks for the same price. Even though I give it high marks I personally would not have payed the full amount for the duluxe just to get the extra  songs.<br /> To many disc are less than 40 minutes now days.<br />If it will hold 80 minutes atleast give us a whole hour
B0032Y8XH8|3.0|So far I'm not in love with Mumford or this album.  Mostly I'm really disappointed that one of the two songs I liked on the radio and based this purchase on is not the radio version.  \\"Little Lion Man,\\" which I thought on the radio had the lyrics \\"I really messed it up this time,\\" has 'f*ed it up' on the album.  Now that I go back and look the song is labeled explicit in the track listing, missed this before, I thought they labeled albums.  Since I can't blast this out around the kids, this will probably not get the repeated playing it probably needs to really like it.  I'm not even interested enough to download the clean version.  If they can't include radio edits on albums with explicit lyrics, my cd purchases will be next to nothing soon.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|If you are familiar with Malick's work, you know what you're in for. Don't expect your typical drama and linear storyline. This is filmmaking at the highest level of ambition and sophistication. An arthouse picture reaching for the heavens. The movie is groundbreaking on every concievable level and one of the best films in the last decade. It is also the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.    The film itself cannot really be explained. Its essentially an episodic tale of one  family's highs and lows in 1950s Texas. Though what Malick does, and does incredibly well is explain how their story coinsides with the meaning of life and death and God. Malick asks the kinds of the questions that stump adults when kids ask them. Some may find it preachy and pretensious. Though a keen eye for art and an open ear for radical ideas and thoughts will send you soaring into amazement and into a state of film ecstacy. You may just be moved to tears by the images you see.    Walking out of this movie, I had a body high and heavy head like I've neever felt. I felt like I just sat through a 6 hour film, and I mean that in the best possible way.       If you liked Days of Heaven, The New World, 2001: Spaced Odyessy and The Thin Red Line, you'll love this.
B000002L80|4.0|This was a gift for someone's birthday who had mentioned over the past year or two she had been meaning to buy this CD.  She owned the vinyl album of this years ago, but now only has those memories of this excellent CD.  Getting this for her is something I do not mind at all as I also like this album.  Songs like 'She was' and 'Up all Night' are some of the tunes that come to mind and are timeless and just as fresh sounding now as they were 'all those years' ago.  If you were a Talking Heads fan you will sure want to have this in your collection, if not a fan yet, just give this a listen and you will buy it.  Every home needs an album this upbeat, fun,l and just dang good!  Enjoy!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I am an Amazon MP3 convert. I first learned about the Amazon MP3 store when clicking buy on a song I liked from the slacker radio app.  I have been hooked since. I have an approximately 6 GB music collection in iTunes and to my dismay, around 1/3 of them are DRM protected.  While my wife is happy to purchase an iPhone, I would like to listen to my paid music on my computer AND on my Droid.  Amazon MP3 to the rescue. The DRM free music allows me to listen stream my music from the Amazon cloud or download it and listen to it on my Droid, desktop computer, or laptop computer.  All of this for the same price (and often cheaper) as iTunes.<br /><br />I am also a participant in Google Music Beta but have found the Amazon player to be more to my liking. Not only does Amazon provide the ability to purchase music and download it directly to your cloud drive but the storage of music in your cloud drive is a free service.  I did not realize until recently that the storage for music purchased directly from Amazon MP3 is not included in the 2 GB quota that is provided for the free cloud service.<br /><br />I am also suspicious of Google's music beta. Don't get me wrong, I love Google and Google products and they have a track record of providing free services that offer alternatives to current paid services (often at potentially expensive costs to the company while upsetting competitors). However, the clause in Google Music Beta on the App Store that says \\"Free for a limited time ...\\" makes me nervous that they are waiting for people to upload their entire music library, become dependent on the service, and then start charging a subscription fee for storage or bandwidth.<br /><br />But I digress. With Amazon MP3 purchase and download to your hearts content without worries about running out of cloud storage space or hidden or future costs. Then enjoy life streaming your music or downloading it to listen offline in areas where your reception is not so great (or if you do not have aunlimited data plan).
0307591549|5.0|Book review by Richard L. Weaver II<br /><br />There are sixteen pages of notes that support 210 pages of text.  Right from the outset, this is a good sign.  Clearly, Achor has done his homework, and it shows throughout the text as he documents his observations, conclusions, and recommendations.  Also, it isn't just the research, it is the range of the author's information that makes it impressive.<br /><br />A book with this title, I have to admit, makes me skeptical at the outset.  There are so many \\"self-help\\" books out there, I assumed that this was just another one of the same.  Happily, I was quickly disabused of this notion.  This book in no way is typical of other self-help books; it is truly unique and deserves your attention.<br /><br />I loved the author's explanation of his upbringing -- being from Waco, Texas, and<br />going to Harvard on a dare.  Just as Achor looked at his opportunity at Harvard as a privilege, especially after visiting Africa, talking to his guide, Salim, and finding that Soweto students saw education as a privilege, I realized my opportunity for an education at the University of Michigan (UofM) was truly a privilege -- especially after talking to people around the world (with an emphasis on East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) where I worked for nine months) and realizing how people viewed the UofM.  It was an eye-opener, and it changed my viewpoint, my study habits, and my whole approach.<br /><br />I firmly believe that the author is correct when he discussed the pattern of focusing on the negative (pp. 11-12) that pervades schools and society at large, too.  And Achor's thesis supported throughout the book is a simple one: \\"We become more successful when we are happier and more positive\\" (p. 15).  I realize that this isn't a new discovery, but 1) it is nice to have it revisited, 2) it is pleasant to see the evidence that supports the thesis, and 3) the way the author develops the thesis is terrific.  I loved the statement, and all students should be aware of it: \\"It turns out that our brains are literally hardwired to perform at their best not when they are negative or even neutral, but when they are positive\\" (p. 15).<br /><br />Achor's seven principles, when given the \\"eyeball test,\\" appear practical, accurate, and worthwhile.  1) The happiness advantage, 2) the fulcrum and the lever (\\"This principles teaches us how we can adjust our mindset (our fulcrum) in a way that gives us the power (the lever) to be more fulfilled and successful\\"), 3) The tetris effect (self-fulfilling prophecies), 4) falling up, 5) the Zorro circle (when \\"our rational brains can get hijacked by emotions\\"), 6) the 20-second rule (the need to make \\"small energy adjustments,\\" and 7) social investment (using friends, peers, and family members to propel yourself).  When you read each chapter, you realize the value of his principles and the accuracy of his labels.<br />One of the things that makes this book a great read is the author's sense of humor.  On page 23, for example, he says, \\"the head of his Ph.D. program estimated the average academic journal article is read by only seven people.<br /><br />This is an extraordinarily depressing statistic, because I know that number has to include the researcher's mom.\\" On page 27, he says, \\"Great, you might say, for squirrel monkeys -- but for the most part, we don't hire monkeys in our organizations (at least not on purpose).\\"  In brackets on page 68, he says, after asking battle-weary bankers to sing \\"Row, row, row, your boat\\" over and over again at one of his talks: \\"(At least this time I remembered to specify that they sing it in their own heads, not out loud -- a detail I once forgot on Wall Street, where I quickly learned the true definition of `tone deaf.')\\"<br /><br />This is a book for everyone, and the reason \\"is supported by some of the most rigorous cutting-edge research in neuroscience. . . . Once our brains were discovered to have such built-in plasticity [neuroplasticity], our potential for intellectual and personal growth suddenly became equally malleable.  As you're about to read over the next seven sections, studies have found numerous ways we can rewire our brains to be more positive, creative, resilient, and productive -- to see more possibility wherever we look\\" (pp. 29-30).  Now, I ask you, knowing this book offers practical steps for change (based on clear evidence), why wouldn't anyone want to increase their positive outlook, creativity, resiliency, and productivity?  It's a no-brainer.<br /><br />Let me give you just one example of his practical approach.  \\"With this in mind,\\" Achor says on page 51, \\"here are a number of proven ways we can improve our moods and raise our levels of happiness throughout the day.\\"  There are seven ways discussed.  This happens throughout the book, and it makes it possible to see happiness as something we can acquire, build, or improve.  Despite the research, the studies he shares, and the serious discussions about happiness, Achor's writing is engaging and accessible.  He talks directly to his readers, and his writing is loaded with examples and illustrations, personal experiences, anecdotes, and well-explained (easy-to-understand) research.  Also, he shares his experiences with emotions attached.  For example, \\"Adrenaline shot through my body as I reached for the shiny handle of the Cambridge Police cruiser. . . . \\" (p. 87).<br /><br />If you want to have some fun; if you like learning new things; if you are seeking improvement in your life; if you just plain enjoy good writing (and a good read); and, perhaps, most important with respect to the author's thesis and the title of this book, if you want to take advantage of \\"the Happiness Advantage\\" (the application of positive psychology in your life), this book is a great choice.  I highly recommend it.denly became equally malleable.

B0054U53WG|5.0|Book review by Richard L. Weaver II, Ph.D.<br /><br />Just looking at this 387-page (of text) book, sixteen pages of notes, with only seven parts and meekly marked chapters within each part, with a heavy amount of verbiage on each page, no pictures, no special boxes, or any interferences of any kind, one can be easily intimidated.  Reading the book, however, will change this perspective quickly and directly.  Levy is a terrific writer; his stories are interesting and, indeed, engaging; and the narrative is well-organized, and meaningfully and purposefully driven.<br /><br />For technophiles, and anyone else who might be interested in the etymology, history, maintenance, and continuing evolution of one of the most influential and indispensable aspects of daily life, this book is a \\"must buy.\\"<br /><br />Because of Levy's unprecedented access to Google, you not only get to look into its headquarters (the Googleplex), but you also see Google from the vantage point of its employees. Levy interviewed \\"hundreds of current and former Googlers and attended a variety of meetings in the company\\" (p. 6).<br /><br />How does Levy know all the in's and out's of the workings of the company?  The meetings he was allowed to attend \\"included product development meetings, `interface reviews,' search launch meetings, privacy council sessions, weekly TGIF all-hands gatherings, and the gatherings of the high command known as Google Product Strategy (GPS) meetings, where projects and initiatives are approved or rejected.  I also ate a lot of meals at Andale, the burrito joint in Google's Building 43\\" (p. 6).<br /><br />The inside information Levy obtains, the incredibly detailed operations, the decisions that had/have to be made, the thinking that takes/took place, the numerous and exacting quotations, and all the various and intricate movements of this company are told in a fascinating, even riveting, narrative that keeps your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />One personal story here merits comment.  In the sixth edition of my college textbook (written with Saundra Hybels), Communicating Effectively (2001), I introduced readers to the AltaVista search engine every time I discussed the use of the Internet as a research tool.  At that point, Google was not mentioned at all.  It was in my seventh edition (2004), that I made a complete switch from discussing AltaVista--which now had one mention (p. 421) --to Google, which, in my seventh had more than a dozen pages as listed in the index.  In the very next edition, my eighth (2007), AltaVista was not discussed (even as an alternative search engine), and Google became so predominant, obvious, and accepted that it was no longer even selected for special mention in the index--and it was a prominent fixture throughout the book.<br /><br />Communicating Effectively, now in its 10th edition  (McGraw-Hill, 2012) continues to discuss Google alone when it comes to Internet searches.  I have grown as a writer along with Google, and in the essays, books, and speeches I write, I depend on it (almost solely) as my immediate and invaluable research tool.<br /><br />For me Levy's book is outstanding for its comprehensiveness and depth.

B003UESJEM|2.0|I have no qualms with watching movies that deal with hard hitting issues, but we are dealing with a sort of realized fiction that has to have some sort of spark to keep the viewer interested. The Company Men doesn't have that spark. The characters come across as cardboard cut outs of the problems that are going on today, they lack any sort of depth. From Affleck to Nelson, everyone here seems to be nothing more than a placeholder, couple that with stilted and unimaginative dialogue and the entire movie is snore city.
0553805371|5.0|Book review by Richard L. Weaver II<br /><br />I am not a physicist, although I took physics in high school.  I am not a scientist although both of my parents were, and I pursued a pre-medicine curriculum from 9th grade through my second year at the University of Michigan.  I say this only as a preface to my review, for unlike some who have reviewed this book who have sufficient credentials to examine the argument here, and unlike others who come at it from a definite viewpoint (or even worldview), I am but a lay reader interested in science and scientific information.  I love living in the age of the Hubble telescope just because of the wonders it has unfolded and the new definitions it has forced us to formulate.<br /><br />I did not read this book to get answers to the three questions the authors pose toward the beginning of the book (p. 29): 1) What is the origin of the laws (that govern nature)? 2) Are there any exceptions to the laws (i.e., miracles)? And 3) Is there only one set of possible laws?  Common sense alone serves as a guide to the answers to these questions.  1) Human beings are the originators, 2) Of course there are exceptions; however, there is no such thing as miracles -- never were! And 3) There are numerous sets of laws; there have to be.  (Now you see my point of view and from where I am coming.)<br /><br />I read the book with an open mind.  After all, the authors have written an incredibly accessible book about a very complex set of ideas.  It's a picture book, too, although the pictures really add very little to the substance.<br /><br />I have never been fond of the big bang theory -- even though I think those who support it really don't understand it completely.  At the AllAboutScience web site, it makes the theory simple when it says: \\"Discoveries in astronomy and physics have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that our universe did in fact have a beginning. Prior to that moment there was nothing; during and after that moment there was something: our universe. The big bang theory is an effort to explain what happened during and after that moment.\\"  To this day, I do not believe there was ever \\"nothing.\\"  That doesn't mean I support a static theory, just that universes are ever evolving and forever have evolved -- there is no specific beginning; there will be no specific ending (except for human life on this planet, which is likely to end when the precious and precarious vicissitudes that allow for our existence change). The authors discuss these conditions.<br /><br />The authors' very simple explanations of the various scientific laws that govern the universe are wonderfully described.  I liked it when they said, \\"Einstein didn't attempt to construct an artificial explanation for this [time as a physical process].  He drew the logical, if startling, conclusion that the measurement of the time taken, like the measurement of the distance covered, depends on the observer doing the measuring\\" (p. 97).<br /><br />Readers need to take note of this important statement: it \\"depends on the observer doing the measuring,\\" for this observation can serve as a template for what the authors' have labeled \\"the grand design.\\"  There is no reason to become disturbed or annoyed by their self-anointed position of supreme scientific authority (after all, this is Stephen Hawking!) in promulgating their grand design.  Because it is a catch-all, multi-faceted, all-encompassing theory that subsumes what theories exist and what theories may come to be, it makes sense for its versatility and widely encompassing embrace.<br /><br />I thought the authors were courageous to take on those who believe that \\"the grand design is the work of some grand designer.  In the United States, because the Constitution prohibits the teaching of religion in schools,\\" they say, \\"that type of idea is called intelligent design, with the unstated but implied understanding that the designer is God.\\"  It may have been courageous; however, the argument is basic, fundamental, and easy to understand.<br /><br />The authors continue in the next paragraph, \\"This is not the answer of modern science.  . . . Many people through the ages have attributed to God the beauty and complexity of nature that in their time seemed to have no scientific explanation.  But just as Darwin and Wallace explained how the apparently miraculous design of living forms could appear without intervention by a supreme being, the multiverse concept can explain the fine-tuning of physical law without the need for a benevolent creator who made the universe for our benefit\\" (pp. 164-165).<br /><br />For readers who have no scientific (or physics) in their background, these authors may provide challenging (even threatening) information.  But, something that these authors do, and that readers should be especially thankful for, is to strengthen our appreciation of our place as humans on earth.  My goodness, how fortuitous!<br /><br />This is a well-conceived, carefully written, thoroughly explained (especially for neophytes) book that deserves consideration.  In the end, of course, it may have far greater purpose and usefulness than what may be thought about today.  It could contain the explanation -- the final theory -- that becomes the grand design.authors continue in the next paragraph, \\"This is not the answer of modern science.  . . .

0865479186|5.0|I liked Ben Goldacre's \\"Bad Science:  Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks\\".  Actually, I really liked it.  What I liked most about it, though, was how you could sense how pissed off Goldacre is without the book devolving into a tired and lengthy tirade.  Goldacre is a medical doctor and, perhaps more importantly, a scientist that values data and data-driven evidence above all else.  He has no patience for anecdote, sham studies, and pseudo-scientific professions, namely homeopaths and nutritionists.  And he rails against the mass media and their inability (unwillingness?) to accurately report science stories resulting in a further \\"dumbing down\\" of the media and, most disturbingly, of the masses.  I hesitate to reduce the book to a single sentence -- a theme -- but if forced to, a sentence on page 52 would suffice:  \\"Transparency and detail are everything in science.\\"  Now let's hope that science and data-driven decision making -- both under full-on assault in the world (especially in the United States?) -- will return to their rightful places in society:  front and center.  Here's to this book, and others like it, getting us there.
034552554X|5.0|I won an advance copy of this book some time back and put off reading it. \\"Language of Flowers\\"? It sounded like some  tacky, romance novel. When I finally decided to give it a try, I found that I had made a big mistake. This was a stunning novel that is about a child brought up in foster care who is desperately trying to learn how to bond with another person- a skill she is sorrowfully ignorant. One foster home taught her the Victorian language of flowers. It is with this valuable tool that she makes a life for herself after she ages out of the system. It is such a layered book with such raw moments of emotion that sometimes I ached as I read it. The encyclopedia of flower language in the back of the book, was quite interesting. I, heartily, recommend this book.                                      r

B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is an awesome app that I find difficult to put down.  I initially got this via the free Amazon app of the day but went back and purchased it so I could give these people money.  I want to encourage more of this.  It starts out simple and in early problems a bit too simple but it quickly grows in complexity so  I was feeling very challenged.  Any puzzle game where I'm cursing out the devs for their fiendishness is something I want more off.  I'm going to be rather disappointed when I finish all 120 levels; I know I'll want more.
0240815807|5.0|I have been a home recording musician for over 30 years and I have always believed that a decent quality recording was a result of good playing and good recording technique...not just gear. I have always made my way to various tips and tricks from several magazines and articles for insight on how to develop that technique - which is exactly how I stumbled across Mike's work in Sound on Sound's 'Mix Rescue' columns. Mike immediately gives you the impression that he is not only good at what he does, but he seems to be able to do it with the most basic tools and he can write to boot. It was a no brainer for me to pick this book up based on that. (For anyone curious, I would suggest they become aquainted with him and his work from SOS...great stuff) If you like what you read there, you are going to just LOVE this book. It's focus is to give a 'foundation up' approach to the recording process, and demystifies a lot of the things that I think trouble many home recordists today. The first number of chapters - about 78 pages, are strictly dedicated to listening and monitoring setup. To quote...'Even God's own personal control room won't help you mix you way out of a wet paper bag unless you know how to listen to what you are hearing'. There is a lot of attention to the details and the science of sound which I certainly appreciate.    But more than that - I felt that there were many occasions where I felt like that fly on the wall, looking in on what a pro would do in a given scenario. To be specific, there is a section on multitracked/multimiked drums - here Mike gives you a sneak-peek of exactly what he would do to each track (about three pages worth), spending a lot of time showing you why the mute/solo and phase buttons are so critical to address before any processing such as compression or reverb enters the picture. I would have happily paid the price I did for the book for this insight alone! There is much much more that I can comment on..the book is jam packed with somany excellent quotes and references from big names in the biz -JJP, the Lord-Alge brothers, Alan Parsons, Phil Ramone, it goes on and on.    All in all, I found it to be an easy read, and at times even quite funny. It has definately changed my perspective on recording, and the proof is in the pudding....my mixes have improved dramatically as a result. It will stay by my side at my desk for many many years. THANK YOU MIKE!!

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppola's \\"Lost in Translation\\" was a big hit in 2003-2004. It's about an aging actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who's in Tokyo doing commercials for a week. His homelife is mundane and he's experiencing a bit of the mid-life crisis. He runs into an attractive 20-something woman, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who's in Tokyo with her photog husband, but he's gone most of the time and takes her for granted.<br /><br />This is a mature, one-of-a-kind film and you have to be in the right mode and maturity level to appreciate it. I said \\"maturity level\\" and not \\"age\\" because some people are pretty mature at 16 while others are completely immature at 50. I didn't view the film until last night and it worked for me. The story, music and visuals pulled me into these character's temporary world for the 104-minute runtime.<br /><br />The film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight. I'll only focus on the deep love element. It's been noted that the story orginated from writer/director Sofia's experiences with an aging actor, possibly Harrison Ford. Sofia is obviously Charlotte, while Charlotte's husband is Sofia's ex and Anna Faris plays the role of the other woman, which would be Cameron Diaz in real life. So there's a lot of reality in this picture.<br /><br />But it's not just a cathartic piece, Sofia has some powerful insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love. For one, love transcends age difference (Bob is about 30 years older than Charlotte). For another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another. Not that this ever justifies adultery, it's just a fact. As the story progresses you'll see how comfortable Bob and Charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes -- the windows of the soul -- in a profoundly naked sense. This can happen in the flash of a moment where the two people just KNOW or it can take place over a period of time, as is the case with Bob and Charlotte (a handful of days). They see the same things and speak the same language, and I don't mean English. But this presents a conundrum for Bob. Bob could take advantage of Charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vunerable. Will he or won't he take advantage?<br /><br />!!SPOILER ALERT!! Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.<br /><br />If Bob loves Charlotte so much (not to mention his wife) why does he have a one-night stand with the lounge singer? Bob slept with the singer to release sexual tension that had been building up between him and Charlotte. This was a moral failure, but keep in mind he was drunk (another failure, but have pity, he was going through a mid-life crisis). While all this is obvious, it goes deeper...<br /><br />Bob could have taken advantage of Charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end. Bob could sleep with the singer because he didn't love her (not that it justifies his actions). Simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.<br /><br />The ending is powerful and tear-inducing. No CGI, explosion or action stunt can compare. It's just an older man and a too-young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million. Tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered. They could never be a couple, even if they weren't married, and they know they'll likely never see each other again, but their love has been expressed and will be treasured for eternity.(a handful of days). They see the same things and speak the same language, and I don't mean English. But this presents a conundrum for Bob. Bob could take advantage of Charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vunerable.

1591844096|5.0|Seth has a way of passionately expressing profound business truths in simple language, and then collaborating them with business cases to drive the point home.     In his best-known book, Purple Cow, Seth's message was, \\"Everyone's a marketer now.\\" In All Marketers Are Liars, his message was, \\"Everyone's a storyteller now.\\" In Tribes, his message was, \\"Everyone's a leader now.\\" A linchpin, as Seth describes it, is somebody in an organization who is indispensable, who cannot be replaced--his role is just far too unique and valuable. And then he goes on to say that you seriously need to be one of these people, you really do. To not be one is economic and career suicide.     Therefore in Linchpin, \\"Everyone's an artist now.\\" By Seth's definition, an artist is not just some person who messes around with paint and brushes, an artist is somebody who does real \\"emotional work.\\" One who literally throws his heart and soul into it! She does work that matters. Work that you would gladly sacrifice all other alternatives for because you know that the result is worth much more than the effort.      Anybody can become a linchpin in any organization. You just have to do things differently, do work that changes things for the better. Seth challenges the reader to become a Linchpin wherever you are. Make the leap. Become an artist. Do emotional work, whatever makes you tick. Go the extra mile and be remarkable! It's your choice!    I highly recommend this great book to all those potential Linchpins in the world!

B0055B0MIO|4.0|If this band hadn't released 2 amazing albums before this (Ascendacy and Shogun) then I wouldn't have had such high expectations.  But a few of the songs just are too mainstream rock, compared to their older work this album is very light on the guitar solos, but they did bring back some intense drumming.  For the price of a good CD and a DVD you can't beat it.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|First saw the movie after reading a review by Cal Thomas, a columnist in our local paper. He said it was a reminder of what made America great: individualism and a \\"never give up\\"/\\"can do\\" attitude. Liked its message of overcoming adversity and obstacles so much that I purchased it. Have now lost count of how many times we've watched it. Characterization is great. Story, inspiring. Photography of the racing, fantastic (you lose some of its impact on a TV screen, unfortunately). There are a number of memorable lines for anyone going through challenging times.    The movie's message is definitely a 5 rating. I'm not a movie critic and I know the movie didn't win any awards, but it's timely, it's inspiring and Secretariat, the animal star, is a wonderful American success story, even if he is a horse!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was a great read. I was surprised to learn that the author also wrote the screenplay for the movie Fanboys, a movie I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about this novel, is besides having so much nostalgic information in it for the pop culture of the 80's and the Geek culture, it also paints a picture of a very feasible world to be. Current world economic conditions and gaps between the haves and the have-nots could very well lead to a future like he depicts. Oasis is definitely a preview of the next generation of second life, with technology he describes not being so far away.<br /><br />The geeks will also enjoy this cyberpunk book as it talks of things such as \\"CaptainCrunch\\" the 2600 ceral box whitsle and even makes a reference to Kevin Mitnick.

0143116177|4.0|Overall, Niall Ferguson has woven together many aspects of finance into a coherent web, which makes the big picture more intelligible. As an economics and finance major, I found the book highly readable in comparison with many academic articles. Mr Ferguson successively tackles the main arteries of international finance: the bond market, insurance, the stock market, real estate, derivatives, corporate debt and so forth. It also deals with the seamy side of financial services, for instance, loan sharks.     As Mr Ferguson explains, poring over financial history provides means to understanding the role played by certain financial institutions and tools as well as their rationale. For example, bond markets were first thought of by Italian city-states as a new source of revenue to fund wars against one another. Mr Ferguson's perspective on real estate is refreshing, the more so since the book was written in the early stages of the global financial crisis. In my opinion, the most enlightening section of the book was that on savings and loans associations (S&L) and the way they were actually set up by the American government in the wake of the Great Depression. President Roosevelt thought widespread ownership would jumpstart economic activity besides giving people a stake in democratic government. However, S&Ls descended into economic chaos as the regulation governing them unwound in the 1980s, paving the way for abuses and real estate speculation. Subprime credit really was the last straw as government-sponsored entities (GSE) subsidised subprime mortgages and allowed insolvent households to borrow. The mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that arose were slices of streams of payments from mortgages packaged in a bundle and sold to investors as AAA securities.    One of the most interesting parts of the books regards America's current-account deficit, and the way China still funds it by buying up treasury bonds and driving down yields by generating demand--the Fed has also been doing that, incidentally. Mr Ferguson brands this unhealthy conglomerate \\"Chimerica\\" and accurately exposes the underlying causes; China has to keep the American consumer machine going in order to have an outlet for its exports. American people keep bemoaning the fact they are invaded with Chinese produce while most American consumers actually benefit from having cheaper goods on offer. In turn, this has encouraged U.S. firms to invest more. However, the Chinese also like to boast on what they see as a strong position for their country since it effectively funds American consumers. Regardless, the Chinese are as dependent on America as Americans are on China.     There is also a brief passage on Chile's transition from Salvador Allende's State Marxism to General Pinochet's military junta and subsequent liberalisation of Chile's economy under the aegis of Milton Friedman and the Chicago School.     The strength of Mr Ferguson's book is that he demystifies the financial system in a relatively jargon-free way. His views are also carefully balanced. Of course, technical terms are well-nigh unavoidable at some point, but, trust me, it could get far worse. The reason I am not giving it five stars is because it sometimes lacked structure. Overall, the structure is fine, but the contents of there chapters were less coherent at times, randomly jumping from one topic to another. Obviously, this was not meant to be a comprehensive history of finance, but it could have been given a clearer structure.

B000V6738U|3.0|Iwas initially excited about this collecton but now I have mixed feelings after listen to it.  I just picked up all of their records in used cd's, at really decent prices, and the sound is better than either of the discs mentioned, or any other cd I have heard from some of the artists. I don't have a great sound system  or anything, its just that the source is so much better with the better quality cd's. I do agree that the earlier remasters were a bit lean sounding, lacking some natural richness, especially in the midrange. But this one is excessively warm with rolled-off treble. If you have a high qulaity wuffer than that really helps with a lot of these songs so this might do it for you, but I have a system with pretty good resolution and overall neutrality, and this disk is worse than the originals, but in the other direction!

0553288105|5.0|One of my favorite Asimov stories, up there with the foundation trilogy, I've read it multiple times.  What would happen if a dimensional rift resulted in first contact scenario, and the beings on the other side of the rift thought we were the Godlike alien intelligence?  At the same time, humanity creates a limitless power source (the electron pump) and create the rift.  Superstition and politics lead into a bad place, and the very chapter titles make it into a masterpiece:  \\"Against stupidity, the Gods themselves contend in vain?\\"    The alien race is one of the best is early SF, and the meta-theme of heroism in the face of cultural stupidity sets up an enduring message.  The book is really broken into three short sections, but unlike many other authors, Asimov made these stories into more than the sum of their parts.

It's an easy book to understand, but it will require a lot of your time practicing the CAGED method on your guitar to get everything out of it  I wish I bought that book earlier, my level of understanding of the fretboard would have been much better than it is now!
078322804X|5.0|This movie is a classic! Dan Akroyd and John Belushi are irreplaceable as Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues. This movie is the right balance between storyline and hilarious celebrity cameos from Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, and many more fantastic blues artists!
0767802470|5.0|What every WWII collector buffs must have:  A copy of Das Boot!!  I received it punctually from Amazon and I'm quite pleased with  their professionalism.
B004P29FSW|5.0|Recieved my product in a decent time frame, plays great,  nice low end.  Only problem was the second record had the same label on both sides,  that of the second side,  but the music is correct for each side,  oh well,  I will keep it. Always heard about Daft Punk but never heard them before,  I think this soundtrack makes a decent movie come across as a great movie,  really elavated the movie for me.  Plays quiet and the vinyl is flat, nice gatefold.  recommended!
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|Overall, I have to give this book 2 stars. In the scheme of all books, it's a sold 2 star book. For what it is, it is much higher.     What it is: a Jodi Picoult novel that deals with an emotionally supercharged situation and progresses through a trial. The truth of what actually happened is revealed in the last 5% of the book. The writing is solid, the characters are heartfelt, and the conclusion is what you expect.    What's different about this novel, and what was frankly distracting was the sexual situations. Too many. I read enough \\"he entered her\\" sentences to last me a lifetime. Gave the book kind of an ick factor.    If you're a Jodi Picoult fan, this is a book for you.
0553381695|5.0|You learned a hard lesson about life then, and Martin means you to learn it well.    Again the lines are drawn but you will have no idea which side you should be on. King Robert is gone and five more Kings pop up to take his place. In the Red Corner the cruel Joefrey the supposed rightful heir to the seven kingdoms. In the grey corner the King in the north Robb Stark who is kicking butt all the way to Kings landing to avenge his father and rescue his sisters. In between two brothers as different as the seasons, Stannis and Renly Beratheon both vying for the cold sharp throne of the seven kingdoms. Danearys marches to womanhood and learns to live without help from the men that pulled her to and fro all her life.    However, you still don't know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy and most people you thought where pure evil will show even they are worth redemption. This may be my fav of the series. There is nothing to dislike, even the songs get you humming. Do remember from the last book that there will be no resolutions for you here. You are only rushing to the end of some and the glory of others but never the true justice and completion of this journey. For this journey is hard and cruel and long but when they laugh you will.     5 stars
1250004349|2.0|This book consists of two stories: one about a present-day journalist struggling with an assignment and family difficulties; the other, the tragedy of a young girl, Sarah, and her family during the holocaust. The problem may be that by telling these two stories in parallel, one might infer there is an equivalence of suffering between the holocaust and the journalist's marital problems. Apologies if this sounds sexist, but judging by the focus on the journalist's marriage, lengthy descriptions of clothing and what was ordered at restaurants, the target audience seems to be mainly women. Sarah is by far the more fascinating character, and I had hoped that her life story would have been far more deeply and extensively told.
0553386794|5.0|For those who expect the \\"American Tolkien\\" to give you a battle of good and evil, go read that one again, this is not your book. What it is is a fantastic \\"True\\" fantasy. In Mr. Martins world there are no clear villains and heroes. Oh yes, you will find the righteous honor of Lord Stark and the undeniable villainy of the House Lannister, but you will see both those sides bend to the other.<br /><br />The world of Westros is cold, especially where it is warmest. The great king Robert won his throne with the help of his childhood friend Lord Eddard Stark, now he needs his help to keep it. The book is littered with unspeakable tragedies and few triumphs. However, this is the first book in the series and guaranteed to get you hooked if nothing else, to see the characters you root for most to get some justice. Characters are deeply developed and continuing to develop as they grow up before your eyes. There are vast houses and names for all, richly described down to the small-clothes. History becomes a big part of the fantasy which makes me think one day Mr. Martin will grace us with a Silmarillion of his own.<br /><br />This book may seem hard to get through at first, and for some it will be. Chapters are long, so much to remember and many things difficult to pronounce (however, HBOs new series of the Same name will help with that). It can be done easily, all you have to do is give yourself to the story. Become Eddard, or Tyrion and you will find yourself among people you've known your whole life. You'll fight there battles, grieve the fallen and weave the spells that will make you believe in this beautiful world.<br /><br />It may not remain your favorite, you might find that in one of the other amazing books offered up to you afterword but you will always remember this one as the start of your journey to save the world of men from the evil monsters-and themselves.<br /><br />5 out of 5...read it now and thank me later.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I read another review claiming the bag worked well for a tall person, so I ordered the bag. I am 6 foot 5 and when I put it on, with the shoulder straps sinched, the bottom of the bag was about 2/3 up my back, the waist strap just under my breast, and the sternum strap close to garroting me even when moved to the lowest position. Overall, it felt like I was wearing my two year old's backpack. On the positive side, the waist strap was long enough so that I could actually close it without a problem.    Because of where the handle is attached I see why other reviewers reported that it ripped off. Not being able to use it as a backpack that could prove to be a significant problem.     The bag itself is fine, with plenty of padding for equipment and extra pockets for the non-fragile items. In general it has a good amount of storage capacity with a nice selection of pockets and adjustable spaces in the padded section.

0553801473|1.0|I won't try to waste your time with a long winded summary that goes nowhere. George Martin does THAT  so well that it's hard to compete.  The last two books in this so called series are such a collection of pointless trash that I've genuinely begun to suspect  Martin of having nothing but scorn for his readers. You can almost hear him dragging himself to the writing desk despite all the other important things he wants to do in his life, like remodel his kitchen!  He's going to make some coin from the HBO series and I think that's all he really cares about at this point.  Well, good for him.  I, for one, am done with this bozo .

B005CWRB44|4.0|Good price. Quick shipment after ordering. Fast delivery. First impressions very good. Slightly disappointed it did not come with battery. Greased the threads to ensure smooth twisting of the control head. Works as described. Throw and spill better than expected; as good as lights much more expensive. Carries easily; small and light. Scraped threads off plastic bottle cap and use it as head and lens cover to avoid scratches. Light comes with extra O-ring and lens. Knurled surfaces on both body and head make it easy to turn on and off. So far, so good. Will buy another Fenix model soon.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|I received my X Grip last week and found it had no female threads on the bottom knob to attatch to a tripod. The manufacturer mistakenly drilled the upper knob for the accessory shoe instead. Opteka recognizes the problem but I have to go thru some red tape and wait for a replacement. They checked their inventory and all in stock were defective in this way. Otherwise I like it.

B00001W9G0|5.0|One of the most beautiful love stories ever told on the big screen, \\"The Way We Were\\" focuses on two people from very different backgrounds, who fall in love despite their differences. Katie and Hubbell (Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford) are as different as two people can be, meeting during the turbulent 1930's. Katie is an outspoken and vocal anti-war proponent, whereas Hubbell is quiet, demure and loves to write. Their love story is told in flashback and evolves over many years.<br /><br /> The film was nominated for 6 Academy Awards including one for Barbra as Best Actress, although she lost that year to Glenda Jackson with many saying this was Streisand's best performance on the silver screen. The movie did mange to win 2 Oscars, one for the beautiful and haunting theme, \\"The Way We Were\\", which became Barbra's first #1 single.<br /><br /> The movie upon its release became a certified box office hit grossing over $50,000,000 on a $15,000,000 budget.<br /><br /> Barbra Streisand told Oprah Winfrey in 2011 that she always felt there should be a sequel to the film because of the way it ended with Katie being pregant with Hubbell's child.
0385534639|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It was listed as a romance but it is so much more.  There are stories intertwined with other stories with a good dose of fantasy built in.  However, the fantasy is believable.  The author has a gift in the way she tells this story of how two people are forced into a \\"contest\\" of magic and how their lives affect so many others.  You can see the sights and smell the caramel.  You feel the thrill of the town's people when they wake up to see the tents on the edge of town that seem to have come out of nowhere.  For people who like the racy romance novels this might not be the book for them.  There are no scenes with graphic lovemaking and the main characters do not completely lose themselves the first second they see one another.  Instead, it is a story of a different kind of circus, a contest and true love.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I was told that Rachel Brice is the forerunner of Tribal Belly Dance and I can see why. She is excellent and her cues are perfect. I would argue however that a lot of the footwork is for those who are either 1) VERY good with dance and 2) have experience in this form of dancing. I am not all that rhythmically inclined which certainly begs the question of why I continue to do these work outs but the fact is they are FUN and they do work. Brice does an excellent job with direction and shows you different angles so that you can see what the body does when you do the move properly. It helps someone like myself who likely looks more like someone having a seizure than sexily dancing about. ;) I found that I was better able to envision the move and do it properly, faster, because of her extra attention to the angles and direction.<br />Brice is definitely one of the best to go with regards to dancing be it to learn from or watch so I give this video 5 stars but it is something that DEFINITELY takes time to master.
B004H3WWU2|4.0|This is a great bag for trips to and from the office. I have to admit, at first glance I thought it was way too small. Even after filling it with my 15\\" MacBook Pro, power cable, phone charger, earbuds, random pens and office supplies, two notebooks, a couple of folders, a baseball cap and a 1,000-page hardback, I was skeptical. But after a couple of days, its design and efficiency of storage really grew on me. It's replaced a Timbuk2 laptop messenger bag that I would routinely fill with extra gear (because I could) and then suffer with during the mile-long hike from parking lot to office. Now I only take what I need, when I need it - and with much more comfort.    I love the wide-mouth main zipper compartment; it ingeniously opens and gives access to all your gear. Multiple compartments inside keep everything organized and secure. Side zips are perfect for cables and accessories. Mesh pockets in the shoulder straps hold my smartphone (snugly), and similar pockets on the side of the bag are great for small items - though they're too small and tight for water bottles.    The minimalist design and interior color accents are the icing on the cake, and separate this from the pack of wannabe bag brands. The top handle is a nice touch for people like me who use this as their primary office bag. The laptop sleeve fits my MacBook perfectly, is well-padded and secure no matter how much junk I'm carrying.    On the downside, it is a commuter bag only. A chest strap would be nice for those days when you've got a full load. Zippers instead of velcro tabs would be better for the interior pockets, and sleeves for pens and pencils would be a good addition.    If you're a Booq fan and need something for weekend trips or overnighters (or a commuter/camera bag), check out the much larger [[ASIN:B004KE0LZG Booq Boa Flow XL, Black-Red Backpack]].
B004XQO90O|4.0|Source Code was fast paced and keep me on the edge of my seat. It's one of those movies you have to pay insanely close attention too. I have always been fasnicated with movies of this genre. Ones that make your brain think and keep you guessing.     This movie defiantly delivered. Jake Gyllenhaal gave a superb performance. This movie is one you need to watch and you will enjoy it. I think it is defiantly one of the most underrated movies of 2011, but it was defiantly in my top five.  Go watch it today!

B004XJHBCE|1.0|Though I consider myself somewhat tech-savvy, I've found this app to be confusing, difficult to use, and very complicated. The app offers zero instructions , and after a month of tinkering I am still as clueless as I was when I first bought the app. It seems like the regular Android OS is capable of doing everything this app does, only in a more simplified manner.  Perhaps this app is useful for those who like to hack their Android and whom understand programming, but for a casual user like myself, the app is useless.

0545259088|4.0|I was left in a love trance after Shiver (and I honestly could have stopped with that book and been happy).  After Linger, my heart ached with anticipation.  After Forever I was left feeling like a person standing in their front yard stunned after a driveby water balloon assult....thinking \\"what the H*** just happened? That was awkward.\\"  ***possible spoilers***  From the very beginning of the book there was this looming depressing saddness just lingering over every line in the book.  I was BEYOND disappointed in the reunion of Sam and Grace.  I expected that to at least be some kind of epic but....nope.  If I were Grace or even Sam and I hadn't seen the one I loved in how many ever months and was worried on a daily basis about their safety and health, I would be turning flips into my lovers arms, smothering them with kisses until my lips were chapped and holding on tight ever so reluctant to let go.  They were kind of...just...uninterested it seemed.  I had to remember back to the other books to remember just how in love they were supposed to be with one another.    Isabel and Cole, I liked a whole lot more in this book.  I wish things would have been more rounded out with their ending but it was the kind of open-ended that seemed ok.  Like it was something I could work with in my own head even though I would have loved some type of epilogue finality to their story.  A lot of people were disappointed with the ending and while, like I just said, I would have liked at least some kind of epilogue to sum it all up and see the happy ending on paper, it wasn't a totally horrible ending.  It did leave things pretty open to the readers imagination to come up with their own ending (which in my opinion should be the authors job) but it was kind of satisfying at the same time.    The best book out of this trilogy was Shiver and I really would have been happy just stopping there but I am glad I read the other 2 books and I would recommend them.  Just have some tissues and be prepared to feel slightly depressed while you read them.

0545265355|5.0|I really don't know how to start this review or what to say because words cannot do this trilogy justice...so i'm going to make this short and sweet.  READ THESE BOOKS!!!!! While there is a love story amongst all those pages its not the major theme of the books but it was enough to keep you longing to know what would happen next if you're a person totally into love stories.  But that wasn't the only thing that would keep me on the edge of my chair.  This was the kind of story that you could totally see happening in the future.  You can completely put yourself in the story and get lost in the \\"what would I do in that situation\\" thoughts.  I HATED when I finished.  I didn't want it to end.  I grew to love every single character (even the bad ones in an odd sort of way) that I hated to say goodbye to them.    These books had me laughing, crying (a lot), staying up WAAAAAY too late reading and reading so fast it felt like my eyes were crossing.  Again, READ THESE BOOKS!!! You will not be disappointed and if you are, well...then...you're just weird. :-)
B005D6442G|5.0|My husband and I became Dexter fans less than a year ago and sped through the first four seasons. You could say it's our guilty pleasure. The end of season four was the most disturbing and thought-provoking event of the series and I couldn't wait to find out how Dexter would go on afterwards. Season Five is off to a great start- keeping you staring into the soul (yes, believe it or not) soul of a serial killer. The season premiere reminds me- like all the other Dexter episodes, that good TV is about great characters (believable or not), funny moments mixed in with the tragedy, and ultimately, a search for justice in a crazy world.

B004132HZS|5.0|It was a little difficult to accept this new guy as Sherlock at first since I'm a Jeremy Brett-as-Sherlock-Fan, but after watching it the second time--all I can say is, I can hardly wait for Season 2.  I love the updating to the current times--it's easier to relate to.  The onscreen texting is a great idea because you can observe the players faces as they react to the data.  I'll always love the Brett-Sherlock, but this one's a close second.
0793518326|4.0|When you receive this book, you can feel something like: ``Whoah, that's a real big one''. It is more than one thousand pages, with that kind of thin paper, they same that is used for bibles.<br /><br />As said, and as other people have remarked in their posts, the scores are just about perfect(at least I have noticed no flaw in those that I have checked deeply). Everything that is played on the Beatles's albums appears there (voice&lyrics, guitars, bass, drums, and the rest of instruments that sometimes take part in the playing).<br /><br />There is just one thing that I find not positive: The size of the scores, the characters are really small, the pentagrams, everything. So, this is not a book to study in the bus or the metro, you need to sit and have a good light if you want to care of your vision.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|This controller would've been better than the official one if it weren't for the analog sticks dead zones and the fact that in some games (most of what I played) don't respond correctly to them. For example in \\"The Elder Scroll's IV: Oblivion\\" I can't walk left because the stick doesn't respond when I move left and in most games, although I'm able to move when I push the stick front, it fails to respond when I slightly turn the stick to one of the sides.    I strongly recommend you don't buy this controller. The fact that it's almost as expensive as the official one makes me feel robbed.
B0058A11AK|1.0|Barbra's albums are all starting to sound the same. Actually, this has been happening now for a decade.  This one is no different. It follows in the footsteps of Love is the Answer and The Movie Album. What makes this one a little more painful to listen too is that it focuses on the works of Marilyn and Alan Bergman. With the exception of \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\", Barbra has already recorded the best of the Bergman's work. This album is therefore unnecessary. Furthermore, by restricting herself to these lyricists (who have not produced an iota of decent material in decades), she is left with an album that is subpar and has that \\"scraping the barrel feel\\".  Speaking of scraping... Years ago, her singing would have overcome the music and made the recording vocally mesmerizing. As evident in this album, which reeks of auto tune and other voice enhancing software, she is limited to about an octave where she sounds somewhat decent. If she goes higher than that, she struggles.  In general, her vibrato sounds more like a tremble than the operatic trills she once had. Without the voice that made anything sound good, she needs to rely more on the material she sings. That is where this album fails. Bad material, bad outcome. I really don't think she would have made this album if the Bergmans were not her personal friends. Hopefully, if she records again, she will use better material. BTW, there are only 10 songs on this album. Either she was too tired to do more, or she realized she had indeed scraped the very bottom of this very dry barrel. Back to The Windmills of Your Mind... This is the one song that works. It is arguably the Bergman's greatest song. So good it would sound good no matter who sang it. Here, Barbra adds a haunting intro. More haunting because I can't hear any breathing. The vocal just pops out of nowhere. It's as if a corpse were singing.
B000002UTY|5.0|Quicksilver Messanger Service Live \\"Happy Trails\\"; along with thier debut album,is the finest example of the so called west coast \\"Acid-Rock\\" available.

B0019MQBJW|4.0|This ballet was made available in three different video formats; DVD, HD-DVD, and BluRay. My version was the HD-DVD version, but in all formats, the ballet is the same. First of all Nureyev is not dancing in this ballet. I think the Ad is somewhat deceiving. The principle dancers are Agnes Letestu and Jose Martinez. They are excellent dancers, and as you will see from the extreme close-ups of the principles, they both \\"sweat blood\\" in their efforts to entertain us.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give this production a five star rating is because I did not like the ending. You may call me old-fashioned, but I want to see good triumph over evil, which does not happen in this story. Swan Lake is a story ballet, and is NOT just dancing to beautiful music. This is the second ballet in my considerable collection in which Nureyev came up with a terrible ending. In The Vienna State Opera Ballet..... [[ASIN:B0007P0LPC Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake]].....production with Dame Margot Fonteyn, he had Siegfried drown in the Lake of Tears as Odette swims away to remain a Swan-Maiden for all eternity. Plus, he had on more make-up than Margot Fonteyn. In this version, he has Rothbart flying off with the Swan-Maiden clutched in his talons as Siegfried writhes on the ground unable to help her. Again, she must remain a Swan-Maiden for all eternity. I HATE that, period.<br /><br />NOTE: I must make a correction here, because I misunderstood an important aspect of the meaning of this version of SWAN LAKE. This entire ballet is a dream by Prince Siegfried from beginning to end. The poor Swan Maidens are NOT doomed, because they never existed except in Siegfried's dream. This was brought to my attention by Mr. Robert Campbell for which I am grateful.<br /><br />This is an HD-DVD (also available in std def and Blu-Ray) and will NOT play on anything but an HD-DVD player. It has excellent resolution in HD. I wonder though, why the video producer thought we needed 12 to 14 close-ups of the ballerinas hands, and their feet? Letestu and her partner are wonderful dancers, though, I thought she lacked the sad expression Odette needs as the trapped Swan-Maiden. I thought at times her expression was rather bored. She was very good as Odile, and Siegfried warmed up to her portrayal of \\"Odette in disguise\\" gradually, and did not act like he knew her when she first appeared. Letestu gives a good account of herself in her mime role, both in the second and fourth acts. Color and lighting are well done in all four acts and the excellent music is stereo and surround. The running time to end of curtain calls is 140 minutes, and the screen format is 16:9<br /><br />The dark psychology thing of Rothbart being in all four acts hovering on every move of Siegfried was way overdone, in my opinion. Why do people think they need to psychoanalyze Tchaikovsky's mind forever? I think that is what Nureyev is trying to do here, using the freakish spectre of Rothbart haunting Siegfried's every thought.<br /><br />The corps members of the POB were superb, but messed up by an overzealous button pushing production manager. Why have a beautiful weaving line of ballerinas and then ruin the effect by shooting close-ups of them? That sort of thing was done all through this ballet. It's good that the theater patrons did not have to see all of the close-ups. The button pushers think they are being artistic, but they know nothing about the art of the ballet. The artistic director of the ballet company should put a stop to their enthusiasm. I spent thirteen years in a TV studio, so I know a little of what I speak.eir feet?

0671027344|5.0|I first found this book in the fall of 2001, I was fourteen. Maybe the content was a bit much for my age but my parents didn't question it because they've always cheered on my love for books. In my opinion, I was at the PERFECT age to read it.<br /><br />The story is about a boy named Charlie as he write letters to an anonymous \\"friend\\" that you never learn the identity of. This doesn't matter though and enhances the story. You feel as though Charlie is writing these letter to you personally. It's beautifully done. Charlie is not your average teenager, his feelings of alienation and awkwardness are not so strange to someone his age but Charlie himself is one of a kind. Charlie is innocent, sweet, shy and also beyond the moon genius. He's incredibly smart, book smart though. That's where the problem sometimes lies. He isn't very street smart but he gets lessons in that subject from the beautiful and automatically likable Sam and the friendly and inspiring Patrick. They, plus a few other great characters, introduce Charlie to everything from amazing '90 rock like Nirvana, the Smith and Smashing Pumpkins, to the Rocky Horror Picture Show and open his eyes to things like sex and drugs which sounds more scandalous that it really is. With the help of one of those \\"everyone should have a teacher like this\\" teacher that takes an interest in Charlie's growing intellect and vast understanding of things most kids that age don't understand or care about. He calls this teacher, the advanced English teacher, Bill. Bill starts giving Charlie books on the side to read since he reads way faster than his classmates (even though it's an advanced class). Charlie likes the read every book twice so you get the idea about how genius he is. His ideas about the books, the experiences he's having and the girl he begins to fall in love with are page turning to say the least. Charlie learns a lot about himself, more than he thought he'd ever want to know. This book is great for all ages and I'd recommend it to anyway that wants to read a thought provoking novel that they can relate to and that will move them. I've reread this one several times and after writing this review... I'm going to reread it again now.<br /><br />PS: I suggest you read it BEFORE the movie comes out in the next few years!end it to anyway that wants to read a thought provoking novel that they can relate to and that will move them.

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|I've been a Jane Eyre fan since I was 11 years old! In addition to having read the book multiple, multiple times, I own 5 different film versions of Jane Eyre. I pre-ordered this latest version, hoping to relive the romance and mystery of this exquisite novel by Bronte. I was in shock when the film ended! Only the version made with Orson Wells where he plays Edward Rochester could be considered as being the worst. This is a close second! I guess, both, the director and screenwriter were just trying to make a quick buck. The mystery was a muddled mess, the romance was stilted, important clue elements were left out of the script...Terrible,terrible. Be happy I gave it a star!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't feel I need to say very much about this book, because its popularity is growing rapidly, the movie is almost done filming, and it seems \\"everyone\\" is talking about it. I just wanted to weigh in with my own 5 stars and add to the chorus of, \\"READ IT!!\\" Seriously, read it.
B003NX76BM|5.0|the characters were original and portrayed in depth.  i loved that each dog had thier own personality and were very characteristically labs in every way.  i loved the charatcer of Simon the most because he was so irritated that he fell in love.

B005GHN2GG|5.0|I rarely read fantasy romance, but I read a review that talked about the hero, Silhara, the Master of Crows, and he sounded like my kind of hero so I decided to purchase the book. I'm so glad I did so. I loved it, which really surprised me because I'm not usually that wild about books set in the vaguely medieval type world that straight fantasy is usually set in.     Silhara is a strong mage who lives in exile from the Cabal of Mages because they fear him and his magic. However, the god Corruption has gotten loose from his prison and is trying to take over the world and Silhara is the only one who has a chance of stopping him. The Cabal decides to place one of their servants, Martise, in Silhara's home as a spy in order to destroy Silhara, not realizing that he is the only one who can defeat the god. Ultimately, of course, Martise and Silhara fall in love and figure out that they must work together to defeat the god.     Silhara is a wonderful anti-hero type. Strong, sarcastic, and willing to use whatever means he can to overcome the Cabal, initially he has no hesitation about using Martise even as she is trying to spy on him. Yet in spite of that, it's clear that he has an inner core of integrity that can be shaken, but not broken. Martise has tested positive for power, but no one has been able to unlock it. Silhara throws all kinds of various difficult tests at her trying to unlock her power, while at the same time completely suspicious of her motives. Martise is a wonderful character. She is plain, calm, and quiet and takes everything he throws at her while still maintaining her dignity. She has lived a hard life and she is determined to not let him break her. Eventually, her goodness just wears him down. I loved reading about the two of them slowly come to trust each other and bring out each other's strengths. This was the very best kind of romance, with two sympathetic characters who come to depend on each other and then have to make the hard choices in order to save their world. I can't wait to read more stories from Grace Draven, whatever genre they are in.
B0058A11AK|5.0|Every track on this album is beautiful.  Barbra still sings so beautifully at age 69, by the end of the last song I was moved to tears.  This album far outshines her last one.  It's a treasure, her best since '93's Back to Broadway.  Breathtaking melodies and lyrics and vocals.  What Matters Most is, Barbra is still Barbra.
B004UHF51S|5.0|Just putting my \\"two cents\\" in...<br /><br />Michael Franks has consistently given us quality work over the last 30 some-odd (where did the time go?) years.  This CD keeps that consistency going.<br /><br />Great job, Mr. Franks!<br /><br />P.S., Yes, I do agree - this man has more talent in his little finger than nearly all of the artist's out there combined! (With this electronic age, that's not much of a stretch)  Yet, he doesn't get much \\"hype\\" or \\"pub (as in publicity)\\" through anyone that I can see (except my fellow Amazoners)!<br /><br />P.P.S., My fellow Amazoners, spread the word that Michael Franks is back (again) with new material that is worth a listen!<br /><br />I rate Michael Franks' \\"Time Together\\"...Five stars!!
1934030597|2.0|It's a thick book but yet I find it lacking in many procedures, seems like about 50% (or more) of the time I have an issue I can't find it and end up going online. I have a pretty good grip on basic maintenance so I use this as a reference manual and it just doesn't deliver, I would try the Parks book before this one.
074356619X|5.0|This is a worthwhile CD! Very impressed with the quality of the information and the presentation is superb. Good stuff!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this season! Amy and Bernadette made it so much nicer. I love the character of Amy and how she and Sheldon interact. I know a lot of people are upset Sheldon has a friend girl and that her character is evolving. I think it's perfect and realistic. She is able to help him assimilate in the real world since she always has a logical explanation for the new behavior. If Amy left the show, I would be devastated. However, I think this season is focused a little too much on sex. Every other line is a reference to masturbation or sex, etc. It's funny, but it's a bit too much. It's sometimes uncomfortable to watch because of all the sex.
B0000025IE|5.0|I'm not a diehard Judas Priest fan, or even a metal fanatic. But this album, in its own way, defined heavy metal as a stand-alone music form.  There were many metal songs and even whole metal albums before this one, performed by some amazingly talented and renowned artist, like Zep or Sabbath. But this album really established in a lot of peoples minds that heavy metal could be worth its own genre, a marketable self-sustaining artistic expression and a significant artistic vein all by itself.  It's a great album.
B001PO53IO|5.0|There is more humor in this series than traditional star wars, and of course this series is animated.  But do not let either deter you. This is a must see for any star wars fan.<br />In the spirit of things, it more closely relates to the first trilogy than the second (because that is when it takes place).<br /><br />As others have said, the picture on the blu ray is near reference quality.  The packaging is so excellent that I can't imagine anyone not displaying this out in the open.  In fact this is my favorite set i own now next to Pacific/ Band of Brothers metal box sets.

0062112430|1.0|Delirium by Lauren Oliver  Rating: 1 out of 5 Stars  Grade: D-  I almost feel bad giving this book a one star review. I know so many people who've adored this book, but unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me.  I love dystopian novels. I've read all of the popular dystopian YA, and many of the unknown or less popular ones. This was not my favorite, I was unable to finish this book no matter how many times I tried.   In this book, a girl named Lena is nearing the age where she will be cured of deliria, or love. Right before her procedure(which is basically a lobotomy) surprise, surprise, she falls in love.   I couldn't identify with Lena. I felt no sympathy, no connection with her. As female characters go, she didn't seem to have a distinguishing personality trait- strength, kindness, intelligence... She just struck me as sort of blah-ish.  I have no problem with most slow novels, but as another reviewer noted, nothing really happened until about the ninetieth page. This novel took slow to a new level. It would be fine if the writing was really beautiful and striking, like many other reviewers said it was, but the writing wasn't spectacular. It was good, but not great. I personally think that Lauren DeStefano and Laura Resau are much better, more lyrical and poetic writers. This book just seemed sort of meandering, causing me to stop reading.  Finally, my biggest problem with the book is that IT IS NOT REALLY A DYSTOPIAN. Dystopians show probable future societies, and showcase issues in society that could become larger problems if we don't fix them. They also need to have a logical plot. There is no plausible reason the government would want to remove something as amazing as love from society. I mean, really. It seemed more like a convenient plot point for the author, as it caused more problems then solutions in the society. Even Matched and the Maximum Ride Series made more sense then this. Why, with their outlandish plot lines, would they make more sense? Because the motves of the government, or the villians, were explained. The author says that she didn't know that dystopian was a category, which is okay, but then its not really fair to classify it as being a dystopian if it was not intended to be one.
B004G600A4|5.0|I love this movie! It was so cute! As an adult I found this movie entertaining. I am a Mandy Moore fan. She did a great job and has a great singing voice. It is a disney classic with singing, romance and humor. Great story spin off of Rapunzel.
0439023513|1.0|As with everyone else who has written a review for this book, I was waiting with eager anticipation for the final installment. Then \\"Mockingjay\\" was finally released! I read it in one day, but not because it was so good, but because it was so bad I couldn't believe what I was reading from one page to the next; the story and writing just got worse and worse until the rushed mess at the end. I kept turning page after page hoping against hope that the story would suddenly change for the better, that perhaps even all that had been written so far in the book had been a dream sequence. By the time I reached halfway through the book, though, I knew it was doomed, and I felt so sorry for the author. I knew, as a writer, she had to hate her own book. She must have felt tremendous pressure from the publisher, yet she must have had writer's block. I wouldn't be surprised if \\"Mockingjay\\" was written in the last week before publishing began. \\"Just get something down on paper!\\" I can imagine Collins saying to herself while beating her head with her fist. I have to believe that because even if she meant it to be an anti-war statement, it was poorly written and so obviously rushed, and we all know Collins is a much better writer than this.    Poor Collins; if only she had asked her readers for help. We all knew what the final story would involve--the story she so quickly glossed over with a mere paragraph or two in \\"Mockingjay\\":    ---Spoiler---    the daringly executed plan to retrieve Peeta from the hands of the Capitol and its evil ruler!     The story would expose the role of District 13 throughout history. It would involve the internal struggle going on inside Gale: should he help save Peeta because it might win the love of Katniss, or should he not help and allow Peeta to die and thus eliminate the competitor for Katniss' love? It would involve the internal struggle within Katniss. Katniss will finally have to choose between the two: does she risk her life to save Peeta? Doesshe really love him that much? Would she even want to reveal to everyone else the depths of her love for him by volunteering to save him? Should she just stay with Gale, instead? If she decides to go after Peeta, could she even ask Gale to help the one he despises so much?     The story would involve intrigues with sympathizers within the Capitol and traitors outside. It would tears us readers apart as Katniss is torn apart by her competing love for Peeta, Gale and her family and the desires of the leaders of the revolution for her leadership and symbolism. It would involve a plan to save Peeta, a counter-plan by the President to thwart it and kidnap Katniss, and the counter-counter plan of the revolutionaries to use it all for the cause of freedom. In short, it will be the hunger games all over again, only this time the players are all the major personalities in the story including the Capitol and the revolutionaries, and the playing field is the entire empire, and the prize is freedom or slavery for everyone!    That is the book we all were waiting for. What we got . . . well, let's just pretend it didn't happen, and we'll keep on playing the alternate story over and over in our dreams! The only question I have is: who wins?
B003L77GGK|3.0|Being a huge fan of Supernatural, I was really expecting a lot from season 6. But honestly, it was somewhat of a let down. Yeah, Kripke stepped down and his 5 season story arc ended, but I still thought that the writers would be able to come up with a more interesting--or at least consistent--story line. Besides some very good episodes towards the second half of the season, the season as whole was sporadic and repetitive. Some characters and items that were introduced as important just faded into the background or were just easily dealt with. Other than that and the sudden twist near the end, it was typical Sam/Dean mistrust and complications all weaved under the general theme of \\"souls.\\" Nonetheless, I am looking forward to season 7 and hope that some of the old scary Supernatural feel returns instead of continuing on with this drama-filled and mundane trek it's gone on.
0439023521|5.0|There are some books that change your life after reading them. This is one of them. From the time I started reading the book, I was engrossed so deeply into the lives of its characters that now, after finishing it, I feel as though I know everything about them, and want to be a part of their lives. Collins holds the same caliber as J.K. Rowling, and I would not be surprised if this series became the next Hollywood franchise like the Harry Potter series. It is that phenomenal. It is literally impossible to put down; I finished the book in roughly four hours. The reader can feel the intensity and savagery of the games, the conflict of the characters, and the hatred upon the Capital that makes all the games necessary. Literally transported into another world, I am now itching to continue the series and reenter the world of Panem, almost preferring it to that of the present. A MUST READ FOR TEENS AND ADULTS ALIKE.
B004LROMSY|1.0|I'm not certain where the writers found their source or inspiration (I use this term in its loosest sense); certainly not from Malory's \\"Morte d'Arthur\\" (ASIN: B0031MA3PQ) or Geoffrey of Monmouth's \\"History of the King of Britain,\\" (ISBN-10: 1843834413), not the \\"Mabinogion\\" (ISBN-10: 0199218781), nor any of the classic 12th C. lais that embellished the Arthurian world.  This insipid, horribly written, atrociously acted slap in the face of  Arthurian legend began on a promising note with it's attention to the gritty world of 5th and 6th century Britain.  But as each episode progressed, it became sillier and sillier, mired in it's inability to extract an Arthur that compels our attention or a cohesive story line.  Much as been said of Eva Green's performance, but it is so over the top it renders her role as Morgan almost laughable. She and Joseph Fiennes are wasted in this production, and it is not their fault: they were forced to speak what the writers put in their mouths.<br /><br />All in all, this is a series to be avoided at all costs.  To spend a dime on a DVD that presents such drivel, is money ill-spent.  It ranks right down there with \\"First Knight\\".  Try Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\" (ASIN: B000Q66JXA) instead.  For all its quirkiness, it at least tries to take the high ground and pays some attention to the source material.

0345529057|4.0|I'm not a big fan of this genre but once in awhile something comes along that just grabs you and Game of Thrones is one of those. The show is engaging, well casted, great scenery and magnificent writing. The fact that the creator, George R.R. Martin is involved is also a plus because his vision gets to be kept which is always good because most of the time you have producers not involving the creator and they mess with it but here not only are they keeping with the vision but martin himself is a producer and writer of some episodes. This made me buy the 4 book set because I wanted to see the story in full meaning I wanted to know about everything that couldn't be filmed or written and usually the book goes more into detail and depth. I enjoyed the first season very much more then I thought I would and I'm looking forward to reading the books.<br /><br />P.S. The first season was taken from Book 1. Season 2 will be from Book 2.. This idea is an intresting one and here's hoping it works to be a good one.

B004DTLK8A|3.0|Finnish power metallers Stratovarius launched into early 2011 with new album \\"Elysium\\" which in my humble opinion has pretty impressive cover artwork, a quality CD booklet and a nice picture of that star shaped space-ship thingy on the disc itself. :-) But how does the album itself fare?<br /><br />I purchased this album not long after its release and have delayed reviewing it because initially it didn't really do much for me and I wanted to give it fair playing time to see if it grew on me.  Whilst it has a bit and isn't a bad album by any means, sad to say that I still find it somewhat disappointing.  After the parting of ways with founder/guitarist Timo Tolkki, the band got back to a sound more in line with their earlier albums with \\"Polaris\\" in 2009, which although not an outstanding or brilliant album, did have some quite good songs on it.  I was expecting them to go one step better with \\"Elysium\\" but they haven't.  Elysium sees the band returning with the same general sound they had with Polaris, and I can't fault the sound at all, but they have been a bit more ambitious this time around with the songs themselves, and it is the songs that let it down a bit for me.<br />The songs aren't really bad mind you, it's just that they really aren't that great either and generally don't really grab me.  The best songs in my opinion are the opener \\"Darkest Hours\\", \\"Lifetime In A Moment\\", \\"Move The Mountain\\", and \\"Fairness Justified\\", the latter three being slower paced songs.  The others (bar the title track) are much faster in pace, but they don't really offer much that we haven't heard a zillion times before.<br /><br />Then there's the title track to close the album.  Man... what an ambitious piece of song writing this is and full credit to Stratovarius for having the balls to try something like this, but for my mind it doesn't work.  Again like the album generally I can't fault the singing, musicianship or production and there are some fabulous arrangements in the song.  But overall it really has nothing about it that is really captivating enough to carry the song for just over eighteen minutes!  And that's my problem with the album over all.  Certainly they're a great band and it's a quality recording, but it just lacks that \\"something\\" to really grab me and make me want to keep playing it.really has nothing about it that is really captivating enough to carry the song for just over eighteen minutes!

B005HEXQN2|5.0|Note: I am a big Voyager fan so there will be that bias, but I am not only a Star Trek fan but one of its biggest critics.<br />  Endgame combines a lot of plot elements. Time travel, alternate time lines, and lots of Borg action. These elements are combined very skillfully, which sometimes doesn't happen in other episodes of Voyager or other Star Trek series. So this makes for a stunningly well done end to the series.<br />  As Endgame opens, we see scenes of the Voyager crew at home on Earth after their multi-decade journey. It's quite an emotional jolt for the Voyager viewer. And I won't spoil the plot, but key Voyager characters are deceased. Another Voyager crew member has a serious incurable mental heath disorder. But the older, grey, Janeway has an idea. Again  no spoilers here, but it's an idea that will make some changes. From there, things get wild and there will be things that will stick with you for a long time.<br />  To sum up- the plot, the action, are all integrated in an tight ball of rockin' enjoyment.
B001HNE3NO|2.0|While the story line had great potential, I could not get past the author's simple, childish style of writing.

0440178002|5.0|I saw the mini-series in 1980, and did not read the book until 5 years later. Wow. What a book. Most other reviewers have covered the bases, but it is truly a masterpiece of historical fiction. I have enjoyed the novels of James Mitchner very much, but Clavell's works are much more griping and compelling. He's closer to Tom Clancy than Mitchner.    An interesting factual note is that Blackthorne is modeled on the real life adventures of William Adams - an English sea-going man who came to Japan and ultimately became the confidante of the Shogun. His influence in Japan was significant, and he was given a wife and much property. His posterity had waned almost completely (in both England and Japan,) until Clavell rediscovered him and based his work on his story. (I was very surprised when I discovered this.) [...]    Bottom line: I think you will enjoy reading this book very much. It is timeless and will always be enjoyable to read. Pick up a copy and carve out a week or so to read it. It will very much impress itself deeply on your soul.
1564148793|4.0|This is a good book to get running with. Nice methods, but with the uses mainly Hekate and other spirits (out of his own dreams and visions that no one else have ever heard of) of own strictly personal experience (not very well rounded). I do recommend this book if can get it on a sale, techniques can be used and altered to suit personal path.
0061537969|5.0|This is a SAD story--however when told from the POV of the dog, it makes it a little less weighty of a topic. A must-read for any dog lover that seriously has me questioning whether my bulldog can understand what I say. Loved this book!
B000JIHP88|5.0|I chose this mobile to go with frog themed nursery. I love the sounds that it has with it.  The nature sound is my sons favorite sound to sleep to.  It is on the quite side and you cannot hear the motors at all.<br /> I've had it running for a week and love it. The remote works great also so you don't have to walk beside the crib and risk waking the baby.<br />You might need some help putting it together it's not hard to assemble but it's easier to have help.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I have yet to see the film in its entirety (saw the Arena scene) but Daft Punk makes mind blowing music. That one segment of the movie totally blew me away musically and I had to have the soundtrack before anything else. I bought mine from iTunes so I got the 2 extra tracks and I have played this album looped over and over for days. Only problem is, I wish it were longer. Some of the tracks could easily be extended and as much as I enjoy the R3C0NF1GUR3D album, it's not a true remix of all the tracks.     I love the classical/electronic combinations and DP delivers a truly genius mix here. Considering that this is Disney (yuck), I am pleasantly surprised that it's this good. The credit I believe is owing to DP and their penchant for having a tight creative control over their sound. Disney is notorious for being master control freaks, so one wonders how much was actually given/taken in this partnership. Aside from that, I love how this work feels timeless. It seems to incorporate a feel from the first movie (which I have seen) as well as something that feels \\"today\\". The beauty of it all is that in 20 years, it will still be an excellent album to listen to...I only wish that there were more albums like this...like maybe they could write a soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist. The musical landscape is stunning.
0061997811|4.0|I'm a huge Potter fan, so I feel weird giving four stars to a product so many other fans love, but I have a few issues with this book.    Overall, it's beautifully done, with striking attention to detail, design-wise.  The pages are all chock full of photos and sketches and little blurbs about everything.  There are fold out pages with even more information, and reproductions of props like Harry's Hogwarts letter and the Yule Ball programme.  Other reviews have described all of these things already, but they're awesome enough to be worth mentioning again.    Still, I have my nitpicks.  Number one: there are several typos.  At one point, \\"Sorcerer's\\" is spelled \\"Sorceror's\\" and \\"Lockhart\\" is spelled \\"Lockheart.\\"  I'm used to seeing those sorts of typos on the internet, but in a professional book, it's unacceptable.  Number two: some of the the props (including all of Umbridge's educational decrees) appear to have been caught in the glue of the envelopes they're stored in.  I can't get them out of the envelopes without cutting them up, because they've been glued in there, and that's not something I want to do, of course.  Pretty disappointing.    The other thing is, a lot of this information is not new.  If you're a fan who watches/reads lots of \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff, especially the documentaries on the Ultimate Editions, you'll have seen a quite  few of these interviews before.  Also, since it was made before Deathly Hallows Part II came out, it's not really complete, either.  I guess you can blame me for buying this before DH2 came out, though.    I don't regret buying it or anything (it is indeed a pretty cool book!), but I wish it were a little bit more than it is.  I'm really looking forward to Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey, which comes out in October, and looks like it'll be even better.

B0058A119G|5.0|In an interview with Bill Whitaker, fans were treated to one of those banal interview questions, \\"You never vocalize, you don't walk around singing?\\" No, the interminable and ever fascinating Barbra Streisand doesn't do scales. Okay sure, she'll vocalize when in the car heading to the studio, but that's it. \\"No. I never sing in the shower either. It's like a gift that I can't even explain to you. When I love the music that I'm singing, it's just there for me. I'm very lucky,\\" says Streisand. She is lucky, and so are we - the listener.<br /><br />What Matters Most is classic, quintessential Barbra Streisand. An album that should have a place of honor next to: The Barbra Streisand Album, Funny Girl, A Christmas Album, The Way We Were, Guilty, The Broadway Album and Love is the Answer - just several albums that deserve repeated, faithful and loving play after play.<br /><br />Streisand sounds fantastic on her new album, is she really 69? Is it possible to the voice that gave us \\"People\\" and \\"My Man\\" \\"The Way We Were\\" and \\"A Piece of Sky\\" is close to entering it's seventh decade. What ever her age, Barbra Streisand never ceases to impress. The production, the quality, are all top notch. The source material - the lyrics of Alan and Marilyn Bergman, fit like a glove.<br /><br />Naysayers will bemoan the arrangements, citing that they're lush and prosaic. Nothing could be further from the truth. The orchestral treatments are sublime, and perfectly match the music and lyrics. In this new release, Streisand takes us into uncharted emotional and physical territory. Playful on \\"Nice 'n' Easy,\\" downright sexy on \\"Solitary Moon\\" but soaring and powerful on \\"The Same Hello, The Same Goodbye.\\" \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\" and \\"What Matters Most\\" tug at the heartstrings. Ever the \\"actress who sings,\\" Streisand still posesses amazing interpretive skills.<br /><br />\\"What Matter Most\\" is old school Barbra Streisand.<br /><br />She can still sing.. and that's what matters most.

B0058A119G|5.0|Closing in on seventy, the amazingly durable Barbra Streisand continues to impress with a feast of riches in this accomplished 2011 recording that may smack of MOR adult contemporary to some but to these ears, sounds like a master vocalist still at the top of her game. Her interpretative skills remain undiminished, and her tone has become even richer and more burnished since 2009's watershed collaboration with Diana Krall, [[ASIN:B002RJNFB8 Love Is the Answer]]. Streisand lost her high notes a long time ago, but her youthful ardor has since been replaced by a confident knowingness that makes her current, sometimes throaty expressiveness all the more resonant. For a performer who claims never to do anything to prepare her voice for recording, this legendary perfectionist does not allow herself to slip into self-parody like many of her cash-driven contemporaries and predecessors. Here she focuses her energies on a tribute to her frequent collaborators, the renowned lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman.<br /><br />Having already sung over fifty of their songs, Streisand could have simply compiled her previous recordings. Instead, she provides a refreshing and assured take on her friends' musicianship with material both familiar and unknown. The disc begins with a knockout version of Michel Legrand's classic \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" (from the original 1968 version of [[ASIN:0792840461 The Thomas Crown Affair]]), which Streisand dares to open a cappella, committing herself to the psychedelic lyrics with such dramatic precision that its haunting message of obsession becomes concurrently unsettling and soothing. A hidden gem, \\"Something New in My Life\\" is a straight-ahead ballad with the unmistakable Legrand touch informing the waves of hazy romanticism that infuse the Bergman's unapologetically dramatic lyrics. Excised from 1990's [[ASIN:B00005R5GM The Russia House]] (though on the original soundtrack recording), Jerry Goldsmith's \\"Alone in the World\\" is a lush quiet-storm ballad that builds off Chris Botti's melancholy trumpet accompaniment.<br /><br />Previously recorded by Sergio Mendes and Brasil 66, \\"So Many Stars\\" has a gentle bossa-nova sway that the singer maneuvers with great dexterity, even contributing some effortless Portuguese in the bridge. In the same vein, \\"Solitary Moon\\" has a nice mid-tempo rhythm that evokes the moodiness of an Edward Hopper painting. Written for Frank Sinatra late in his career (although never recorded by him), \\"The Same Hello, the Same Goodbye\\" was composed by John Williams (best known for his memorable work on [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars]] and most of Spielberg's films). In Streisand's version, the song has a Sondheim-like sense of drama with a swooning chorus that benefits from her innate theatricality. Sinatra's spirit is even more present in Patrick Williams' arrangement of the 1960 jazz standard, \\"Nice `n' Easy\\", which Streisand slows to a relaxing tempo that showcases an extended swing passage that feels like a complete throwback to when Ol' Blue Eyes first recorded it. She does similar magic with Fred Astaire's \\"That Face\\", which was first introduced in one of his groundbreaking TV specials from the late fifties. Here she is downright playful and flirtatious without sacrificing the melodic line in Williams' high-spirited arrangement.<br /><br />The saving grace of a soapy piece of cinematic drivel called [[ASIN:630277943X The Promise]] was its poignant theme song, \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\", most familiar from Melissa Manchester's original 1979 version which Streisand varies very little in her languid treatment. That she can express such unbridled longing so fluidly is a testament to her enduring interpretative skills. Written with Dave Grusin, the title track is an appropriately tender closer with its halting melody and reflective lyrics. The deluxe edition contains a second disc with ten previously recorded songs. Several are part of her standard repertoire, but there are little-heard gems included like 1974's \\"Pieces of Dreams\\" and 1999's \\"The Island\\". Her earliest recording here, 1971's \\"The Summer Knows\\", gives clear evidence that Streisand has diminished little in her artistry across four decades, a startling feat when one realizes how music trends have changed so dramatically in the meantime. As she enters an astonishing sixth decade of performing, she simply proves that quality wins out every time.\\"Pieces of Dreams\\" and 1999's \\"The Island\\".

B0036S4CTS|4.0|This review contains spoilers!       I was cheering for these two characters throughout the entire book. At times, their quirky relationship reminded me of my own best guy friend. I loved the premise of the book, showing how their lives changed year-to-year. However, I was disappointed on a few things: first being Dexter's downright un-likability throughout, Emma's constant self-loathing and need for approval, and especially its ending: (what seemed to me) Emma's pointless death. After that point, it was difficult for me to continue reading it, let alone finish it. Still, I give it 4 stars because I thought the premise was brilliant, and the way it was written made it a great read.
B0024CEY36|4.0|Having many plot parallels with his \\"Eye of the Needle\\", this Follett novel which takes place in the pre WWI era, nevertheless stands very well on its own as both, a window into early 20th century upper class British society, and a top-notch political thriller. To the usual Follett mix of lies, deceit, betrayal, murder and adultery, a heaping dose of pre-Revolution Russian anarchism is added, which gives it a flavor all its own
B001HNE3NO|3.0|I liked this book. I loved how the two stories were intertwined, and how the chapters alternated back and forth between 1942 and 2002. However, I found the character of Julia incredibly irritating at times, especially towards the end. She was downright unlikable by the final few chapters. Overall though, the book was well-written and a relatively easy read.

B005CAPS0K|4.0|I let this movie linger to bleed off all the hype that was attached to this film. If you let yourself just go with the story you will be drawn in, and never let the hype speak for itself.<br /><br />I found this movie to be a good cross style movie from a great classic ghost story like Poltergeist and the newer hit movie Paranormal Activity. Insidious turns from a suspenseful ghost story to something of an adventure through another realm. I've heard so many mixed reviews on this movie I had to wait til the hype died down. After that I found this movie very enjoyable! It should be a must own for any horror / ghost story collector.
0553801473|2.0|Not a review (plenty of good ones already), just a quick reflection.<br />In my opinion, I believe it would be better, instead of taking 5 years to write a book, to spend 4 of those years studying other authors and getting acquainted with the process of editing as shown in recent works of fantasy like 'American Gods' or other novels of that calibre.<br />I have always found the label \\"American Tolkien\\" really misplaced. Now, it seems quite offensive...
0062060554|3.0|Christine has amnesia; she can recall only as much information as she stores prior to sleeping every night. When she wakes up, her brain has expunged it again and she must begin anew. Her husband, Ben, ever tolerant and nurturing, seems only to want to help. But a phone call to Christine by a man she can't remember, alerts her to the existence of a journal -- and inside its covers, the story of Christine's life begins to unfold.<br /><br />On the one hand, the mystery of exactly what happened to Christine was well-written and intriguing as it developed; on the other, I found it somewhat predictable and implausible, and that made it hard to invest in. There were some things that didn't make sense by the end (I won't give them away here), and too many plot holes to convince me that Christine's story could have happened the way the author described. By the time it ended, I was left feeling unsatisfied and wondering a bit why I'd bothered wasting my time.<br /><br />I'd suggest borrowing this one, as opposed to buying it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Just finished George R.R. Martin's Dance with Dragons  - which is far more like going in circles with everybody except a dragon - including a plethora of absolutely useless secondary, tertiary etc etc etc characters.  This book contains more wandering, dithering and second guessing than dancing. There is also a great deal of standing about doing nothing.  Great characters are wasted - Dany is adrift and Tyrion is made a mockery of - and some not mentioned at all.  And the dragons - those wonderful dragons we started to know - well they're locked up or gone for almost the entirety of this overblown amble of a book.  They have no individual characters.  GRRM has killed some extraordinary characters to no purpose because Winter is not coming - it's just thinking about it, changing its mind and going home again.  I am feeling very Robert Jordan Wheel of Time right now.<br /><br />Feast and Dance could have been put together, edited and maybe we'd have one good book instead of two bloated messes with occasional flashes of the brilliance of the first novels.  GRRM is starting to write like some of his characters eat - far too much and far too messily.

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I read this first, so although I could tell this was not a favored character - I felt VERY sorry for this woman.  Others have their opinion - but how can you NOT feel sorry for someone so obviously lacking in substance or real true character -- a person never having experienced adversity leaving never a chance to learn who she is or how to be a good person; and to NEVER have someone love her enough as a friend or family member to try to help her into situations that may have helped her learn a little more about life other than living off her looks.    So her friend is made out to be so fantastic - why was she never a good enough friend to say \\"Hey, Darcy - this gorgeous, popular thing is working great for you for now but have you ever thought about who YOU are behind it?  are you happy?  what do YOU really want from life?  Why don't you take a long vacation - she seemed to have plenty of $$ and time - BY YOURSELF, perhaps to a yoga retreat or spirituality quest in order to FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF WOMAN YOU WANT TO BE before you make choices about marriage, etc?\\"  Not saying any of this is an excuse - but all of her friends so quick to criticize her never seemed to have tried to help her or make her see how lacking she was on the inside.  As much as you love your friends - a person you spend time with b/c beauty, fun, access to events, ppl, etc - well, that is not only an acquaintance - but it makes everyone so snotty seem to be users and a bit fake themselves.  If anyone loved this girl - she would have had a lot of friend support BEFORE she found herself if the life crisis in this book.  Not saying she would have listened (other readers seem to think badly of Darcey) but perhaps if anyone had tried to help, she might have had a CLUE before she backed herself in a corner with this Life altering course of events!  And if nothing else, she would have had someone to reach out to when things got bad and she needed the love, support and friendship during this time of need.  As awful as she may be/have been/ people who call themselves your friends SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING BY THAT and they should help never seemed to have a true friend.    So who are all of you out there with Zero support for your friends?  No one ever even explained her selfishness, shallowness or behavior?  Why did her friend allow HERSELF to be trampled and her boyfriends stolen without discussing these behaviors with her friend.  The \\"horrible woman\\"  doesn't seem so horrible when NO one, no friend, family, lover or employer ever explained the reality of the world to this woman - such as the basics of generosity, love, respect, friendship, kindness, humanity, and narcissism.  How can you condemn and berate someone who is in complete ignorance  - yet these same friends OBVIOUSLY talk behind her back.    WORD TO THE WORLD.  DON'T TALK BEHIND ANYONE'S BACK EVER - even if you feel the need for help in HOW to bring these issues up to a friend.... do so NICELY and in a way respectful and in the tone you should have - which is ' how can I best help my friend help herself ' - and if it is beyond the help of a friend - collect names of fantastic therapists/counselors/psychologists/life coaches to help your friend become a WHOLE PERSON and the good person you MUST believe to really be in there - because if not..... WHY ARE YOU THIS PERSON'S FRIEND?  SPREAD LOVE AND KINDNESS AND SUPPORT.....  Jealousy is hard to deal with regardless of age - but that is not HER problem... you can explain things that hurt you due to jealousy once she has tools to even understand your emotions much less the empathy to care about changing to help you, her friend.  And sometimes - just admi t outright jealousy, have a laugh over it and move on.... This girl is crucified, even in the book, and (although I love the book and author)is too quick to discover her faults and piece her life together..... her life events may have hastened her learning curve but she needed help.    I'm curious to read froma few perspectives and see how self-righteous, self-absorbed, jealous, selfish, and how much \\"Help\\" this woman's friends appear to need as well for them to so casually dismiss someone they count.  Being a good person includes being a good friend and sometimes doing the hard stuff when you know it will make someone's life better.  If you cannot help others help themselves, convince them to get help themselves then perhaps your version of who is good and right in the world - MAYBE IT IS YOU WHO NEEDS TO LEARN TO BE A BETTER PERSON AND DEFINITELY A BETTER FRIEND.  If NO ONE EVER  tells Darcy she  has issues or has hurt them - HOW WILL SHE EVER EVEN KNOW HER BEHAVIOR IS NOT APPROPRIATE IF YOU ARE NOT A GOOD PERSON AND GOOD FRIEND AND FIND THE STRENGTH AND GENTLE WORDS TO HELP?????????????????
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Your editor has lost all control over mr. Martin, you could have cut half this book out and still retained a cohesive plot.  So many characters that have so little to add to the novel, as a whole.  This was supposed to be the last book.  Now I'm forced to come to grips that mr. Martm is another Robert Jordan, endlessly cranking out fantasy novels like a factory prints toilet paper.  He's a very good writer but I'm done with this series.

B003Y5H5FG|5.0|Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a normal teenager living in Las Vegas, Nevada with his mother (Toni Collette). Their new neighbor, Jerry (Colin Farrell), is a mysterious man who works all night and sleeps during the day. As Charley leaves for school with his girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots, you're reading this name correctly), his mother comments about the dumpster sitting in front of Jerry's yard. Charley pays little attention to it. Once at school, Charley is approached by his former friend `Evil' Ed (Christopher Mintze-Plasse) who believes that Charley's new neighbor is a vampire. People have been turning up missing in the area and a woman was recently attacked by a man who tried to bite her. Ed is convinced, but Charley is unable to accept that the charismatic man next door could possibly be a vampire and dismisses Ed's ramblings. When Charley eventually becomes suspicious himself, his research yields that Ed's claims were correct. Intending to keep his mother and girlfriend safe, Charley enlists the help of a magician and self-proclaimed vampire expert Peter Vincent (David Tennant) to help him destroy Jerry before Jerry destroys everything around him.     This summary may sound vaguely familiar, because Fright Night is the latest example of the Hollywood remake machine remaking every film they can. Based on a 1985 film that already spawned a 1988 sequel and is considered one of the better horror films of that decade, this film takes a different approach in remaking a film that some consider a classic and is more of a reimagining than a remake. Fright Night respects the source material enough to not just create a carbon copy of it, retaining the tone/concept of Tom Holland's original rather than the specifics of the plot. The chronology of the story has been altered, with events from the original taken out and new ones put in and the film has done away with certain elements of the original story. Meanwhile, some returning characters have retained their basic function in the plot but have been completely reimagined. Obviously, this has a much more modern feel but that doesn't mean it's the studios attempt to appeal to Twilight fans. The original is very much a product of the 1980s, while this latest version is very much a product of the 2010s. In updating it this way, it simply continues staying true to the original film. It's rare to see a Hollywood remake stick so close to the source material while straying so far from it and it's even rarer when the old story is replaced with a new one of equal strength. The idea of rewriting Fright Night as opposed to copying the original by-the-numbers, works for and against this new version. The 1985 film has its cult following and fans will be angered that the remake (exists and) has strayed from their beloved original. Meanwhile, open-minded people who come to this film without bias will appreciate the feeling that they're seeing a new film. As a remake, Fright Night is a worthy one. Taken on its own terms, it's very good film too. This is the surprise of the summer.    The 2011 Fright Night is better than the 1985 Fright Night that inspired it. While it lacks some of what made the original special and does away with elements that made some audiences interpret it as something deeper than a typical-horror/comedy, it improves upon the imperfections of the original substantially and has few imperfections of its own. The character `Evil' Ed, as played by Stephen Geoffreys in 1985, met with polarized reactions. On one hand, the character was a fan favorite and considered one of the best aspects of the film, but, on the other hand, he's considered by many (including this viewer) to be one of the most annoying characters to ever grace the screen. It wasn't the character, but the performance that elicited such strongly opposed reactions. It succeeds only in that it's memorable, but few performances have made me so frustratingly annoyed. Roger Ebert called Pauly Shore the \\"cinematic equivalent of long fingernails, drawn very slowly and quite loudly over a gigantic blackboard.\\" This describes how I feel about Geoffreys. While Mintze-Plasse doesn't create a performance as memorable and his `Evil' Ed character (only referred to by the moniker once) is substantially altered, he's immediately less annoying and has much less screen-time. Mintze-Plasse is forever cursed to be remembered as McLovin', but he uses that to his advantage by allowing the audience to make their associations and then going somewhere different with the character. This is the darkest he has gone with a performance and it works. In the 1985 version, Amy was much more of an object of desire for both Charley and Jerry, but was played by Amanda Bearse, the actress best known as Marcy D'Arcy from Married...With Children. While Amy is more personally involved in the plot this time, her character is not lusted over to the extent she was in 1985. I like Bearse, but she was not convincing as the object of a teenager's desire let alone a much older vampire. The new Amy is much more attractive and convincing than Bearse was. The only thing this new version is missing that the old version really benefitted from was Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent. McDowall was the highlight of the original film and made Vincent such a sympathetic character. I do miss McDowall, although David Tennant plays a completely remodeled version of the character and does a splendid job, but more on that later...    The script by Marti Noxon (with a story credit going to Tom Holland, who is also credited with the `based on' portion leading me to think he may have had some involvement with this new story) is very well-written, with a strong respect and debt to the original film. The comedy/horror tone is preserved, but the time-specificity is updated well without becoming too overbearing with current pop-culture references. Some characters, such as Jerry's assistant, are done away with but characters like Amy and Charley's mom are much more developed and involved this time around. I applaud Noxon for rewriting Peter Vincent successfully, as I had very little hopes when I heard what was done with the character. Additionally, Noxon stays true to the characters, which was very important in the original film. People, myself included, felt emotionally invested in their plight and that remains true here.     Fright Night is paced very well and draws you in, but descends into a CGI-heavy action film towards the end of the second act. It's obligatory for a film like this and it doesn't sacrifice the story or characters for the sake of mindless special effects, but the story is most successful when it deals with character interactions. The early scenes, especially the new ones, are marvelously handled. The scene where Charley first enters Jerry's home is suspenseful and exciting, with a surprisingly shocking climax. It's a great-looking film, which I can't emphasize enough. The film was shot in 3D, but the entire thing looks wonderful with some incredible exterior shots (which I suspect are CGI). Director Craig Gillespie currently has a track record of one well-received and one horribly-received film, but he proves here to be quite the director. Finally, the score by Ramin Djawadi is an effective film score that complements the action onscreen very well.    The acting, for both a horror film and remake, is very impressive. Yelchin is a convincing Charley and it's easy to really relate to the character and the situation he's found himself in. David Tennant plays Peter Vincent for the first several minutes as a Criss Angel/Russell Brand hybrid, but eventually transitions the character into someone the audience can root for. He establishes a completely different persona from McDowall yet stays true to the heart of the character and gives a very entertaining performance. The real star however is Farrell as the smokingly charismatic, diabolical Jerry. Clearly having a lot of fun here, devouring thescenery with a performance that is unbelievably charismatic and effectively creepy, Farrell brings flamboyancy to the role, treating it seriously without being afraid to have fun with it. Think of Heath Ledger as the Joker basically, although don't expect Farrell to collect any awards. It's absolutely fascinating to watch him and it restores faith in an actor that hasn't had such a prominent role in the limelight for the last few years.    Also featuring a terrific \\"Hey-I-know-that-dude\\" cameo from an original player in the 1985 version, Fright Night is a tense, intense, and very entertaining film that goes far and beyond expectations; a fine example of a remake and a sturdy film on its own. It's never dull, it delights in over-the-top blood and gore, and it never takes itself too seriously. While it's not quite a \\"horror\\" film and it's contrivances keep it from being perfect (much like the original), I can't imagine seeing a more enjoyable horror film this year.    GRADE: A-    *Due to theatre manipulation, I was forced to see the film in 3D. If you like 3D to be gimmicky, there were moments that were quite impressive. However, due to many scenes being very dark it doesn't benefit from this format in any discernible way.

031603438X|5.0|This book is simply fantastic. If you're a fan of the Stones, of Keith, of rock n' roll, or simply of music and those who truly appreciate it, you will love this. His love of those who came before him and those who have stuck with him through the years is actually quite powerful, and this will totally change your opinion of him both as a musician, as well as a man. So much love to the guy, may he keep playing till the day he dies, which I am sure will not be for many, many years.
B0059H05VI|5.0|I've always enjoyed their music, so my opinion is a little biased here.  However, this is probably one of my favorites of theirs and has some exceptional tracks.  If you like Maroon 5, chances are good that you will love this installment of theirs, too.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The microphone picks up everything - which can be a distraction for others - but all of my gaming group have this headset now and we love it.  It is not a small unit (size / weight) - so it might be a bit big for younger users.  We average over 9 hours of charge on it (I have not charged it in two weeks and it still shows over eight hours of charge time.  I live in an old house with very poor cell reception due to old wiring - I \\"game\\" in the basement and can wander all the way to the top floor (2 stories) and not lose connection.

The grease from stewed salt pork clung to his gristly beard as he donned a slashed velvet doublet of purple satin, emblazoned with the crest of Ser Eddard Bauer. Over his smallclothes, he wore black pantaloons. He clambered into his Honda and began the short journey west, bearing northwards along the interstate. He turned left, edging his way past opposing traffic. If I look back, I am lost.<br /><br />His office was a dull brown keep that sat astride the Crown Road. His desk was hidden behind a soundproofed beige cubicle and was lined with a faux wood finish. Reek, reek, it rhymes with teak.<br /><br />He had finished A Dance with Dragons not a noonsday before and wondered if in truth he had finished the entire series. George R. R. Martin is so constipated from the fawnings of his lickspittles and self-indulgent side stories that he's not like to drop another turd of a novel anytime soon, if the last decade has told it true, he thought to himself.<br /><br />He smirked at his own witticism. \\"It is known\\" he said aloud to himself.<br /><br />To tell it true, he had enjoyed several parts of the novel. Jon Snow's first chapter was strong, as were the Bran and Davos chapters. He'd not expected that. Many of the early story arcs had glistened wetly with promise but of these Martin had written little and less as the book wore on. Of Dany's aimless navel-gazing, there'd been much and more. Asha and Victarion vied for the distinction of the most pointless Greyjoy POV. Ariane Martell had twisted her teats for naught, for her brother Quentyn's chapters proved to be as useless as nipples on a breastplate. Gods be good, he thought, the fat man teased us with Feast's Dorne chapters for.... this?<br /><br />And Jaime... that had been the cruelest jape of all. Best that Martin had left out his sole chapter. Though, given the masturbatory excess of Dance's prose, Martin could have learned a thing or two from a man who'd had to make do without his sword hand.<br /><br />The epilogue was a satisfying end to an unsavory meal, but even the most succulent lemoncake doesn't salvage a bland and unfilling meal of gruel. In truth, it should've been left in A Feast for Crows, along with Cersei's chapters. At least then at least one of the novels from the last ten years would've amounted to more than a mummer's farce.<br /><br />He set down his copy of A Dance with Dragons with an unsatisfying thud. Words are wind, he mused. Speaking of which... He raised a leg and broke his word. It smelt of stale bacon grease and mashed neeps.<br /><br />By then, his bladder was full to bursting from the morning's coffee, so he headed to the latrine before he pissed his smallclothes. Reek, reek, it rhymes with leak. Along the way, he passed the receptionist from the adjoining office. She was a pretty brown-haired thing, a woman of about four-and-twenty, fully flowered.<br /><br />\\"Where do whores go?\\", he asked her.<br /><br />She slapped him.<br /><br />He entered the men's bathroom and undid his breeches. The urinals were crofted from gleaming white porcelain and bore the seal of American Standard. Whilst it received his golden stream of the morning's piss, he contemplated how this was a metaphor for how Ser Martin had raised the leg and done the same to the continuity of A Song of Ice and Fire and the first three books.<br /><br />He angrily composed an e-mail to Martin's editor whilst zipping up his breeches.

B0044FC06Y|5.0|I have read everything Ken Follett has ever published and this book is one of his bests. A great piece of historical fiction that makes learning about WWI interesting and entertaining. I read this book quickly and immediately regretted it. Once I was done I realized it would be quite a while before part two of the trilogy was published. Hopefully not too long, because I loved the characters and want to follow their stories into future generations as we did with \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End.\\"    I was disappointed that the Kindle version actually cost more than the hard cover at release, but I understand the politics behind publishing and electronic distribution. Hopefully that will get better as Kindle becomes an even bigger distribution channel.    Anyway, great book. I can't wait for the next part in the trilogy. My wife is burning through the pages of this one right now and she has said the same thing. Enjoy!
0345428064|2.0|You know how some people, when they tell a story, have to give you every...single...detail and by the time they get to the point, you are past caring.  That's how McNab is -- only to add to the misery,his main character is dragging a little girl around with him.  And we have to hear about every street they go down, every hotel room they inhabit.  And, on one hand, the author makes you think that capture could come at any minute.  Yet, the character has time to buy clothes for the little girl, right in the heat of the chase.  Spare me!  The book just plods along with little excitement and little plot development.  In fact, the plot seems to go nowhere.  McNab is better writing non-fiction.  I can't understand all the positive reviews here.  It must be a British thing.
B004B32500|5.0|This movie begins looking unapproachable, artsy and undecipherible but later you discover that the movie is actually quite understandable and the plot very recognizable. Five stars til further notice.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I bought this headset back in June of 2010 and it was great.  Because I do most of my gaming after everyone is in bed, I needed a headset that would give game sound through the headset unlike a bluetooth earpiece.  The PX21's seemed to fit the bill.  Once I received it, right out of the box the clip that can be used to attach the sound controls to a belt or shirt broke the first time I tried to use it.  I didn't think it was that big of deal because I wouldn't be walking around or anything so I just planned on setting the controls on my lap as I played.  That worked as planned for a year.  Now after a year of use there is no sound coming out of the left ear piece.  I don't beleive they could just wear out because I was not hard on them at all.  But I'm starting to think if that clip wouldn't have broke there would have been a lot less stress on the cord where it attachs to the earpiece.  Overall I was satisfied with the sound and ability to chat (although sometimes people couldn't hear me well at all) but am very disappointed that they were poorly constructed and quit working after a year.
0545259088|5.0|I can't decide if this is my favourite of the series or not. I think it's hard to look at the books as independent from one another. I guess that's the point.  Forever is, like the others, beautiful. It didn't make me cry but it did catch my breath in my throat more times than I care to admit.  Read it. Read the series. It explains so many things about love and friendship and loyalty. It makes you contemplate every relationship you have, especially the one with yourself.  I adore these books. I adore Sam and Grace and I love Cole. They prove the world is imperfect, but that's ok.  Oh, and I hope there'll be another book. I really really do, though I don't know if my heart or nerves could stand it...
0316098329|4.0|Room is a very inspirational yet eye-opening novel. The book started out a little slow because the story is told from the point-of-view of a 5-year old boy, Jack. Once you get familiarized with the tone and style of writing, you won't want to put this book down. This is a very touching story of a mother and her child who are put through an unbelievable experience that as a reader you may understand, but many people could not relate to what these two wonderfully crafted characters are put through. I highly recommend reading Room, it's a great read and a beautiful story.
1594202710|5.0|Henry Kissinger certainly knows about what he is writing. His first chapters on Chinese history are bit shaky on some very early periods but once he gets to the modern era of Mao and Zhou en-Lai, he is in territory he knows well. Mao was probably the only one with the will to unite China but he almost destroyed it with the Cultural Revolution. He wanted continuous revolution to \\"purify\\" the people. Fortunately for China, his life came to an end and Deng completed the transition to a modern and powerful nation Mao had begun.<br /><br />The book is obviously filled with personal observations and anecdotes that give the reader the sense of knowing what really happened. It is well written, as were other Kissinger books I have read. It can be picked up and set down without losing much of the continuity. I have spent quite a few hours on my deck this summer with a glass of wine and this book.<br /><br />China has many challenges ahead that Kissinger did not mention. The one child policy dooms China to a demographic crisis, if not collapse later this century. The transition of leadership has, so far, been handled well considering the mysterious power structure of the government.<br /><br />An interesting introduction to China might be the famous novels of James Clavell, \\"Taipan\\" and \\"Noble House\\", both a history of Hong Kong in two volumes that give a picture of 19th century China.<br /><br />For a serious study of modern China, this book is an excellent place to start.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|This collection appeals to a variety of musical preferences.  From the clarity and smooth, richness of her voice, to the superb musical accompaniment and offbeat lyrics, these songs take you on an unexpected and delightful journey.  Enjoyable and insatiable!
B004I654WQ|5.0|Bought this for my 2.8 year old. Loves the movie and the G rating holds up. Some of the G rated movies are too much for him due to even horseplaying type violence (think Bugs Bunny or Wile. E. Coyote). Worst thing in this movie is crashing into others.
0547258305|5.0|`Graceling' is a book by Kristen Cashore and it is also a YA fantasy novel. I have to let you in on a secret, I am not a YA fantasy novel fan. I never read them when I was younger and I don't really indulge in them now that I am an adult but this is a book that will appeal to all readers.    It took me a while to read `The Hunger Games' because the premise of the book didn't excite me; but, upon reading the first few pages I knew I was addicted. `Graceling' is a similar sort of book, even though it started a bit slower.     Kashore has a way with words and built a world of 7 kingdoms that drew me in and left me wanting to know more. The protagonist in `Graceling' is a girl called Katsa, and her name and pluck reminded me of Katniss. However, this book is not a ripoff of `The Hunger Games'. It is unique, fun, and interesting and will draw you in. Once you read it, you will eagerly anticipate the `Graceling' sequel just like I am. Kristen Cashore currently has a book called `Fire' out but that is more of a prequel. The `Graceling' sequel will be called `Bitterblue' and is not currently out as yet.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|Smartly put together and fun to play.  Enjoy the diff. maps that can be downloaded. A game worth buying and a game playing.
1452101248|5.0|All of the recipes I have tried from 'Plenty' have turned out delicious on the first try.  I have purchased many vegetarian cookbooks, and this is by far the most unique in terms of combining flavours from different cultures and presenting a rainbow of colours on the plate.  He groups the recipes by the dominant vegetable, which is a great way to choose recipes if you're looking to cook what's in season at your local market.      I had the chance to meet Yotam Ottolenghi in San Francisco, and if you didn't know he was a chef, you would have thought he was an artist.  In a black turtleneck, admiring antique cookbooks, speaking softly about memorable dishes, his journey from journalism school to the kitchen, and the interplay of colour in his restaurant in London, you could quickly understand that he views the plate as his canvas and food as his paint.  And I'm sure your dinner guests will agree that the dishes you prepare from this book are true chefs-d'oeuvre.
B0052VI2YS|5.0|It's fun being young again.  Just place this SACD reissue of Deep Purple's \\"Machine Head\\" into your player and crank the volume.  An onslaught of heavy metal madness will rip through your ears in full multi-channel glory.  Sure, you can also get a standard layer stereo mix, but why bother when 5.1 is available!  Overall the sound quality is excellent, however, the bass is a bit mushy and thumps more than most other releases.  Could this be due to Deep Purple's desire to knock your head off when you hit 120db at home?  For fans of multi-channel this is a must have, and finally available at a reasonable price compared to an earlier out of print multi-channel reissue that often cost well over $100 used.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Thought we had seen Season 2 and actually had missed it! But ordered through Amazon and it was one of the best purchases! The Season was fantastic!!! We love Breaking Bad!
0439023513|1.0|I can't believe that ANYONE would like this book.  I couldn't wait to get away from Katniss' whining and whimpy attitude.  I liked her in the beginning because she was a survivor and in the end she became a drug addict who let everyone down. I was actually hoping that she would die and her sister who was actually doing something noble would have lived.  Katniss did not deserve Peeta who was sweet and should have gotten a better partner.  Thank goodness Gale bailed and went on to do good work in the districts - I wonder if Peeta lost the coin flip.  To me it was a really bad marriage between the Twilight (two guys love the same girl - who doesn't understand why they both could love her) and Harry Potter (Harry, I mean Katniss is the 'chosen one' to fix the world and end the war).  I think that this Suzanne Collins was trying to ride the coattails of two very good authors.  I want my money back for these books!
B0059R5Q08|4.0|This is a very good version of the movie, although I wish it would have been longer.  Mia Wasikowska is the by far the best actress I have seen in this role.  She is so believable.  I didn't like the abrupt ending of the movie, but it is still one of my favorite versions.
0345529057|5.0|My wife loves to read and I bought this as a gift for her upon a friend's recommendation.  The set is a great deal for the money.  She is on the third book in the set and hasn't put the series down yet.  The small print, many lines per page, and high page count make for a very long read.
0143038419|5.0|I read this a few months ago and it was one of those books that just touches you.  Its poignant and relatable. I think most of us have gone through some or all of the pains and emotions she worked her way through.  I only wish that I had the money and the time to devote to an exploration of the world and myself at the same time like she did.<br />This book is worth whatever price you find it for and will no doubt be a personal favorite for a great many people. Its a story worth reading. More than once.
B0019IB26I|5.0|The music speaks for itself as does the musician. From the first note to the closing songs you are catapulted into a better place and stress is relieved. I find his music to be very useful when trying to escape the worlds injustices or even just to enjoy by itself.
0765322889|5.0|An excellent start to the series.    This is an interesting world with lots of different competing factions, there is some ruthless politics and Erikson isn't afraid to kill characters if it is appropriate.    There are a lot of characters but they are distinctive enough that you don't have problems remembering them or distinguishing them when the point of view changes.    The pace is quick as we swap from character to character and there are several sub-plots to keep things moving, the ending is well done with several twists.    There are hints of a bigger plot and other conflicts to come.    If you like Guy Gavriel Kay you'll probably like this, it has a similar level of complexity although it is more action packed than his books.
B0058A119G|5.0|Barbra did it again!!!! Time seems not to pass for her voice. Every single track in this album is beautiful. Barbra continues amazing me with her performances. BRAVO BARBRA...!!!
B004LWZW24|4.0|This James Wan masterpiece in horror is a standout. It is significant in that it gives an old-horror feel without compromising surrealism (e.g. the puppet-looking family members forever reenacting how they died, which is a nod to the Saw puppet also created by Wan). The obtrusive musical score is the only thing I do not like.
B0052OWGUQ|1.0|I only lasted 40 minutes.  It was painful.  It moves like molasses.  The plot and motivation is poor.  Barely any action.  The acting is terrible.  The cinematography is murky.  I like Jason Statham but not in this movie.   The only redeeming value is the introductory assassination (that sounds bad, I know).   Terrible movie.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I have followed the career of Enya since her first album.  After hearing her for the first time, I was instantly hooked. What can I say about her voice? It is totally unique and captivating.  Her music production is outstanding.  Usually on a \\"best of\\" recording, there are only a few really \\"best\\". This recording is a true joy, because EVERY song is perfect.  If you were to purchase one recording of Enya, I would strongly recommend this one.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is a collection of work displaying a great sense versatility and forethought. The sequence of music in this album takes you on  a memorable journey well worth taking. I never travel without John Mayer on my iphone.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|This film was a very good horror film remake that follows the \\"How to Make a Re-make\\" handbook nicely. It's a simple rule really. Take the basic premise of the film you are re-making, keep basic elements the same, and then make your own damn movie! Think about it. Some of the best horror film remakes in recent memory (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, Piranha) all follow this rule. They pay \\"respects\\" to there origins, but for the most part are farely original. This one is no different.    The story is about a high school boy named Charlie, who recently has climed the social ladder at school with help from his new friends, who are tools, and his smokin'-hot girlfriend. But when his new neighbor Jerry moves next door, all hell breaks loose. You see, Jerry (played wonderfully macho by Colin Farrell) is a vampire hell-bent for blood who will do anything it takes to get it. But when Charlie recieves help from his girlfriend and his new found magician friend Peter Vincent (played like a cross between Chris Angel and Aldous Snow), Jerry might have more on his plate then he can handle.    All in all, this was a very refreshing and suprising remake that deliciously blends humour with horror. If you're looking for a good scare with some dark comedy and a well ensembled cast, this is the movie for you.
B0055SWM08|5.0|All in all this game rocks, I really enjoy how they did not just copy another game and put their own spin on it like a lot if the other games are these days.
0316056863|2.0|I was excited to read this because I thought it would be funny, but it wasn't especially funny. And, it wasn't especially interesting either. About two-thirds of the way through I gave up because I thought I could make better use of my time.
1463514581|5.0|I read this book a few weeks ago and wanted to do a review, only I wasn't sure how. I have wrote and re wrote this review. I still don't think what I have to say gives this book justice but, I want people, readers to know how much I loved in this book. I was warned that I would get anything done. So knowing the reader I am-I get totally lost in my books especially great ones-I cleaned, had laundry caught up, as much as one can, and dinner made early. I even gave the kids their baths and put them down early. I was prepared to start the book.     Somewhere around 2 or 3 in the morning, when I my husband woke up and realised I wasn't in bed and came to see why I was still up, and several gripping chapters into I went to bed.    I often dream about the characters I read about. I was glad to dream about Rose and Joe.         The next day I woke up early to read and did so until breakfast and continued through lunch. I did stop and feed my kids and then sat right back down with out eating. Later that night I finished Twenty Eight and a Half Wishes. I dreamed about Rose and Joe AGAIN!!! And I thought about them for the next day or week.         About the book. I my opinion it was greatly written and very captivating. The personalities of the characters were intertwined into the story. Everything Rose did you knew was something Rose would do. There were no wavers in their personalities or plot. I never found myself thinking, \\"now that doesn't seem like Rose or MaMa.\\" Or wondering why we the author lead us in this direction. Everything tied together and plot twist was revealed.    And let me tell you, there where some twist! Denise kept the mystery through out the book and touch of paranormal was perfect.     Rose and her visions were central to the story but not always correct. They sometimes showed her things that made no sense and sometimes showed her things that happened very differently. I don't want to say to much about these visions and give anything away.    Rose andJoe's relationship is a rocky one and has as many twists as the plot its self.     I know I will be picking this book up again soon. Actually I'm needing something to read right now! I think I'll read it again. And if you haven't, read it.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|This DVD set is a must for any fans of David Tennant's portrayal of the Doctor. When you open it up, you see that the little booklet of DVDs and their scenes also contains a great foreword by David Tennant himself. As for the DVDs, they depict the epic conclusion of one of the most beloved Doctor's careers on the show, one where the Doctor slowly descends away from a few ideals that until now have been the foundation of his logic, until he realizes that he has gone too far, and must accept that the end is coming for him. I definitely suggest buying this, it will be a gem in any Doctor Who fan's collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read. The author kept you wanting for more and delivered. It takes you in what could possibly happen in the future. How she came up with this story line I don't know. As soon as you finish the first novel you just have to start into the next. Great read for teens or adults.

B003XRDYX2|5.0|I won't go over the detail again that many others have already covered in their reviews, but the sound is superb - surely the definitive version of at least the early acoustic albums.  Good packaging too, with individual album sleeve reproductions.    Just one complaint - the single \\"Positively 4th Street\\" is only included on the separate \\"Best of...\\" CD and not in the box set.  How can that be \\"The Best of...\\" this set if some of it is not in the set?  And how much effort would it have taken for Sony to gather this song up with the handful of other mono era singles not on the albums and include a bonus disc of them?  I for one am not going to pay for a whole CD to get one missing song.  This is a cheap marketing trick which lets down what is otherwise a major milestone in popular music.    Actually, isn't it time Sony put together a comprehensive collection of all Bob's non-album material over the years?  Singles, B-sides, charity disc contributions, movie songs - there's easily enough to make up a good double album.  If the bootleggers can do it, why can't his official record company?

B0015DYIH2|1.0|Don't get me wrong, but seriously, it took me 3 years to actually comes to term with writing this review, simply because there are no better words to describe HOW DISAPPOINTING STEPHENIE MEYER HAVE BROUGHT UPON US!!!!!!!<br /><br />One, I have admit that I loved the first book very much because it was the first in the series and one of the strongest, and also I was recommended by one of my best friends to read it since she suggested that it was really good. So, I read it including all 3 books that came after but each one was followed by a little disappointment, and the 4th was no better. More importantly, the worst book I had read in my life so far (my good old chemistry book was more deserving than this utter-unspeakable crap!).<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />1. I think many people have already said this but...this book need a serious revision! What happened to the editor? Did he/she fell asleep or drunk or what?<br />2. I would have thought that Bella's maturity would grow into the not so whiny-selfish-stupid-all-too-dependable female protagonist that I looked so forward to. But no, she's too self-centered, disregard everything besides her goal for eternity/future with Edward and her eagerness for her \\"love night\\" with Edward (Should I say more...? I think others have said enough on my part so I'll just leave it at that), and more importantly, becoming a vampire (Ohhhhh).<br />3. Bella getting pregnant (WTF?)!?!?! Didn't Ms. Meyer describe that no liquid besides venom flows through a vampire's body? Well, semen is fluid that flows...How did that happens? Wasn't vampire suppose to be dead and unable to have children? Well, I guess Ms. Meyer could break all sorts of rule to make it so it's plausible.......<br />4. Jacob imprinting on Renesmee. Just Vomit Ew. First, it was your mother, and second, it's the daughter (Renesmeee). How lovely! No better words to describe my sarcasm.<br />5. The oh so battle seen and no bloodshed was literally a disappoint that could stretch all the way to Mars. J.K Rowling would have done a much better job with this.<br /><br />There are so many reasons why this book is one of the biggest failure in the English world (no offense) but I think this is enough for me to say why it has disappointed me so....Don't buy this book, you'll regret every second that you touch this. You'll be much happier if you read something that is much worthy than this crap.g would have done a much better job with this.

You'll be much happier if you read something that is much worthy than this crap.
B0058VW36U|5.0|If you like games similar to this, then this game will be very addicting. I played for a couple days and I've beaten all the levels and got all 3 stars for them. Now I'm just waiting for more levels. This is a very good and addictive game.

B004EPYZZI|5.0|This movie was very inspirational as it portrays the story of an incredible young woman who chose to overcome her shortcomings.  I was pleased that this movie was wholesome also, no bad language or anything inappropriate, we certainly aren't used to that in the movie industry.  What an incredible story and journey.  We could all learn a lesson from Bethany Hamilton.  I wish her the best of luck in realizing her dreams.

B003JLA4KS|5.0|I love this DVD!!! I gave it as a present to my boyfriend for one of our anniversaries and he LOVED it! He is the biggest Rush fan I know. The band has a special meaning for us because it was the first concert we attended as a couple. It's been a YYZ love affair ever since. Anyone who's a true Rush fan has to have it! :D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me up all night. I had to keep reading because if I tried to stop all I could think is what's going to happen next, so I just turned the light back on and kept going.  For all those saying that this is poorly written I didn't find it so.  You have to remember that the story is being told by the 14 year old in the story but even then I found the writing great and not juvenile.  Big words and wordly rhetoric doesn't always make a good book.  I really didn't know this was a young adult book and wouldn't have know it unless I had read it in other reviews.  If this is young adult, well they are reading some books much more interesting than alot of the adult books.  Do not be put off thinking this is some twilight crap and not read this book.  I have read most of the books that come out on the best sellers list (98 this past year) and this is the tops as far as most entertaining....yes way way better than The Help.

1608191664|5.0|I have an MBA and run my own firm - and I describe myself as a capitalist. So this isn't the kind of book I'd typically pick up - it just happened to be sitting by the library checkout.    Wow.    Amazingly informative, extremely thought-provoking, and (surprisingly to me) very clearly written.  The words don't get in the way of the ideas, which are many, and well supported by data, reasoning and anecdote.    As the living standards of the US middle class plummet (we don't need a Korean-UK professor to tell us that), I hope this book will be much more widely read in this country.  Something needs to change.
B000HKT7RK|4.0|This item was a nice addition to my Volume 1 copy.....the only thing that I am a little disappointed about is that it's a different size than Volume 1 and I did not realize that was the case.  But I still LOVE it!!
B0042RJWTC|1.0|I like the movie, it was really scratched up (very bad quality) and I don't know how to return it.  This is the 2nd DVD I've order (out of 7) that had something wrong with it.
0142403873|5.0|I just love reading this book to my daughter, 3 years old.  The cadence of the words flow so well when read aloud.  My daughter's first favorite book was 'The Snail and the Whale' by the same author/illustrator.  She just loves the rhyming and repetition of these books and it makes it easy for me to memorize (very handy for long car trips and queueing with an impatient toddler).  I remember once instance where I was telling the story to my daughter and wound up entertaining 5 other adults who were listening in. 'The Gruffalo' is cleverly done and entertaining and humorous enough to for me to read it 2-3 times a day for 2 months straight without going bonkers.  There may be a nod to 'Where the Wild Things Are' (another classic), but toddlers and preschoolers love unscary monsters.  I think there is plenty of room on our shelves for both well loved books.  I have gifted 'The Gruffalo' to my nieces and my daughter's friends.  It is probably my all time favorite children's book.
034552554X|5.0|This is a wonderful read that is beautifully written and has well-drawn characters that you really root for.  I highly recommend it!

B00371QQ0M|3.0|I had enjoyed reading Frank Herbert's novel Dune back in the mid 1970's.  At that time the friend who introduced me to the novel and I wondered if a movie would ever be made of this wonderful book, and what that movie would be like.  We never imagined anything like this movie though!  The visual impact of some of the scenes in the movie are disturbing--from the bloated fish-like navigators, to the diseased Baron, to the animals put in service to the strange tastes of the Baron and his deranged nephews Raban and Feyd-Rautha.  But okay, Dune is a pretty weird book, with its medieval-flavored high-tech society where the heightened drug-induced capabilities of humans are forced to compensate for the religious sanctions against computers.  One should expect quite a few strange-looking beings in such a case.  The real problem with this movie is the enormous swath of events, plots, and subplots that it has to touch on to bring Paul Atreides from a boy in his teens to the warrior and messiah who brings a galactic empire to its knees.  This movie seems more like a bare outline of story rather than the story itself!  I am left to wonder if those who had not read the book could follow this movie at all!<br /><br />On the positive side, some of the roles were well cast.  Kyle Maclachlan was pretty much as I had imagined Paul Atreides--though it would seem that too many of his powers were focused on avoiding a bad hair day.  Sting captured the gleeful menace of Feyd-Rautha, and Max von Sydow endowed Liet-Kynes with the proper measure of gravitas.  The Baron, however, came off as a complete buffoon rather than an evil master strategist.  Duke Leto seemed somewhat stiff and lacking in the charisma that I felt that he should exude.  Lady Jessica was also somewhat stiff and did not exude the charm and sensuality that I had always associated with her.  I am not sure what might have been done with Alia--as a superwoman in a child's body--but the affect that they achieved was comic rather than threatening.<br /><br />One of the worst ideas implemented in this movie is the decision to color in all of the eyes of Paul and the other spice eaters so that their eyes (including the whites) are dark blue.  This effect gave the whole thing the look of an incredibly cheap production.  If the director or technical advisers were unable to use proper contact lenses or some other convincing-looking way of coloring eyes, they should have not colored the eyes of the spice eaters at all--as the coloring of the eyes from eating spice is hardly an essential plot element.threatening.

B0041T52S6|2.0|\\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" is a youth-oriented comedy that is destined to divide audiences into two diametrically opposed camps: those who see it as a brilliantly creative and satirical take on modern adolescence, and those who see it as a migraine-inducing, insufferably pretentious exercise in self-conscious self-indulgence that has desperation written all over it.  The movie is definitely an acquired taste, but one thing is for certain: very few who see it will be indifferent to it.<br /><br />Based on the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" is a highly stylized, non-linear account of a 22-year-old geek (played, as always, by Michael Cera) and his surrealistic adventures with his friends and band mates (the cast is indeed enormous) - who are a combination of dorks and Goths and just about everything in between - as they do battle against evil forces, most of them former boyfriends of his current flame (Alison Pill), in snowy Toronto.<br /><br />Writers Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright's attempt to transfer the look and style of graphic literature to the big screen meets with only modest success here (Wright also directed the movie), and it's not too long into the film's nonstop assault on the senses that we're compelled to holler \\"Uncle!\\" purely out of self-defense.<br /><br />The is-it-a-dream-or-is-it-reality? narrative framework, the frenetic editing, the robotic line-readings, and the words constantly flying all over the screen have a certain novelty and charm at the beginning, but they quickly wear out their welcome - as well as the audience's patience - and all we're left with is a profound sense of relief once the whole thing is finally over.<br /><br />Despite the best of intentions in wanting to do something a little bit different for a change, \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" still comes across as a \\"cult classic\\" trying just a little too hard to become a \\"cult classic.\\"

1594744769|4.0|A delightfully bizarre reading experience. I loved the use of the weird old pictures which just added an extra layer of super creepiness. The pacing is really great through around 3/4 of the book before it gets a little rushed feeling at the end. While I appreciate a good cliff hanger ending, I think the story could have benefitted from at least a little more closure.     Overall, I loved it and can't wait for the story to continue. It would be a really fun read for the young adult crowd but definitely enjoyable for older readers as well!
0321701763|5.0|I have been a long time user of Elements and am comfortable with most of its capabilities, including layers and filters.  When I upgraded to CS5, I needed a book to teach me this much more complex program.  I'm well into CS5 Classroom in a Book now and believe it's an excellent teacher.      The book contains 14 lessons, each covering several tools or processes.  Each is short but intense.  The screen captures are very clear with red arrows directing you to the action.  The text is clear and concise, each sentence covering so much that I found it useful to skim the entire lesson first, then go back and do each step in sequence.    There is a DVD with images for all 14 lessons.  The images provided are carefully selected to clearly support each lesson, not to show off the authors' superior talent.     The DVD also has a couple of hours of tutorials, somewhat better than the stuff you can find on the Internet.    Finally, most of the critical reviews note that this book tells you what to do but not always why to do it.  I agree with this comment but suggest there's a reason for this method.  For instance, the authors say to set a slider to a certain percentage, with no explaination of why that number.  I move the slider above and below the suggested number and observe the effect on the image or the tool.  By doing so, I begin to understand what that number means.  This is learning by doing, the overarching technique of this book.      The authors do explain the numbers when it is important to do so (as in Threshold for Unsharp Mask) but to explain every number, in my view, would add many pages and greater complexity to an already complex subject.       So if you already use Elements and are thinking of moving up to Photoshop, this book will help you make that leap.

B005HV6Y5W|2.0|At the turn of the century someone pointed out that the youths in the advanced economies were getting more and more conservative. Now it seems humanism retarded farther still.      Cannes has been awarding religious films in the past few years.... Couldn't humans live \\"better\\", after all, without the help of some external device they call God? The process of globalization, which causes the loss of local tradition everywhere, may be another driving force that works behind all this.      My personal impression of this film is that it is a bold attempt to attribute to God everything from the creation of the universe to the birth of life, and the internal struggle of modern, industrialized people. It is a propaganda film, just like Schindler's List or Malcolm X. As a religious confession, it may indeed be truthful. However, in this film, nothing is to be seen beyond God. That is why the family reunion on the beach feels no less monotonous than Paradiso of Dante. Whether you like this film depends ultimately on whether you accept the unmistakably pre-modern values that you discern behind its graphic beauty and tactful direction.

B004EPYZUI|2.0|Some any fantastic ideas are in this film. However, it takes on a profoundly predictable and overly tripe structure. So much wasted potential. The action was epic and the visual were stunning. But such lackluster storytelling was intolerable. Two hours utterly wasted.
B004ZJZQ92|2.0|I ordered this in large part for the digital copy. However, when I went online with the authorization code it denied me because I was logging on outside of the US. Amazon should be clearer about this in advertising this and similar bluray/dvd/digital copy sets.
B004UXUXGE|5.0|We are so used to seeing dramatic presentations of events that never happened, with faster action and bigger explosions than could ever occur in real life, that it's almost possible to see how someone could fail to be astounded by real artwork made more than 30,000 years ago, before farming, before towns, before pottery or cloth or any of today's popular religions, before human domination of the earth.  Almost. If you still have a soul and an attention span, you will be provoked to wonderment and contemplation of what being human really is by this film.  Pass the word.

0307346617|1.0|I was really disappointed with this book.  I found the book's concept to be very interesting.   For me the book bombed,  I labored to get through each little episode.  His political or cultural allusions seemed to be more on the petty side and detracted from the story.  I was expecting a better quality of story telling.
B005IEWUW4|5.0|Prequel to Let's Kill Hitler- Ok so it did everything a Prequel should. It teased and made you wish it was 9 PM Saturday, August 27th. It was very emotional though. I won't give it away but... If you are a very mushy kind of Parent (not that there is anything wrong with that) don't watch it.    You will only hear Karen Gillan's voice but her perfomance was perfect. Matt Smith facial expressions say everything.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I saw this the first time in a small theater in Seal Beach, CA; loved it, as did everyone in there with me, clapping and shouting at the end of it.

Not a bit 'cheesie', with truth that you can take to your heart, AND lots of great surfing, by Girls; yeah!

Not sure why he needs to get shot or blown up in his roles but it does provide for an interesting plot.  Then there are the attractive women in his movies.      With TV quality going down, I am more inclined to add to my video library and this is a movie I can watch again and again.  If you like action movies with requiring some intelligence you will enjoy this one a lot.    [[ASIN:B000N6UERK Deja Vu [Blu-ray]]]  [[ASIN:B00005JPD0 Deja Vu]]    I bought the Blu-ray version
B00003CXZ4|2.0|Watched twice out of incredulity. Intriguing premise badly implemented. Even the disk does not follow the Newtonian cause/effect nexus we know on this planet--standard  DVD commands such as find scenes do not work, which in turn make it impossible to uncover the \\"reality\\" (if any.) Supposedly flashbacks of (anti?)hero who devolved from reputable insurance agent to  justified vigilante, with such memory loss that cannot function in this space-time despite carrying inch-thick file of documentation and writing, yea  bodily tattooing, important considerations as to who/what (has/is to?) occur(red). Like Run Lola Run, but less coherent. Unreliable narrator cannot maintain distinctions between multiple realities and  his constant shifts of P.O.V between color and b/w are unhelpful;  happenings and identities shift, even between friend and foe constantly and nothing is what it appears. Cannot exist in this universe, assuming Occam's Razor applies in an America filmed in 2000. Therefore either (1) space and time fold back on each other at the individual level without warning or (2)it's a drug-induced bad trip. Drugs are mentioned throughout and fantasy desiderata such as protagonist killing a gangster to take on his Jaguar and girlfriend and even clothing, not to mention a free $200,000 to live on without a job, with no law enforcement or Mob penalties (scot free)are much in evidence. WAS the killing, if actually happening, actually justified?  Don't try this at home.
B003Y5H5AQ|2.0|The first 20 minutes of the movie was actually great but when the smurfs arrived in New York it started to all go down hill from there! I didn't know whether the movie was about the Smurfs or Doogie Howser!!! How convenient was it that Gargamel happened to find an abandon warehouse with everything in it that he needed to conjure up some evil spell against the Smurfs!? This movie was full of recycled material already seen in Alvin & The Chipmunks!! Not impressed with this television remark! I would rather watch paint dry!

B003AYPMBU|4.0|I love Priest and I love this cd/dvd. Only thing wrong with it in my opinion is all the camera movement in the opening song on the dvd. Totally ruins it (the first tune). Why do people that edit metal shows think that having 10 camera shots in 5 seconds is exciting? It's not. I'd rather be able to focus on the guys in the band for at least a few seconds at a time. Anyway, having said that, great performance!

034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers, the deput novel from Vanessa Diffenbaugh, is the story of one foster child, Victoria, and how she tries to deal with integration into the world after years of abuse from the foster system.  The novel opens with Victoria, newly 18, being emancipated and placed into a group home.  Victoria has severe social anxiety, no high school diploma, and no prospects.  The novel flashes between her attempts to establish her life after emancipation and her one chance of a stable home 10 years earlier with Elizabeth, a single woman looking for the love of a daughter.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers has a lot of hype as one of the big releases of the fall, and with good reason.  The novel is emotionally powerful.  And although the protagonist is horrible to many of the people around her, it's hard not to feel for this young woman who has only known true love once, just to have it taken away from her.  You can understand why she acts the way she does, and you hope to see it all work out for her in the end.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to readers of literary fiction.  It will make you think twice about foster care and what happens to those children no one wants.  And I don't think you'll make it through with a dry eye.  This is easily one of the best books I've read so far in 2011.
1400052181|5.0|I read this book fairly quickly because it was an easy, engaging, informative story. It flawlessly mixes science and history and the impact both had on the family of Henrietta Lacks. The author really does a great job of bringing this family to life. I felt sadness and frustration as I read. The author thoroughly explains the science part and does a wonderful job on the family history. I can easily see this book making mandatory reading lists for both HS and college students studying biology, sociology, or ethics.

1400052181|5.0|Having been born and raised in Roanoke (Henrietta's home town), when I first heard about the Hela line I started doing some research online. Most of what I found was of a scientific nature and made little mention of the woman from whom the cells were taken or her family. A couple of weeks I happened to come across this book in a book store and bought it on the spot. Turns out that was one of the best book choices I have ever made. The story of the Lacks family and what they have been through with these cells will break your heart. To know that the medical and scientific community, with a very few rare exceptions, has spent years profiting and making discoveries with the Hela line with no regard for the person they came from is deplorable. This book is SOOOO well written and the story is so fluid and wonderfully told if almost at time read like a work of fiction as opposed to non-fiction. I can highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a wonderful story, as well a lesson in how \\"normal\\" people are treated by the medical establishment.
1594200823|5.0|This book had a major impact on how I view food. I've long suspected some of what Pollan describes, and he validated many of my suspicions. Its amazing what most people, myself included, don't know about how food is grown and distributed. A great, educational book.
0439023521|4.0|To be honest, I was skeptical when I first picked up this book at the library. It's cover isn't heavilly decorated, though it reminds me of nazi propaganda. I was told that it was good, that a movie was coming out next year, and I better dang well have perused the pages before it hits the big screen or I'd be in such big trouble, missy.  It took the library 3 months to fill my reservation. At first I figured it was because they surely only had one copy. No. They have 600 copies in circulation and my hold was 950 in that queue. A little bit of dread has crept into me at this point. Am I holding the next twilight in my hands? Is this what I've waited for? More wasted time with a senseless monotony of creeper-ness and too eager teenage trailor trash?  I'm stopped three times before I leave the library. They want to know how I like it, gushing that it's so freaking amazing they can't stand it. I'm nearly mobbed before I manage to get out of the food court. I can't get out of the mall before I'm hit five more times by random passerbys. They all want to know my thoughts. It takes me nearly two hours to get back to my car, and the mall itself isn't even as big as a small high school. I throw myself into the car and close the door, at this point suspicious that someone might stop me on the road before I manage to get home. Dang it, people, I have no opinions at this point. I just got the darn thing!    It takes me two days to work up the courage to part the cover and expose the pages. It is 2am in the morning, and from that point I am rapt untill the sun rises. The book couldn't have been more attatched to my hands had you sown it to my skin.  The characters are lovingly flawed, the action is not overdone - and almost all the more compelling for it. The horror in contrast with the teenage reservations highlights the both splendidly. So take Battle Royale... splash it with a teaspoon of Brave New World, a salute to To Kill a Mockingbird, a dash of John Peel's 2099 and you have... well... This.  It's great. I devoured the thing in six hours. Now I have to somehow get my hands on the next book - no way I'm going to wait another 3 months for the farg'n library.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books.  Purchased for a cousin who recently lost his dog, it is filled with love and healing.   Highly recommended for anyone who has or has had a canine companion.  My only regret about \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is that, having already read it, I can never again read it for the first time and be enthralled by its surprises.  Buy two or more of these because you will surely wind up giving it as a gift as I have done repeatedly.

B00000J048|5.0|I bought two of these toys to mount on a board on the wall in my son's room, as both a toy and a decoration.   This has made one big rectangle that work together.  There are white pieces that fit on the backs of the gears that go into a plastic peg-board.   These pieces are a little hard to get on, because they are white pegs going into a white board.  We took a permanent marker and placed dots on the topside of each piece where the holes were to make lining it up a little easier.  The disks slide on great and move great as long as your little one doesn't pull upward.  The gears can be stacked one on top of eachother.  Because my son is young (under 2), we are just using the big disks and the two handles right now, which has simplified things.  As he gets a little bigger we'll add the other disks and build more layers.     My son likes this toy (likes gears) and was quick to pick up on how to assemble them, but as a few weeks have gone by, it isn't his go to toy.  He's still a little young for it.  The colors are attractive and the disks are a good size.   If your child still puts things in his/her mouth, the white pieces on the back could be a problem.

0156027321|5.0|I read this book two years ago and I still remember how it kept my interest throughout. Part of me cannot help but think that the bengal tiger is representative of our own fears, our demons within, and our constant struggle to adapt and overcome. A voyage of fantasy, fear, and ultimately, survival. Highly recommend it.
0380820846|3.0|STORY BRIEF:<br />Penelope is 28 years old, plain, shy, and a wallflower at dances.  She believes she will remain a spinster living with her mother.  She was secretly in love with Colin for years.  She spends a lot of time with her best friend Eloise who is Colin's sister.  Colin is a charming bachelor and likes Penelope as a friend.  Colin traveled a lot over the years but is back in London for a while and attending the ton parties.  The main topic of conversation at the parties is the secret identity of Lady Whistledown.  She has been writing a gossip column for more than ten years.  Lady Danbury announces that she will pay a thousand pounds to anyone who can discover Lady Whistledown's identity.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I was tired of the arguments and discussions about who was and was not Lady Whistledown.  I was not engaged or pulled in.  I was simply reading this to be able to write a review.  I really didn't care about the characters or events.  The last third was reasonably good.  And I did like discovering who LW was, but on balance I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />I might have been better if we saw Penelope change, but she didn't.  She was still the shy plain wallflower that she always was.  It would have been nice to see why or how Colin fell in love with Penelope.  It was too sudden with no reason.  So, there was no developing relationship to watch.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Story length: 370 pages.  Swearing language: mild with one occurrence of a religious swear word.  Sexual language: none to mild.  Number of sex scenes: one, 9 pages long.  Setting: 1824 to 1825 London, England.  Copyright: 2002.  Genre: historical romance.

The only negative is that if you loose any of the small 1 inch or so pieces then the game doesn't work as it is suppose to. Other than that great game and very addicting

034552554X|5.0|Victoria Jones, abandoned by her birth mother at only 3 weeks old, has been tossed around from foster home to foster home. She wasn't born an angry child, but she could not catch a break so she began to act out. Then, at the age of nine, she is placed with Elizabeth, a vineyard owner who desperately wants a child. It is with her that Victoria learns the almost extinct language of flowers, and now she has something to care about. However, the story doesn't end there. Things don't turn out the way Victoria wanted and now she has burned all her bridges. She is sent back to finish her childhood in a home until she is basically tossed out at 18 to live on the streets in San Francisco. The only thing she has is her language of flowers, but is that enough?<br /><br />There is so much that happens in this book. It is all so beautifully written that I didn't want to put it down. This will easily be in my top ten of 2011 list. I loved learning the meanings of flowers (and the inclusion of Victoria's Dictionary in the back of the book) and I can really understand the joy that Victoria got from the work she does with flowers. All of the characters were extremely well-developed and likable. The romance is believable instead of being forced. I can't stress that point enough. An actual realistic type of relationship is a breath of fresh air. Victoria Jones is a character that stole my heart from page one and would not let go until I turned that final page.

B00004YX39|5.0|Gaucho is Steely Dan's greatest artistic achievement, and may go down in the annals of American cultural history, along with William Burroughs' Naked Lunch and Allen Ginsburg's Howl!, as among the most powerful evocations of the underside of American prosperity in the era following World War II. What makes Gaucho different from these is that it isn't merely an expression of alienation, but demonstrates and is itself a means of redemption from the self-destructive escapism to which so many of the era fell prey.<br /><br />The central characters of each of these songs has been described as a \\"loser,\\" but these portraits often go beyond sardonic mockery and disdain to deeply-felt empathy and self-reflection. The title track is a ballad about a cuckolded and humiliated homosexual lover, a middle-aged agent for a new, young singing talent. At the time this song was written, open homosexuality among entertainers was taboo, unlike today. But the lyrics don't invite contempt from the listener. Instead, wrapped by a sensuous horn melody and compelling syncopated, counterpoint rhythm, they induce listeners to share the speaker's anguish and heartache: note the subtle change in the chorus, from \\"Why is he standing in your spangled leather pancho and your elevator shoes,\\" to \\"your spangled leather pancho with the studs that match your eyes\\".  In this perceptive detail we feel the adoration the agent has for the young man, even after expressing his anger and frustration.<br /><br />The same pathos, in a simpler tale, is the foundation of \\"Third World Man,\\" about several Vietnam War veterans suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome. They are  emblematic of Fagen and Becker's take on each of the central characters in these tracks:  they aren't merely losers, they are victims as well as carriers of a soulless culture, as Fagen and Becker themselves came to recognize about themselves. In Gaucho, the tracks are the songwriters' own redemption from the overindulgence in drugs, sex andalcohol, that threatened to destroy them. Their art says, \\"We all suffer, but there is a way out of hell, and this is it\\" -- poetry set to music in performances that move and heal us.<br /><br />Steely Dan's unique contribution to music was a new synthesis of jazz, blues and rock that became a platform for an increasingly philosophical assessment of their era. Gaucho shows how far Fagen and Becker had come from their early rejection of mainstream America and embrace of hedonism, to a more mature understanding of themselves, their music and the human experience. Gaucho is a masterpiece that transcends its genre.
0670022411|4.0|When Diana Bishop, a scholar working on alchemical research in England for an upcoming conference, requests a manuscript from the Bodelian library, she unwittingly sets off a chain of events that will change her life forever. You see, Diana is a reluctant witch who comes from a long line of very powerful spell casters, and though she has forcefully denied her power and magic after the horrific deaths of her parents many years ago, her magic is about to come crashing down all around her. The manuscript in question is called Ashamole 782, and when Diana recalls it from the library, she inadvertently casts a spell that opens the enchanted book, which has been lost for thousands of years. Soon the library is filled with curious and malevolent witches, daemons and vampires, all hungry for the secrets that Ashamole 782 is hiding. Into this mix of curious creatures comes Matthew Clairmont, a very powerful and exceptionally handsome vampire, who seems to take an unusual interest in Diana. But this is a problem because vampires and witches can never mix, according to old customs and laws. However, Matthew is not to be deterred, and before Diana knows it, she's in over her head not only with unexpected feelings for Matthew, but with protecting Ashamole 782 from greedy and vicious creatures who wish to plunder it for their own ends. So begins an epic tale of forbidden love between two very powerful creatures who are on the run to protect not only themselves and their unspeakable relationship, but the magical book that may contain the secret history and future of the daemons, witches and vampires who long to possess it. Thrilling, provocative, and enthralling, A Discovery of Witches takes its readers on a fantastical and magical journey of epic proportions and leaves them spellbound and hungry for more.<br /><br />I'd heard a lot about this book before picking it up and had remembered that Steph had reviewed it for BookPage earlier this year and had fallen in love with it. I normally pay attention when Steph falls in love with a book because I think she has great taste, so when I was looking for something to get engrossed in over the long weekend, I decided to pick this one up and give it a shot. It was sort of a dicey proposition because before reading the book I wasn't sure how I felt about books that carried heavy paranormal elements, and aside from the Harry Potter books, this was a relatively new genre for me. Despite my reservations, when I really got into this book, I was totally hooked, and found that the book mixed the elements of The Outlander series with the magic and wizardry of the Harry Potter saga. There was even a little bit of Twilight in here (to my dismay) but this book was much more entrancing that Twilight could ever hope to be.<br /><br />There was a lot going on in this book. From interspecies love affairs, to secret manuscripts and societies, to time travel and magic, to academia and intrigue, this book had it all. It was the kind of story you can't help but get invested in quickly because it was so vivid and perfectly imagined. The characters (which were a well developed and varied lot) were not stereotypical and this was a great feature because often it's too easy to fall into stereotypes within the framework of a paranormal tale. I also liked the myths and backstories that Harkness created behind the various creatures. They each had their own defining features and special talents, and I was surprised that she varied a bit from the usual vampire lore to create a subtly different species than what I had come to expect. The book was long by anyone's standards, but it never felt arduous or overwritten, and the story was consistently morphing between its different elements, making it all seem fresh and exciting. A lot of space was given over to the practice of magic, which is another thing I enjoyed. It was all so refreshing and clever, and the worldbuilding was also done exceptionally well. Each of these componentsfelt very organic and was written with aplomb and energy that gave the story a life and mythology of its own.<br /><br />The Matthew and Diana contingent was one that was easy to enjoy because of the obvious sparks between them and the fact that their love was forbidden. There was a whiff of the exotic when it came to the very touching and sensual interactions between them. I may have swooned a little bit when reading about Matthew's romantic overtures. Though they tried mightily to stay away from each other, it was obvious that they would find a way to be together despite the danger their relationship created, even if it started a war between the supernatural creatures. Which it did. Like the vampires that we have come to know, Matthew could be possessive and overbearing, but in a flash of brilliance, Harkness created her Matthew as a genetic scientist who was obsessed with finding out the secrets behind the singularities of the different species of creatures. He was a very intense character, full of passion and drive, and he had a very strict set of ethics that were difficult to sway. Diana, on the other hand, was somewhat reserved on the outside but very conflicted on the inside. Often plagued by anxiety, she relished physical endeavors and was stubbornly resolute about refusing to embrace her inner witch. These two players were very different, resulting in a lot of friction that generated some very bright sparks. It was lovely to watch them slowly melting towards each other, despite their instincts telling them that it was not safe to do so.<br /><br />Between the mysteries of the enchanted manuscript, the malevolent witches and vampires out to destroy Diana, and the secret world of magic that lay just beyond human eyes, A Discovery of Witches was filled with action and adventure. Subtle quirks in the storyline were also really appreciated, like the house that had ideas and behaviors of its own and the delicious history of Matthew's vampire family living in France. It was the type of book that you pick up for only a moment, and before you know it, hours have passed. Danger, love, creatures, fabulist science, and old grudges mixed themselves into a delicious hodgepodge of a book that I couldn't tear myself away from. The only quibble I had with it was discovering very close to the end that the book ended on a cliffhanger that will be resolved in future books. Oh, what I wouldn't give to have the next installment in my hot little hands right now! The book was intense and mystifying, and it continually surprised me with its inventive plot and the strength of the amorous relationship between two very different creatures.<br /><br />This was a tremendously entertaining book, and it came at just the right time for me, as I had been gorging on much more depressing reads for many weeks now. Unexpectedly, this book took on a life of its own as I read, and read, and read. I exclaimed to anyone that would listen that I found a new favorite, and that's saying a lot for me. If you're even mildly curious about this book, I would strongly urge you to pick it up and give it a try. It will surprise you for sure, and keep you guessing all the way to the final page.

0446547603|4.0|I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books and enjoyed them all.  Safe Haven was another page turner but I thought he overdid the ending scenes.  With the descriptions of the fire and what Kevin and Katie were going through, they would have been dead before the end of the story.  I doubt that any human being could drink two or three bottles of vodka day after day and still function as Nicholas had Kevin doing. He was practically dead in one scene and shortly after that he was chasing Katie (Erin) with knife or gun. Too much violence at the end and generally Sparks does not do this.  But I will now read The Choice and will continue to read the Sparks novels.
0385534639|4.0|In this enchanting novel of surreal imaginings and epic proportions, a battle unlike any you have ever encountered is enacted in a venue of dreamlike splendor. When two very powerful magicians decide to play a game that pits two of their students against each other magically, the consequences are far reaching and unexpected. For Celia, the daughter of the world famous Prospero the Enchanter, the competition that she will one day be engaged in means nothing to her other then ceaseless practice and mystery. To Marco, a boy who is being trained by the mysterious man known only as Alexander, the realities of the completion mean one day testing his skill against one whose abilities could possibly surpass his own. When the two elder magicians decide to create a magical circus as a venue to house this strange and volatile competition, the circus develops a life of its own. And the life of this particular circus is one of strange magical wonder and enchantments so unusual that it defies the understanding of even those who are charged to keep its secrets. As Celia and Marco use their venue for more and more abstract displays of their magic, a life and society begins to bubble up. The circus has a way of enchanting and ensnaring even the most casual observers, pushing the limits of comprehension and belief into the realm of imagination and dream. But when unexpected events threaten to not only end the competition but tear the beloved circus apart, Celia and Marco must take drastic steps to protect what they've built, and strangely enough, to protect each other, though the rules of the competition forbid this. With utter beauty and dreamlike interpretation, Erin Morgenstern gives us the brilliance and beauty of The Night Circus, and shares a space where imagination and power flow freely into the darkness, creating a brilliant and beautiful light.<br /><br />I don't think that anything I can say will do justice to this incredible book. At once wise and strange, the story was like nothing I've ever read before, full of bewitchment and wonder, but also very heavily steeped in character creation of the best kind. The book was a melange of lots of different elements, from the very unusual and fierce aspects of the competition to the more emotional sides that dealt with loyalty, compassion and love. What I enjoyed most was the Morgenstern's ability to conjure up the kinds of astonishing imagery that appeared behind each black and white tent flap in her beguiling circus of magic.<br /><br />There was just so much going on in this tale, from the use of potent and involving storytelling to the intense color and object symbolism, to the impressive themes and ideas that lie quietly underneath it all. But the good news is that it can be read on several different levels, and a first cursory read will probably be just as satisfying as a re-read in the aims of picking it all apart and discovering the clues and cues that Morgenstern so cleverly sprinkles throughout. Each small aspect of this tale was interconnected beautifully with all of its larger parts, which gave the story a great feeling of cohesiveness and life. Because of it's fairy tale like feel and scope, certain aspects felt wonderfully alive and orchestrated, while other smaller bits felt like they just fell into the perfect place organically. It was a clever mix of storytelling and visual description that seemed to defy any preconceived ideas that I had placed upon it, and it was also a story that keep me trapped within its pages until its final and very unexpected conclusion.<br /><br />A lot of this tale was just dripping with magic and alchemy, and as such, it reminded me a little of a mix between the Harry Potter books and the story in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell. It wasn't what I would call magical realism, as this world was almost completely overrun by magic and sorcery, so I would have to say it was more like a magical fable that openly portrayed characters that had one foot planted in the magical world, and one foot out. Some of the ways this magic was manifested was in the various exhibits at the circus, and let me tell you, a lot of these exhibits were wonderful, colorful, and strange. Glass bottles that captured pungent sensations and scenes through smell, labyrinths made of clouds that one could get lost in, and exotic ice gardens that were precise down to their smallest elements, Morgenstern captures them all with a heady mix of the dreamlike and surreal to share with her readers and characters alike, morphing the circus around and around the magicians who seek to outdo each other.<br /><br />Though their prime focus began as outdoing one another, soon a strange fascination between the two springs up, which puts the competition and its irreversible results in jeopardy, for this is a competition that one of the magicians won't walk away from. Though it seems that it's all one big game of skill and exhibition, the realities are far grimmer and will lead to a heartbreaking choice that will forever change the circus and those who have grown to love it. There's a stark inevitability here, and it shapes and forms all the people who have come build and love this particular circus, especially those who are using it to play their very dangerous and calculating game. Through the mesmerizing permutations of the tale, the fate of the magical circus is amplified across the hearts of its performers and creators, and it will take one stunning act of love and loyalty to undo the cataclysmic magic that both holds it together, and tears it apart.<br /><br />This was a story told not only with fluidity and grace, but with an unerring sense of allurement and a perfectly crafted set of characters and narrative. It was not only a pleasure to read, but a pleasure to ponder over in many ways. While eagerly flipping through the pages, I came to feel a sense of excitement and wonder, almost as if I was seeing this strange and magical circus with my very own eyes. It's rare to come across a book about enchantments that literally enchants the reader while they're exploring it, but this is the feat that The Night Circus manages so brilliantly.

B002IFT1ZA|4.0|George RR  Martin's \\"Fire and Ice\\"  book series is a 5 star series. If you like this show, please read the books because you will love them! They are works of art:) I enjoyed them SO much more than I did the Tolkien books. The 5 books thusfar are: The Game of Thrones, The Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast For Crows, A Dance With Dragons.      They did a very good job making this for HBO. The casting was brilliant and the acting was superb. The scenery and ambiance were perfect. The dragons were beautifully rendered and I am so anxious to see how much the direwolves evolve next year! The casting for next season looks amazing. Brienne, Davos, Stannis, Jaq and Gilly look PERFECT for their parts. I've read all 5 books in the last couple months and Jon Snow's sad eyes haunt my days. The actor Kit portrays him beautifully on HBO as a tortured soul.     The only thing stopping this show from being a 5 star rating for me was that they put a vulgar  spin to it. They made up several \\"Jerry Springer\\" type sex scenes that were not in the books. It wasn't necessary for the producers to trash-up these books. The books were very erotic as they were LOL! I expected a serious R+ rating due to violence and sex but they really perplexed me in their adaption regarding this. It felt like a hormonal 14 year old boy rewrote all the sex scenes to thrill his teenage buddies. And gleefully decided to add dangling boobs to half the scenes, even if the scenes in the book had people clothed.    It was a really good adaption though and I anxiously await next season. They did a respectful homage to the books, in almost every aspect but the one.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love the Twilight saga.  I own the books and have read them multiple times.  I am about to buy them for my Kindle so I can read them on the go but I just did the math and it is a dollar more to buy the four books then it is to buy each book individually.  Why would that be???
B0058A119G|5.0|I am admittedly an unabashed Streisand fan who owns everything she has ever recorded from Pins and Needles and I Can Get It for you Wholesale to Live at the Village Vanguard, but in her recent recordings, while I have loved them, I have also felt a little twinge of sadness that her powerful voice has certainly aged.  While I knew I would purchase this new CD (and yes I bought the deluxe set) I thought, hmmm, I hope it's going to live up to her earlier recordings and worried that the second CD which has several cuts from one of the best if not thee best pop album she ever recorded (The Way We Were album) might have the effect of accentuating the older, less powerful voice BUT WOW WAS I WRONG!  SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!!  I don't know where this voice comes from but other than a few husky (but welcome) crackles on the higher notes which perfectly into the song's theme, the new recordings more than stand up against the old.  She sounds better than Village Vanguard and Love is the Answer. WAY BETTER!  The first a capella lines of Windmills of Your Mind enrapture you and draw you in and her voice is lush adn deep with tremendous range throughout the entire recording.  As with any new Streisand record, you have to listen to it over and over, to find new favorites, new phrasings, new insights into the lyrics each time you listen to it.  Her way around a lyric and orchestration are better than any other recording artist -- EVER!  Some reviews will say it's too mushy, mellow, slow paced, but c'mon these are love songs and she's 69!!!!!!!!  You won't be disappointed if you buy this CD and you will be amazed at how GREAT SHE SOUNDS!  This one will go up there with the Way We Were, Higher Ground, and Broadway Album as some of her best recordings.  There is not one bad song, there is not one song out of place on the entire album, JUST BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!  Grab a glass of wine, lower the lights, put in the CD and be mesmerized all over again by the most amazing singer of all time.  She captures the \\"story\\" of every song, every emotion and delivers yet another memorable album that will stand the test of time.  KUDOS BARBRA!!!!!!!!!
0545123275|4.0|Is it normal for a sixteen year old girl to sit in her yard or stare from her window to watch the wolves in the forest behind her house.  It has been for Grace ever since she was bitten by wolves when she was young. In particular she is watching for that one wolf who saved her from certain death when the rest of the pack attacked.<br /><br />Sam has kept a watchful eye on Grace since that day she survived the wolf attack.  Whether it was from the forest at her backyard, or from one of his assorted summer jobs, he has been concerned for her.  During this time, Sam has led a most unusual life, boy in summer and wolf in winter.<br /><br />This is essentially the modern re-telling of a classic tale of a love not meant to be.  Boy wants girl, girl wants boy but circumstances stand in their way.  I found this a fresh approach to a story that could have been very predictable.  I enjoyed the character of Sam.  He never totally accepts his situation, but he deals with it in a mature fashion.  Grace is a bit whiny for me.  She mopes around quite a bit, staring at the forest.  Come on girl, get a back bone.  I would have liked to spend more time with Beck.  He has spent only his adult years changing and has a career as well unlike the other wolves.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable tale.<br /><br />This unabridged version was produced by Scholastic Audio, 10 hours 43 minutes.

159514188X|4.0|I found this book at a yard sale and grabbed it... Not sure if I would have bought this at a book store at full price had I just read the description - but I'm glad I got it!         It was a little hard for me to focus at first with the 2 different narratives going on.. but once I did, it was a VERY fast read. I think ALL middle/high schoolers should be required to read this - it really makes you realize the consequences of your words and actions...even something that you may think is small or minute, could be life changing for someone else .... very very very thought provoking! I finished it yesterday and have found myself thinking about it constantly since then..

As we each grow up we have to make choices.  Do we follow our own path or do we listen to our parents and the others around us and follow their led and expectations.  Similar to the wolves, do they blindly accept that the weather gets cold you become  a wolf, or do you take Cole's lead and ask questions to really determine what is happening.

0071752854|5.0|Pitch Anything takes a really good look at what works and what doesn't when presenting (or \\"pitching\\"), and then gives useful instruction to make pitches work.  Nothing in the book could be considered \\"rocket science\\", but much of it is actually counter-intuitive, until pointed out.  The framework for this book was written mostly around those pitching investment deals or new business opportunities, but the principles could be used for anything (particularly for job-hunting/interviewing).  In fact, I've found myself thinking in these terms in my daily life.  I highly recommend!
0553582038|3.0|Martin has created a very interesting world, but he has clearly hit the limits of his ability to spin a narrative and tell a story. This book is plodding and muddled. By the time you're here, you're probably reading for plot, but the plot is so fragmented (and, for hundreds of pages at a time, NONEXISTENT). Then at times Martin will have written himself into a corner and you'll find out 10 huge developments through the dialogue of two minor characters who have heard of these things fourthhand or fifthhand. Basically the book is a mess and probably readers would be better off just stopping after Clash of Kings.    Books like this make you appreciate the mind-boggling skill of a Tolkein or Rowling, able to handle this many characters and this much complexity while maintaining a compelling narrative. Martin reached his limit as a storyteller two books ago.    Maybe someday he can check his ego and let a good editor revise this series, because there is quality material when you filter out all the irrelevant dawdling and gratuitous violence. (My other primary complaint with Martin is his mysogynistic, belittling attitudes toward his female characters).
0553801473|2.0|I read the first four books consecutively. After Feast I thought, ok, I get it, we're slowing down a bit. I appreciated that Martin was letting us take a breath after the conclusion of Storm, allowing the major and minor characters to evolve, and letting us see his world in more detail. I expected the same with Dance, or at least the first two-thirds of it (the corresponding length of Feast). I also didn't have any expectations about what should or should not happen by the end of Dance. I just wanted to see how Martin handled the `other half' (position them) for the, well, war is an understatement. Martin is going to put us through hell.<br /><br />For the record, I am one of those who hope that Tyrion never reaches Dany.<br /><br />But there is something \\"off\\" with Dance. The haters are off the mark but so are the lovers. Dance is great, but repetitive. Many readers have remarked on the endless, needless, description in the book. It's not that Martin's detail doesn't set the mood for each character in their respective arcs. It's that the endless description tends to overlap, again, and again, between each POV (the middle of the book). When the POVs are read independently (I read the book once through and a second time by loosely grouped POVs - the North and Meereen), the story is tight, very descriptive, but tight.<br /><br />Martin has said that if he could do it all over again, he would (five year gap). The Five Year Gap concerns the age of the protagonists, the potential twiddling of the Other's thumbs after the brutal attack on the Fist - not to mention all of the wildling wight fodder after Stannis's attack. It is a fair criticism of Martin's `grow in the telling' style of writing. How could someone so brilliant not see the drawbacks of an over reliance on flashbacks?<br /><br />Whether you now (still) love Martin, or hate Martin, he has acknowledged his oversight, and his commitment to finishing (fixing) this story is Feast and Dance. When read together, Feast and Dance are simply a mess. When read separately, they are kind of boring, well written but kind of snoozy. I wonder if it would have been better to publish a series of novellas.<br /><br />And, is it just me that notices a certain check-off list on Martin's agenda? Plague caused by rats. Check. Disease that follows (pale mare...yawn). Check. A list of freaks (better get those in before I go back to Westeros). Check. Old Man River - No, Old Man Turtle. Whatever, check. Better not miss any atrocities. Check. Any obvious correlation to past human events? Check. I guess Martin feels that he can re-invent the wheel. Most of us that know anything about the history of humanity know it has been brutal. I guess Martin has something new to add? If anything, he fails miserably.  George kind of pansied out on the real threats. Did any reader feel threatened by spreading disease? I didn't, but wanted to.<br /><br />The story is also becoming contrived and predictable. C'mon, George, you could have thrown us a more meaty bone than having another persona switcheroo ex outanowhere. I think George has flashes of brilliant imagination, but he is just not that imaginative. The more he extends the story, the more we see his lack of imagination, and the more he makes corollaries to actual history to make up for it. Yawn again.<br /><br />Too bad. George's universe was best left with mystery. This may be the case in the future, but now George seems pedantic, and it's just annoying - like any other talking head that thinks he can fix the world. Yawn. Let's see your treatise. Doubt we will ever see it. Put up or shut up. George has become a predictable whiner. Sad to see.<br /><br />I was relieved when Jon was finally assassinated. That's at least something.

B0042KZJ5K|5.0|Amazon has an unfortunate habit of grouping ALL the reviews for ALL issues of an album. This CD - the 2011 \\"10th Anniversary\\" release was released YESTERDAY (8/24/11) and yet there are over 400 reviews posted. Take a look and you will see that nearly all of them are from 10 years ago (2001) when the film and soundtrack came out. Those are not relevant to the new edition. Also, recent reviews were about the seller or the shipping or the packaging. That's NOT a review of the album. This is.<br /><br />While I do not own the original \\"deluxe\\" edition from 2001, I reviewed (elsewhere) the single CD which sold in the millions. The new one - contains the original 60 minute CD ans well as Disc Two - marked as \\"Bona Fide Rarities and Unreleased Tracks\\". He 14 tracks on this 35-minute disc include recordings of songs performed in the film and not on Disc One plus six songs not used in the film. Many are short - the longest being John Hartford's instrumental \\"Hogfoot\\", that clocks in at just under four minutes. There are tracks by Norman Blake, The Cox Family and the Fairfield Four among others. The crisp sound of the \\"hammers\\" on \\"Tom Devil\\" by Ed Lewis & The Prisoners sounds great coming from my speakers.<br /><br />This film - and its soundtrack introduced a whole new audience to \\"roots\\" and \\"American\\" folk music. And the concert tour by artists like Gillian Welch, Chris Thomas King and The Whites in 2001 and 2002 did the same. And this is the album that gave producer T. Bone Burnett his well-deserved fame.<br /><br />The package includes a booklet with notes by Burnett and DJ Robert K. Oermann plus short bios of the artist. They are not as easy to read as one who hope (because of the brown background behind the text.).<br /><br />A nicely done package. And I'm glad to have the bonus material missing from my original copy.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

B004UXUUDA|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the year. There are two interlocking plots. The first focuses on Sarah's experience in 1942. She, age 10, her parents, and her brother, age 5, whom she loves dearly, live in a small apartment in France. The Nazis come to take them away and kill them because they are Jewish. Sarah decides to save her brother. She hides him in a closet within a paneled wall and locks it with a key. She tells her brother not to make a sound nor try to come out until she returns, and she promises the frightened boy that she will return. The Nazis make her return impossible. She and her parents are driven to a concentration camp and her parents are murdered there. Although a long time has passed, she is determined to return to her brother and keep her promise. She never lets go of the key, neither then nor for the rest of her life. She escapes from the concentration camp and is helped by non-Jewish husband and wife farmers. They rushed to the apartment and....<br /><br /> The second plot focuses on a journalist in the present who writes about the hellish butchery of the Jews by the French. The journalist's husband now owns/possesses the Jewish family's apartment, and she learns the story of Sarah and her key. She feels that she is unable to live in this apartment because of its history, even though her husband had it totally remolded, and....<br /><br /> She feels driven to find out what happened to Sarah. Did she escape the Nazi clutches? If yes, where is she now? How did she cope with her experiences and especially with the events surrounding the key? What she discovers is tragic in many ways, especially, in my mind, the affect it had on her, and that she furthered the Nazi plan to rid the world of Jews, because....<br /><br /> I do not want to disclose what I indicated with ellipses. These facts are powerful and should be seen.
B005HBP75K|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this dark & disturbing show. However, Season 4 seems to drag out and lose steam.  It's  the same thing one episode after another. Nothing really new happens and it gets stuck in constant character mode, where the writers want to continue to build on the same characters as if we have not seen the first 3 seasons.  Yes, we know Walt and Skyler are having problems in a weird relationship and we know Hank and Marie also have a problematic relationship but do we need to spend half the show on it week after week? The big drama is Jesse traveling around with Mike.  Really?  That's it?  Zzzzzzzzzzzz<br /><br />UPDATE: 5 stars.. Talk about an ending ...  Wholly crap!!  Simply fantastic!

140053271X|1.0|My nook froze within a few days, as the user guide is ON THE NOOK I had to go to the internet to find info on what to do.  I was directed to the online nook user guide (on B+N.com) which told me to remove the back cover and unplug the battery for a hard reboot.  It didn't work and after an hour with a worthless tech support agent I'm informed that those directions are for the original nook, and that I will need to get a brand new one.  Best yet.... Removing the cover has now voided my warranty!! Quite simply the worst customer service experience I have ever had, although the nook was fun to use for the ~48 hours it worked.
055357342X|4.0|Like many others have written before me, these are masterfully written books, and this 3rd installment is no exception. The plot twists, detail, and character development are truly amazing. These books are Tolkienesque in their detail, creating rich, full worlds for us to immerse in. However, they are quite different from Tolkien in that Martin is more interested in moral complexity than good triumphing over evil. We don't get any wholly good guys or bad guys, they are all a very mixed bag. And while I appreciate this intellectually, I have to admit that it wears on me at times. Sometimes I find myself really wishing for a character to wholeheartedly root for. This 3rd book was especially damning in that respect because the two female characters I had become most attached suffered devastating fates. The violence in these books also grates on me at times, especially the mention of rape every 2-3 pages. I also had hoped for the supernatural aspects of the tale to advance more in this installment.<br /><br />But overall, these are minor complaints, and subjective. I keep reading, because at this point Martin's world is part of my own, and I am invested. That is always the sign of a great series.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|great movie for adults as well as children loads of laughs adventure and great songs hopefully their will be a sequel
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I was prepared to be disappointed in this film, after all the hype, and all the positive reviews. But I wasn't. I was riveted the entire time, and very moved in the end. I thought every single person turned in a stunning performance - Ralph Fiennes is breathtaking as Voldemort, as is Alan Rickman as Snape, all three young leads, and the fabulous British supporting cast. It was great to see so many of the latter back, albeit briefly.<br /><br />As for the plot, you won't follow it unless you've read the books and/or seen the other films. The action revolves around Harry and his friend's search for the final horcuxes - pieces of Voldemort's soul he's hidden away for safekeeping - and the climactic battle that ensues. And the battle at Hogwarts is epic, truly marking this as a timeless film about good and evil, what is worth fighting for and what is worth loving. It is moving and deep, and it is very adult - this is not a children's, or even really a young-adult, story or film at this point.<br /><br />One thing that not many others have mentioned about this series is the spiritual aspects, which is part of why it is a favorite series of mine, and I think this is carried off really well in this film. Harry's meeting 'in the light' with Dumbledore is handled brilliantly, without being sappy or preachy. Snape's discussion with Dumbledore re: why Harry must die, and the Christ-like message regarding his role as a saviour, is also handled with a deft touch. The result is a movie with many universal spiritual themes that does not come off as preachy or sentimental.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think this could have been done better. I am sad to see it end, but so thrilled that the conclusion was so satisfying in every way.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Most times, movie studios choose to make sequels because they either want to make a quick cash-in based on the popularity of a film franchise or continue the story the first installment established. Evangelion 2.22 is both yet it does not feel like a cheap quick-buck film nor does it feel rushed in regards to the pacing in its' story. The sequel expands on what the first film covered and continues to do so. To keep this review spoiler-free, I'll just explain what's already been known. We are introduced to new characters, specifically Mari Makinami, who you see at the very beginning of the film taking on one of the Angels, term given to alien beings that descend from space, in one of the most exciting and well-executed battles in the film. The second \\"new\\" character is Asuka Shikinami, who we see battle an angel around the first 15 minutes of the film. Like in the original series, Asuka sees herself as superior to Shinji and Rei concerning piloting an Eva and things don't start too well when they are first introduced. Meanwhile, Gendo Ikari, Shinji's father, is still just as secretive as he was in the series and in the last film but as we progress into the film, more details surface concerning what he has planned for Nerv headquarters and to the world population. The film loosely covers episodes 8-19 of the original series. Old fans will notice several references and changes to the story around the first hour but the film then takes a very wild and unique direction near the final 15 minutes. Believe me when I say this, you'll be eager to know what happens next and wonder how the director and producers will be able to top this. Take note that the film does not have an MPAA rating like the first film did. Evangelion 1.11 was released with a PG-13 rating; this was released unrated so I'll list what you need to watch for if kids younger than 15 are watching. Concerning content, this film is very violent and the battles between the Evas and the Angels can get quite bloody especially the fight between Eva unit-01 and Eva unit-03. There is some profanity, some of it is audible and some is covered with sound effects. There is [only] one audible F word at the very beginning of the film, before the movie title shows up. There is no sex whatsoever in the film but there are a few scenes with little nudity but it is not presented in a sexual manner. There are thematic elements throughout the film, focused mostly on Shinji's distant relationship with his father, Asuka's social detachment from people, and Rei's attempts to reach Shinji in a emotional method. Overall, this was an excellent film that will attract even non-fans of the series and individuals who are even remotely interested in anime. And blu-ray is the way to go! Highly recommended!especially the fight between Eva unit-01 and Eva unit-03. There is some profanity, some of it is audible and some is covered with sound effects.

0439023521|4.0|It's a novel about survival in a brutal, brutal cruel and crazy world.  I kept wondering, is the author trying to give us a message about our reality voyeuristic TV crazy world of today?  And honestly, as much as I am sickened about the crap that gets passed on as \\"entertainment\\" on TV today - I still found it hard to believe that anyone in 21st century America could enjoy a real \\"Hunger Games\\" - fighting to the death for the sole purpose of satisfying the requirements of \\"the state\\".  But, that being said - and the chilling brutality never made me feel comfortable, I enjoyed the novel for it's suspense, action and just great story telling.  There's a bit, just a bit, of a love story & in fact that is a crazy juxtaposition against the brutal heartless world of the Hunger Games. It's a well written, well told story - and not predictable.  That makes it a good read in my mind - and of course there's a \\"series\\", so yes - I'm looking to buy Book 2!  Definitely recommend.

It was a huge disappointment and I could not recommend to anyone with a component audio system. The sound is raw and edgy rather than being smooth like my old Sony which died. Cds take longer to load, something like 30 seconds, than discs on my DVD player. Pass on this TEAC CD-P650 player.

B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I was biased listening to this the first time, because I love both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi's music.  I'll admit that the first time I listened to the album, I was a little taken back, because it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  It's definitely not a blues/rock album.  At first, I would skip the slower songs to listen to \\"Bound For Glory\\", \\"Learn How To Love\\", and \\"Love Has Something Else to Say\\", which are all awesome songs.  But the more I listen to it, the more I appreciate \\"Ball and Chain\\" and \\"Easy Way Out\\".  I think everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously do not understand how anyone could think that Susan Tedeschi's voice is \\"grating\\".  Her voice is amazing, always on.  My wife and I just saw them in Albuquerque, and it was absolutely amazing.  I will say that this album doesn't capture how great they are in concert, but I think that's the way it is supposed to be.  Great bands should be better in concert than they sound on the album.  The album gets you familiar with the songs, and then they can change and improvise the songs in concert.      Derek's playing on the album is great.  Maybe more understated than on the DTB albums.  But his solo on \\"Love Has Something Else to Say\\" is just ridiculous.  He plays riffs that are completely out of left field, and I love that.  I love his slide playing, but I don't think he gets enough credit for his non-slide playing.  I think I enjoy hearing him play without his slide even more.  He plays scales and riffs that nobody else plays.  There are a lot of players with technical skill who can shred on the guitar, but they don't have anything original or interesting to play.  On the other hand, there are some people who aren't technically skilled, but you can tell there's soul behind their playing.  They have something to say.  Derek is one of the handful of people in the world who has both.  He's amazingly talented and technically skilled, but he uses that to say something, to add to the song, notjust to impress people with how fast he can play pentatonic scales.      Overall, a great album.  I hope this band will stick together for at least one or two more albums.

B005F82X48|4.0|Tooth & Nail Records \\"other female-fronted band\\" have just released their debut album, \\"Scripted\\". A mixture of punk rock, synth pop and great lyrics are the result. Let's get to the review!     \\"Scripted\\" throws open the curtains with a suspenseful intro to \\"Theatre\\", a heavy-hitting song about living life beyond the script. Ariel's punk vocals hit you in the face with urgency, the music is great, and the lyrics really pack a meaning. \\"Make A Move\\" is the single from \\"Scripted\\" and urges us not to compromise. \\"Make A Move\\" is more in the style of their EP's, carrying that same raw sound as songs like \\"Fall Apart\\" and \\"Call Me Alive\\". \\"Make A Move\\" is one of the best tracks off \\"Scripted\\".     When I first heard \\"Get Well\\", I was really surprised as Icon For Hire never did any synth pop on their EPs. However, it was a nice surprise, and I really like the \\"new\\" sound. The lyrical theme is very different than a listener normally hears, with lyrics such as \\"And being lonely's only fun in a group/It sort of loses its charm when it's true\\" but the lyrics of \\"Get Well\\" are a message that needs to be heard. \\"The Grey\\" follows, and is one of the three older songs Icon For Hire chose to re-do. This version is beautiful and doesn't differ much from the EP version. Ariel's vocals are more polished here, and there are minor lyrical differences. Another standout track.     \\"Off With Her Head\\" follows, and I have to say, while the \\"Scripted\\" version is awesome, I like the EP version better. The EP version had more of a raw punk feel while the cd version sounds very polished with a bit of pop influence. It all depends on your tastes! \\"Off With Her Head\\" is one of my favorite Icon For Hire songs lyrically, with Ariel pleading to God, \\"Don't let go I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this, death is mine I know, Don't let go, don't let go, Savior!\\"    \\"Fight\\" can be considered an anthem for all of those who have gone through their lives and taken a lot of pain. \\"Fight\\" brings crunching guitars that blend with Ariel's beautiful vocals, the unique bridge is definitely \\"ear-catching\\"  and this song is sure to be a fan favorite. \\"Up In Flames\\" doesn't bring anything new to the musical table, however it's a very good track with empowering lyrics. \\"Iodine\\" is another standout track about how we know what we need to do to recover, but keep \\"temporarily\\" fixing things. \\"I don't like pain but I bring it to life, I don't like scars but I'm good with a knife, I don't like tears but I'm starting to cry when I realize I'm destroying my life.\\" \\"Iodine\\" really brings the energy as well as the message.     \\"Only A Memory\\" (Known as \\"Pernilla\\" to we older fans) is my personal favorite Icon For Hire song. That being said, I like the slight musical changes they made to this song, as well as how great Ariel sounds singing. But what I really miss in the \\"Scripted\\" version is the screaming. The screaming of \\"I won\\"t bend, I won't break, I will, not, BREAK!\\" made the EP version absolutely perfect. I know Icon For Hire doesn't have a screamer anymore, but I wish they would've had one of the many Tooth & Nail screamo bands guest. \\"Only A Memory\\" is still an amazing track, and Ariel did do a great job replacing the screams with her vocals. The lyrics to \\"Only A Memory\\" really pack a punch, and many fans will relate to this song.     \\"Pieces\\" closes out the album, and I'm glad Icon For Hire chose to end the song on an energetic note instead of a ballad. Ariel dishes out some tough love on \\"Pieces\\" and straight up tells us to pick up the pieces and get our lives right with God. This was a great song choice to leave the listener with.     Over the past few years, Icon For Hire's musical style has developed from punk/rock/screamo to a blend of punk/rock/synth pop. Icon For Hire has a great sound with lyrics a lot better than their secular counterparts. While their slight style change has them borrowing a lot from bands like Paramore, Evanescence, and Flyleaf, Icon ForHire still puts their own unique stamp on each song. They may not change the script entirely, but they're well on their way to re-writing it.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|I really loved Series 5 and I'm totally in love with Matt Smith and Alex Kingston, so obviously I had to have this. I love the Confidential and special features, though I agree with the general consensus that they are a bit skimped for this release, especially for the two-part episodes. However, the really confusing this for me is the little cardboard graphics that came with the box set. What are they, and do they have any purpose at all?
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I enjoyed \\"The Walking Dead\\" more than I thought I would.  Who ever thought there would be a TV series like this?  This is a very unusual show, which could be the reason I liked it so much - almost refreshing.  If you are a \\"hard core\\" zombie fan, you may not like it as there are many things you could pick apart.  If you scare easy, this show may not be for you.   I, on the other hand, really like Zombie flicks (even though they scare me - I just don't like the idea of zombies!).  Remember, people react to things differently.  I thought the Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead were terrifying and I had nightmares for a month.  Some of my friends thought it (the Exorcist) was hysterical and giggled through the whole thing.  Now, that stupid movie \\"Candy Man\\" scared my friends to death, but I thought it was so dumb that I couldn't even sit through the whole thing.       I realize this is a TV show and not a movie, but I wish they would have established the characters just a little bit more in the first couple of shows.  I understand that we will \\"get\\" all the characters as the show goes forward.      If you are a person looking for a new and different show, this may be for you.  I'm excited about season 2 coming in October - I can't wait!

1594744769|5.0|I got this book to read on the beach for my summer vacation. While this may not be typical fare for a summer read for most people, it was just perfect for me.     The story is about a 16 year old, but don't let that stop you from reading it because you think it is a YA book. I think it reads more like an adult novel, but I think my 13 year old would enjoy it as well. I recommend this book if you like your novels to have a little bit of magic and a also a little darkness.     I really like how Riggs incorporated the vintage photographs into the story. The pictures inspired me to go on line and look around at antique stores for pictures that I might like to collect. The pictures really make the book unique.    I think the ending is a set up for another book, and I really hope there is a second novel. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A great story of strength and perseverance, tragedy and survival, love and loss, told through the eyes of a remarkable little girl. A great read but not on a cruise ship (mom thought I would enjoy the book and gave it to me as I was leaving for a romantic vacation with my husband...bad idea!)!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is amazing alarm app (who knew you could love anything about alarm clocks!) I have the Droid Charge and the preinstalled alarm is not great so I tried this free app! what a huge difference! I liked it so much, I paid for the pro version just to support the developer, I've never on that before.
0321647440|5.0|I have been taking the Aperture Pro-Series Class given by Apple.  They use this book as a training tool for Aperture users.  It is also used by Apple to train their Aperture experts.  It is an excellent learning tool for aperture users.  I refer to it often when using the program.
1594481717|5.0|There is no book out there which perfectly describes the major causes of unemployment in the West like this book does. It isn't policies, like so many people believe. It's all about \\"Abundance, Asia and Automation\\". For a clearer understanding of these three concepts, read the book.    As I read this book, I kept exclaiming, \\"why hasn't somebody said that?\\"    I recommend this book to anyone who wants to place themselves strategically to reap the benefits of the next century.
1603400265|5.0|The young Jim Hawkins tells the tale of buried treasure and treacherous pirates led by Long John Silver who wants to keep the treasure for him-self.  From the Admiral Bow Inn the tail sails on in the Hispanola galleon to treasure island. Set to magical pen and ink artwork this book will delight. A must read.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead follows in the footsteps of great zombie films like 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead.  The characters are believable, the story line is engaging with just the right amount of tension.  The zombies have a realness about them and they aren't over the top in the way they behave, and of course they provide just enough gore.[[ASIN:B0049P1VHS The Walking Dead: Season One]]
1416549447|5.0|A few years ago i started biking and enjoyed it. But since I live where there are four seasons, with harsh winters, I figured I'd try to add some running -- again -- for the months when biking is out. \\"Again\\" because about ten years ago I tried running. A trip to the running store led to a pair of heavily cushioned running shoes. Off I went, happily heel-striking and striding large. Shin splints and knee pain sent me to a podiatrist. \\"Stop running,\\" he said. \\"You're not built for it. Or limit it to twenty minutes per workout a few times a week.\\" I quit running. Giving it up was effortless. So, when, after the ten year hiatus I thought about giving it another shot, I sort of stumbled on this book and was put off by the title. I love tai chi but \\"Chi Running\\" sounded like some hippie freak's notion of skipping around and letting your chi flow purple and green. Well, don't judge a book by the title, I guess. After reading some reviews of it on line I bought it. It totally changed how I run. I hooked up with a certified Chi Running teacher and took a few lessons, then went to a workshop. Two years later I'm addicted to running. I'm too superstitious to say I no longer have shin splints or knee problems but I don't, and I ascribe that to what I learned from this book, which was augmented by personal instruction. So I endorse the method. And the book is really very clear. I do think you can learn the method just from the book. The DVD is less helpful but nice to have, but the book really is the best tool for learning this style of running. It covers hills, speed work, the long slow run, footwear, and of course the proper mechanics. I have also read The Pose Method, which is excellent as well. The key difference is that the Pose Method emphasizes landing on the balls of the feet. Chi Running emphasizes a midfoot landing. I've tried both and prefer the latter as it doesn't exhaust my calf muscles. Look, that podiatrist was right. I'm medium height, a former lifter whose stocky with thick short legs. But through this method I've fallen in love with running and now the bike comes out only maybe twice a week. In my view, this is the best book out there on running form. There are others, and many are worthwhile as well, but if I had to read only one book on good form I'd go with this one.
B0055B0MIO|5.0|This album blew me away. The guitars are heavier and the drums are louder and sound more agressive than on other Trivium albums. The mix of the album is really good, it's like a raw heavy metal sound that rocks. Heavy but clear and concise.  In my opinion they have not done a killer album like this since Ascendancy. The Crusade was ok and Shogun was pretty good, but 'In Waves' is just bloody fantastic! The album flows and the vocals are great. The entire song lineup flows like you wouldn't believe! The album is a ball of energy!  With the special edition, the bonus songs are pretty good but there was one or two I didn't care for. Track 10 'Caustic Are the Ties That bind' is beyond amazing. At the mid part of the song the flow goes to clean guitars and clean vocals, amazing!! I wish Trivium would do an album with more of that! A side project maybe? :)  The guitar solo harmonies in this song are so great!! I still get goose bumps when I listen to it!  Trivium stepped it up on this album and I absolutely love it. Cheers!

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Charles Ferguson is to be commended for this courageous, brilliant, dispassionate, and ultimately damning exposé of Wall Street's unconscionable machinations. Truly sobering.

B000000OF6|5.0|For anyone who is a Queen fan, this is the ultimate CD collection. From Bohemian Rhapsody to Fat-Bottomed Girls to Radio Ga-Ga (one of my personal favourites) to some of their lesser-known songs (Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy, Seven Seas of Rhye, Hammer to Fall) the voice of Freddie Mercury will transport you back to another place and time where music was more than just a cacaphony of noise. Freddie will live forever through his music. I'll admit, the only thing missing was Princes of the Universe. This is a great collection and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00457X7XQ|3.0|With such a big name, I had some high expectations. Unfortunately, Zero Day did not meet them. There was a lot of technical detail; to the point that it began to distract from the storyline. The sex scenes seemed out of place with other gimmicks here and there such as the 1337-speak portions that really seemed to diminish the overall story. In all, it seemed like a hyped story based on recent media covered events. Nothing really new was presented in the book in terms of technical value or style. An OK read, but a disappointment nonetheless.
B002VECLVO|1.0|This film FAILS because of the 'perfume ad' vision of the director, a poor story (novel) which the director changed out of all recognition, and actors who completed it (in the director's words) in just 21 days.    Colin Firth plays himself TOTALLY, not a gay man; Julianne Moore does her best 'Belle Watling', the FEW other characters are transparent to the extent that the best performance is by the dog!    In a series of confusing flashbacks all the actual 'action' (lethargic as it is) takes place in 24 hours. The only change of visual pace includes scenes of 'death in snow' and 'almost drowning', and a fire-red sky owing much to 'Fargo', 'The Piano' and 'Gone with the wind'.    As for the music, it's pretentious, saccharin sentimental, and more suited to Anna Karenina than a film set in California in 1962!    Don't waste your money.[[ASIN:B002VECLVO A Single Man]]
B0037A4ILC|3.0|I can't give this movie less than three stars-- on the mountain, the cinematography is superb and the acting outstanding. To watch these climbers set out strong, then engage in a long, grueling struggle, outfitted with 1930's gear and within sight of tourists below ... it's every bit as riveting as the 5-star reviews say.    And that is precisely why I'd love to sock them with only one star: the story itself is so incredible that it did not need falsifying or romancing.  Can we truly not watch an adventure movie without a ridiculous and superfluous romance?  And was the actual climb not gripping enough without false additions?  The \\"competitors\\" were a 4-man team from the start; no living person cut himself off the rope (it was cut the next day, when the men who fell were beyond rescue and no longer responsive); no woman had to galvanize reluctant rescuers, they responded as a matter of course; and on.    If the filmmaker wants to include a fictional story, then the people portrayed should be fictional, as in Titanic.  To use a real story, with real, legendary people, and then to falsify it -- that verges on obscene.  If you would like to know how events actually unfolded, I highly recommend the British production \\"The Beckoning Silence\\" based on the book of the same name by Joe Simpson (\\"Touching the Void\\").  Right now, it is available only in European format DVD.  In it, Simpson talks of how this climb inspired him, what the climbers did and how they must have felt, and mountaineering in general.  It is accurate and incredibly compelling in its own right.  And yet, the scenes recreating the climb, though nicely acted and extremely well filmed, fall just a little flat after watching \\"North Face\\".  Oh, my kingdom for a hybrid of these two movies!  That would be a 10-star!
B002PJ4NIO|5.0|How can you not love The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe? This book is just tremendous. I listened to it on audiobook recently and fell in love with it all over again. This is one of those books that you could read or listen to once a year and never get sick of it. Love it!
1401324517|5.0|First the disclaimer: I'm a sold out Rafa Nadal fan. I appreciate everything about his game but, even more what is seen as him the person. In an age of Egos larger than life in professional sports, and lifestyles that overstep the limits of decency, Rafa could not be more different. This book not only outlines this as fact, but reinforces what many would take for granted these days; there are few things more priceless than a strong family.     In terms of reading this from a tennis player's perspective, this is not a book about technique. However, Rafa's first-person account of what he was saying to himself, what his mental success and failure points were, is in my perspective, in the same league with, if not of more practical use, than The Inner Game of Tennis, Winning Ugly by Brad Gilbert, or any other book that addresses the mental approach to tennis. There is a tremendous amount to learn from his approach.    Second disclaimer: The book has only been out for 24 hours and I'm only 2/3 of the way through it. Specifically, the book is just starting to discuss the 2010 US Open. But, I can't put it down (Well, in fact I have to. I have to go to work). I'm willing to bet that, if you read about tennis, play tennis, or in any way are interested in Rafa, you'll have the same experience I'm having reading this book.    One last perspective. If there's aver a second book written By Rafa and his team, I hope it's about how he transitions from Tennis to whatever is next in his life. That could be a sequel even more interesting to read.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Finally someone has written a series that doesn't remind me of several others on the telly.  Original scripts, original characters that don't require a lot of pawing and face sucking to be interesting, and a setting that I am somewhat familiar with (Maine).  Love this series and I hope it goes on for a long time.
0307595862|4.0|It's really too bad that Jo Nesbo is being touted as the new Stieg Larsson, because he's much more than that.  As brilliant as Larsson's Millenium Trilogy is, Nesbo is simply the better writer and should be judged on his own terms.  Don't get me wrong, I was captivated by Lisbeth Salander and the three books that told her story; they're among the most entertaining I've read in many, many years. But Nesbo writes more typical detective stories, with murders, red herrings and many surprise twists; as such he rates with the best of them, including Michael Connelly.  Harry Hole, Nesbo's troubled, alcoholic protagonist, is in fact like a Swedish Harry Bosch, cut from the same damaged cloth.  (If anything, Hole is even more of a crazy, loose cannon.)  \\"The Snowman\\" has Hole embroiled in a bizarre series of murders that may be linked to some similar cases 30 years ago.  It's all pretty much standard detective fiction fare, but presented with tremendous style, humor and sharp, elegant prose.<br /><br />If I have a reservation about \\"The Snowman,\\" it's that that the plot is a bit too convoluted.  There were times when I found myself lost, having to backtrack and remind myself of character names and past plot developments.  Frankly, like one of the main characters, I was driven a bit psychotic by the many misdirections that were thrown my way.  But like all good mystery writers, Nesbo demonstrates a sure, steady hand by tying everything up at the end in a methodic, logical manner.  Reservations aside, I was never in the least bit bored with \\"The Snowman\\" and entertained -- often surprised -- page after page.  Nesbo very much deserves his day in the sun, particularly if it means stepping out of Stieg Larsson's shadow to claim it.
0817439390|5.0|This book is a great guide for newbie photographers like me, and something I imagine would help veterans as well.  The example photos (complete with settings listed) are great, and I like that Peterson has tips for a variety of situations (fireworks, portraits, etc.).  Worth every penny!
B004YXE438|5.0|This is good for kids and adults.  my kids love to play on the easier levels and i like the harder configurations.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Fantastic through and through. Surprised I've only watched it twice. Great story, better acting than in any of the previous movies, awesome action. Too violent for the little kiddies, but a great family movie for those 12 and up. Start a discussion on good vs evil. Or just watch for the pure entertainment value!!
1401307450|5.0|I am a die hard chilli peppers fan and always have been, i cant beleive i have left it this long to read this fantastic account of the life of Anthony Keidis, from a small child to the living legend he is today, with a career that has spanned decades during which he has overcome massive unspeakable addiction and STILL produced some of the best music i have ever had the pleasure of listening to.  Anthony, you are my hero!!!
B0057UA4FY|5.0|Ah season one, right after the pilot movie; \\"Star Wars the Clone Wars\\" I can't give an in-depth review because, well that's just not something i'm good at. The original star wars fans will love this series because back in episode four \\"A New Hope\\" fans noticed that when Leia was appealing for Ben's help she said something among the lines of \\"You served my father in the Clone Wars\\" apparently this caught fan's and (possibly) Lucasfilm's attention. Well people, you asked Lucas and now he's devoting an entire computer animated series of the clone wars, it has a perfect mix of the old star wars elements and is kid friendly too. I love every season of the clone wars and what's special about this one was the suspense it gave me in almost every episode back when season 1 episodes were broadcasting on TV. Every episode kept me entertained on different levels.      I loved every episode and the season finale shows fans what kind of tone and setting to expect in season 2, it gets darker, more serious, intense, and violent (not too violent of course).     So for those who are skeptical about this series, just give it a shot. The animation isn't the best but Lucasfilm animation was just starting out and the animation DOES get better in every season and according to their commentary, they are really trying to reach out to new and old star wars fans alike.     Final word on this season: This season was simply awesome, and I can't wait for season 4 episodes to come on this fall :)
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|excellent product.  Very useful when you don't want to connect to your pc via usb just to move a couple of files.  I like the ability to stream media on a pc from phone as well.

B0058A119G|5.0|Never before has Streisand been both so emotional and subtle. Each song marks a different step in a journey, a different period in a real relationship. It's been a long time since she last sounded this effortless and frisky, especially on songs like \\"Nice 'n' easy\\", \\"That Face\\" and \\"Windmills of your mind\\", three absolute masterpieces. And what's even more stunning is her ability to perfectly understand the Bergman's lyrics and manage to get the best out of them: in Streisand's mouth, even the most ordinary songs become the most touching and poetic ones, like \\"Something new in my life\\", a complete surprise and one of her most emotionally powerful and tender performances, as are both \\"Alone in the world\\" and \\"I'll never say goodbye\\".    Keep on singing Barbra, you're just getting better as time goes by.
B0051T46XM|4.0|First off, this is a complete ripoff of The Blair Witch Project in almost all aspects except trolls from Norwegian folklore take the place of... whatever it was haunting those kids in The Blair Witch Project. That said, it is a great movie... kind of gory at time, a bit humorous and quite entertaining aside from the first half hour which was a bit slow.
B002M9WW30|4.0|This collection of the \\"Rocky\\" movies are awesome. People should know that all movies are put in one case. So there aren't six cases in this box, there's only one. Nice huh? Including that there is a bonus disc with special features. All six movies were put into the blu-ray format, but the older ones(the first couple) seem to have some grainy textures in the background in some scenes. The sixth movie does not have that problem though. If you like the \\"Rocky\\" movies you should buy this collection
B0058OUJA4|4.0|Wow.My battery from 100% to 0 in two hours. It is a challenging game though. I have played other tower defense games this one is the hardest one so far.
1401324517|5.0|This book has to be awesome, the man is an incredible person, one of the best of all time, if not the best.  He soon will be.  He is classy, honest but very sophisticated.  Just the way he uses his shots carefully, so does he with his words.  I just hope my daughter and son play as eloquently as he does.  Most importantly be the man that he is wise, and honorable.  Enough said, buy this book and learn to hit the ball like him, let's play tennis, hit the ball!

B004FRX0MY|1.0|App installation and buying experience is ok.    What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket, it closes. Put your phone on your desk, closes. Music stops, and you have to restart the app completely. App takes 15 seconds to load, even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning (interruption point was not saved)    All this on our 2 phones (different models) so hardware problems are to be excluded.    Really disappointed.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|I wish I hadn't downloaded this when it was a free app. The app is oddly designed for my Incredible 2. The layout and interface is not user friendly. Now I just wish it wasn't on my Amazon app list.
B0052FG750|5.0|not everybody already has every version of every cd/record the doors have released.  This set contains all their albums with Jim Morrison.  It's a great cheap way to snatch these all up at once.  If you're not looking for obscurities or other fancy gimmicks and just want the bare bones, go for it.  This is all you'll need.  Then you should check out Live at The Matrix.  It's an excellent live concert CD of the Doors very early in their career.
B000G8NXZK|5.0|The 2006 3-Disc Remastered Reissue of Brazil from the fine folks at Criterion and Universal is wonderful! You get 2 cuts (the 142 Minute Director's Cut and the Love Conquers All Version) and a bonus disc with extras. But buyer beware: When you buy this release here on Amazon, ask the seller which version it is. There are 2 versions of this release; the 1999 release and the 2006 Remastered Reissue. Here's how you can tell the differences:  -The back cover on the 2006 release states Second Pressing at the bottom. The 1999 release has First Pressing at the bottom.   -Another difference is that the Director's Cut on Disc 1 is anamorphic for the 2006   release while the 1999 release isn't.     I ordered Brazil from another seller and I was expecting the 2006 reissue and I got the 1999 release instead. I was so angry! (I don't want to blame the seller because it's mean and he probably didn't know what release he was selling) I don't want to make that mistake again and I don't want you to do either. So ask the seller first immediately after you buy it. You'll be glad you did.
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|As well all know, the first was awersome, the 2nd raised the bar in the gore, third was good, 4th was craptacular...but this...this is the kind of sequel we were all hoping for after 2nd. Gone are the cheesy stuff we saw in the 4th film. Gone are the moving too quick storyline. This was enjoyable...yes the deaths were extreme but that is what makes the series so good.    Speaking of the deaths they were really thought out with ane exception of to. But the bridge collapase was awesome. Now the best part was the ending itself. As we all know, every film has ended with some kind of big climatic ending. This didnt disapoint...in fact best in the series. What was also great actor Tony Todd made his triumphant return as the creepy mortition from the first 2.    Besdies a couple of deaths, this film is possibly the first true sequel. Yeah the second was great but it basically rode the cocktails of the first, this had a lot of weight on its shoulders based off of the previous sequels.    Must see, cant wait for blu ray to come out, we already know there will be 2 alternate deaths and hopefully more.    Pros:  -No cheese...well maybe some  -The story didnt move quicker then the race track in the 4th  -Most of the death especially the bridge collapse  -The ending  -Tony Todd returns as the mortitian    Cons:  -A death or 2 could've been better
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these headphones to wear running, since my earbuds kept falling out. I was skeptical when I received them in the mail because they seemed a little bit flimsy. However, they fill snugly on my head and stay put during intense running. These are good workout headphones, with surprisingly strong sound quality.
B004XANKVO|5.0|This is an excellent way to carry your Mac, iPad and power supply and/or recharging cords around with you while keeping your hands free. I was surprised that it would hold as much as it did. One of my favorite touches was the hard, crush-proof compartment for holding fragile sunglasses or an extra pair of regular eye glasses. The upper, center compartment is open at the top and that makes it easy to add things like newspapers, gloves, a windbreaker or umbrella. Since this compartment doesn't zip shut, it has easy access but is deep enough that stuff won't fall out of it if you lean forward. Stuff will fall out if you find yourself hanging completely upside down, but probably not if you are simply rolling down a steep slope.That's important for campers and hikers. The price seems a little more than I'd prefer, (I'm a classic \\"Cheap Charlie\\") but it's definitely a well-made product.There is a place especially made for everything.
0394873742|5.0|Although the edges of the book were slightly torn when I received it I was still thrilled to have found this book which my Grandson LOVES!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I bought this book based on all of the strong reviews.  I am not a snob by any means:  I love popular books (Game of Thrones) and movies, and love most sci-fi.  I found this to be very, very basic entertainment.  This is a collection of disparate stories about the zombie-apocalypose.  A few of them are entertaining but I found the majority of them to be repetitive and not really that interesting.      This is a beach book at the very best.  Caveat:  I am only 70% finished.
1594744769|2.0|The wonder and enchantment that can be gleaned from Miss Peregrine's home for Peculiar Children comes more from the design of the book than the literary content. Ransom Riggs tells his story with the aid of a collection of vintage pictures, many of them, the strange and 'peculiar' children that our young narrator discovers. It makes for a concrete visual on these misfits, but in telling their story, besides their particular talent, I wasn't that engaged. Furthermore I was never sure what target age group this was meant for, because it lacked some of the sophistication of say the Michael Scott series, let alone the Potter boy, and at the same time the protagonist is a sixteen year old who uses some coarse language that parents might find objectionable for their young children to be reading. I will say I loved the idea, and again the physical book is classy and well produced. I just wish the story lived up to the design.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I read the reviews about this product having defects and not working appropriately after a short time. I thought maybe it was only a select few and would give it a try. When we received it and set it up on the first day I was so impressed. It is gorgeous, soothing, and visually stimulating. My 3 month old son LOVED it! Everything about this mobile was awesome. Music, sounds, movement, etc. And then....it stopped working the next day. We tried new batteries(again) but that wasn't the problem. The lights continue to play and the sound works fine, but the mobile will not spin unless you manually stimulate the leaves. Even then it will make only 1 rotation and stop. Then you have to stimulate it again. It broke my heart to have to send it back, but if I pay for a product I expect it to work properly and I don't have the time or patience to be the mobile's human motor :-(
B001FB55H6|1.0|Prologue: I have no familiarity with the graphic novel \\"Watchmen\\" so I know nothing about the intricacies and nuances of from where this movie emenated from.<br /><br />This movie stinks! It's so boring, so long, so geeky (this would make \\"Harry Potter\\", \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and any other fandom flick look sooooo cool).<br /><br />This is about a alternative world where Richard Nixon, instead of being the resigned falure, was a fixture in the 80's. Superheros were first a fixture in society and now they have been outcast. Somebody is killing the old , retired superheros.<br /><br />As person that knows nothing about the background of this, here are my feelings;<br /><br />1) The actors/actresses have no charisma in the least bit. They do not exude \\"superhero\\" in any way;<br /><br />2) The big,bald muscular blue superhero dude is a really, unbelievable (even in a fantasy realm) and silly character. The movie focuses on him and this is an utterly ridiculous character;<br /><br />3) All the other superheros are portrayed with such little development that if anything happens to them, you will care less;<br /><br />4) The story is cliched and too well worn;<br /><br />5) Villains can't be wusses!<br /><br />Sometimes there exists great stories, that are in the sci fi/fantasy  genre, but they cannot be transformed into cinema without taking on a goofy, cartoonish persona (ie. Daredevil, Fantastic Four, Hulk...anything that is too fantasy).  That fits this overlong nerdfest to a tee.<br /><br />This movie is ambitious and it does have it's moments but, unless you are previously enthralled with what is going on, this is the most pretentious and geeky movie ever. There's not a lot of  redeeming value to this movie that takes itself way too seriously. I'm sorry, but for the lengthy time investment, this movie really stinks. It's not even a guilty pleaure.<br /><br />By the way, I wanted to like this movie because I [sometimes] respect a geeky movie. It seems as though this movie only coveted the previous fans of the graphic novel without considering the casual moviegoer.moviegoer.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Definitely worth watching. Most people are aware of the horrendous conditions for workers and animals in the huge factories and slaughterhouses around the country, but we choose to push those images out of our minds - so I wasn't surprised with that aspect of this film. I WAS however, shocked to see that the food industry is about as consolidated and domineering as the media industry is. Did you know that KASHI is owned by Kellogg's? Tom's Toothpaste is owned by Colgate now? A company called Monsanto has an absolute monopoly on seeds in the US? I had no idea! This film made me see the importance of reading labels, asking questions, and buying organic and local when possible.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book in the series. It was everything I expected and more. Love this author. His fantasy world is his own and the characters in it are flawed, just like people in the real life, which of course makes it a great read. Now, the wait is on for number six.
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|They were received rather quickly I must say! i am a size 8.5 in sneakers and decided to go with a 9 for extra room. I was going to go with a larger size anyway for some looseness and comfort. They fit perfectly, and there is some extra room with the adjustability for wool socks and jeans.  My feet slide in really easily and the boots come off quickly, too. Good for the price and boots are good quality so far. I think I'll manage a winter with them. :)
B003Y5H59W|4.0|I will admit I'm not a Captain America fan but I wanted to see this movie the trailers & TV spots looked so good I saw it & I have to say it's a pretty solid movie. Directed by Joe Johnston he directed Honey I Shrunk The Kids, The Rocketeer, Jumanji & Juraassic Park III. Stars Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers, Captain America, Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull, Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter & a small appearance by Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Story is Steve Rodgers wants to join The Army during World War II but a commanding officer Colonel Chester Phillips gives him a hard time cause he thinks he's too small a docter named Abraham Erskine has created a super soldier serium. Steve Rodgers agrees to it so he can serve his country. An assassin kills Dr Erskine Peggy Carter tries to stop him but he flees outside Steve Rodgers chases him down pretty good scene he throws a kid in an ocean the boy tells Steve Rodgers it's ok I can swim. It has it's fun moments. The assassin commits suicide with a cyanide capsule before he can be questioned. Rodgers is given The Captain America costume & is sent to promote war bonds on some kind of U      S       O   tour he learns about has been captured fighting in the war. Colonel Phillips won't let him go but he disobey's Peggy Carter Howard Stark ( Tony Stark's father) sneak him in cool action scene where he rescues the soldiers. Your introduced to The Red Skull they have a fight better than any of the fights between Red Skull & Cap in the 1990 movie. Check out my review for Captain America 1990. Red Skull escapes Rodgers is feared M    I      A or        K           I            A but he returns & asks what his punishment is Colonel Phillips says nothing. There's another good action scene where Cap & the troops are owning N      a             z  i's. Well done scene on the train a buddy of Cap's falls to his death. Cap finds out about the base of operations of the Red Skull. You have a really good chase with Captain America on a motorcycle being chased by The Red Skull's goons. Cap is captured but US Forces bust in it's a pretty good finale. Captain America stops The Red Skull from destroying New York City. They have a pretty good fight scene. Cap can't land the plane or cause the weapons will go off he has a final conversation with Peggy Carter who has became a love intrest. he crashes in the Antartica. Steve Rodgers wakes up 70 years later in a 40's style hospital room in NYC. He feels something is wrong he flees outside Nick Fury which leads into The Avengers next year. I know I didn't explain the plot very good but I enjoyed Captain America it was slow & talky but it had enough action a lead that could carry a movie that it's a pretty solid movie Joe Johnston did a decent job directing. I didn't know a whole lot about Chris Evans but he did a good job. Hugo Weaving wasn't too bad he was a better Red Skull than Scott Paulin Weaving at least stayed in The Red Skull make up. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't given much to do but he did a good job. Hayley Atwell was pretty good. I like this movie wholehearted more than X Men First Class. I'll continue with my LW reviews soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I devoured the trilogy in three days - fantastic.  The writing wasn't overly \\"flowery\\", the story was fascinating and moved along.  The plot is refreshingly unique.  I cared about the characters.  GREAT BOOK - Hope the movie is well cast and does it justice...
B00008WJBU|4.0|This story was a bit different in the sense that it deals with gambling in a very creative (albeit deadly) way that I have never seen before. At first I was a bit lost but as the movie unfolds you catch on eventually. Tying a Holocaust survivor into the mix of main characters and which also served as the basis for the ultimate form of gambling was quite clever. The plot deals with luck and fortune, superstition and perhaps a touch of magic.     Although there are some scenes that are suggestively graphic (violence) there is a quality to this movie that helped me relax and did not over-excite me before bedtime. The cinematography is quite beautiful and the musical score were, for the most part, quite soothing which probably is why I felt so relaxed instead of jolted (as some movies can do). Just thought I would describe the feel of the film as it provided a different vibe and was a pleasant welcomed surprise.
B002G1TSBI|3.0|These notes I wrote at the end of two marathon sessions of experiencing the present version of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.<br /><br />I am not an opera expert. I have spent a good portion of my adult life (spanning over 5 decades) in listening to classical music but I have neglected opera somewhat. Wagner's Der Ring along with some works of Bach have given me experiences that I would call \\"enthusiastic\\" (meaning I experienced god's breath). I cannot put aside my Solti Ring for any appreciable time interval.<br /><br />I regret that I sat through this production. It will take me sometime to extinguish some aesthetically vulgar visual images. The purity of the images evoked by the Solti Ring as well as Wagner's archetypical conception have been adulterated for me now.<br /><br />If you are new to Wagner and cannot wait to dive into the Wagnerian world you may be disappointed and even shocked to see the entire opera setting in artistically heterogeneous, cheap settings. You will perhaps be distracted by the fact that a good part of the opera takes place in the shadow of gigantic John Hancock edifices.<br /><br />Barenboim's rendition is very good, although it lacks the depth of emotion of Solti`s. Singing is excellent. Acting is good. Then there is the stage floor; an aerial view of fields or cobble stones on which the actors like to lie down and roll, sometimes for no apparent reason, no relevance to what is taking place. Iron scaffolds like those used in building, up and down which actors climb, again without any apparent correlation to the nature of the particular scene. These scaffolds pop up here and there, along with rusty half demolished boiler like containers in which actors live, and of course climb on their roof and back down again. In the final opera the Rheingold maidens appear in a grotesque structure which is like a come-from-the-future elevator or maybe it is part of a sewage pipes system. In the first opera, The Rheingold, these maidens swim in the river, electronic works that are pathetically amateurish. The electronic fireworks of this production are horrifyingly ugly. Beams of light that evoke images of kids playing with laser flashlights. The killing of the dragon was visually poor and silly. By the way, the singing of the dying serpent was not dramatic enough.<br /><br />The actor that impressed me was Gunter von Kannen (Alberich). Jerusalem (Siegfried) was convincing and suited to the role. Wotan (Tomlinson) was good but his physical appearance does not suit the image of father of gods. Mime (Grahan Clark) was good but I wish I had not seen The Cabaret, the movie.<br /><br />Brunhilde's (Anne Evans) physical profile suited the prototype of a Valkyrie, her singing was very good (it would have been better for me had I not listened to the Solti records (Birgit Nilsson)!). However as an actress she could not at times adequately convey emotions on her facial expression.<br /><br />It is my thesis that attempts to create modern versions of classical works (I include classical theater plays) tread on very precarious grounds. If they are meant to bring home to today's audiences great works of art (spoon feeding), they fail, for the same reason that translating or explicating poetry fail. Wagner's ring is a dream in the Schopenhauer, psychoanalytic conception, it cannot be explicated, it must be experienced.<br /><br />The bottom line of my recommendation is that, if you want to see Der Ring on DVD and this is your first visual exposure to this great work, do not buy this. Buy it if you already own other DVD productions of Der Ring, and you want the intellectual stimulation of an experimental version.<br /><br />Addendum, Sept. 30, 2012<br /><br />I am pleasantly surprised, and grateful to all of you who found my review worthy of your comments. I am grateful even to those who do not agree with my thesis. Some of you are so knowledgeable that taught all of us things we did not know. I agree with the comments that true Art is produced not only in big cities such as New York or Paris. In fact the greatest obscenities, not only in opera but also in all forms of art including painting and poetry, are produced in such centers, of course, along with monumental achievements.<br /><br />The question what is good art cannot be answered in discussions like the present one. It takes a lifetime of searching (not only reading or watching but searching like an ascetic searching for god) in order to, hopefully, one would have some insights on this issue. It is interesting that these insights cannot be communicated without loosing much of their meaning. At this point<br />I thought I might stimulate more discussion, more serious perhaps, by pointing to Wagner's views of the Arts. You may wish to read this book: Wagner, R. Opera and Drama, U of Nebraska Press, Jun 28, 1995, especially pp. 119-<br />I warn you it is very difficult reading; trust your instinct!<br /><br />Wagner was influenced by another great book by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. \\"Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry\\". Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1853<br />Both books are free to read on Google Books, and perhaps archive.org.
B000000WF9|5.0|The movie and the complementary musical score create a surreal experience. They go incredibly well together. The cast of actors, the storyline and cinematography were all well done. This movie, when made, was ahead of its time.

031603441X|2.0|I did not expect much from Keith Richards' autobiography and that it what he delivered. He seems to have never been at fault, not ever. I thought that he might come clean about the uncredited contributions of various players, most notably to me Ry Cooder, but no. He tosses off his creation of John Phillips heroin addiction with an offhand dismissal of how fast Phillips became fully addicted. Never a thought to the well documented carnage within that family. And all this pathetic blather about his \\"guitar weaving\\" with Ron Wood. Spare me please. I saw the Stone for the last time in Fort Collins CO in 1975 and the guitar playing was god-awful. Even though I had been fan since the beginning (I remember that first American TV appearance on WPIX on Clay Cole's show) but the crap they produced that long hot day was the end for me. I have thought that when they replaced Mick Taylor with Ron Wood was when The Glimmer Twins showed their true commitment to the money, rather than the music. I guess that when you are sufficiently out of it, then pointless guitar noodling seems to be brilliant interplay. I read it for the account of the earliest days and much of that was informative.After that, the L(ead) G(uitarist) S(yndrome) take over. This wasn't as bad as reading the self-published disaster of a novel that an acquaintance gave me years ago. But that was free.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Excellent Read.  Great book.  Great twist. Very suspenseful.  Well written and researched. I would definitely recommend this book to others.  It took me two days to read.
B0058OUJA4|2.0|there's hard and then is impossible... after you get through the tutorial this is the ladder. I say that as someone who loves tower defense games and usually excels at done. I really think most of these reviews were written before people played beyond the tutorial.   beyond that is the elements of polish this game doesn't help. ui is not polished and the extra game add ons like being able to alter enemies is not easy to use, mostly because you have to do it for every single level. that's tedious because the only way to win some of the more advanced level seems to be to the nerf the enemies...
0393338959|5.0|This is a terrific, hard-hitting book. Prof. Stiglitz not only describes the errors and abuses the led to the still-current \\"Great Recession\\", he also describes the errors and abuse that occurred as the Bush and Obama administrations responded to the evolving crisis.  Not stopping with criticism, Stiglitz goes on to describe various better remedies that might have been used, and/or might yet be used, to help the USA going forward.    First and foremost Stiglitzs condemns big finance for recent past and present problems. Not only did the Big Banks and related institutions, (notably the mortgage creator business), act in a narrow, purely self-interested way, but they also acted against common sense and their own, longer term interest.    Stiglitz is also harshly critical of actions, (regulation and lack there of), before that crisis and also during the crisis. As reading would predict, the author is utterly contemptuous of the Bush administration whose actions were exclusively pro-Big Finance and against the wider public interest. But knee-jerk Republicans can take some small comfort in his hard-hitting criticism of the Obama team's responses to the crisis too.    Stiglitz roundly condemns Obama's bail out of the Big Banks which he sees as too much and definitely miss-targeted.  Further, he insists that Obama missed the obvious opportunity to reform and regulate the Big Banks and other areas of the financial system.    This is must-read book for anybody with the slightest interest in the current economic situation. It contains quite a bit of detail but is always clear & accessible to the economic layman.
0767804511|4.0|I hated hearing how people didn't like Renny Harlin back in the 90s, I really enjoyed \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\\" (despite it does come up short with its choice of villians).  And while \\"Cliffhanger\\" does come up a little short next to \\"Die Hard 2\\", for a Slyvester Stallone action picture, and when you look at all the one Sly did back in the 90s, for me at least, this was the only truly good one he made in my opinion. For I was forever mixed on \\"Demolition Man\\".

0307577589|3.0|I'd recommend this book to a very select group of people: anyone who enjoys reading about depraved men and abused women, and writers who don't mind reading about depraved men and abused women.<br /><br />Larsson uses some fascinating storytelling techniques in this book. He uses multiple points-of-view (and, to a well-restrained extent, multiple protagonists) exactly the way it should be done. He uses plot-necessary investigative journalists and private investigators to drop tons of exposition in the form of plot and dialogue (it's kind of brilliant), and he maintains a large cast, a huge scope, and a foundational subplot, without ever losing the reader.<br /><br />All of that is fantastic. The subject matter is GRIM, though, and Larsson paints it as black as he can. Some of his effectiveness spoils the story there.<br /><br />He also has a habit of labeling characters \\"introverted\\" when what he really means is \\"worthless hateful psychopaths.\\" I don't know if that's a translation error, or if it's a cultural thing, or if it's just Larsson himself who thinks \\"introverted\\" means \\"socially inept,\\" but as an introvert I found the frequency and consistency of that abuse deeply irritating. Especially because the book goes to such great lengths to pat itself on the back for being so informed and enlightened on topics such as feminism, racism, and social inequality. Against that backdrop it's utterly bizarre to find such a small-minded and really absurd prejudice splashed across every page.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Super 8 is about a group of kids shooting a zombie movie for a local Super 8 Film festival. While filming on location at a train depot, they witness a colossal train wreck, which, just to throw out there, is simply amazing! After the wreck, odd things begin to happen around the town, and soon the kids find themselves facing something that would bring them all closer together, and experience danger, love, and life. This movie truly has the old Spielberg feel of ET, Close Encounters, and the Goonies. Its young child actors, especially Joel Courtney's lead performance, and his debut, are outstanding and really bring this film to glory. JJ Abrams has definitely rekindled the spirit of the 70's and 80's and hopefully will continue doing projects such as these. As a teenager, I enjoyed this film immensely, and it made me feel emotions towards the end, that a film has not been able to do for a long time. Along with the score, JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg make an AWESOME team, and this movie was SUPER SUPER Good!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Probably the best high fantasy novel I've ever read. Good adventure, fascinating setting, and some incredibly well-made characters make this novel fun to read, all the way through.

B000W9399S|4.0|I remember reading this book when I first worked my way through the Discworld series and finding it less entertaining than many of the later ones. Still, I've always been a huge fan of Terry Pratchett and I recently decided to reread the whole series in order.<br /><br />And I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this book the second time through. Its punchlines far less developed than some of the humor you'll find later in the series, far more parody, but the plot is engaging.<br /><br />I was most surprised to see how much of the cosmos of the Discworld was already so thoroughly established in the very first book. That's the main purpose this story serves, as cowardly wizard Rincewind travels the whole Disc encountering its greatest mysteries and, in the process, establishing quite solidly the strange setting that will become host to a phenomenal series going forward.<br /><br />I still think I'd recommend most new readers of Pratchett start somewhere later in the series (usually with Guards! Guards! and just work their way through the Watch series before going back), but I'm pleased to see how well this book holds up after all.

Simply THE BEST for all who love something original.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have researched over the hear, on the ear, around the ear headphones.  I even tried  pairs of Bose around the ear AE2s and IE2s.  These Sony phones are not only cheaper (costing under $100)  but the sound quality is, in my view as a listener only of classical music, equal to the AE2s.  And I do not have the feeling of the wires falling off, being pulled, coming apart.  The \\"hardware\\" is much more durable.  The coiled wire is nice and can be easily elongated with a similarly coiled extension. They can be folded in and packed in their nice sack. Maybe they are too bulky for running and sweating, and maybe the coiled cord is cumbersome for movement, but certainly for stationary classical listeners they are fine. Plan to travel with them too. And walk.  Coiled part can be stuffed into a small front \\"waist pack\\" or pocket, out of the way.<br /><br />Need to add that the earpieces swivel out so you can pull them up to communicate with the world.  But when they are on they are very noise-cancelling as well, even though they are  technically not noise-cancelling.  I did not even hear someone calling me on skype inches away from me!<br /><br />So until Bose with its great sound gets its hardware to match its musical quality, their headphones are overrated, too expensive, too flimsy.

B000F1IQNC|5.0|This movie was fun, entertaining, and a touch of morality.  The movie was written and produced by Emma Thompson whose magical background includes being a Professor at Hogwarts in the Harry Potter movies. There were other actors in this movie who also played in the Potter movies. It was creatively written and had a strong comedic element. Colin Firth is great as the loving exasperated father and the kids are wonderful brats. Angela Lansbury was wonderfully cast in her role. Don't know who else could have played that role as well. Kind of a predictable ending but that did not detract from how the ending was accomplished. A good family movie.

B003L20IJM|3.0|Nanny again confronted juvenile challenges, this time with the addition of a city versus county conflict.  The children were brats who learned their lessons the McPhee magical way. Nanny was much more a known quality to persons outside of the family being helped, for example, in London, she wore a British military uniform and had significant rank (although without rank insignia). She was also more willing to actively use her magic in this movie. In the first movie, she seemed reluctant to use her magic until the children needed it or had exhausted all of their available resources. The key values promoted by Nanny were accepted by the children and the ending was well done.  As with the first movie, Nanny brought in colleagues from the Harry Potter movies, this time bringing in Ralph Finnes (Lord Voldemort)and others. This movie was good but not as creative (or perhaps \\"innovative\\")like the first movie. Perhaps the novelty of the magical walking stick was gone. But, watching city kids dressed in city clothes chasing escaping piglets was funny! Adults would see the movie as a sequel, kids would enjoy it.

B00005221M|5.0|This is one of the few movies I've seen more than once. It just has great everything, a great story, great action, great battle scenes and settings, drama, romance, and has one of the greatest movie sound tracks ever to grace the silver screen. It is without doubt Daniel-Day Lewis's most iconic role, and perhaps Wes Studi's too, but the rest of the cast is outstanding as well, including Stowe, Schweig, Waddington, Roeves, Chereau, and Means. A young Pete Postlethwaite has a minor supporting role, who would gain more considerable fame later in other movies, such as the Jurrasic Park sequel and The Usual Suspects.<br /><br />Probably my favorite Michael Mann movie, it's a truly wonderful recreation of Cooper's epic novel of the French and Indian wars. There are so many great scenes, but the battle that occurs on the road back to Albany between the British column and Magua's war party is just, to use an overused phrase, awesome in its action and historical realism. The movie shows just how precarious life on the frontier could be back in those days. At the time, tribes that were allied to the French, such as the Ottawa and Huron, were raiding up and down the frontier and killing all the British settlers. It was this war that gave the young George Washington the experience he needed as a young officer to lead the Continental army many years later.<br /><br />One minor point of historical accuracy--the large mortars used by the French to attack the fort would not have had exploding canon balls. Those came later, from what I remember of my history. I'm not certain, but if anyone knows more about the history of weapons than I, feel free to correct me. But I seem to remember that at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, sixty years later, Napoleon's canons still did not have exploding shot. That came later and was used to great effect during the Civil war, the other important thing being the development of an accurate timed fuse for the balls.<br /><br />There have been about half a dozen movie versions of the book going back to the first one in 1920 with Wallace Beery. From what I've read (in the Wikipedia article) this movie follows the 1936 version more than the others. The movie also deviates significantly from the book in some ways. For example, some characters who are killed in the movie (such as Colonel Munroe), actually live on the novel. Also in the movie Magua is killed by Chingachgook in a tomahawk and battle axe fight, but in the book Hawkeye kills Magua by shooting him. But overall, it's a great movie on many levels and one that rewards watching more than once.ns of the book going back to the first one in 1920 with Wallace Beery.

B001S49AQW|5.0|This is my 15th Heyer book. I have been reading one a day since I discovered this writer. I have never paused in the Romance section of the library or book stores, so I have lived a rather long life without the great entertainment Georgette Heyer provided the world with her books. This particular one does not fall into her Regency Romance formula as it is far more Wodehouse - with great young male characters and their very humorous dialogue. Laughter is good medicine, I think. The world was in turmoil when this one was published in 1944, so I am impressed with Heyer's ability to have created these wacky characters. If you need a laugh, try this one for the zany dialogue.

B0000028M7|5.0|One of the things I respected the most about Alice In Chains is how consistently good each of their releases were, something I don't feel any of the other similar bands of the period were able to achieve, and Dirt is another example of one of the most creative stretches by any band ever.  While I don't feel Dirt is as good as the debut(which is common for me), Facelift,  it is close.  Again buy Dirt as a whole and listen to it the way it was intended.  Highly recommended.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Ok, the trap.  We know what it is, Jordan found it whole heartedly, Abercrombie avoided it.  The point where an author gets caught up in description, mind numbing and fruitless plot additions, and overal wordiness.  Sometimes I believe authors of a great series get to the point where they enjoy the look and feel of their own words much like a well followed preacher seems to fall in love with his own voice to the peril of the message to those following him or her.  I found the book satisfying, only because of my love for earlier events.  Martin's attempt at shock value is consistently failing him now.  At some point or another, the reader needs to feel a satisfying sigh that moves the plot in a meaningful way.  Overall, average at best, and only because the series as a whole is filled with greatness.
B00000272N|5.0|Couldn't stop playing Facelift forever when it came out and it still sounds as fresh today. Everybody I knew also seemed to be playing it and even new people I met were playing it, amazing debut. Instantly enjoyable with incredible depth and contrast that keeps it from getting old.  While Alice In Chains showed the obvious influences of the time, Seattle Grunge, they really had their own sound and did it so well they were practically genre defining.  This is one of those discs you want to buy as a whole and listen to as intended.  In my opinion Alice in Chains best! Highly recommended.

B004VD3PE0|5.0|Mia is an accomplished cellist and part of a loving, supportive family. On a normal family car ride, tragedy struck and a large truck hit their car. Now, she is inexplicably standing outside of her body, among the corpses of her parents, watching paramedics tend to her brother and herself. Not knowing if she's alive or dead, she follows her body to the hospital, where it lies comatose. As her friends and family come to visit her and talk to her, she thinks on the past and ponders an important question: should she fight to live or simply die?    I love If I Stay. I read it for a read-a-thon and just devoured it in a couple of hours. I didn't expect to like it so much. I heard a lot of rave reviews before I read it, but it didn't seem like something I would like. It seemed like a lame Nicholas Sparks novel whose only purpose is to make me cry. I was totally wrong. I love pretty much everything about this book. The book is told through Mia's eyes. It starts with the day of the accident and then the present interweaves with the past. While she sees her friends and family talk to her and watch them deal with her parents' deaths and her coma, Mia has flashbacks to important events with all her loved ones. The events show a realistic life that's not perfect, but filled with well meaning, loving people. They aren't in any particular order and each one lets the read get to know her and her circle of loved ones better. I think it gives the novel a more natural stream of consciousness feel as opposed to putting them in chronological order.    The prose is really beautiful. It's simple and straight forward, but descriptive as well. The story is emotionally driven without being manipulative. I think the writing makes it accessible to readers beyond young adults, younger and older. I was sucked into the story quickly mostly because of the vivid characters. The characters are detailed, realistic, and flawed. Getting to know the characters is heartbreaking because some of them diedin the first few pages and you feel more of the pain they are feeling in the present. Mia is someone I would be friends with in real life because her character is so richly imagined and we have a lot in common. Unlike a lot of YA novels, I thought the romance between Mia and Adam is realistic. They aren't fully consumed by their love or super overdramatic or creepily codependent, like so many relationships are in YA. They love each other, but argue, disagree, and fight like real couples do.    My absolute favorite part of the novel is the music. Music is what really ties the story and all the characters together. Mia is a classical musician born to a family of rockers and her boyfriend is in an emo rock band. Even though they all enjoy and play different genres, they all share a love and passion for music. The juxtaposition of different opinions and genres allows them to learn to break through their preconception and respect each other. The descriptions of music and the experience playing music is wonderful and really what makes me love this book. I like that Gayle Forman names specific pieces and songs so I can go and listen to them while I read the book.    I enjoyed If I Stay because it's not just a depressing story. It's really about life and its complexities. The ending was perfect and beautiful. I cried many times throughout the book, but I also laughed and got frustrated with the characters. I would recommend this to those looking for a complex, emotional book.
1402790546|5.0|To my mind, the two best air war novels ever written are THE LAST TALLYHO by Richard Newhafer and Len Deighton's BOMBER. Newhafer's chronicle of USN Hellcat pilots at war benefitted from the fact that Newhafer flew F6Fs in WWII and knew his subject intimately. Len Deighton, on the other hand, had no experience of Bomber Command ops and had to do endless research to create what is an authentic and tremendously gripping portrait of a fictional RAF raid on a German town in 1943. That's why I give the tip of the hat to BOMBER.<br /><br />Back in 1970, when I first read BOMBER, I finally realized what was meant by the phrase \\"compulsive page turner.\\" I simply couldn't put the book down. Piece by intricate piece, Deighton created a spellbinding story of a bombing mission gone terribly wrong. That story was populated by living, breathing, sometimes flawed human beings English and German alike. On top of that, he got all the technical bits spot on! Nothing ticks me off more than when an author, writing an air war novel, commits a boner concerning aircraft, weapons, tactics, etc. Time after time in BOMBER, Deighton got it right.<br /><br />Other reviewers have detailed the plot of BOMBER. Ostensibly, it is the story of a Bomber Command raid focusing on the crew of a Lancaster named 'The Creaking Door.' Yet, BOMBER is much more. It can be read on many levels. There are so many fascinating elements at work in the book such as the leisurely way Deighton develops the plot, the matter-of-fact manner in which he presents plot developments, the sympathetic portrayal of the British and German characters, the fashion in which 'minor' actions produce major consequences and so on.<br /><br />To my mind, BOMBER is Deighton's masterpiece. None of his other novels were as gripping as BOMBER; likewise his non-fiction work. Whether you vew it as a war novel or an anti-war novel, it's just one damn fine read!

B00138EYG4|5.0|Speed metal's finest moment.  Its like will never be seen again, nor its match found.  Judas Priest was at top form when they put this one out.  (I wore it out twice on cassette, one CD and when I listen to it now, it still gives me goosebumps.  Also, this capped the glam/guitar era with a hard hitting metal Judas stamp.  I don't know if there's a better guitar album out there...

B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is the best bodybuilding movie.  Anyone interested in training can learn a lot and also be motivated to train harder.  The movie covers what was supposed to be the epic battle for the 1975 Mr. Olympia between Arnold and Lou Ferrigno, but Lou ended up in 3rd place behind Serge Nubret, who arguably had a better physique than Arnold for the 1975 Olympia.  Watching Arnold exposes his secrets to winning.  He is also a masterful poser.  Equally impressive is watching Franco Columbu lift a car and perform his lat spread.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in bodybuilding.  Otherwise you may not enjoy the movie.
B000X2H8G4|3.0|Only one side of the headset works.  I tried 2 different headsets and 2 ear buds.  Only the left side works.  I tried all configurations in both ears.  I'm disappointed this does not work in stereo.  I do use the product and like it as it is.  It does pick up all sounds. I use it for watching TV but can't use when the fan or is AC on.  It must be used in a quiet environment.
0439023521|5.0|When I originally read the description of the book, I felt like this would not be a book for me.  I don't like to read about voilence; but all of the reviews, made me decide to give it a try.  I could not put this book down and read until 2:30 a.m. last night.  Plan on starting the second book as soon as possible.  Great book!
030788743X|4.0|I found this book being hyped at Comic Con International.  I put it on my wish list and bought it from Amazon when it became available.  I am not a gamer, I think I played pac-man a couple times and I am not a \\"fat, virgin, high school boy\\" that some reviewers indicate this book was written for.  I am a 48 year old woman and I really enjoyed the escape and simplicity of this sci-fi/fantasy book.  Ernest Cline will be in town for a book signing and I will be there in line to see him.  I highly recommend this book.

0061537969|5.0|I can't stress what a joyous book this was to read.  I recently lost a cat after having the privilege of being a part of her life for 15 years. A friend recommended this book to me.  I'm not your typical reader - I don't have the patience for a book.  I might read about 10-15 pages and then I fidget and I have to put it down.  But this book was such a good read that I found myself reading 50-60 pages in about 1 1/2 hours.  That's unheard of for me!  The story just embraces you like a big gentle hug, the kind you get from a loved one. I still have not finished this book, but I can tell you, that it has helped me get through the most difficult decision a pet owner has to make for their unconditional loving faithful friend.  You won't be disappointed.
B00511ONPG|5.0|This book was chock full of great information.  It confirmed that we are already doing many things right, but still have so much to learn and implement.  I usually don't take to non-fiction books, but this one was actually a page-turner for me.  I read it all in one sitting, with my highlighter and pen in hand.  I now have many more questions and a host of new ideas to implement.  Thanks Dave for creating Likeable.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|Brutal but good! \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" takes revenge to a new level. If you are easily grossed, step out the room and let grown folks watch. I find it hard to imagine making a movie this good, this gruesome. I don't recommend this kind of payback but.......
0439023521|5.0|This was his favorite book for summer reading.  He asked me to buy the rest of the series.  The book was chosen from a B&N top 20 reading list for this age group.  Although I did not read the book or know anything about the story, as a parent, I was ecstatic about his enthusiasm.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|From my blog: [...]    If you've seen any of director Terrence Malick's (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line) films and didn't care for them then there's probably a fair chance you will not like The Tree of Life, but maybe you will gain respect and admiration for his craft.  The one thing that often divides Malick devotees from those indifferent to the director's films is his cinematic language.  Like all of four of his films, Tree of Life is an exercise in show before tell, a love of nature, an examination of interpersonal relationships and a fondness for purity. More than anything Malick wants us to feel his picture.    In fact, The Tree of Life marks Malick's movement towards the abstract and surreal.  Quite often Malick prefers to convey feeling through montage, facial expressions, subtle gestures or even the now famous creation sequence.  Just like his previous efforts it's a film which could easily be reworked as a silent picture and not miss a beat - a very high compliment.  It's also comparable to The Thin Red Line in its narrative approach but much more free and loose.  More than ever before Malick is less concerned with plot and more concerned with conveying feeling.    The first time I saw The Tree of Life was on its release date.  I was overwhelmed by the film's brilliant imagery, its poignant score and its examination of the life of a family in a sleepy town in Texas in the 1960's.  Malick's focus on the three boys all close in ages and practically on the cusp of adolescence felt incredibly intimate, honest and relatable. Growing up the middle child of three boys I found myself relating to the joys and pain felt by the boys growing up.    Naturally, these boys grew up in a time when the father was the disciplinarian dishing out tough love.  Brad Pitt is superb as Mr. O'Brien or simply \\"father\\" or \\"sir\\" as he demands his sons to politely call him.  Mr. O'Brien believes anything is possible in life with a lot of hard work and a fierce will.  He demands theydo what is right even though he doesn't always fulfill his words to a tee because he wants them to be prepared to be the boss when they grow up.  The ethereal Jessica Chastain's sweet and naïve mother is often the foil (sometimes to the chagrin of Mr. Obrien) to the boys' father.  Her thoughts and inner feelings are expressed through her beautifully natural face. Together both parents find ways to make it all work.    Malick's portrayal of life from birth to the boys' late childhood is exceptionally moving.  The way he shows the early years of a child's life could make a stone cry and the longest of faces smile.  Then Malick shows us the boys start to think for themselves, get into mischief, have difficulty coping with disappointment and finding themselves attracted to girls - it's all there and Malick presents it all so tenderly and vividly.    There's the bad - when one of the sons gets the gumption to tell his father to be quiet at the dinner table and Mr. O'Brien gets worked up in a rage and demands his son to leave the dinner table.  There's the fun - when the boys get into the type of mischief that only boys can do and the proverbial schoolyard scenes Malick accompanies with a poignant piano piece.    Then there's the irreplaceable.  Consider a scene in which the father, a once aspiring musician but now a plant worker, is playing the organ and he glances over to see his young son already excelling at playing the guitar.  The look of pride on the father's face is priceless.  It's something as a kid I could never grasp because I couldn't see myself through my father's eyes to see the love and pride he had when he saw me succeed.  Just as it meant everything to me to play sports well, it meant the world to my father to see me do well.    Much of the pre-release buzz over The Tree of Life concerned its lengthy creation sequence detailing the formation of Earth and existence and demise of dinosaurs. I've left discussion of this sequence to the end of this reviewbecause it compliments the story, rather than the story supplementing the creation sequence. The CGI visuals, of which Douglass Trumbull (2001: A Space Odyssey) had a part in, are spectacular to be precise, but naturally Malick's hand maintains restraint and doesn't let them veer into spectacle. I've seen The Tree of Life twice and I'm still processing my thoughts as to how this sequence and the story fit into place (Which is not a bad thing as the film has so much substance).  There's also the present day urban skyscraper-set story of the eldest son Jack (Sean Penn) who's recalling his childhood, his parents and the loss of one his brothers at a young age. Penn doesn't need to emote because his face, his body language and Malick's direction juxtaposing small town Texas with the steel and glass urban environment of Jack's work environment are more than enough.    To be sure, The Tree of Life is not for everyone. One has to buy into Malick's cinematic language from the start or be lost in the stream of memories, feelings and sometimes surrealism.  It's also clear the film has a religious element but one's faith shouldn't prevent appreciation of this picture.  I think it's much too soon to rank this film's place within the Malick oeuvre, because it will no doubt be discussed and dissected endlessly in the years to come. All in all, Malick has never disappointed and The Tree of Life is no exception to this rule.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I found this book interesting, entertaining and informative. The perspective of the slaves and the indentured servant -- and their relationships to each other and the white plantation owners -- was fresh and gave a good perspective of the era. This was a good read!
B0058A119G|5.0|This album is ethereal. Barbra Striesand's voice is like an opening in the sky- a shaft of light that comes from the heavens and gently caresses one's face- reminding one of what it means to be alive. Goodbyes, hellos, past love, hope- are all here. It is almost as if all the songs are just one song- a celebration of romantic love...    Others can better comment on the technical aspects of the arrangements, the phrasing, the music selection- the flaws and the perfection. Yet in a true work of art, imperfection is part of the perfection- vulnerability is an opening- the chasm that breaks the monotone and awakens the passion. The words of many of the songs are melancholy and simply beautiful.
0805047905|5.0|Both Carle books (Brown Bear and Very Hungry Caterpillar) have really helped out with our bedtime ritual (book/bottle/bed) for my now 5-month old.  My incredibly active son actually sits still for these two books.  He enjoys cuddling with me on my lap while I read to him before his bottle and tries to help me turn each page.  He finds the colorful illustrations fascinating and laughs with delight when I make each of the animal noises in this book (\\"meow, meow, I see a white dog...\\", etc.).  He is especially entertained by the green frog and black sheep.  This book size is perfect for his little hands - he grabs the page with his right hand and switches half way through with his left hand (his first act of independence!!).  I know some people have complained that this edition doesn't have the surprise element with how it's edited, but for us, it's less about actually reading the book and more about another opportunity to bond.  I hope as he gets older and reading becomes the focus, my \\"reading\\" to him now will create a positive association that books are fun.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Nice addition to my GoPro line up.     With this case I am able to shoot a video while having a power source plugged into the camera, just what I was looking for. Sure I have the extra battery bacpac but it weighs about the same as the whole camera. Plus is your worried about heat problems, which I haven't experienced yet, then the ventilation will be of great use.

B0058A119G|5.0|Ms. Streisand's albums in the past decade have been fairly well received, two of them, The Movie Album and Love is the Answer, getting nearly grandiose applause in the NY Times.  For those who want belting, joking Barbra of the 1960's, please enjoy her albums from the era.  Here we find Streisand where she should be at this time in her career.  It seems one thing matters to Streisand: love.  Approaching her sixth decade recording, Ms. Streisand has no peers when it come to phrasing and can effortlessly make a syllable have meaning.  In today's world of voice synthesizers for those who can't sing and over the top vocal gymnastics from those very few singers who can, Ms. Streisand is a rare gem.  From the opening of Windmills, Ms. Streisand, dares us to turn away from her greatest beauty---her voice.  There is a more earthly purity to her instrument rather than the crystal bell like purity of her youth.  And while she does not sound her age, she sounds older and wiser even when she choses the subtle nuance where she would have chosen to belt out five decades ago.  But I am no less bowled over, perhaps more so.  In a world where popular movies need explosions, in a world where music must have a pumping driving beat to be a hit, a a world of so much noise pollution  we can almost become numb, I thank Ms. Streisand for reminding me of the great joys of the quiet revelation.
0312427999|5.0|I have not read The Shock Doctrine. I bought it for my husband as a gift, and, judging by the way he carried it with him to work & back, quoting it often & with extreme gusto, I'd say that purchase was a huge success.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Loved Sarah, Wanted to strangle Julia  I really enjoyed 60% of this book.  I have read lots of books on the holocaust, but had never heard of the Vélodrome d'Hiver and the round up of Jews by the French in 1942.  Sarah's part is fascinating, but what was the author thinking of when she wrote Julia's part. This is a tale of two books, Sarah's and Julia's.   Sarah's story was engrossing and what you would expect from a very bleak time in history. But to then add a Chick-lit, soppy romantic heart fluttering garbage in the same book ???? WHY ????  It didn't need it,
0553801473|2.0|Now we know why Martin waited so long: he had nothing to say.<br /><br />Clearly the pressure--probably more compelling from us, his readers, than his publisher--drove him to edit down (more than write) the indifferent manuscript he's been shuffling around for the last five years or so, hoping he'd come upon a shaping destination along the way.  Didn't happen.  Maybe with more time he'd have found his muse, or whatever it is he lost, and produced a book that travelled over memorable territory.  You've got to believe that our impatience brought this out before he had a product up to the standards he'd maintained in the rest of the series.  It's a plotless hodgepodge of  people and events.  If he had his target fixed, he could have gotten rid of all this in two chapters.<br /><br />Reading some of the interviews he's given, you sense that he's hoping this publication will unblock him.  So are we all.
B004UXUSPA|5.0|I've never really been a Woody Allen fan. While I've appreciated his accomplishments, both as a filmmaker and as a musician, his films never knocked my socks off; at least, not until now. &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; could very well have been titled &quot;Love Letter to Paris,&quot; because that is exactly what it is. Main character Gil Pender's (Owen Wilson as the Woody Allen surrogate) love and enthusiasm for the City of Light is contagious, especially if Paris already has a special place in your heart.<br /><br />To say the film is gorgeous is an inadequate description, at best.  There were moments where I was actually moved to tears. Paris is a visually magical place, and cinematographer Darius Khondji captures that magic throughout the movie, as does Allen's script and Wilson's portrayal of a man hopelessly smitten with one of the most beautiful places on earth.<br /><br />This is a hard film to review without giving away a few spoilers, so to be brief here's what you really need to know:<br /><br />  If you love Paris, you'll love this movie.<br />  If you like Woody Allen, you'll love this movie.<br />  If you can't stand Woody Allen, but you love Paris, you will not only love this movie, but you'll start to like Woody a little bit, too.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I purchased this book on a Monday afternoon and was finished before I went to bed. Jaycee is so honest and open when writing this book. Her accounts and so vividly written and raw. One of the best books I have read this year.
B004UHPTZ0|5.0|I have been reading a lot of reviews knocking this LP for various reasons. The singer is trying too hard, it does not sound like King Crimson, etc.. I have enjoyed every track and I am truly happy that I purchased it. Nice sturdy packaging and heavy weight vinyl makes this worth every penny. No need to name any tracks because they are all good. Fripp fans will be satisfied.
B000XUUQQK|4.0|Good movie for all of those who have feared the BOOGEYMAN at some point in their lives. It was interesting to see Tobin Bell in a Non-Saw movie. He is great as the doctor who runs a clinic where people are made to face their worst fears in order to overcome them. Runs well and has a \\"never saw it coming\\" ending. A bit gory at times but not overly bad. I have not seem any others in the series so I can't compare them to each other.

B0006AAS5G|3.0|packaging nice, arrived right on time, watch looks expensive.  One problem i noticed, the watch functions completely backwards. The watches actual second hand tics(large second hand), and the chrono second hand, at the 6 O clock subdial act as the chronograph.   This is the complete oppisite of the way a chronograph functions. I am not big on chronographs any way . I will not send it back, i will use it as a work watch. I like having a moving second hand all the time any way. And as long as both second hands are not moving at the same time I dont think there will be any difference in the battery drainage. Hey the watch was 79.00 what do you expect. If this watch is supposed to function this way would someone let me know?
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I recently had a chance to see the full Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice (if you have never seen Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you haven't lived) and loved it as much as ever.  Now that I have a Kindle and many of the classics are free I couldn't resist.  I recalled that the dialogue in the series was almost verbatim from the book but I hadn't read the book in so many years that I couldn't recall how well the rest matched up.  They are different because the book does a lot of narration that in the film had to be shown by activity, so it gives a different insight into your favorite characters.  I was delighted to find so much in the book not in the series.<br /><br />The book is a perfect delight and it obvious why this treasure by Jane Austin ranks so high in the lists of English literature.  Austin's skill at dialogue, character and plot development are unmatched.  I had intended to just skim the book to pick up the pieces I wanted but I read every word and was delighted with the extra sections in the book not in the series.  I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty good.  It is keeping me entertained during long football and cheer practices. It is pretty good on my battery G'Zone Commando Froyo 2.2.  It seems to go down a lot less when playing this game than any of my other games.  The controls are not the most sensitive, and that combined with my phone not having a terribly sensitive screen, does make some of the games a bit difficult, but the more you try each game the more you earn to open the other games up.
B004478GN8|4.0|This set is a cool minifigure set. I'm not familiar with the clone wars, but this set has pretty cool figures, which are all the same. It's an easy build, with some cool guns. Nothing really special here.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I was looking for a for something like this for my Baby Jogger City Mini stroller. I looked at their branded option for nearly $30 and only so-so reviews. Being frugal, I was on the hunt for something less expensive that would get the job done. The Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory is great. It is a heavy duty fabric that can basically stand up on end although it can be flattened as it arrived that way in the packaging. The cup holders will hold a pop can or a water bottle just fine. And I love the space in the middle for anything extra you would need to bring. There is a zipped mesh little pocket in the inside as well that I didn't know it had before purchasing. It would be perfect to put a house key in or a few dollars, etc. I was worried how it might hang from the City Mini and if I could easily get things in and out of it. The velcro straps are very long and you can adjust how high or low you would want it to sit as well as where on the handle bars you would want it to be. The ONLY drawback is the logo printed on the outside. It is rather obnoxious. The design isn't very professional or modern and it's big with colors that aren't very 'today'. I am a graphic designer so I think that is the only reason it bugs me. I will either hang it backwards on the stroller or even put black tape over it. It is just one of my hang ups, I guess. This is going to get the job done and I'm happy about it's affordable price tag. I highly recommend the purchase of this accessory.

B0033AI4CK|4.0|Network is one of the most prophetic films ever made. It not only satirizes the medium of television in the mid 70s, but also predicts current television trends, like hysterical talk show hosts and outlandish reality shows.  When a news anchor suffers a nervous breakdown on the air and shouts, \\"I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it anymore\\", it sets the whole tone of the film. This phrase has become one of the most memorable of cinema in the last decade, because its sentiment is still true today. The viewing public feels utterly powerless.    Howard Beale's rants about the downtrodden and corporate mergers now seem more real than ever. In the film a powerful network executive explains to Beale there are no countries, just companies like Exxon, AT&T, and GM.    Beale's character in the film is being manipulated by a cunning executive shrewdly played by Faye Dunaway. She has created this angry prophet of the airwaves. Also featured is a reality show about angry revolutionaries that broadcast their illegal exploits. Today's reality programs don't show illegal activities being committed, but they do push the boundaries of good taste. The once lowly UBS network has becomes a ratings success.    The older broadcasters in the film seem to be the only ones portrayed with consciences. They reminisce about the good old days of Ed Marrow, and watch in horror as Dianne (Dunaway) turns their once proud network into a circus act.  However, eventually all circus acts become stale, and Beale is murdered for poor ratings. That is one part of the plot that seems farfetched today.
B000002NBY|5.0|This Grammy Award-winning album from 1986 is probably Paul Simon's crowning achievement in a stellar career with many high-points. His peerless songwriting and poignant lyrics are fused with intelligent use of folk and brass instruments: Zulu Mbaqanga rhythms, the Ladysmith Black Mambazo choir showcasing their a capella style plus the Zydeco creole music of Louisiana; the Everly Brothers, Linda Ronstadt and Los Lobos also feature in cameo performances and the whole mish-mash, improbably, works beautifully and makes for a one-off classic. It's absolutely gorgeous and hasn't aged a day in 25 years.<br /><br />The album works best when listened to as a whole experience, rather than sampled track by downloaded track - like having a full meal rather than just eating the beans one day, and the sauce on another occasion. Only when the whole is savoured and digested can the extraordinary blend of complimentary musical styles be appreciated, and the grand creation be enjoyed and fully understood.<br /><br />The 1986 CD release is in every way superb, with depth and richness of sound allowing for the subtleties of the unusual instrumentation and vocal combinations to shine. In my view, the 2011 `re-master' should be avoided. Like so many modern `re-masters' the result is not an improvement; it's harsher, more brash, less subtle - though it works OK if you're playing it loud in a moving car. But for the best listening experience, get the original 1986 release if you possibly can: the sound mix is far superior.<br /><br />Regardless, `Graceland' is a truly classic album which should be in any serious music collection.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This was a good film....my father (AGE 90)was in the 1st Marine Division in WWII, 5th Marines in Guadacanal.  I talked with him recently and the film was an accurate depiction of events.  Those brave Marines!  I'm glad I purchased the DVD series.
B0050546IM|5.0|Without being over-dramatic or hype-y, this gives me hope for new/\\"pop\\" music.  Akin to electronic shoegaze, the ethereal, lush, sexy and somber moods on this album got under my skin and into my head the instant I put the album on.  Washed Out manages to mix my favorite combination of moods in ways that few artists ever do (among them are The Cure, Slowdive, Boards of Canada, Future Sound of London, and even early 90s RnB act P.M. Dawn).  I was pretty surprised to find out how popular Washed Out actually was -- this kind of stuff is usually too deep for the masses.    Moving from nostalgia to sadness to sex within the span of a few chords, this album is of fairly consistent quality and style from start to finish; every song is really good and you can tell he has honed in on his sound.  While becoming somewhat predictable structurally, that doesn't matter much against the sheer feeling of the songs.    My 2nd and 3rd listen of this album was driving with the windows down and sunroof open toward/down Pacific Coast Highway as the sun was setting.  For an hour or two I felt like I was in a movie.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|There is not a darn thing I would say bad about Grey's Anatomy. I have all the seasons and currently waiting on the 7th season. Get ready for a ton of surprises in this season. The shipping was fast and free - thank you Amazon! :)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|\\"21\\" by Adele is very heartfelt and original.  I was convinced to check out the cd when I saw my husband viewing the online video of one of the military females doing an excellent cover of \\"Rolling in the Deep\\".  I also enjoy this cd because Adele put so much of her heart and her feelings about her former love into many of her songs.  My favorite musical gem in \\"21\\" is Adele's cover of \\"Lovesong\\". \\"Lovesong\\" is a great song about loving someone through many years regardless of what happens in life.  \\"21\\" by Adele is best to get  for anyone that enjoys pop songs about the dramatic side of love.
B004XQO90O|5.0|Loved this movie. Keeps you wondering what is going to happen. Great actors. Will watch again. Loaned to my sister and she loved it to....
B0050CQY1W|5.0|\\"4\\" by Beyonce is a good  recent musical effort put out by Beyonce.  Many of her songs are very motivating from the standpoint of going after what you want.  My favorite musical track on this cd is \\"Love on Top\\".  \\"Love On Top\\" is a musical track about an enduring love relationship that prevails regardless of what happens in life.  The biggest reason why I recommend \\"4\\" by Beyonce is because many of the songs have a unique musical feel reminiscent of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (one of my other favorite Beyonce songs).  She bravely experiments musically in this cd, and it works out well.  Many who enjoy Beyonce's  \\"Sweet Dreams\\" musical track is going to like \\"4\\" because it pushes the musical boundary envelope in a similar way.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|This movie was a little slow but overall a good movie. Gotta love Matthew McConaughey as a lawyer. He is always good in that role.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|\\"Planet Pit\\" by Pit Bull is a well-compiled medley of high-energy dance tracks.  The musical tracks on this song are definitely good for helping to increase physical energy because they have a fun party feel.  Many of the collaborations on this cd are also very good.  My favorite musical track on this cd is \\"Took My Love\\".  \\"Took On Love\\" is about the ability of a woman to be enchanting.  \\"Planet Pitt\\" by Pitt Bull is best to get if you enjoy fun  dance/electronica club music that you can play to raise your mood and/or at a public forum such as a party.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Is there such a thing as free will?  Is there really that one person out there that is meant just for you?  And what would you do to be able to stay with your \\"soul mate?\\"<br /><br />\\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" was a clever, visually dazzling movie.  Matt Damon as David and Emily Blunt as Elise were well cast as the politician and his ballerina girlfriend.  The mysterious manipulators of their lives were creepy but well played especially by Anthony Mackie as Harry, John Slattery as Richardson, and Terrance Stamp as Thompson. I also liked Michael Kelly as Charlie, friend, speechwriter, campaign manager? for David.<br /><br />The movie flowed well but not so quickly that I had a hard time keeping up - with the story and special effects (like I did in \\"Inception\\" at times).<br /><br />Fun but thought provoking, too.
B004UC1WN8|5.0|I was inspired to get \\"Love\\" by Jennifer Lopez  one day when my husband was whistling her \\"On the Floor\\" tune.  I care to check out the music he is interested in because of the fact that I love him very much.  Needless to say, \\"Love\\" by Jennifer Lopez is very catchy and has elements of excitement and adventure in the musical tracks.  My favorite musical track in this collection is \\"Run the World\\".  \\"Run the World\\" is an excellent musical track about the unlimited power of two souls in a loving relationship.  \\"Love\\" by Jennifer Lopez is best to get if you enjoy pop and/or dance music.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I have to say the first time I watched this movie, after about 20 minutes, I wondered if there were going to be any words.  I have now seen this movie over 75 times now and still love it each time I watch it.  While I don't think you need to watch it that many times to really get it, I think you do need to watch it at least twice.  This movie is never going to be considered a classic by Disney standards, but it really should be.  This was the very first movie my three year old son ever watched and it quickly became his favorite - so much so he named his special sleep toy \\"Eve.\\"  This movie entertains little ones while also entertaining and reminding adults the importance of our world and our relationships with other people.  If this movie didn't move you the first time you watched it, I encourage you to watch it again.  You'll pick up a lot more and hopefully feel inspired to get in touch with a friend or do something good for our planet.
0439023483|4.0|But I enjoyed this book very much. I sat down and read it in a day and a half. I thought that the subject would be too dificult for me to handle - kids that have to kill each other to stay alive themselves, with only one left standing. But I did not experience what I thought I would once I got into the book. Somehow, it's slow and methodical, but yet full of action and fast-moving at the same time. This is probably a very awful review, but I'm not quite certain how to describe this book without giving everything away.   The world that the author has created is very futuristic, and yet, it is also mingled with old-fashioned, as the characters in the outlying districts seem primative compared to the futuristic Capitol city. The Capitol has convinced the districts under them that they must depend on them (the Capitol) for their very existence. There are strict laws that must be followed, and to step out of line is to risk punishment or death. A long-ago squashed rebellion by the districts has led the Capitol to implement these Hunger Games every year, involving one boy and one girl between the ages of 12-18 from each district. The purpose is to keep proving to them that the district people are nothing without the Capitol and that they can control them.   The ending is open, obviously for the sequels, and I'm definitely interested in continuing the story.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a great Cd, any one would be glad to have it. Adele has a wonderful voice and goes way beyond her years looking forward to what else is to come.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|This series is epic and only Blu-ray on a good HDTV can do it justice. The time and talent that went into this product is astounding. I can't recommend it enough. Don't even think about buying the Oprah version - David Attenborough is the best.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book along with the whole series! It's the best book/set of books that I have read in awhile. Once I started reading it, I had a really hard time putting it down. It held my attention throughout the whole series-once a book was done I instantly went and bought the next one. Awesome work!!
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Now here is a Blu Ray transfer that is truly outstanding!<br />The video quality, given the age of this movie, is truly outstanding.<br /><br />They must have kept the master in a environmentally controlled<br />room/vault for sure.[no doubt]<br /><br />Amazing video quality, especially when viewed on a good quality video set up.[or even a basic Blu Ray set up]<br /><br />Obvously when they filmed this movie, they used a very high quality recording system/tape,<br />then carefully preserved it.<br /><br />Highly recommended on the video quality alone, not to mention its 2:30 minute content!<br /><br />BM
0887431453|5.0|I got this for my 3 year old to do while I'm homeschooling my 6 year old. She loves it. She does mostly all the school work my 6 year old does except while I'm teaching reading skills I let my 3 year old work in this book and she never gets bored. She would probably finish the entire book in a week if I let her. There are plenty of pages for her do and a lot of different activities that she really benefits from. The only thing that I haven't found so far are any cut and paste pages. The book might have them but I haven't seen any yet. So that was disappointing but not anything major. It's also very bright and colorful which she likes.
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|I was almost amazed at the video quality for this Blu Ray disk, given the age of the movie.<br /><br />If you have a high resolution video system [or even a quality set up], I though this Blu Ray was worth the extra $$$ over the standard DVD[which I also own].<br /><br />Not all Blu Ray movies, especially older movies transfered to the Blu Ray format, are created equal, as many are aware, but this one is pretty good, especially if it can be had at a reduced price.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My wife and I did not think that Ponyo was among Miyazaki's best, until our five year old daughter found endless delight in it.  Having seen it a dozen times, the film's gentle story of innocent love and friendship, coupled with gorgeous, artful images of a Japanese seatown have grown on me.  While I would watch Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro when my kid is not around, I am thankful to Miyazaki that he produced a film appropriate in tone, story, message and editing, for young children.  We are one of those families that tries to minimize exposure to mainstream kid's movies, mostly because their pace is too fast, with too much emphasis on action and stories revolving around adult love and marriage (e.g., the Disney princess films).   Ponyo takes it's time, but delivers magical moments and a pleasurable stillness that I have never seen achieved in US animated films.  As many times as I have seen it, I still delight in it's funniest and most touching moments.  If you are looking for an alternative to Disney and Pixar for your young ones, you can't go wrong with Ponyo.
030746363X|5.0|This is the only diet (lifestyle change, really) where I haven't been starving. I eat a handful of nuts, beef jerky, or almond butter between meals of 30 g of protein. I'm 5'7, 128 and wear a size 2-4. Oh, and I'm 45 and have 4 kids. I stopped running 50 miles a week and cut down to 6, started walking with hubby and doing the kettlebell swings twice weekly. If you like protein, this will work for you! Can't say enough good things about it.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|I had seen a couple of trailers before going to see this movie and I knew that Jason Momoa from Stargate Atlantis was cast as the lead.  I wasn't expecting much.  All I have to say is that it delivered everything that I could hope for in a Conan movie.  This movie isn't getting enough hype.  Jason Momoa does a great job portraying everything that I know about Conan (...I've read about 10 comics and have seen the 80's movies a few times).  In my opinion, the acting, the filming, the directing, the scenery and the story were all superb.  Five stars... what can I say?.. I'm a big fan of the comic-to-movie adaptations (they're my favorites).    You won't want to take your kids to this... it's a Barbarian movie (a considerable amount of brutal Violence, some nudity).  All good stuff :)    There was only one reference to Crom which I found peculiar, though they did mention \\"the Gods\\" several times.
0307887960|5.0|I read this book and I think it's great, but I know that to follow this diet you are going to have to be  quite creative. Talk about a lot of protein. I like to eat meat, but it is a bit boring. But the Gallete (pancake) tastes really good and you can make one that is savory.I had to make one for a test run. I just finished the book so I am going to begin the diet come next week. Some of the advice seems a little sketchy and goes against what we typically think about healthy eating, but hey I am going to give it a shot. The diet on the outset seems like it would work, but you all know that nothing can take the place of eating well rounded meals. My advice so far since I just finished the book is to drop the weight that you want to lose and work out as often as you can. Then go back to eating well and exercising.  Also this diet seems to follow the Atkins diet, but I think it is MUCH MUCH better because later you can have a bit of fruit and veggies. But over all I feel like this is a pretty good plan to follow. Wish me luck !!! And good luck to those who want to give it a try. BEST OF LUCK!!!
0553057006|5.0|I cannot believe how wonderfully helpful this book has been in my life. I originally came across it at my local library. Although I was caught off guard by the title, what was written on the front and back inside covers were what made me check it out. Before I even got a fourth of the way through, I decided it was a book I needed to own.<br /><br />Dr. Forward is my hero! She totally opened my eyes to thinking about my childhood in an adult manner allowing me to deal with my childhood in a productive and life changing way. I feel as though I can finally stand on my own two feet when dealing with my folks without being defensive and childish.<br /><br />If by chance Dr. Forward ever sees this review...thank you, thank you, thank you! You are my hero!

159448385X|4.0|I read the Kite Runner first and thought it was a good book.  Then I read \\"A Thousand. . .\\" and thought it was better because it was much more visual.  The abuse of women and children and the deplorable living conditions were very much in the forefront of my thoughts the entire time I was reading. At times I was overwhelmed with sadness and had to take a break and put the book down.  I am much more educated about a country that I've only seen and heard about in the news. I was constantly reminded of how well I am living and having read this book, I am much more grateful.
B0051CSIKQ|2.0|Well, we've got yet another end of the world flick, but this time they're no zombies--just vampires.  The plague was caused by a virus (aren't they all?) and everyone now is bound for the \\"New Eden\\" (a/k/a Canada) beause it is viewed as some kind of safe haven.  Don't ask me; I didn't write the movie.<br /><br />Wow.  I'm really surprised at these glowing reviews.  I found \\"Stake Land\\" to be very amateurish (in both look and feel).  No character has any sort of depth to him/her.  Characters are introduced for the sole purpose of being later devoured by the vampires.  Of course, there was \\"Mister,\\" who was supposed to be Mr. Billy Bad A**, but looked like a poor man's Michael Masden sans acting ability.  Also, there were too many inconsistencies about the vampires--some were not affected at all by sunlight; others were.  The Vampire effects are pretty sub-par.  Where there could have been some kind of depth to the plot, the filmmakers opted instead for a child's game of \\"tend-like\\" and seemed to just make up the story as they went along.  And then it ends.<br /><br />Winner of the Midnight Madness Award at the Toronto International Film Festival and directed by Jim Mickle, \\"Stake Land\\" needs a real sharp stake right through its heart.  If this is the future of horror, then horror needs to be very afraid.

0142501123|5.0|This is a wonderful, deliciously funny picture book told in rhyme. A witch flying on her broom drops first one thing (hat, ribbon, wand), then another. Each time, she orders the broom, \\"Down!\\" The broom goes to ground and the witch sees that another creature has helped by finding her lost item. That creature (the first is a dog) then asks if there's \\"room on the broom\\" for him. The witch never hesitates: Yes, she replies. So the witch and dog ride on the broom, and then the witch drops something else. In this manner, the witch ends up with four animals riding on the broom . . . which then breaks in half because the weight is too heavy. Down tumble the animals, into a bog. And while that's happening, a dragon captures the witch with the intention of eating her.<br /><br />The witch is saved by those she gave a ride to, and then the five friends contribute to the witch's cauldron and she creates something magical: a better ride for all of them.
1935670913|5.0|Thank you so much for publishing this book.  I started bragging about it BEFORE I read it.  Now that I have, this is a MUST READ for aspiring authors.  - Dan Uitti, Past President, CT Authors & Publishers Association
B001B93PQ0|5.0|As a person who rarely consents to buying an album in these days of free music, I bought this 2-disc album and have never looked back. Mayer really comes alive LIVE!!! Whereas even his magnum opus [[ASIN:B000H0MKGK Continuum]] sounds cut for radio (blah! I won't even bring up [[ASIN:B002QEXN2K Battle Studies]]), his raw talent really shines through on Where the Light Is.<br /><br />Disc 1 begins with Mayer, mostly solo, doing a 5-song acoustic set. It's beautiful. The next 8 on Disc 1 are the Trio -- J.M., Palladino on bass, and Jordan on drums. Kickin'. These are infectious, bluesy, tear-it-up-John-Mayer, straight-up jams. Now I'm no blues aficionado, but what Mayer does with these 8 songs almost made me one. Disc 1 has done about as much time in my car stereo as any other CD ever has (right there with [[ASIN:B0000CD5FR Eagles : The Very Best Of (2CD)]], for I am a guitar-laden, classic 70's rock nut). Fully expect to be humming, whistling, singing, and/or playing these tunes -- and having to come back for more! Disc 2 is the full band set and definitely gold too.<br /><br />All of Continuum is on here except, to my dismay, \\"In Repair\\" and \\"Dreaming with a Broken Heart.\\" I own Continuum but it is still totally worth the moolah to own this. Where the Light Is really is his greatest hits to date. Alas, if only he would've recognized he'd really come into his own with John Mayer Trio and not gone back to the made-for-radio rabble of Battle Studies.

B0018PJEYY|5.0|For the very first time in Moody Blues (the reorganized group which produced the \\"modern\\" sound we know as Moody Blues) recording history, two firsts occurred.  A QUESTION OF BALANCE dealt directly with modern political, almost protest, subject matter, rather than centering their efforts on spiritual and speculative introspection dealing with the human condition alone.  Here, The Moody Blues addressed the Vietnam War, ecological carelessness (pollution, overpopulation, environmental exploitation), and painted a bleak picture of humanity in general.  Secondly, The Moody Blues recorded this album without the lush orchestrations and overdubs which dominated all their prior albums.  They recorded in as much a manner as they could perform the songs in concert without sounding entirely stripped down.  The result was a fantastically organic album that neither departed from their inherent natural sound, nor sacrificed the beauty of their compositions.  Even without all the usual overdubbing and orchestration, between the acoustic fullness of their instruments, the lead electric guitars, the astounding mellotron, and the driving drums by Edge, The Moody Blues had lost nothing in the translation!<br /><br />Additionally, not only is the instrumentation on QUESTION less \\"lush\\", consequently it became more \\"rock\\" and accessible to a wider audience, leading it to chart in the USA much higher than any previous album (#3 in the US and #1 in UK).  Pinder, already playing 12-string acoustic guitar, piano, harpsichord, organ, mellotron, (not to mention on earlier albums: upright bass, cello, autoharp, tambura) now added the Moog Synthesizer to the Moodies sound.  Justin Hayward had been experimenting with his lead electric guitar tones over the course of 4 previous albums and on QUESTION he added numerous effects pedals and fuzz boxes and \\"developed for himself a very melodic buzzing guitar-solo sound\\" (quote from liner notes).  Check out the background lead guitar on Pinder's How Is It We Are Here and you will hear the same classic buzz guitar that predominates the Blue Jays album (with John Lodge) and some of his other solo album songs.<br /><br />The song Question has always been attributed to Vietnam, even though the wording is more generically useful as the Everyman addressing War in general.  Question was actually recorded in just one take, with no double-tracking, no overdubbing.  A unique rocking/ballad/rocking format with heartfelt vocals and strong 12-string acoustic guitar lead, accented with mellotron, tambourine, and drums (and a very subtle bass line), it was a perfect winner for chart success.  How Is It We Are Here by Pinder plays with mellotron and moog leads, accented by fuzzy guitar, it is Pinders casual questioning of man's incessant need to rape mother earth and questions just how smart we really think we are.  According to Ray Thomas, And The Tide Rushes In was promptly written after an argument with his wife, easily discernable in the lyrics, however the song can also illustrate a discourse between man and nature which lends itself perfectly to the overarching theme of the album.  Don't You Feel Small by Edge is another of his non-poetry rock songs, he whispers the lyrics over the harmonized vocals of Hayward and Lodge, and again Man and Nature are measured against each other as we are asked to \\"look at progress, then count the cost\\".  John Lodge's Tortoise And The Hare is a highlight on the album with its rabbit-racing drumming and Justin's superb lead guitar.  Speaking of Justin and John, It's Up To You and Minstrel Song are both beautiful soft-rock songs with intricate guitar detailing.  Then come the two real highlights of the album (for me).  Dawning Is The Day is a simply gorgeous mother-nature love song, delicate yet vibrant, Justin's vocals are spot on perfect and this one ranks up with his best written songs ever.  Curious fact is that most people my age and tad older will recall that the words and melody were used in a Lady Clairol commercial during the 70's.  I guess that is just as much a sellout as Carlos Santana allowing Evil Ways to be used in a \\"should a gentleman offer a lady a Tiparillo\\" advertisement?  After this beautiful expression of love to mother earth, comes the heavy hitter.  Melancholy Man is perhaps, no, it is truly. Mike Pinder's hardest most gut-wrenching song.  Melancholy Man is a heavy mellotron-laden with Moog assistance, no holds barred, accusatory and prophetic, lament on the state of planet earth and a vision of destruction and woe.  He uses near-biblical prose to deliver one of The Moody Blues saddest and biggest songs.  This song actually was a number one hit in France (go figure), was an FM staple, and is a huge fan-favorite, not to mention one of mine!  No overdubbing necessary because the mellotron can be an entire orchestra if needed (for as long as it works before breaking down) the lead keys on Melancholy Man will make your hair prickle at the back of your neck and just might bring tears to your eyes.  The storm grows so strong in this song that the fade out and flute-gentle mellotron opening to the Edge/Thomas finale, The Balance, is a welcome and uplifting climax to the album.  Never have two songs (it is always darkest just before the dawn) so perfectly given a novel/movie plot ending as Melancholy Man and The Balance do.  When you think the story is going to have the saddest ending possible, the protagonist switches batters in the bottom of the 9th, and Pinder reads Edge's message of love and forgiveness to provide us all with at the least, a hope of a happy ending.  Justin, John, and Ray give uplifting, angelic backing vocals and the story closes with The Balance, necessary to solve all the problems (questions) that were laid at this particular table.<br /><br />Although The Moody Blues would return to their lush production styles on EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR and 7TH SOJOURN, the rock writing style and the more progressive rock edge dynamic which is pioneered on QUESTION will be carried over onto both of those albums, to the point where these last three of the core-7 albums will actually win, place, and show on the charts, on both sides of the Atlantic, a feat which demonstrates the universal appeal that grew with the Moody Blues over the course of 7 albums in six short years.  Anyone who like solid classic rock, progressive (art) rock, or just good rock and roll with meaningful lyrics, terrific hooks, and intricate instrumentation with orchestral flourishes, will love A QUESTION OF BALANCE.irol commercial during the 70's.

Although The Moody Blues would return to their lush production styles on EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR and 7TH SOJOURN, the rock writing style and the more progressive rock edge dynamic which is pioneered on QUESTION will be carried over onto both of those albums, to the point where these last three of the core-7 albums will actually win, place, and show on the charts, on both sides of the Atlantic, a feat which demonstrates the universal appeal that grew with the Moody Blues over the course of 7 albums in six short years.  Anyone who like solid classic rock, progressive (art) rock, or just good rock and roll with meaningful lyrics, terrific hooks, and intricate instrumentation with orchestral flourishes, will love A QUESTION OF BALANCE.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The fact that this says \\"The Original\\" but is instead the 1997 CGI sexed-up versions is despicable. It should say \\"Special Edition\\" as they were always previously referred to.<br /><br />There are literally thousands of people asking for the ORIGINAL UNALTERED movies so that we can BUY THEM WITH MONEY. Why does it have to be so hard?
B000F4LPJ6|3.0|The film version of Koushun Takami's novel BATTLE ROYALE makes major changes that may annoy fans of the book.  The biggest change is the central premise behind the story.  In the novel, \\"Battle Royale\\" is part of the totalitarian government's program designed to terrorize the populace and prevent resistance - each year, 42 middle school students are taken from their families and forced to participate in a brutal competition that will result in the deaths of all but one of the children.  In the film version, directed by Kinji Fukasaku, \\"Battle Royale\\" is the government's response to a rash of teenage violence and misbehavior.  The film opens with scenes of students refusing to go to school, openly resisting authority, and even violently assaulting adults (including a teacher).  As stated in the film, \\"The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act, aka the BR [or Battle Royale] Act.\\"  This changes things greatly - while the children in the novel are completely innocent middle school students being manipulated by an evil government, the children in the film are portrayed as miscreants who brought the horror on themselves.<br /><br />Another major change is the role of the instructor who directs the program - in the novel, this is Sakamochi, who explains the rules to the students and begins the terrorism; in the film, the instructor is a new character, Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), who is a former teacher of the students (and who has a strange and unexplained relationship with Noriko (Aki Maeda), the young female protagonist).  The difference here is striking - while Sakamochi was portrayed as a heartless symbol of the totalitarian government, Kitano demonstrates human qualities that allow us to sympathize with him (at least on some level) by the end of the film.<br /><br />Whether these changes bother you or not will probably determine whether you like the film.  I found it to be interesting and engaging, but never quite real.  As expected, there is a lot of violence, but it reminded me more of the kind of thing found in popular video games rather than anything that might actually happen in real life.  Perhaps that was the director's point - he seems to want to numb his audience with over-the-top scenes of gunfire, slashing, gushing blood, and exploding body parts.  I actually found some of the battle scenes laughable - more than a few times I wondered how anyone could absorb so many rounds of machine-gun fire and still keep getting up!<br /><br />It's also a little hard to take all the middle school crush stuff that permeates the film (there is plenty of this in the novel, too, but because the characters seemed more real and fleshed out it made more sense; here it just seems absurd).  The central couple, Noriko and Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara) are believable, but others don't work as well.<br /><br />Overall, the film version of BATTLE ROYALE can be enjoyed as a stand-alone movie, but as an adaptation of the novel it's not very successful.  It's worth a watch, but don't expect the level of complexity and thematic depth found in the novel..

0425241505|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, english not being my primary language and all, but all I could say is BUY IT!  This book is definitely a keeper, I would be reading it again soon! I love all the characters in this book, Dragos (YUM) the macho possessive \\"You are mine\\" type, larger than life and older than God, that still manage to be funny.  Pia is funny, smart,  untrusting for reasons that we will learn later in the book.  It is a fun book that I honestly couldn't put down, The author did a brilliant job putting together a whole package for us e.g.; a fantasy world/believable romance/ steamy scenes/ action/humor, etc.    Don't miss it!
B004LL1HM4|1.0|Fleet Foxes on \\"Helplessness Blues\\" channels a sunshine-pop sound spawned by the likes of the Mamas & the Papas and Beach Boys, and injects its own vibrant personality, fragile and haunting on the lovelorn \\"Lorelai\\"; wild and wispy as \\"Harvest Moon\\"-era Neil Young on the title track; stark and fierce as a mountaintop blizzard on \\"Sim Sala Bim,\\" a bluesy tune that conjures the mournful side of Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />I'm kidding, of course ...<br /><br />Because when I attempted to listen to these Lady Gagas of stoner folk after I had run out of weed, and sensation flowed back into my brain cells, I lost that spirit of kismet with Kermit the Frog. That lime-green glove had been mocking me from the TV screen the whole time. I know what you're thinking, but it's not smoking marijuana that makes me paranoid, it's the constant fretting over where my next high is going to be coming from that gives me The Fear.<br /><br />Anyway, the more I listened to these bearded Johnny Appleseeds, the more I felt like some pteromechanophobic John Denver strapped to the back of Falkor the luckdragon on a fetid journey above a \\"What Dreams May Come\\" land of unicorns pooping rainbows. Dear Gandalf, keep these spiders from spinning their splintery cocoons inside my eyeballs, I thought-screamed, as I was force-fed toe-jam cotton candy by my \\"nurses.\\"<br /><br />P.S.: I'm actually hip enough to realize that stuck in the middle of this Elfquest soundtrack is a gem of a song called \\"The Shrine/An Argument,\\" but since life is black and white and never gray, it still gets the one star. Sorry, nobody ever said it was going to be easy.

B000I543SM|1.0|This movie moves incredibly slow and uninteresting.  There are a lot of different characters and they are all two dimensional.  The story centers around a rich and mean man hosting a shooting party in the early 1900's England.  You are forced to sit through painful and banal conversations and gossip with no real point.  I won't give anything away (almost anyone who manages to stay awake could figure out the dynamics that serve as the unexciting climax), but you are finally told of the relationship of one of the visiting servants and servants of the house after about two hours of pain.  It was that relationship that led to the murder of the rich guy.  The inspector that is sent out is a complete idiot and just leaves without doing any investigation or having any real suspect.  I am not sure if they were trying to make his character funny or not but he isn't.  I recommend watching paint dry, it is more exciting and will be over quicker than this debacle.  It had soo much potential, they could have made it into a mystery but chose instead to focus on cardboard and predictable squabbles between the guests.  What a waste.

He wins the special golden ticket and Willie Wonka ends up giving him his Chocolate Factory. The part I liked best was when the naughly little girl, Violet eats gum that is newly invented and not perfected yet, she fills up with blueberry juice and becomes a big round blueberry. I chose this book because I love chocolate. You will find out what Oompah Loompahs are and what an everlasting gobstopper is.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. As a lover of dystopian novels through the ages I truly believe that The Hunger Games Trilogy is a relevant and modern take on what Huxley and other authors have foretold in their respective eras. With that being said, this was not as captivating as the first book of the series though equally as enjoyable.
B0016OMFO8|5.0|These heavy hitters, GEORGE  HARRISON, ROY ORBISON, BOB DYLAN, TOM PETTY AND JEFF LYNNE all of whom are righteous individually could do no wrong when they put out this cd, \\"The Traveling Wilburys Collection.\\"<br />Their sense of humor and ability to compliment one another talent wise made this a great purchase.<br />A must have for any collector!!<br />All my purchases from Amazon are pretty much in the used section where you can get slightly used or brand new for such a low price plus they are guaranteed or your money back.<br />Why pay more when you can get them for less? Right !?!
B0050PYNO4|4.0|i liked it quite a bit love pegg and frost modern day christians will not like the storyline but thats ok its just entertainment folks. i would recomend it for a few good laughs
0553582038|5.0|I guess i am very surprised at the negative reviews on this book.  I read the first three books in the series and was amazed at how good they were with each one getting slightly better than the last, peaking with A Storm of Swords.  After reading all the virulent negative reviews of AFFC I expected this was going to be horrible going in...  I was completely wrong.  Sure, my favorite character, Tyrion is not directly in the book (not to mention Jon and Danny among others) and that is a disappointment, but the POVs that *are* in the book are incredibly interesting and insightful.  I will swim against the tide in saying Cersei's POV chapters are incredible.  I may not like the character, but seeing things from her point of view was very interesting.  I am also enjoying all of the other POVs... old and new...  So in a nutshell, while AFFC may not eclipse the first three books before it, it in my opinion is at least as good as the first one, and maybe the second.  Considering I gave them both five stars, I see no reason to give this any less...  I am just glad I came to the series later on, so I did not have the long wait as others had to go through before this one and ADWD.  Great stuff and I look forward to the rest of the series.
078322737X|1.0|Like star wars and thx 1138, there are many spots in american grafitti that are a bit boring and could use the Lucas magic cgi brush to make the movies more exciting and accessible to a younger audience. Lucas could take some tips from great new films like fast and furious and really add some pop to this weathered looser of a movie. Main problem the movie is old the songs are from the 50's(note to Lucas...could use some 50 cent or soldja boy)and there are no special effects to make the driving scenes more awesome. A few superjumps and maybe a shoot out while driving 100 mph could have saved this movie. Where is the lucass magic in this movie?! Its no willow that's for sure.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I loved the cast!  I was a bit worried about Mary-Kate being able to transition from cute to semi-evil but she did AWESOME.  She was by far one of my favorite characters.  Alex and Vanessa were fabulous; perfect chemistry and they played well off of each other.  Neil was great as the teacher, adding just the right amount of comedy.  Lisa was a version of the wise Mrs. Potts.  As one reviewer already mentioned, it reminded me very much of the cartoon Beauty and the Beast by Disney, but much better I must say(and I loved the cartoon!).  I've never read the book; I didn't know until reading through these reviews that there was a book.  I will definitely read it now because I liked the movie so much.  I'm glad, however, that I didn't read the book before as I am much too critical of movies if I've read the book and it spoils my enjoyment of them.  I loved the ending they chose AND the alternate ending that was included on the DVD.  I intend to buy this on DVD ASAP!  It is VERY highly recommended by... ME!  Which is all you need to know because movie critics don't know what they're talking about half the time and the other half is just stuff they've made up to sound smart(which doesn't really help them in my opinion).
0694013013|5.0|[[ASIN:039924204X Eric Carle's Very Little Library]] I was very pleased with the ease of ordering and how quickly the set arrived.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Sharpening a knife is a skill that requires hours of practice. I purchased a knife sharpening kit that came with 6 grades of grind stones and a booklet thinking I would be sharpening like a pro after reading the instruction manuel. Wrong! The Smith's Sharpener is easy to use for novices like myself, and it takes the guess work out of how much angle to get a sharp edge. My pocket knife had many nicks in its edge and it took 5 minutes of drawing the the blade through the carbide groove to set the edge. Another five minutes drawing the blade through the ceramic stones and I was happy I purchased the Smith's sharpener. I have seen other compact sharpener and chose this one because the stones can be replaced, and a plus it has sharpening rod for serrated edge blades. Using the sharpening rod was a no-brainer too, you can give the blade a quick sharpening. I bought this strictly for pocket knife sharpening, I can agree this sharpener is not made for thicker blades.
0802473156|4.0|this is a great book for newly weds, however if you're already having trouble in your marriage i suggest seeing a marriage counselor. Gary Chapman has a lot of interesting ideas, however for non-religious folk this book won't do anything for you.
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|I wish I did not have to give this a star.  It deserves negative stars!!  Anyone who thinks this is an accurate portrayal of the characters from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte clearly has never read or does not understand the novel.  This was the worst and most horrible version of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen.  It is simply awful -- it is far too \\"hurried\\".  The flashing back and forth is most annoying and disjointed and from the terrible acting one cannot gain a true sense of the characters as they were written.  I love and greatly admire the Bronte sisters works, have read all of their books and writings dozens of times and have visited Haworth in Yorkshire.  I have run on the moors amongst the heather yelling \\"Heathcliff\\"!!  Do not waste your time with this movie; it is a wretched and feeble attempt to recreate on screen one of the greatest written masterpieces of all time.  I would highly recommend Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke -- it is wonderful -- beautifully done -- and accurate.  I could watch that version over and over and over again.
0385523904|4.0|It would be impossible for Barbara Demick or anyone else to know much about ordinary life in North Korea. It is the most closed society the world has ever known. Cut off from trade, travel, and the internet by a Stalinist, repressive regime holding on desperately to the mythology of the Kim family that has ruled for the past 60 years. Even its own citizens are largely cut off from Pyongyang, save for the privileged few without deformities from malnutrition or ideology.<br /><br />The author tells the story of a handful of North Korean refugees, but the focus is on their lives north of the DMZ from the 1980s up to the mid-2000s. Readers are the beneficiaries of Ms. Demick's prolific interviews with North Koreans; information about the school system, government distribution of food, a Korean caste system, and work life. Much of the story is heartbreaking. Children starve. Men kill themselves for lack of a future. And millions work for no pay.<br /><br />Shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, the DPRK (North Korea) was faced with a dire reality. They had little arable land and few natural resources. Without China supplying tons of food and fuel, the country would starve. Of course, the Chinese don't want millions of refugees flooding their country. The parasitic relationship props up Kim Il Sung, who is revered as a god-like figure.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002ZB26AO Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea]] is well-researched and reads like good fiction. Of course, the hard truth is that it is not. As the world watches for a future implosion, people continue to suffer with little outside assistance and no hope of rebellion against the highly militarized, dystopian state.
B000784WMW|5.0|The best version of Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre.  No contest.  This is hands down the best version I have ever seen.  Don't bother with the others -- because after you have seen this the others will not compare.  The acting is superb and the scenery is beautiful.  Perfectly done.

B004LWZVZM|2.0|First, we all know how this movie ends. It was initially played up because of its historical accuracy, but then you never heard another word. After watching the movie I understood why. They had wonderful costumes and period sets, but the film was extremely bland! Save your money! Sooner or later it will be on the History Channel and you will understand my comments.
044024238X|4.0|Samantha is a corporate lawyer who is on the way to becoming partner at her law firm but she makes a mistake that could cost the firm millions of dollars and instead of facing the music she runs off and puts in for a housekeeper position. The family she works for thinks she has lots of experience but she doesn't and learns along the way with the help of the gardener who becomes her love interest. Overall this is a good book although not Kinsella's best. It gets a bit unrealistic towards the end, because let's face it I seriously doubt if the media would really care about a lawyer deciding to become a maid as much as they did in this book.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|A cute and amazing film with great music and animation. Focusing on a tiny cute kitten Oliver and a pack of hilarious stray dogs. Dodger, the wire fox terrier is my personal fav. Full of love and humor plus action. This classic will live on.
B004V9J3HM|4.0|This guy came thru town w his large band recently, and we saw them not knowing much about him or his history.  Band was tight, seemed to enjoy playing together, and I could brag at work that I'd seen Portnoy the famous drummer live.  The show was directed by Neal Morse, tho, and this cd was featured.  It's a long cd, and there are some extended insrumentals that should please progrock fans, and it's also quite a personal cd, if you listen close to lyrics.  Morse is clearly a talented musician, and anyone looking for tunes you will hear neither on top 40 radio nor Christian radio nor any station I have ever heard of , will find it here.  Here's to more exposure for a guy who has an original voice/sound.
157421327X|4.0|I was pleased with the very prompt service and reasonable prices.  The book was a little too basic for me and I should have ordered a more advanced one.  This one was geared to children and new beginners.  I am however very pleased with the purchase. Good product.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|As a long time fan of the Star Wars world, these changes sadden me. Lucas told a great story that we all fell in love with. THESE ARE NOT THAT STORY. I have copies of the correct story on DVD and while I'd love to see it in HD, these aren't it. Cleaning up things here and there are fine. I LIKE the idea of better looking light sabers. I LIKE the idea of a cleaner looking picture. I'll ACCEPT the idea of cleaning up makeup lines as 60 inches of 1080p might bring to light some distracting makeup effects. What I won't pay for is changing the story I grew up with. Hans shoots first. We don't need Jabba in The New Hope. The original death star explosion was AMAZING.   I recently purchased The Last Starfighter on Blu-ray and have watched it 5 times already. The picture is amazing! The story is the same and the effects still work. When it's a great story, it doesn't need to be changed.   Yet this is the same director that raped Indiana Jones in the last movie, so I'm sad but not surprised.
0670022411|4.0|I really enjoyed Anne Rice's Witching series.  I am also intrigued with the events in Salem MA so this book was a bit up my alley.  It was occasionally confusing due to the high number of characters introduced but once you get it down, it is very good.

0393325172|5.0|I've been a bit intimidated by O'Brian, given his attention to detail in all things 18th (and early 19th) century nautical.  On the recommendation of Amazon reviewers (I guess I can't use the term \\"Amazon friends\\" anymore, can I?) I took the plunge.  I am so glad I did so, and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.  First, a word about my reservations.  Yes, O'Brian does refer frequently to the (initially) dizzying number of sails on square-rigger.  Fear not: one of the principle characters (Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's physician) is also new to the ships, and O'Brian helpfully has a deckhand explain the rigging and purpose of the various sails and lines.  (There is also a very helpful diagaram in the front of the book, but mid-way through I no longer needed to flip back-and-forth, as it became familiar.)<br /><br />The pace of the book is lesiurely, of which readers should also be aware: O'Brian does not provide a complete biography of characters the first few pages we meet them.  Rather, as with real people, their past is gradually revealed through conversation (and the occasional interior monologue), their personality and character similarly slowly shown.  I found it refreshing and, as I began to like Cpt. Aubrey and Dr. Maturin and the rest of the crew, I wanted to know them better.  The plot, in broad terms, revolves around a newly promoted English Captain (Jack Aubrey) and his managing of his first command in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic war.  Having been in a Naval service (I am a former Marine), the pace of life at sea remarkably hasn't changed much: long periods of tedium interspersed with moments of frentic activity.  O'Brian's descriptions of life at sea were excellent, and frankly, left me pining for the \\"good old days\\" when ships were made of wood and canvas.  The burden of command as it weighs on the young Captain, the burning curiosity of Dr. Maturin (a \\"natural philosopher\\" in the parlance of the day - very much a natural scientist as well as a physician) and the intrigue, pitfalls and challenges of promotion were icing on the cake for me.  The description of the naval engagements (and there are several, albiet small skirmishes) had me riveted.<br /><br />I cannot recommend O'Brian strongly enough; the naval language may take some getting used to (I suppose I have a bit of an advantage, but my ships were steel and oil powered), but patience is immensely rewarded.  A fantastic, swashbuckling read.as well as a physician) and the intrigue, pitfalls and challenges of promotion were icing on the cake for me.

B000E97Y6A|4.0|Naomi Watts is one of my favorite actresses. This movie is one of the better re-makes of King Kong. A little too long for my liking, but it held my interest though all of the movie.
0439023513|2.0|First off... I love The Hunger Games series and I have thought about this book for a while after reading it. The first two books were amazing and I couldn't put them down. Really this book was amazing too. Until the last part. The whole point of Katniss going into the games was to save her sister and then Suzanne kills her off!? WTF!? Then she ends up with Peta... who I was hoping for, but she's never really happy. It was such a depressing ending!
B001EOOQEC|5.0|I remember buying this when it first came out! I had to give a few listens before i really got into it! I agree with some of the other comments! As far as the Dio/Sabbath albums...I like Dehumanizer better Mob Rules but still give the nod to Heaven And Hell! Dehumanizer still kicks some major ass! \\"Master Of Insanity\\" & \\"I\\" & \\"Too Late\\" are my favorites! If you missed out on this one back in the day....I Highly recommend this forgotten masterpiece!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Everyone in my family has enjoyed playing this...from my 11 year old daughter to my 65 year old mother. Addictive, cute and so much fun.  Well worth the $0.99!
B00005N5RM|5.0|Except that it's not really a blob, but an amorphous mass of tentacles and some sort of intestines, or maybe they were one of the same.  It matters little, since this is no slow-moving Blob, but an intelligent and highly aggressive bio-creature, with the twist of man's arrogance and stupidity thrown into the mix.<br />I was most impressed with how many \\"main\\" characters died, and quickly, like the sheriff.  That is so much more realistic than a group that escapes death while 100s fall like dead leaves everywhere else.<br />Shawnee Smith was great, beautiful and strong, a true heroine.  I was turned off at first by Kevin Dillon here, but he did OK for what was still a replay of his brother's roles, the rebel tough guy in jeans and trouble with the cops.  The obnoxious bald deputy getting snapped in half as he was pulled through a door was a sick but satisfying effect, he was a pig jerk.<br />The ending, like the original, was left wide open for a sequel, but nothing has yet been made.  Too bad, they could improve it one more time, esp. in this age of reboot before the first film is out on DVD.<br />Overall, an enjoyable film, and enough evil bad humans died to make it worthwhile.
1451629184|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this book.  A tragic story and in all sincerity, many of us enjoy reading real life tragedy, because we have a difficult time envisaging something so horrible could have happened to an individual. You always wonder, what are the circumstances, how does this go on for so many years? While the very reality of what happened is horrible, the book, I fear, is too.  Every page has something to do with a new cat or dog, it really doesn't capture what her life was like, and essentially, aside from the obvious (having children by her captor, which also implies being raped by him as well) there is no mention of every day life in a real way.  The pages are filled with I just want something/someone to love me, cats, dogs, their deaths and her working.  Its tedious and not really much of a story, truth be told.  It doesn't evoke emotion, it simply beckons boredom.  I started skipping over parts because I just couldn't read another paragraph in extreme detail about another cat or dog and how much she loves it or it loves her, or her wondering about her mother in no actual terms, just generically speaking.  The whole story felt vacant - generic.  So I would not recommend this book.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I have been flipping back and forth between Amazon Cloud Drive and Google Music for my 20,000 song collection.   While both user interfaces are sluggish, Amazon MP3 player is by far the worse of the two....to the point of being unusable on my EVO 3d.  There are extremely long pauses while browsing my collection and frequent force closes.  I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app, but the horrible lag in browsing the UI is unacceptable.  I cannot recommend this app for large music collections.  Instead, look at Google Music or Audiogalaxy (the latter only if you can leave your music collection pc on all day).  Both have android clients with usable, albiet slow interfaces for large collections.
B0053EZXRS|5.0|People and their nasty reviews...shame on you! I loved this movie, it had action, humor, and awesomeness all rolled in together. I mean yes a lot of people died, but the humor and the chase was amazing, i just cannot get around people not liking it! I am especially in love with the \\"accountants\\" performance, he cracked my funny bones to pieces! People these days need to get a sense of humor with a dash of let it ride...without bashing the serious into it! I give it a high five! :)
142311339X|5.0|Rick Riordan, I can't thank you enough. My 8-year-old son, who really wasn't a great reader, started reading the Percy Jackson series. Just a half-way into the summer break he finished all books in the series -- It was either he had a book or a tennis racquet in his hand, or he was sleeping! He went onto reading The Heroes of Olympus series, and just finished this one, 500+ pages! He can't wait to get his hands on the next book, and has been asking when Amazon will send a copy to us. Thanks again for great stories!
B0058OUJA4|3.0|I love this game. It is challenging and gets you thinking. There are plenty of ways to complete a level, which is great for replayability.  My only issue is the level editor. Whenever I try to set the starting money it force closes. Devs: Can you please fix this? I have a Droid Incredible. Once fixed this will go up to 5 stars.
B0058A119G|5.0|It's been a long time since a Streisand album has touch this listener with such a jolt of surprise and delight as What Matters Most does. From that very first word of Windmill of Your Mind, \\"Round\\" sung at the start in a fresh raw voice that jolts the sleepy stranger to full attention.  It's the best interpretation this writer has heard of that classic movie song.  It's as if Ms. Streisand invented or perhaps a better word is that she has written this song as she sings it.  It's difficult to choose a favorite selection from these Bergman gems. Barbra's voice and all selections sound renewed. Clearly she loves this album. What a gift to her fans and her beloved loved ones, Alan and Marilyn Bergman. The song, \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\" is so heartfelt, filled with a magic weave, if you will, a touchstone of affirmation, of Barbra's spirit, that it shakes one's soul to a deeper level of being. The set contains songs the listener may not be familiar with.  Most of us know \\"That Face\\" and Nice'N'Easy\\", but they're some pleasant surprises like the title cut. What a nice touch is the bonus disc of some more Bergman classics like \\"The Way We Were, songs from The Oscar Winning Score from Yentl and who can't forget the chart topping duet with Neil Diamond, You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\". Streisand singing is spot on with a wonderful orchestra lead by Bill Ross. This reviewer is reminded of a song from Barbra's past from one of her TV Specials, \\"How Does The Wine Taste\\"? Not bad at all Barbra, a rich fragrance, like fresh flowers, the taste, O' well filled with fruit at the peak of the season, that is a delight to the palate.'
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The DVD was received as advised and in excellent condition.    It is an interesting theme in Vampire folklore that should be watched by all whom enjoy vampire folklore; especially since you find very few people whom are \\"Cajun\\" in the town of Bon Temps, Louisiana.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|It's an interesting plot: an Indian mother whose husband feels they can only afford a son, and will not allow a girl baby to live. In order to save her infant daughter, she puts her in an orphanage, but lives forever with the pain of separation. She is a very sympathetic character. She has strength and conviction and an ability to forgive. Initially her husband is the antagonist and seems purely evil, but as the story develops he becomes more understandable and sympathetic, as well.<br />The problem was with the 'other' story, which was essentially half the book, and is told concurrently. That one is about the NY female doctor  and her Indian husband, who adopt the baby. The writing in those parts wasn't as good. There was a lot of summarized back story, a lot of whining. I found the dialogue, in those sections, to be very wooden and sometimes trite. It didn't help that most of those scenes centered almost exclusively on either the pain of infertility or the daughter's pain at not knowing her past. The result is that those characters seem rather one dimensional. Somehow the author makes it work with the Indian characters, but not with the American ones. I found myself skimming through half the book to get to the scenes in India. So overall, great plot idea, and almost great execution.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I started off this book, not fully knowing what to expect. However, by time I read the second chapter I was absolutely hooked. This is a great book about how love is not like easy, simple fairytales like in many books. I loved the characters development and enjoyed the entire book! Hopefully you will too! :)
1933952806|5.0|This is the book you want. The Nikon D7000 is too feature laden to be without a  guide. If you want to use Nikon's user's manual, good luck. You can't meander through the manual or intuit camera controls. Young writes clearly, avoiding the convolutions, silliness and folderol of books by some really knowledgeable and highly respected writers. It's published by Rocky Nook, which has earned my respect. It uses acid-free paper and builds books to last. I am disgusted by publishers whose books lose pages and fall apart. Young lists up front references to information you need to get going with this camera before you wade through his excellent feature details. Young give his recommendations at the end of each section. Book owners can download a PDF of the book from O'Reilly.com for $5. I don't think this book is something I'll put in the camera bag, however. It's 479 pages and weigh 2 pounds. Thanks for the book Darrell.[[ASIN:1933952237 Mastering the Nikon D700]]
B0050PLT8W|5.0|That this album kicks ass! These guys just keeps producing hit after hit... they have followed up each album with yet another great one, while I personally think the best album by them is [[ASIN:B002MJM8B6 Scars & Souvenirs (CD/DVD)]] this was a good album and from start to finish is a great album to listen to if you like rock music. They are the type of band who like to have fun but put effort into the music and it shines through in this album.. rock does not have to be the \\"most creative\\" or the \\"next huge hit\\" as long as it has good lyrical hooks, a good beat to match the lyrics and sometimes a little guitar solo. Is always appreciated. To bad I will probably not get to see them when they come down here.. Atleast I have this great album till I get the chance to see these guys
B0000047GA|5.0|I won't add any more words of praise as others before have done that well enough, but just want to assuage the worries of any prospective buyer that this album is practically unlistenable due to poor production and acoustics. That may be true compared to modern jazz releases, but comparing this album to the many others I have from '68 to '70 I cannot agree with that assertion. That was the way albums sounded in 1969, that was the state of what was then modern recording technology. For people to whom this is unlistenable, most late 60s recordings must be equally unlistenable. If all you listen to is modern productions from the last 20 years or so, you might reconsider getting this album. If like me you also have blues in your collection which is truly primitive, like some of the old bluesmen from the 30s and 40s, then this album is state of the art. It's all a matter of taste really. So what I'm saying is, if you're used to the late 60s album sound, this is just one more typical example of it. The level of virtuosity and artistry of the players involved overwhelms any shortfall in acoustic quality, and I pity anyone who allows that to get in the way of enjoying this fantastic album.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|The film industry owes a large debt to \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" That seminal idea, of a fake documentary, has launched other movies with various degrees of critical and box office success. This new entry is mostly successful.    Here's the scoop. A three person college film crew is on the tail of, what they think, is a bear poacher. It turns out said poacher is actually a Troll Hunter. They accompany him on his day-to-day and learn a lot (maybe more than they hoped) about Trolls.    This is generally a cool outing. The documentary style is played very well. The viewer gets the feeling he's there with the crew, viewing things as they happen. You like these people. The students are young and energetic. They want to get their story and are overjoyed when it turns out to be bigger than they expected. Even when things get hairy they stick with it. And the hunter is something himself. He's weary (which is why he lets them tag along) and might just want to get all this over with. He's been doing it too long. He's \\"on\\" all the time. No home base. No days off. No vacations. Just the day in, day out drudgery. The story unfolds at an even pace and it makes sense given the circumstances. Being that the viewer enters things at the same time as the students they learn all about Trolls, and their dealings, at the same time. There are some good high-tension scenes and a bit of comic relief to keep things from getting too heavy.     My only gripe in all this are the Trolls themselves. There faces look as though they came out of a Jim Henson movie. It kills the whole sense of reality established during the rest of the film. Other than that the effects are good. They meld seamlessly into the live action. I saw the end coming but I didn't mind. It made sense considering all else that went on.     If you're a fan of 'monster' movies this is a good time. Pop some corn. Pop some beer and have at it.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Visually stunning at times - yes.  Everything else - terrible.  The plot/story line - unwatchable.  There are much better ways to spend 2.  Period.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|After witnessing 2009's cinematic train-wreck, and I was hoping, last, installment of the \\"Final Destination\\" series, I was kind of appalled and disgusted when I heard that there was going to be yet another one. I generously gave \\"The Final Destination\\" a D- grade, for many reasons. It gave into the at-the-time lucrative and exciting 3D gimmick, and didn't deliver on the concept as it was said to. It was a typical horror movie, not bringing anything new to the table at all. While that was expected, it did give some mildly entertaining death scenes, while not necessarily being creative. It featured lousy acting, and an ending that made me happy I didn't pay to see it, as I was working at the movie theatre at that time. It wasn't even good, on a comedic level.     However, I left \\"Final Destination 5\\" a little happier than I did its previous installment. While it's still only for horror fans, it's pretty damn entertaining, and it's more character-driven than the last couple installments have been. Its death scenes are just as creative and fun as they should be, and it made me regain a little bit of my hope in 3D film-making.     It's the same story as it's always been. A gifted (and hot) early twenty-something (Nicholas D'Agosto) with apparently psychic abilities has a vision of him and all of his friends dying in a dramatic accident. He tells everybody, and witnesses them all die one-by-one, doing everything he can to stop it, but realizing, death can't be cheated. In this one, though, there's a little twist, which is a small reason why this film isn't bad as the last few have been. While there's a selected list of who dies next, if the person who's next kills someone, death skips them...or does it?    It's no spoiler, as it's been proven in the four previous movies, each character meets their coup de grace in a quite dramatic way. This one gives you a brief, but worthwhile back-story on each of its characters. It makes you see them as semi-established characters, rather than just teenagers who are about to kick the bucket.     However, why I liked this one is because of its death scenes. They were ten kinds of awesome. There's even a little montage at the end, of creative death scenes from the previous four movies, like a compilation. While its death scenes have never been plausible, as if they could happen in real life, they don't ask to be taken seriously. In a particularly good (and kind of sad) scene, a character is killed by a Lasik surgery machine. That could never happen in real life, for a lot of reasons. But, it's great fun to watch. As is the death-by-acupuncture scene.     Also, the film should be noted, because it was filmed in 3D. It shows. As you might already have noticed, I don't particularly like 3D films. I'd forever opt to see the 2D version of a film, if it was offered in addition to the 3D, this is because most films are shot in 2D, and converted to 3D at the last minute. This was CLEARLY filmed in 3D, and it makes damn good use of it. Stuff pops out at you, almost constantly, throughout the film, and it looks, and feels kind of awesome.     This is probably not the last film in the series, as it will more than likely be a box-office success. I feel like this is a good time for them to end the series. They made two good ones, had a couple lousy ones, and if they end the series now, they will have bowed out on a relatively good note. But this is not a \\"Saw\\" movie, I will welcome whatever they bring out next.    Grade: B
B000NU2CY4|5.0|The Blue-ray is exactly what I was hoping for.  I have always wanted to purchase the movie in this format, but prices were a bit steep at the local electronics store, like BEST  BUY.  I found this blue-ray at a reasonable price and ordering was also another pleasing experience.      Thanks.    Jerry

B0058OUJA4|2.0|Only loads splash screen.  Screen goes blank for 3 minutes,  says it cant connect to amazon app store then crashes.
B000000W5L|5.0|It always cracks me up when people say this is the best or that is the best and they are telling everyone as if it is the Gospel Truth.  No one can say which Stones albumn is the Best or which Stones song is the Best.  You can only say which one you like the Best or you think is the Best.  And guess what some of the Stones songs are so great you can even change your mind from time to time.  So many great songs what an awesome band.  I always loved the Stones from the first time that I heard them.  It was 1965 and all I seemed to hear was Satisfaction blasting from cars of teenagers riding around in convertibles on the streets of chicago, it really impresssed me as I was on the verge of my teen years being 12 years old.  I just remember it being a wonderful summmer playing and loving the song more every time I heard it.   Anyway of the golden 4 with Jimmy Miller producing, there was Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street.   Which one was Best?  All I can say is you must have all of them !!!!  Anyway if there was some sort of disaster that would wipe out all but one of these and I was given the power for only one master to survive and the others be wiped out, I would have to pick Exile on Main Street.  I just find myself listening to it all the time.  I even had to buy another CD of it so that I can have it in my other truck at all times.  I just never tire of my favorite songs on it.   Rip this Joint is tremendous.  Rocks off is real good.  Shake your Hips is in a class by itself.  Casino Boogie is a song that they will never do Live, this is a challange Mick do it LIVE !!!  What a feel and what a line \\"Judge and Jury walk out hand in hand \\"  Tumbling Dice quite possibly the greatest Stones Song Ever, but again a matter of taste. Sweet Virginia possibly the most underrated Stones Song ever, what a terrific song and so great to sing to, Drop your reds, drop your greens and blues !!! Torn and Frayed and Black Angel are both good but I dotend to skip these more often than not as I am driving.  I usuallly drive fast.  Loving Cup  Oh YEAH !!!  Great song and great to sing along. \\"One more drink and I'm fall down drunk\\"  Happy, I have to admit it is a filler for concerts for Mick to rest his voice.  Keith is a great guitarist but he cannot sing, but he knows it too, at least he is very comical when he talks during live shows and quite animated when addressing the audience.  The song itself is OK, but to me a true Stones song has Mick singing.  Sorry Keith ~!  Have to admit Turd on the run is filler, but its still not bad.  Ventilator Blues the only credit that Mick Taylor ever officially got for the songwriting credits.  Excellent song in the vain of Howlin Wolf and Chicago Blues.!!.  I just want to see his face, ok probably more filler and the same can be said for Let it Loose.  All down the Line.  Classic, great Stones song and great live, Love the line  Won't you be my little baby for awhile !?!  Stop Breakin Down never gets enough credit.  No matter what anyone says the blues are the stones roots and Robert Johnson is the root of the blues, who else could to Stop Breakin down other than Robert or the Stones,  ok probably eric clapton !?!!  Shine a Light. What a great song there are not enough adjectives to describe this song.  I always liked Billy Preston and the vibe that he and Mick get on this song is sheer musical genious and the feeling , well I just cant find another song that has so much feeling as this one.  I was suprised that Mick got the thought for this song about Brian Jones and yet it took a couple of years to write and get it perfect, yea the song is perfect.  With Soul Survivor, I usually skip it to get to Rocks off, but will admit Soul Survivor is a good song.  Anyway I'm sorry I had to destroy Beggars Banquet forever.  What can you say Jumpin Jack Flash is really part of it, but they did not put it on Beggars Banquet, that tells you how strong it is.  Let it Bleed. WOW, I use tolisten to this over and over again when I was 15, and again Honky Tonk Women should be on it with the greates Cowbell ever used in the History of Rock !!!!  Thank you Jimmy Miller, just found out recently he was the one on the record and there is no cowbell Live when the Stones do \\"Honky Tonk Women\\"  which I would only play about 50 times straight, picking the needle up and putting it back down on the 45, spinnin around. Someone please tell, Mick on this next to last tour to have a great percussionist play the cowbell live for the next tour for HTW !!!   Anyway YCAGWYW is the class of Let it Bleed.  The most eerie song is Sister Morphine, which was from the Let it Bleed sessions but put on Sticky Fingers, a super, super album which I played over and over again as a freshman in college with my favorite being Moonlight Mile.  Moonlight Mile has such a feel and it is so interesting to me that Keith did not play on it, though he and Mick laid the track for it.  I feel that this song is the reason why Mick Taylor ended up quiting the Stones as he felt he deserved credit for some of it but got none of it.  What a Stonemark in the history of the Stones. The last albumn of the track which eventually leads to Mick Taylor's departure.   Moonlight Mile has such feeling, no other Stones song is quite like it.  Anyway one day a young lady had a Rolling Stones shirt on and I asked her what her favorite song was and she paused and said Satisfaction, which at one time was my all time favorite Stones song and then she asked me what was my Favorite Stones Song, and I just said \\"Tumblin Dice\\" which kind of suprised me that I said that one, which leads me back to Exile on Main Street.  I think one of the reasons I Love it so much is that Mick Taylor plays so much on it and I never realized what a GREAT Guitar player he was.  Not in a Jimi Hendrix kind of way or a David Gilmour way, but in his own way with so much feeling.  No other albumn has so much of Mick Taylor's guitar playing asExile on Main Street and he is at his peak with the Stones on this albumn.  Also This is Jimmy Miller's fourth production with the Stones and He hits a Grandslam !!!, he even plays drums on three or four tracks, one of them being Tumblin DIce !   The album just has such a feel to it, carefree, raunchy, enlighting, gritty, and don't forget to boogie.  I cant think of any other albumn that can mix rock with blues with country, with boogie with R and B, and a mixture of all of the above on some tracks and pull it off and make it sound so good and feel so great.  Even with the filler you still have 11 great tracks, some greater than others !!!   When it first came out it had alot of criticism from my frieds but I still Loved it and when I saw them on the 72 tour, the Stones only did tracks from these four albumns, and the songs that always stood out to me were Tumblin Dice, Sweet Virginia, Lovin Cup and All Down the Line and Mick Taylor was really the one who carried this songs and of course Mick's Vocals are so good on all of these.  I guess this is why Exile on Main Street is my Favorite Stones albumn and I HIGHLY reccomend you get this ASAP, and if you already have one copy get another one, because if you have two cars or trucks you need a copy in one at all times like me. Oh one other Stones note,  why do most of think that Mr. Jimi in YCAGWUW is Jimi Hendrix when it is claimed that Mr. Jimmy is Jimmy Miller. the producer of the 4 greatest stones albumns  with Exile on Main Street being the last of the Golden Four.
B00466HN72|3.0|\\"Hop\\" (2011) is a family picture strongly reminiscent of a 2007 film \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" - a comedy seamlessly merging live-action actors and animation characters. Both pictures are harmless and mindless fun (helmed by the same director Tim Hill, incidentally), kind of movie that would achieve 100 million dollars mark in ticket sales while ridiculed by critics. Actually, \\"Hop\\" is not that bad, thanks to the state-of-the-art special effects, though you really have to ignore the incredible storyline.    A young rabbit E.B. wants to be a drummer, but his daddy Mr. Bunny - who happens to be the Easter Bunny - would not listen. So, to make his dream come true, E.B. runs away from his home on Easter Island, and travels to Hollywood, where he encounters Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), a slacker who discovers his true calling when he discovers the identity of the speaking rabbit. Well, I think you know what it is.    Obviously there are so many wrong things about the film. The story is far from coherent. James Marsden (born in 1973) is too old for the role. The film also feels like déjà vu at times. Mr. Bunny's factory, though beautifully designed, reminds us of a recent Tim Burton film, or the idea of hundreds of working chickens seems to have come from \\"Despicable Me\\" and its yellow-colored minions. Cameos of Blind Boys of Alabama, David Hasselhoff and Hugh Hefner (voice only) are amusing, but may look pointless considering the film' main target audience.    For all these, however, I enjoyed watching the film with its great effects, colorful designs and some funny jokes. Maybe this is not an instant classic, but is still an entertaining family picture.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|SPOILER ALERT    \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is one of the most affecting, beautiful movies I've ever seen. It's beyond Western, it's beyond romance, it's beyond gay cinema, although it has elements of all of these things. It's simply great cinema. Every aesthetic and technical detail is superb, making the elegiac pace not just bearable but enjoyable. Jake Gyllenhaal excels as Jack Twist; his performance only suffers by comparison to Heath Ledger's anguished genius as Ennis Del Mar (which means, fittingly, \\"island in the sea\\"). Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway do fine work as Ennis and Jack's wives respectively.    \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"'s tragedy is specific to its time, place and characters. It is about the oppression and marginalization of gay men in small-town America in the early 1960s. In that time and place, no gay person would ever dare to \\"come out.\\" Jack at least understands who he is. The viewer never doubts that Jack is a closeted gay man. Although he marries and has a child (as did many gay men in that era, including members of my family), during his and Ennis's many lengthy separations, Jack picks up gay prostitutes in Mexico and reaches out to another man to determine if he too might be gay. It's strongly hinted that Jack is killed because he dares to follow his true nature. Jack's tragedy is that he is a gay man in the wrong place and time.     Ennis is the character who is \\"locked down\\" in a more universal way and therefore brings the film to its more universal tragedy. Ennis liked school but was unable to graduate due to dire family circumstances. He has an indelible childhood memory of seeing a rancher suspected of homosexuality tortured and killed and the fear never leaves him. Although Jack suggests that he and Ennis leave and go to a big city or start a ranch together somewhere, Ennis is trapped by his limitations, his fears,  other people's expectations, and his own expectations. He stays in his bleak home town, marries his high school girlfriend, and has two daughters, stuck forever in material and emotional poverty. Unlike Jack, there is no suggestion that Ennis is attracted to any man other than Jack. In fact, after his divorce, Ennis dates another woman, but things don't work because he's so shut down emotionally. Whatever Ennis's clinical sexual orientation may be, Jack is the love of Ennis's life, as we see from the exquisite scene at the end of the movie where Ennis, in his lonely trailer, cries over his and the now-dead Jacks' shirts, together on the same hanger, and Willie Nelson's \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" plays over the closing credits. Ennis's is the tragedy of the person or any race or sexual orientation at any time in history whose combination of life circumstances and personality prevent him or her from living an authentic and rewarding life.      \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is that rare treasure of a movie that engages you emotionally, makes you think, and is at the artistic pinnacle of the filmmakers' art and craft. Of course it did not win the Best Picture Academy Award. That distinction went to the superficial \\"Crash.\\" No matter. People will be watching and weeping over \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" in future decades, long past the time when love is no longer divided into gay and straight but is simply love, while \\"Crash\\" becomes an obscure curiosity.
0470638842|5.0|\\"Socialnomics: How Social Media Transforms the Way We Live and Do Business\\" by Erik Qualman is probably one of the most popular books out on Social Media right now.  Ever since seeing Qualman's video by the same name, Socialnomics, I've wanted to read his book.  Like the video, this book is packed full of staggering statistics on social media as well as a plethora of anecdotes and examples.<br /><br />As an avid reader of social media and business books I generally have a few issues with them.  First, especially with books on social media, by the time the book is printed and I get around to reading it, the information inside is outdated.  This is common with social media since the industry is constantly changing at such a rapid pace that it is hard for print resources to keep up.  The first thing I noticed about Socialnomics was the \\"about this book\\" page in the very front.  In this section Qualman states that the book doesn't have to be read from front to back and that he encourages the reader to work through it at his leisure.  He describes it as \\"...written in sporadically digestible sound bites.\\"  So true.  Additionally, he notes that updates and added material can be found on his website and encourages readers to contact him directly via twitter and email.  He even promises to respond personally.  I haven't tested him on this one, so we'll just take his word. :)<br /><br />Rather than boring you with another review of one of the most reviewed social media books, I'll give you a sporadically digestible list of what I consider to be the book's pros, cons and my favorite passages/quotes.  Enjoy!<br /><br />The Pros<br /><br />Qualman very strategically chose relevant content to cover.  All the topics he discusses are important, with very little \\"fluff.\\"<br /><br />Love love love that the book contains key points at the end of each chapter.  The chapters are pretty lengthy so having a list of key points at the end of the chapter helps to recall key points.<br /><br />Tone of the book is good for both social media pros as well as beginners.<br /><br />Socialnomics contains countless stunning statistics and factoids. Qualman also sites multiple detailed examples to back the data up.  It's pretty hard to argue with statistics and specific examples.<br /><br />I like the idea of having a \\"who's who\\" list of social media authorities at the end of the book.<br /><br />The Cons<br /><br />Some of the chapters get a bit off target.  Not that the information discussed is not interesting, it just kind of goes off on random tangents.  I think that a lot of the subjects could be more concise with less rambling.<br /><br />The book is kind of text book-y.  While this book is supposed to be informational, the overall feel of the book is somewhat academic.  To that point, it would be a great supplement textbook for any college media or marketing class.<br /><br />I'm a visual person, so I love when books include graphs, charts, diagrams and such.  I think that there are only 2 diagrams in total... and they are really not an integral part of the content at all.<br /><br />I was excited to see chapter nine, Social Media Rolodex and Resources, in the book.  I thought it was a great idea to list some popular \\"digital thought leaders\\" as he calls them.

B000002W9Q|4.0|The tracks \\"Be My Baby,\\" \\"Do You Love Me?,\\" \\"Hungry Eyes,\\" \\"The Time Of My Life\\" and the heart-wrenching ballad<br />\\"She's Like The Wind\\" (co-written and performed by Patrick Swayze) are reason enough to purchase this soundtrack. The remaining tracks aren't very good. \\"She's Like The Wind\\" is romantic and moving. Guys will be singing this to their wives for a long time. Makes for a great song at a wedding or a romantic dinner together followed by passionate and sincere lovemaking.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This is great for family movie night!  It is a feel good movie with a happy ending.  Emma Thompson is a wonderful Nanny McPhee.  She is every parents dream.

B0000025D0|5.0|The best review of this record was written by Bill Kauffman, that great sketch artist of small-town and place-centered America. See The American Conservative magazine issue of July 2011 for that review.   I'll add a few words in the margin of Kauffman. Springsteen called \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" an \\"honest record.\\" It's certainly that. It and \\"Nebraska\\" are his two best. Bruce looks bleakness in the face, wipes his hands amply with grit, and hits a walk-off homer. As Kauffman notes, Springsteen manages to bridge the vast and particular with a single poetic voice.   The title track and \\"Badlands\\" have gotten the most radio play but \\"Something in the Night\\" is the CD's best song (arguably), a classic really. Also, hearing the Big Man (the late Clarence Clemons, died 2011) on saxophone will bring a lump to the throat. The Biblically attuned should study \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" and \\"The Promised Land.\\" An evening well spent would be sitting with the recording and liner notes and meditating. As Bruce rounds third and jogs to home with you on his back, you can probably say \\"Hey, these songs are about me.\\"
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why? Why aren't the original theatrical versions included? Why can't we enjoy films on Blu-ray the way they were? This set is a 'no buy' solely because the originals are not included.
B0058A119G|3.0|The voice has definitely matured.  Not negative, just different now.  Mellow, calm.  I liked her singing a cappella in \\"Windmills of Your Mind.\\"  There were a few times in other songs when the instrumentals overpowered Barbra's voice.  I want to hear HER.  I would have been happy if she sang everything a cappella or with a few chords every now-and-then.  On a number of the songs, Barbra appears to have chosen them only for the lyrics. Yes, I know it is a tribute to the Bergman's, but many of the melodies are forgettable...can't find myself humming them throughout the day.  I prefer songs where I CAN'T get the melodies out of my head.  She is still the greatest singer.  I read a few comments about her \\"husky\\" voice.  It's there a few times -again- not a minus, just different for her.  Listen to \\"Nice & Easy Does It.\\"  Her crystal clarity remains intact.  I can't stop listening to the CD, it is really growing on me...in a good way.
0446567337|5.0|let me 1st say that is an amazing book. i read it from cover to cover within 5 days! i couldn't put it down. I'm a huge bookworm so when i shop for my books i want the lowest price. I'm not doing to pay over $12 or $17 on a book (depending on how big the book is) when i saw this price i just had to get it. all in all i don't regret it.
B004T0XYKK|5.0|I've always loved this movie and now I have it in blu-ray. Awesome. Great seller too, it arrived in the exact condition stated and quickly too.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|The book was great, and the movie was good fun too, being a bit more plot-driven but with strong deviations from our visual/mental image of the characters. The interesting thing about the movie is that the people who play the characters are all the ages that they're supposed to be: the kid who plays Greg is 13, the kid who plays Roderick is 19, the woman who plays their mom is 43, and the guy who plays their dad is also 43.  Good casting, in other words.<br /><br />Lots of funny moments, and Greg and Rowley's magic show is pretty classic: Rowley wants to make it serious, but of course with class clown Greg as his assistant it will never be that way. I like also the Loded Daiper song. But what I don't get is the fear that the kids show for their parents - these people are not scary parents!
B001PPGAJY|5.0|I have loved the X-Man comics for years and now I'm collecting the movies. This was a great buy and arrived quickly and in great condition. The seller was awesome.
B004X8W42M|5.0|The perfect rock autobiography. Val, my wonderful band's wonderful drummer, lent me this book soon after he joined the band, and I was so happy to get it from him. I'd forgotten Ozzy had an autobiography - I hadn't even bought it when I saw it on the shelves a few years ago. What was I thinking? What kind of a fanboy am I anyway? But, opportunity arises (or maybe it's my DES-TI-NY), and the book came my way anyway. I quickly found time to read the book, and as soon as I got to the last page I went back and read it from page one again. This is probably the only time I've done such a thing!<br /><br />The book doesn't seem to hold anything back (sex, drugs, rock `n' roll, violence, murder, rock `n' roll) and is alternately hilarious and immensely sad. He's been through it all - near-death experiences, being fired from his band, marriage, kids, divorce, murder, mayhem, jail, ill health, addictions - but he's also had the time of his life. He's met people, good and bad, and with his family is still a staggering musical force with his own, very special legacy. It probably only matches Keith Richards' autobiography in ribald hedonism and insanity.<br /><br />The whole book is great, and it's told constantly in that unique Ozzy voice with plenty of Birmingham slang and cussing, but all of it is heartful. He starts it off thanking his fans, then Randy Rhoads. After the table of contents, there's a series of pages with one line written on each of them, setting up the Ozzy effect, nice touch.<br /><br />Part one is called \\"In the Beginning...\\" (sounds pretty biblical, doesn't it?), chronicling his youth and his Black Sabbath Years, while part two, \\"Starting Over\\", is about the solo band/married to Sharon years. The first story in part one is \\"John the Burglar\\", about his early life. It covers his childhood and teens and brief career in crime, and ends in 1966 when he gets out of jail, where he served a three month sentence for breaking and entering. The chapter, like the whole book, is told with a mix of humor and sadness, of hardship and leisure, and you often want to laugh with Ozzy, you often want to cry. Ozzy grew up in an ugly, bombed-out town where he found himself with two options in life: \\"manual labour or manual labour\\"; or, a third option he hadn't considered in his early years called \\"rock `n' roll\\", as it turned out.<br /><br />The opening page is hilarous, and he gets right into the bit about jail, before going back a few years to his childhood, his horrible school life, and then on page 16 he mentions first seeing Tony Iommi (a real lady's man in those days, it seems, and a budding young musician). Pretty soon he's singing together with family (first song: Cliff Richard's \\"Living Doll\\"). Funny, there's not much about his three older sisters and two younger brothers. He briefly mentions his tattooed grandmother, his first experiences with rock `n' roll, his first drink, and the trouble he got into as a young gangster who couldn't take school because he was dyslexic and couldn't process the written word. Warming big strong guys up to him with his clown routine so that he'd have a fighter as an ally when the bullies set their sights on him (worked in school, worked in jail, worked in the band too). Tormenting teachers and being tormented by them. There is one great story about how they found an old neighbour of theirs who had fallen outside and couldn't get up, and they saved her from a slow death by hypothermia; this made Ozzy late for school, so when he rolled in the teacher gave him a horrible whipping. The story about the old lady is haunting: she had lost her husband in the war and all of her sons in a bomb shelter that took a direct hit, but years after the war she still kept her memories of them fresh in the home, going about life as if they had never died. Then there's the time mum boiled a brillo pad together with the cabbage soup - yuck! He took early jobs where he'd be exposed to toxic, poisonous chemicals... thathe'd inhale and get high off. Then there was the job as the car horn tuner, and all of the insanity (and inhumanity) that went on at the job at the slaughterhouse, not to mention the sickening gutters of blood and offal. Some creepy stories there, people can be so cruel, including Ozzy Osbourne it seems (the pigeon and bat stories come later in the book, of course, but their seeds are sewn here). Introduction to music comes with the Beatles, a young Ozzy used his paychecks to buy their music, starting with \\"With The Beatles\\"!<br /><br />Got his first tattoos in prison, of course, and there are plenty of stories, like how they used to mistreat each other, most especially the torment of Bradley the pedophile, and then there are all of the other sad tales of prison.<br /><br />Chapter 2, \\"Ozzy Zig Needs Gig\\" starts off with Ozzy meeting Geezer Butler one day when he responded to this ad, inviting him and his PA to join Rare Breed. \\"Don't ask me where the `Zig' in `Ozzy Zig' came from. It just popped into my head one day,\\" he sez. Ozzy's dad has taken out a loan to raise the £250 to buy an amp and two speakers, and they helped Ozzy get a place in two bands, Music Machine and The Approach, before Geezer came along with the opportunity for Rare Breed. Ozzy walked around with no shoes in those days, even in the winter, and had a bathroom tap hanging around his neck on a chain. I guess he's never been afraid to do whatever he wanted, even if people looked at him as a clown and laughed at him. Geezer and Ozzy met their old friend Robert Plant that summer, when he was thinking of giving up Jimmy Page's offer to be in the New Yardbirds so that he could be in his own band, Hobbstweedle (?!?!). Rare Breed broke up when Geezer got a promotion at work and devoted himself to that (for a while).<br /><br />Then one day Bill and Tony (who had been in Mythology before it broke up after a serious drug bust) came around in response to the Ozzy Zig ad that was still up months later. Tony recognised Ozzy as the clown from school and wanted to walk away, but Bill convinced him to give Ozzy a chance (he had his own PA, after all, and beggars can't be choosers), and when Ozzy brought Geezer in the lineup solidified. Next, the band had to pick a name: based on Ozzy's inspiration sitting on the crapper they came up with Polka Tulk. What?!? The band had a saxophonist and a bottleneck guitar player for a better blues sound, but they got rid of them and renamed the band Earth. The band worked hard, never turned down gigs, and sometimes went to venues to see if there was an opening from a band that hadn't turned up. Once it worked, and the band that didn't show up for the gig was... Jethro Tull. They got the gig, but in the end Jethro Tull tried to steal Tony Iommi to play in their band. He appeared in \\"The Rolling Stones Rock `n' Roll Circus\\" playing his Fender Stratocaster with Jethro Tull alongside the Stones and Eric Clapton and John Lennon. But he quit after a week and came back to Ashton because he wanted his own band (wise choice, Tony).<br /><br />Chapter 3, \\"The Witch and the Nazi\\", is about the band's first shows, a mini-tour up to Copenhagen, after which they discovered the horror movie motif and the old Boris Karloff film \\"Black Sabbath\\" and decided to name the band after it (there was also a hippy band called Earth floating around at the time and club managers were mixing them up). Eventually there was a stint in Hamburg playing at the Star Club that the Beatles had performed as the house band (but seven years earlier), where they shacked up with groupies so that they didn't have to share a room/bed with each other, and Ozzy ended up with an ugly woman who treasured her father's Nazi regalia (yuck). Back in the UK, they then cut a single with Gus Dudgeon, \\"Evil Woman\\", and Ozzy got to hear himself on radio... at 6:00 AM. On the way to do a residency in Zurich they stopped in a studio to cut their first album, and off they went. When they were back from Switzerland they saw the album for the first time, with its cover, and it sounded great. Then it got released on Friday, February 13th, 1970. That's when they started getting their first bad reviews, ha ha. Tony punched out some guy who wrote a bad review. Ozzy played it for his dad, who didn't like it. But that's also when they started getting bugged by the occultists.<br /><br />When the band figured out that their little league manager was being overwhelmed by their success, they looked into alternatives, and talked to the gangster-ish Don Arden and his daughter Sharon. Ozzy liked her a lot, but didn't fall for her - yet. The band would eventually sign with Patrick Meehan, who gave them money in an opaque fashion (whatever they wanted, just pick up the phone, no receipts), but in sum still probably a lot less than they were owed.<br /><br />Chapter 4, \\"You Guys Ain't Black\\" is about their first tour in the US, and the months leading up to it. Ozzy complains that with the first album they were a \\"bloke's band\\" and barely got any groupies, except the two-baggers (needed two bags over their heads in order to properly shag them - very un-PC to say such a thing, of course, but that's Ozzy). There were also three-, four- and five-baggers. Eventually, they recorded and released a second album five months after the first one that they were going to call \\"Warpiggers\\" after Walpurgis Night, the witches' sabbath. So they made an album cover that looked like war pigs dancing around (the sword for war, the pink colouring for pig).<br /><br />Then they found that album was too short, and they had some studio time left, so they wrote a new song in 20 minutes, Paranoid. When the studio execs heard the song, they knew that it had to be the lead single, so the whole album was renamed Paranoid. Sure enough, they were right and the single hit the top ten in the US and the UK, but the album cover no longer matched. Ozzy complained that the guys on the cover look like gay fencers. \\"`They're not gay fencers, Ozzy.' Bill told me. `They're paranoid gay fencers.'\\" Classic. Next to them on the charts was Cliff RIchard's \\"I Ain't Got Time Any More\\", and they played Top Of The Pops with Paranoid while old Cliff played that song with a full orchestra. Hilarious. It was a highlight of Ozzy's to be on Top of the Pops, which he had watched growing up, and which everybody in his family would be tuning in to. Of course, after this they didn't have to shag five baggers any more, or even two baggers, but had groupies knocking on the door any time of the day or night wherever they were.<br /><br />On tour in America, Ozzy also discovered real food - pizza - and saw the ocean for the first time in Florida. Since Bill hated flying, Bill and Ozzy got driven around the US by Bill's brother-in-law, while they indulged in drug and alcohol misadventures. There was also a weird concert in Philadelphia where all the audience that came out were black. It was a sullen, hostile crowd. \\"After we finished War Pigs, you could hear a pin drop. One guy called out to us `Hey, Black Sabbath, you guys ain't black!'\\" The rest of the tour went better, but they did get accosted by Satanists, one of whom tried to stab Tony onstage. Met members of the Manson family in LA (scary), but also saw Elvis play (he came out for only 20 minutes, there was tons of warmup) and admired his merchandising savvy.<br /><br />In chapter 5, \\"Killing the Vicar (in Atrocity Cottage)\\" Ozzy chronicled his domestic life and his first marriage with Thelma Riley, who had a son Elliot from a previous marriage, and their two children. Ozzy only mentions Elliot to say that he regretted treating him badly, but no more. I wonder what became of Elliot. Thelma never called him Ozzy, only John. With his manager's money he bought a cottage in the country, and a big chunk of the book is spent recounting plenty of goofy, rural misadventures - riding a horse down to the pub, holding hash parties in the kitchen, rampant gunfire, killing cats, accidentally feeding the vicar a powerful hash brownie and worrying that it was too much for him, waking up in the same bed as the houseguests, and all sorts of nutty stuff.<br /><br />There are lots of descriptions of the playful torture the band inflicted on drummer Bill Ward. He nearly died of hepatitis around that time, and then later on when they were preparing for a reunion tour in the '90s he had a heart attack (hands went numb, etc) that they initially mis-diagnosed this as \\"Ah, he'll be all right.\\" Sheesh. But it wasn't only Bill, Tony also collapsed from exhaustion after a gig because the guys were just doing too much coke and other drugs and not sleeping, and Ozzy's epiglottis swelled up to the size of a golf ball.<br /><br />There's a great anecdote about Frank Zappa calling Supernaut his favorite rock `n' roll song, because it's the sound of pure adrenaline. Later there's another one about the guys in Frank's band asking for coke, because Frank hates drugs, and then later on Frank also asking Ozzy if he has some, saying it's for someone else (and maybe it was).<br /><br />Chapter 6 is called \\"The End is Nigh\\", and it's about the downhill path that Black Sabbath took after Sabbath Bloody Sabbath when they were too coked up, too full of themselves, while also running out of ideas. Ozzy quit the band, Black Sabbath tried to keep it going with a new lead singer (an old habit of Tony, Geezer and Bill's), but it didn't work out well, and then Ozzy came back and he sang on the last album, \\"Never Say Die.\\" But then it got too intense again, and there was the case of Ozzy missing a gig because he fell asleep in someone else's hotel room and couldn't be found at gig time (because he was exhausted from touring he slept over 12 hours straight, as anyone who's exhausted would do) and Ozzy got fired. Don Arden came back into Ozzy's life at this time, and so did Sharon, and they got his solo career started. Of course, the professional relationship didn't stay just professional for long, and they were screwing like bunnies between arguments about musical direction.<br /><br />But of course, that's all part of part two: Starting Over, and the first chapter, \\"Des Moines\\", is about the early years when they weren't sure that Ozzy could make it on his own. Of course, now, he's probably sold more records than Black Sabbath ever did (some estimates say he's sold 100 million units, while Black Sabbath has sold 50 million), but in the early days there was no guarantee of that. He put together a band, auditioning Randy Rhoads and hiring just him based solely on his brilliant warmups. They booked tours in small venues, rather than opening for someone else, and eventually it took off. Ozzy has a lot of memories from the early days.<br /><br />Ozzy describes Lemmy on tour, carrying around with him a suitcase full of books, which was all he had in the world except for the clothes on his back. Then Lemmy was with Ozzy at father-in-law Don Arden's house reading in the library, Arden asked Ozzy who the caveman in the library was, Ozzy said something like \\"oh, that's Lemmy, he's harmless.\\" Seems hard to picture Lemmy enjoying himself quietly in someone's library, but I can believe it if I suspend my rock `n' roll disbelief.<br /><br />Ozzy had a lot of torment, and one of the things that got him the most was the breakup with his wife when he realised that he was in love with Sharon. He moved out of the house, and eventually there was a restraining order against him. He writes about the torment of losing his kids, but then again, he was too wasted most of the time to appreciate them (and he'd soon enough have a new family to neglect with his drinking and drugging).<br /><br />There are some grimly funny stories told about this time in his life. One of the things that Ozzy salvaged after the break-up was a stuffed bear that he'd gotten his manager to buy, but he's shot the stuffed bear's head off in a drunken mania (appalling, yes). Salvaging it meant taking a cab from his ex-wife's cottage back to London (couldn't have been cheap), which he did, but the bear got stolen in the process. I don't know what's more surreal - the thought of Ozzy loving a stuffed bear with its head blown off, or the thought that someone in Wimbledon Common has Ozzy's bear as a souvenir.<br /><br />Ozzy started a new life with Sharon, and eventually asked her to marry her... about 20 times. He'd ask her, then get cold feet, then he'd ask her, then they'd have a fight. But they finally did, and true to form he got blasted at the reception and passed out in the hallway.<br /><br />And the family madness continued. You saw it in the first decade of the new millenium on The Osbournes, but it was no different in the '80s.<br /><br />There are other crazy stories in this chapter. Like the pigeon-biting incident when record company executives in LA were giving him a hard time. Someone had dreamed up a stunt where Ozzy would make a point by releasing two pigeons, but instead he only released one of them... and bit the other's head off. It got them in trouble with the record company, but it got them great publicity; same with the \\"pissing on the Alamo\\" incident. Also, there's the bat incident in Des Moines, which is the title of the chapter. Ozzy writes that during that tour the band had a crazy routine of throwing raw meat and pigs blood out into the audience, and hanging their alcoholic midget every night, and there was all sorts of craziness, and people were throwing things onstage. Then there was... the bat... which he figured was a toy... but it wasn't. Chomp... oops... rabies shots.<br /><br />Things take a turn for the worse in chapter 8 \\"While I was Sleeping\\", which recounts the airplane accident that killed his awesome guitarist Randy Rhoads, makeup person Rachel Youngblood, and the coked-out tourbus driver who had piloted a small private plane. It all happened when Ozzy and Sharon were sleeping in the tourbus - the plane went out of control and hit the bus and crashed and burned. A horrible event that shouldn't have happened, and Ozzy still can't figure it out - Randy and Rachel both hated flying, why would they have gotten in the plane? One spooky part of it was that Ozzy found the imprint from the front of the Gibson t-shirt that Randy had been wearing that day lying in the field next to the wreckage. Terrible. But the band had to continue, and then Randy went through a few guitarists before settling on Jake E Lee, who he doesn't write about at all (he also doesn't mention Zakk Wylde much either, and I don't think that Robert Trujillo or Mike Bordin are really mentioned either).<br /><br />Chapter 9, \\"Betty, Where's the Bar?\\", is largely about Osbourne's struggles with addiction, chapter 10, \\"Blackout\\", is also about his struggles with addiction, as is chapter 11, \\"Dead Again\\". Seems like Osbourne hit rock bottom in Prague when, after a period of sobriety, he and Zakk went on the beer (\\"It was soooo good\\"), and Ozzy said to Zakk that the one rock star thing that he'd never done, but he still wanted to do, was to throw a TV out of the window. He did it, but was so disgusted with himself, that he just didn't want to do drugs and drink any more. Something shifted in his addict's brain, if you can believe the telling, but it's good for him if it's so (and for his family as well, of course). It's even gotten to the point that he scorns British pub culture, pointing out the irony of how UK people would unwind after attending the funeral of a friend who has drunk himself to death by going down to the pub.<br /><br />Other tales that he tells are about the accident with the quad bike which nearly cost him his life, and then there's all the madness around The Osbournes TV show. After four seasons of insanity, the series ended, to Ozzy's relief. He would have never done the series, he said, if he's have known what the lack of privacy meant (eldest child Jessie was smart,she didn't want to be in the show at all). Also, there was the surge in celebrity that made life difficult, and there were problems around what it did to Jack and Kelly. But during the time, Ozzy and Kelly finally got a number one song with \\"Changes\\", nearly becoming the Christmas Number One of that year (beat out by Gary Jules' \\"Mad World\\"). Ozzy was disappointed that none of the other guys in the band called to congratulate him.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the The Osbournes years and the celebrity, however, was Ozzy's brushes with other celebrities. Of course, there's the infamous visit to George Bush's White House that is recounted so well in the first episode of the second season of The Osbournes, but there's also meetings with people he loves and respects like Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, Elton John and Elizabeth Taylor (yes, it's a surprising list - is Ozzy much more conservative than we'd all like to imagine?).<br /><br />There were two Black Sabbath reunions, Live Aid in but Ozzy doesn't write much about them. There are a lot of people and events that Ozzy doesn't write much about, and you get the sense that there's a lot of reliance on anecdotes, while there's also a general skirting around certain issues, but in a crazy 40-year career in show business there's going to a lot that isn't mentioned. But he does recount the case of his attempt to strangle Sharon one night when he was out of his mind on booze and drugs, as well as the case of him being mis-diagnosed with AIDS after shagging a grubby groupie (last time he ever cheated on Sharon, according to him, the AIDS scare thing taught him a lesson... I guess). As far as anecdotes go, there's one really disgusting one about the time they were viewing a house that Roger Whittaker was trying to sell.<br /><br />He writes a bit about his parents, and the times when each died, as well as the death of Don Arden, and each story is sad. There's also a lot of animosity with Don Arden, and even with Ozzy's mum, who seemed too focussed on money for Ozzy's taste. A bit odd to fault someone who had a hard life growing up poor being very focussed on the fuel that lubricates the wheels. I guess he's the kind of guy who has been successful for so long that he takes money for granted, although he does give several perspectives on it throughout the book of having to buy his way out of some of the disfavourable deals that he signed onto as a young artist that he needed to get out of if he ever wanted his independence.<br /><br />Ozzy has lots of crazy, funny stories, but also lots of sadness in his madness. There's the cruelty to animals, there's getting away from their first manager Jim Simpson in an underhanded way, there's mistreating his first and second wife, and there's the years spent in a drug and alcoholic haze and neglecting his family, not to mention incidents like the birthday party where he made a fool of himself, scared the kids, beat up the clown, and alienated the kids' parents.<br /><br />The book has four batches of photos. The first one shows the family, Black Sabbath and the early days, and pictures of his first solo band with Randy Rhoads. There's childhood pics of Ozzy, a picture of Ozzy with his mum and dad as a young rock star, a cool picture of Ozzy and an early band playing naked (and Ozzy seems to be playing bass!!!), pics from \\"Atrocity Cottage\\" with Ozzy's first family (no pictures of his first wife, though). Only four pictures of Ozzy together with Tony, Geezer and Bill, there should be more... Then there's a sad (and sadly ironic) picture of Randy Rhoads and Rachel Youngblood together, standing next to the same tourbus that their plane later crashed into, killing them both. A second set of pictures shows Ozzy and Sharon, many of them with him wearing the fake werewolf teeth of the \\"Bark at the Moon\\" days. Then there's a weird pic of a new wave Ozzy with short hair wearing some sort of a horrid suit, and another picture of Ozzy with short hair from the time he shaved his head to get out of doing a gig (didn't work, it only made him look like Bruce Dickinson when he cut his hair short). This section has a cool picture of Ozzy sitting on the crapper that shows the smiley-face tattoos he has on his knees, and there is a mug shots from Memphis where he got busted for public urination. The third set shows pics from the Black Sabbath reunion, both from Live Aid and from the Reunion tour, and and there are pics of his new family. Ozzy starts wearing those cool round shades around this time, and there are shots from The Osbournes TV show. Awww, there's also a nice pic of Ozzy mooning the audience - that's how we'll remember him. Last set of pics shows Ozzy with celebrities - Elton John (\\"the most generous man I've ever met), Paul McCartney (\\"My rock 'n' roll hero\\"), Liz Taylor (\\"My father once told me she was the most beautiful woman in the world\\") and the Queen (\\"She didn't have to bring me flowers.\\") There's also a great pic of Ozzy and Marilyn Manson kneeling on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Marilyn slightly behind Ozzy (\\"Not sure I want to know what Marilyn's thinking about.\\"). Lots of great pics of Ozzy with his family (wife, kids, sisters), him riding a dirt bike, siting on the quad bike that nearly killed him, with a lookalike, and finally... Black Sabbath being inducted into the rock 'n' roll hall of fame..    But of course, that's all part of part two: Starting Over, and the first chapter, \\"Des Moines\\", is about the early years when they weren't sure that Ozzy could make it on his own. Of course, now, he's probably sold more records than Black Sabbath ever did (some estimates say he's sold 100 million units, while Black Sabbath has sold 50 million), but in the early days there was no guarantee of that. He put together a band, auditioning Randy Rhoads and hiring just him based solely on his brilliant warmups. They booked tours in small venues, rather than opening for someone else, and eventually it took off. Ozzy has a lot of memories from the early days.    Ozzy describes Lemmy on tour, carrying around with him a suitcase full of books, which was all he had in the world except for the clothes on his back. Then Lemmy was with Ozzy at father-in-law Don Arden's house reading in the library, Arden asked Ozzy who the caveman in the library was, Ozzy said something like \\"oh, that's Lemmy, he's harmless.\\" Seems hard to picture Lemmy enjoying himself quietly in someone's library, but I can believe it if I suspend my rock `n' roll disbelief.    Ozzy had a lot of torment, and one of the things that got him the most was the breakup with his wife when he realised that he was in love with Sharon. He moved out of the house, and eventually there was a restraining order against him. He writes about the torment of losing his kids, but then again, he was too wasted most of the time to appreciate them (and he'd soon enough have a new family to neglect with his drinking and drugging).    There are some grimly funny stories told about this time in his life. One of the things that Ozzy salvaged after the break-up was a stuffed bear that he'd gotten his manager to buy, but he's shot the stuffed bear's head off in a drunken mania (appalling, yes). Salvaging it meant taking a cab from his ex-wife's cottage back to London (couldn't have been cheap), which he did, but the bear got stolen in the process. I don't know what's more surreal - the thought of Ozzy loving a stuffed bear with its head blown off, or the thought that someone in Wimbledon Common has Ozzy's bear as a souvenir.    Ozzy started a new life with Sharon, and eventually asked her to marry her... about 20 times. He'd ask her, then get cold feet, then he'd ask her, then they'd have a fight. But they finally did, and true to form he got blasted at the reception and passed out in the hallway.    And the family madness continued. You saw it in the first decade of the new millenium on The Osbournes, but it was no different in the '80s.    There are other crazy stories in this chapter. Like the pigeon-biting incident when record company executives in LA were giving him a hard time. Someone had dreamed up a stunt where Ozzy would make a point by releasing two pigeons, but instead he only released one of them... and bit the other's head off. It got them in trouble with the record company, but it got them great publicity; same with the \\"pissing on the Alamo\\" incident. Also, there's the bat incident in Des Moines, which is the title of the chapter. Ozzy writes that during that tour the band had a crazy routine of throwing raw meat and pigs blood out into the audience, and hanging their alcoholic midget every night, and there was all sorts of craziness, and people were throwing things onstage. Then there was... the bat... which he figured was a toy... but it wasn't. Chomp... oops... rabies shots.    Things take a turn for the worse in chapter 8 \\"While I was Sleeping\\", which recounts the airplane accident that killed his awesome guitarist Randy Rhoads, makeup person Rachel Youngblood, and the coked-out tourbus driver who had piloted a small private plane. It all happened when Ozzy and Sharon were sleeping in the tourbus - the plane went out of control and hit the bus and crashed and burned. A horrible event that shouldn't have happened, and Ozzy still can't figure it out - Randy and Rachel both hatedflying, why would they have gotten in the plane? One spooky part of it was that Ozzy found the imprint from the front of the Gibson t-shirt that Randy had been wearing that day lying in the field next to the wreckage. Terrible. But the band had to continue, and then Randy went through a few guitarists before settling on Jake E Lee, who he doesn't write about at all (he also doesn't mention Zakk Wylde much either, and I don't think that Robert Trujillo or Mike Bordin are really mentioned either).    Chapter 9, \\"Betty, Where's the Bar?\\", is largely about Osbourne's struggles with addiction, chapter 10, \\"Blackout\\", is also about his struggles with addiction, as is chapter 11, \\"Dead Again\\". Seems like Osbourne hit rock bottom in Prague when, after a period of sobriety, he and Zakk went on the beer (\\"It was soooo good\\"), and Ozzy said to Zakk that the one rock star thing that he'd never done, but he still wanted to do, was to throw a TV out of the window. He did it, but was so disgusted with himself, that he just didn't want to do drugs and drink any more. Something shifted in his addict's brain, if you can believe the telling, but it's good for him if it's so (and for his family as well, of course). It's even gotten to the point that he scorns British pub culture, pointing out the irony of how UK people would unwind after attending the funeral of a friend who has drunk himself to death by going down to the pub.    Other tales that he tells are about the accident with the quad bike which nearly cost him his life, and then there's all the madness around The Osbournes TV show. After four seasons of insanity, the series ended, to Ozzy's relief. He would have never done the series, he said, if he's have known what the lack of privacy meant (eldest child Jessie was smart, she didn't want to be in the show at all). Also, there was the surge in celebrity that made life difficult, and there were problems around what it did to Jack and Kelly. But during the time, Ozzy and Kelly finally got a number one song with \\"Changes\\", nearly becoming the Christmas Number One of that year (beat out by Gary Jules' \\"Mad World\\"). Ozzy was disappointed that none of the other guys in the band called to congratulate him.    One of the best parts of the The Osbournes years and the celebrity, however, was Ozzy's brushes with other celebrities. Of course, there's the infamous visit to George Bush's White House that is recounted so well in the first episode of the second season of The Osbournes, but there's also meetings with people he loves and respects like Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, Elton John and Elizabeth Taylor (yes, it's a surprising list - is Ozzy much more conservative than we'd all like to imagine?).    There were two Black Sabbath reunions, Live Aid in but Ozzy doesn't write much about them. There are a lot of people and events that Ozzy doesn't write much about, and you get the sense that there's a lot of reliance on anecdotes, while there's also a general skirting around certain issues, but in a crazy 40-year career in show business there's going to a lot that isn't mentioned. But he does recount the case of his attempt to strangle Sharon one night when he was out of his mind on booze and drugs, as well as the case of him being mis-diagnosed with AIDS after shagging a grubby groupie (last time he ever cheated on Sharon, according to him, the AIDS scare thing taught him a lesson... I guess). As far as anecdotes go, there's one really disgusting one about the time they were viewing a house that Roger Whittaker was trying to sell.    He writes a bit about his parents, and the times when each died, as well as the death of Don Arden, and each story is sad. There's also a lot of animosity with Don Arden, and even with Ozzy's mum, who seemed too focussed on money for Ozzy's taste. A bit odd to fault someone who had a hard life growing up poor being very focussed on the fuel that lubricates the wheels. I guess he's the kind of guy who has been successful for so long that he takes money for granted, although he does give several perspectives on it throughout the book of having to buy his way out of some of the disfavourable deals that he signed onto as a young artist that he needed to get out of if he ever wanted his independence.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Great fun! And who cares if Kenneth Branagh has lowered himself to doing Marvel Comics adaptations after having once been in the lofty heights of producing Shakespearean theatre - the film has everything you'd find in a Shakespeare production, including battle helmets and cod pieces. Chris Helmsworth makes a great Thor (blonde, big, lots of doughy muscles and a bit dopey to match), Anthony Hopkins makes a great Odin (grim, imperious and iron-hearted), and Tom Hiddleston makes a great Loki (sneaky, slinky and possessed of a wicked grin). Like most other Marvel Comics movie adaptations, this one bears a lot of similarity with the original comic, while also diverging from it. Sure, Jane Foster was Marvel's most boring character in the original '60s comics, while in the year 2011 she's become an astrophysicist played by Natalie Portman (?!?), and we can skip (for the most part) that whole Dr Donald Blake thing - make fun of it, even - and just carry on with our day.  Hooray!  Thor gets banished to Midgard (our muddy old Earth) and he makes friend (and lovers) with his charm. He confronts some sort of destroyer drone, then goes nutso on heaven and earth in a war on sneaky ice demons. Great fun. Still, though, I don't know who the actor Stellan Skarsgård is, nor the film character he plays called \\"Erik Selvig.\\" Is he important? And why does he seem to have such a crucial role in the upcoming The Avengers movie, as seen in the brief mini-scene that follows the credits where he (and Hiddleston) appear with film legend Samuel Jackson? Don't get it, not really.

B003U0AHBO|4.0|I had seen the Errol Flynn and Costner versions, but I think this is the best. I had seen the movie in the theaters, but some of the plot lines were confusing, especially about the children in the woods. The Director's Cut did a much better job of explaining the interaction. The movie ends as though there may be a sequel. If so, I would gladly go see it.

B004L49K20|5.0|An epic, visionary, and spell-binding album that takes on great operatic/thematic/ and instrumentally inspired twists and turns along the way that separate this work not only from other Duran albums - but most of the stuff that is in the charts today by other bands. Normally it's possible to evaluate a work independent of its producer, but in this case the listener cannot help but tip their hat to the inimitable Mark Ronson. Not just tip your hat, but drop your jaw...<br /><br />It's as if magic was distilled in some musical alchemical process in the \\"lab\\" that managed to take what we love from DD stuff way in the past and merge it with a successful futurist bent. I never explored the Timbaland exercise of \\"Red Carpet\\" but I am even more unlikely as I cannot tear myself away from the current one long enough...Astronaut was all right, but this new one takes things to lofty new heights.<br /><br />DD are the great survivors. Remember that chill up and down the spine when \\"Ordinary World\\" catapulted the charts round 94? Here we are in 2011 with an album that's all the Wedding Album was and even more! You cannot count this band out. They keep moving forward with such talent and accomplishment. They don't just cash in on the oldies.<br /><br />The leopard song is a stroke of brilliance; and its preceding instrumental is a lush, hypnotic audible appetizer. It's really quite addictive and enduring. The little antique violin touches, and BBC-like simulations, are indicative of the attention to detail and mastery of touch that distinguish albums like this - where the listener feels as if assiduous work and love certainly were infused into the entire production.<br /><br />A band of this pedigree still putting out such effort is indeed impressive. That someone had the divine insight to tap Ronson is simply one among many nuances of genius that permeate the latest incarnations of DD.<br /><br />It's so nice to see Roger Taylor back; and the question of how these English blokes look better in their fifties than they did in their twenties is a philosophical conundrum I'll leave other pundits to ponder...<br /><br />Am so looking forward to this live show.<br /><br />(On a side note, I think we should remember one of the musicians critical to keeping DD on the map during sketchy times, though his views on 911 are comical: Warren Cuccurullo.)hey did in their twenties is a philosophical conundrum I'll leave other pundits to ponder...

1857885082|4.0|I liked this book, but it really would have been much better if it were shortened and the font size was normal instead of so small. OK, truth be told, I stopped reading about 1/3 through because of these issues and gave the book to a friend who will probably read all of it. But, the parts that I did read was very informative and usually very funny. Less is More though - here on length I mean. Maybe an abridged edition is in order. Anyway, the book does have its good points, so give it a try if the subject is of interest and length is not an issue for you.
B005DD7H50|4.0|This is for sure a better entertainer of the 2011 lot. Bradley Cooper suits the character well. Though fans like me would expect more from a great actor like DeNiro. His role in the movie was short and not so powerful as his introduction shows. With so less characters, the director has managed to keep the pace which is a commendable effort. This movie gets its place besides other brain based thrillers like Inception and the like. Go watch it if you like fiction.

B004USRKR4|4.0|If you've seen Submarine the movie, you know that it's a quirky little movie, slightly left off center (I don't mean politically), and I say all that as a compliment to the movie of course. I really enjoyed it when I saw it last month. I had no idea going into the theatre that the soundtrack would be featuring music from Arctic Monkeys' frontman Alex Turner. (As it happens, the director of Submarine has also directed several music videos of Artic Monkeys, hence the connection.) I also had no idea that a soundtrack was actually released for this, so when I happen to fall upon this while recently traveling in Scotland, I immediately snapped it up.<br /><br />\\"Submarine\\" (6 tracks; 19 min.) starts off with the 1 minute intro of Stuck on the Puzzle, the official theme of the movie I suppose. The next three songs, Hiding Tonight, Glass in the Park, and It's Hard to Get Around the Wind all are primarily Alex Turner and acoustic guitar, that's it. Intimate songs, with the words sometimes almost whispered rather that sung, but all quite charming. Stuck on the Puzzle follows, and is easily the most accessible and commercial-sounding track on here, with a fuller, fleshed-out instrumentation as well. The closer Piledriver Walz is actually different version from the same Artic Monkeys track that appears on their most recent \\"Suck It and See\\" album.<br /><br />Despite the presence of Piledriver Waltz (which, as mentioned, is quite different), if you are expecting what Arctic Monkeys do, you are sure to be disappointed. This is an Alex Turner solo-project, not an Arctic Monkeys side-project. That aside, I am a huge fan of Arctic Monkeys, and I'm enjoying this EP for what it is, and far more than I expected. Any serious Arctic fan will want to have this in his or her CD collection.

B0031SU2Y2|5.0|What makes us human is our compassion and the fact that we can feel the pain of another and sympathize with others' sufferings and needs. This film is amazing. Vincent Lindon is outstanding, as usual, (check out LA MOUSTACHE) but the young actor Firat Ayverdi seriously takes home all the awards anyone should give him for his brilliant performance. I felt for him and I wanted to help him. There was a sense of impending doom from the very beginning, the sky is always overcast and it seems like it's always cold. This is about helping fellow humans as we would like to be helped in difficult, life/death situations. Simply stunning.
0446677450|5.0|This book changed my life. Getting good grades, getting a good job, and paying taxes on my income was all I knew, but it turned out that all I knew was foolish. I was a child in the world of finance, there to be molested and abused by the gross cultural misconceptions of wealth and success. As a doctor, it soon became obvious to me that the government would tax me beyond my means of livelihood, so I went back to school and earned my degree in law. But little did I know that my second job as a medical malpractice lawyer would simply increase my tax bracket and leave me no better than where I started! I have not been able to read past the introduction of this book, due to the demands of my two jobs, but the introduction alone has taught me more about living - and my lack thereof - than \\"Being in Time\\" by Martin Heidegger.     If the board game \\"CASHFLOW,\\" as described by the authors, taught a 19 year-old girl to master the subjects of accounting and investing, which, in the words of the authors, are \\"two of the most difficult subjects to master,\\" then I  have wasted the last 26 years of my life by not playing this game.  Why did I even go to college? Pride? Arrogance? My parents' lack of foresight? What good is my specialized degree in pediatric oncology if it doesn't cover the payments on my Audi Q7? What good is my 30% commission on cases if the government takes 88% percent? If only Kiyosaki had invented a game board for medical professionals, I might not be $30,000 in debt. From one sinner to another, buy this book. The introduction alone will show you the error of your ways!  As for the rest of the book, I cannot vouch for it as I have yet to read beyond the first six pages.

I hardly find a book that I cannot put down, but this trilogy is one of them. The character development is fantastic, and the games draw you into their world as if you are a participant. The main character is moving and makes me wish she was a real person, so I know that there are actually people like that in the world today.     Must read, exciting, detailed and will make for many lost hours of sleep staying up to finish the books.

B004H0N4PC|2.0|Never thought I'd see the day when I'd give an Elbow release only 2 stars. Build a Rocket Boy! just isn't very good. This album drones on like some sort of lifeless shoegaze album. Where are the soaring choruses? Where are the wildly varying moods? The clever lyrics? The corpse in the bathtub? This album is stunningly mundane. It's as lethargic as a death metal band gone acoustic. I've tried to like this. I've given it plenty of time to sink in, hoping that maybe it was just a difficult album to enjoy. I was hoping the hooks were subtle and with some time I'd pick up on them. Alas, they're just not there. The songs are still a chore to listen to. They haven't grown on me, they've grated on me. And now I've settled on just being disappointed with this album. I waited 3 years for this? Please redeem yourselves boys. Please!
B002RN5I3M|5.0|I read a few of Ken Follett's other books, and have always been a fan, but Pillars of the Earth swept me away! I couldn't put it down! If you felt like this when you read Pillars and you were actually disappointed when it ended, you will love World Without End. Be aware though this is not exactly a sequel to Pillars; it just happens to be similar characters living in the same town about a hundred years later. If you never read Pillars the book will still make sense and be a great read- there will probably only be a bout 1-2 sentences you won't understand. Either way, the book has a great plot, teaches you a lot about history, and takes you on a fantastic adventure you won't want to end! I definitely recommend!
0156027321|4.0|This was one of those books I heard people talking about seven or eight years ago and I kept meaning to get around to it.  Though after I read Martel's first novel \\"Self\\" I was less inclined to read this because that novel was so boring that it routinely put me to sleep.  But eventually I found a copy of this for a really low price so I figured I might as well do it.<br /><br />I started to regret that decision during the first 150 pages.  Like \\"Self\\" these pages are so dull.  Mostly they concern Pi Patel as he tries different religions like an Indian version of \\"Are You There God, It's Me Margaret.\\"  This might have been interesting if you haven't read any fiction about India before but I've read Salman Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\" and John Irving's \\"Son of the Circus\\" which were both far more interesting in terms of Indian culture.  Then too there was also the movie \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" that also dealt with India and its religious divisions.<br /><br />So all of that made those first 150 pages a chore to plow through.  I kept wondering, \\"When are we getting to the shipwreck with the tiger?\\"  That's the hook for this novel isn't it?  Boy in a lifeboat with a tiger?<br /><br />Well it finally happened once Pi's father decides to move his family to Canada to escape the Idira Gandhi regime.  The ship they're on with most of the animals from their little zoo in India--to be sold to American/Canadian zoos--sinks shortly after leaving the Philippines.<br /><br />The crew throws Pi into a lifeboat, where soon he finds that he's sharing space with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger!  That's a lot of animals to cram into what's described as one hundred square feet.  Actually I have serious doubts that you could hide a tiger under a tarp in that small amount of space.<br /><br />Anyway (spoiler alert!) it eventually ends up with just Pi and the tiger as they cross the Pacific Ocean.  The book at this point deals mostly with Pi's struggle to survive.  Not only to find food and water, but also to deal with his boatmate, the tiger named Richard Parker.  It's a constant struggle, one that forces Pi to compromise many of his religious beliefs, such as his aversion to eating meat.<br /><br />This was where the book came to life and became much more interesting.  Though the problem with being on a lifeboat is that there's a limit to just how much you can do.  With \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" or \\"Lord of the Flies\\" or even \\"Gilligan's Island\\" where the main character(s) is marooned on an island, there's far more you can do because you have a whole island to explore.  That makes far more potential for adventure than a boat floating on the water, where essentially everything has to come to you.<br /><br />For the most part Martel manages to make this interesting with the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker.  Then there are strange incidents like meeting another lifeboat or the mysterious island they come upon.<br /><br />Although what I think is missing is more about his spiritual state.  A couple of times he says it brings him closer to God, though which one?  Since he believes in the Christian God, Allah, and all the Hindu gods, which one(s) is he getting closer to?  Or maybe there's just one ubergod?<br /><br />The ending is also a little disappointing and mildly offensive with the vaudevillian act between Pi and a pair of Japanese shipping company officers.  So basically everything off the lifeboat is far less interesting than everything on the lifeboat.  Maybe they should have stayed on the boat.<br /><br />That is all.find food and water, but also to deal with his boatmate, the tiger named Richard Parker.

B00005LELD|4.0|This hood is great, I use it on a 50mm f/1.8 (probably where most people use it. It's extremely convenient that it's collapsible, but kind of a pain when you have to screw and unscrew it on and off when you need to change or remove a filter. Also, there can be some vignetting depending on your focal length (around 24mm) and # of filters if you're using a zoom (like the 18-55mm Nikon Kit Lens). This is easily controlled if you take the time to make sure. Other than that, I love that it's rubber but the way it bends will still protect your glass a bit if it falls.
B000085RTZ|5.0|Karma was epic, powerful, amazing, melodic, and heavy all at once! This is no different. I really like both but I like Karma a bit more. But that doesn't mean that this is bad. This is very good. Epica tells us the story of Faust. I don't really know the story, but the music of this album does more than make it sound good! Especially songs like Center of the Universe, Descent of the Archangel, and Lost and Damned.<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />This album has your basic Karma style but with some extremely memorable melodies (As if Karma's melodies weren't memorable!), the Same amazing vocals of Khan, and some catchier hooks!<br /><br />1. Prologue- Not really a song...just a sound effect type thing that leads us into Center of the Universe...<br /><br />2. Center of the Universe- Great song! Best opening they've had and among their best melodies of all time! Truly a Kamelot Klassic!<br /><br />3. Farewell- Another great one. I love the chorus. Kamelot's music has improved a bit.<br /><br />4. Interlude I (Opiate Soul)- An interesting interlude. I like the ending part; the dark chanting sounds cool!<br /><br />5. The Edge of Paradise- A darker sound for them at this point in time. Signs of what's to come (Altho, this is better than most future songs.)<br /><br />6. Wander- My vote for best Kamelot ballad! Beautiful, moving, and amazing can describe this. I LOVE IT!<br /><br />7. Interlude II (Omen)- Another interesting interlude. Nice<br /><br />8. Descent of the Archangel- Another darker sounding one that's good (and still better than most songs after this album.)<br /><br />9. Interlude III (At the Banquet)- This one is just voices and a cool guitar thing at the end. Not as good as the 1st few interludes.<br /><br />10. A Feast for the Vain- Not that good of a song. It's ok, but not great...<br /><br />11. The Coldest Winter Night- A cold, bitter sounding ballad. I like it.<br /><br />12. Lost and Damned- Another amazing song; I love the chorus and the beat of it.<br/><br />13. Helena's Theme- A beautiful little song with Mari Youngblood singing in her operatic angel voice.<br /><br />14. Interlude IV (Dawn)- This interlude just has a town crier saying how Helena drowned herself and her unborn child in the river the previous night.<br /><br />15. The Mourning After (Carry On)- I don't really like this one, but it's ok. It could grow on me, but I'm not going to say it has a big chance to.<br /><br />16. III Ways to Epica- An amazing ending to this album. Very Epic and cool-sounding. I like it.<br /><br />Verdict: I say that anyone who's a fan of Kamelot, Stratovarius, Symphony X, or Power Metal bands, should check this out! It's a great album and if you're new to Kamelot, this one or Karma is the best place to start (See my Karma review for reference). I say that you should listen to at least Center of the Universe and see if you'll like it.
0316017930|5.0|\\"I'm a very lucky guy\\"<br />William H. Gates Jr., Philanthropist<br /><br />Recently, I had drinks with a former colleague, who was bemoaning the pressure her parents were putting on her to get married. It was a common theme around Shanghai, young people under untold amounts of pressure to live up to some impossible standard; whether it was money, relationships, work, manners, education-parents just want what's best for their kids, and believe that pressure is a good way to do it. They care about their retirement, and know that investing energy in their kids can, almost always, lead to a more financially stable and comfortable retirement (not to mention, more grandkids).<br /><br />But if you examine the richest, most successful people in the world, they seemed to get there by doing something crazy, regardless of the financial upshots. Actually, when the `lucky' Bill Gates started poking around with computers, there was no software industry to speak of. His parents were lawyers, and expected him to go on and be one too. The entire Silicon Valley phenomenon arose out of Southern California University labrats tinkering with new designs, and ultimately founding their own companies (famously Hewlett Packard; most recently, Google).<br /><br />To have pressured Bill Gates at the age of 13 to get into Computers would have quite literally required knowledge of the future of business, the internet, and the multibillion dollar computer industry itself. No one could have known (even if Bill's parents were so inclined-they weren't). No one could have possibly known, and no one could have possibly `forced' Bill into loving those drab black and green screens (which very likely decimated any chance at a social/love life for the following 10 years). The one thing he did have, however, was passion. And passions a funny thing. If you're passionate about fashion, or technology, or sports, or even law, you can burn hours and hours studying and practicing it, without getting tired, or exhausted. And it turns out, it's exactly this kind of energy you need to get to 10,000 hours.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell famously noted that in every child prodigy, young genius, or early Millionaire story, there was a race to hit 10,000 hours of experience. Whether it's dancing, playing an instrument, cold calling sales, playing basketball, there seems to be a very clear distinction between those who've hit the 10,000 hour mark, and those who don't. And the key, is to hit it very early, so you can be the most talented guy/girl in your age group, and rake in all the glory. The only way to do that, is to have an edge. For Bill Gates, it was his Private High school's computer lab. For the Beatles, it was playing bars in Germany for 8-12 hours a day.<br /><br />And here's the rub. If you work really hard, you'll still need about 10 years to hit that experience level (to be considered an expert). If you want to learn something just for the money, you probably won't get there, but even if you do, you might not even get rich, because you need to begin your `studies' 10 years in advance. Steve Jobs didn't do it for the money. How could he? Circuit boards attached to wooden panels? How could anyone think that that was a multibillion dollar idea. Found Apple Computer over a Harvard MBA? No way.<br /><br />And so when it comes to financial success, there is an element of luck involved. You can be great, and you can get a college degree, even a Master's degree, but if your parents insist upon a certain level of financial success, they just might be pushing you in the wrong direction. Bill Gates was.. well, lucky that Software turned out to be a big deal (in fact when he first started, no one was paying for it. He had to convince people to actually pay for Software).<br /><br />So what constitues luck. First you have to have some opportunities, and a bit of luck, maybe you're born in the right year, the right gender, with the rig parents, with the right connections. More thananything, you have to truly love doing something that only 10-15 years later turns out to be a goldmine. If you start something with purely financial motivations, you'll drop it, or go on to have a mediocre career.<br /><br />And it's not good enough to be smart. You have to have social skills too. It's not about your SAT scores, its about what people say about you when you're not around. It's about your ability to pitch and persuade. It's about your background, your family. If any of these things is missing, you won't get there. And being born into a great loving family, may just be the luckiest thing of all.<br /><br />More reviews like this on 21tiger10-15 years later turns out to be a goldmine.

0553801473|5.0|I'm seeing a lot of down-beat reviews, & that's fine; everyone has his/her own opinion. My own feeling is that this was the best book of the series yet: big, bold, ugly, with plenty of potentially bloody cliff-hangers to end it all.<br /><br />Beyond that, I have to respect the way Martin made me feel sorry for \\"Reek\\", & almost had me feeling sorry for Cersei. Almost. There's no way I could ever actually sympathize with that slimey, wretched, loathesome woman ... but Martin almost pulled it off, until I reminded myself just who & what that despicable creature is, & smiled at the image conveyed.<br /><br />I loved the story. I can't wait for the next one.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|While this is by no means a challenging book to read it's certainly a cool one. The combination of nostalgia mixed with the futuristic setting (that's seeming less futuristic everyday) is done well. The eccentric millionaire and poor boy hero plot has been done before (see Willy Wonka) but that doesn't mean don't love these characters still. Easy and fun. Like an old Atari game.
B005G26NJE|5.0|I read about this artist in Rolling Stone before I downloaded the EP. My boyfriend and I love it! One of my favorite things about it is that each of the songs sound different. While they are mostly bluesy, the 3rd track sounds like R&B. Good stuff.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I'll admit, I'm a decades long Yes fan,(how many of you can remember exactly when you heard a new band's music for the first time? I first heard \\"And You and I\\" at 1130 on Sunday, March 18 1973.) So I have gone through many iterations of this band. While I was enamored with the musicianship of the classic lineup, I enjoyed \\"Relayer\\",\\"Drama\\",\\"90125\\",\\"Union\\" and \\"The Ladder\\" as well, realizing that bands reflect the musical visions and abilities of those in the band at the time. And while I haven't liked everything Yes has done in the studio over time (\\"Open Your Eyes\\" and \\"Magnification\\" struck me as weak), I've usually been able to find one or two tracks per album I enjoyed.    I will also admit, I was entirely prepared to not like this album. To be honest, I was not happy with Jon Anderson being dropped from the lineup. Replacing him with Benoit David struck me as too \\"Journey-ish\\". Dumping Jon because of his asthma problems and inability to tour seemed cold. I was also not happy with some of the comments both Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman made in separate interviews regarding dropping Jon and using Benoit. So I was entirely prepared to be skeptical of this album, realizing even before I bought the album that \\"Fly From Here\\" was a recycled \\"Drama\\" era song they used to perform live.    Having said that, I must admit, this is, without a doubt, the most listenable and enjoyable album Yes has done in years, bar none! There are no clunkers song-wise here. I can listen to the entire album from start to finish repeatedly and not get tired or skip tracks. Regarding Benoit David's voice and singing, I was pleasantly surprised to find what some of the other reviews already observed. Sometimes he sounds like Trevor Horn, sometimes he sounds like Jon and sometimes he sounds like himself. He is a vocal chameleon. I will also say, Benoit demonstrates more vibrato in his singing than either of his vocal predecessors and that's a good thing.     I have also altered my opinion aboutJon being dropping. I spent an interesting couple of days listening to the group's studio catalog in sequence from \\"Union\\" to \\"Talk\\" to the studio cuts on \\"Keys to Ascension 1 & 2\\" to \\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"The Ladder\\" to \\"Magnification\\". None of them were as enjoyable as \\"Fly From Here\\". There were some great moments of playing and some great riffs but not very many great songs. I also noticed the songs got weaker as time went on, with \\"Magnification\\" really being about the worst and weakest. I can see that perhaps Jon's musical vision and lyrics were not compatible with where the rest of the group (or Chris) wanted to go. Now, after listening to the album, that may have been a good thing.    I'm not sure this album is \\"Drama\\" Part 2. I recall at the time. that \\"Drama\\" struck some of us as radical and a departure from the classic Yes musical vision. Still, it was enjoyable (loved \\"Machine Messiah\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\"). This album for me is overall, far more satisfying. Kudos to Chris and the gang for sticking to their guns and for producing such an exceptional album, even if it doesn't have Jon on board. More please!!

I ended up having to go to Borders during their closeout sale to get the correct book.

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I tried a test with the Zoom H1. Set the levels to about 60 and was up in the -6db range. Onboard mics sound pretty decent. Then plugged in the Audiotechnica, had to crank the Zoom to 100 just to get around the same -6dB range and sound was mono, distant, small, low and hissy. Don't buy this or you'll be throwing a hissy too. It sucks and that's being kind.
0307389839|2.0|I should start by confessing that I don't enjoy running (it's rather hard on my knees). I read this book only because I'm a fan of Murakami's fiction, and one of his previous nonfiction works - the chilling and unforgettable \\"Underground.\\"  Unfortunately, this book is nowhere near as good as \\"Underground.\\" Everything about \\"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running\\" - including that silly title, inspired by Raymond Carver - feels half baked. Murakami admits that he wrote the book in a piecemeal fashion over a long period of time, and it shows. His descriptions of participating in various marathons, triathlons, and grueling training sessons get repetitive after a while, and never really come together to form an interesting whole.  In Murakami's defense, in the context of discussing his history as a runner, he does make some good (if predictable) points about commitment and determination. And his writing style, at least in translation, is as breezy and unpretentious as ever. So the book is a smooth read, and honestly it's not terrible in any way. It's just bland and underdeveloped.  By the time I finished reading this, I came to the conclusion that Murakami is too private a person to write an effective memoir, even though the major theme is exercise and not his personal life. He buries too much of his true personality under superficial observations about things like the kind of music he enjoys, the kind of beer he drinks, and his shockingly silly views on global warming. Sure, he does a good job of explaining how he became a novelist in an early section of the book; but soon after, the interesting biographical details fade out, and Murakami starts to depict himself as a pure and simple running machine. (Of course, my lack of deep interest in running only increased the frustration I felt at the book's transformation; I kept wanting to hear more about, I dunno, Murakami's wife or something.)  Naturally, readers who are more interested in running as a sport, and a discipline, will get more out of this than I did. As a Murakami fan, I was indecisive about whether I should bother reading this, and it took me a long time to get around to it. Well, I can now say to his other fans that, in my opinion, this book is skippable.

They were not in direct sun light and husband has always left his other crocs outside by the door.  Don't know what he did with them, but I bought him some skull head birki's profi to replace them.  He always wore birkis up until 2009.  Will be sticking with Birkenstock for his work shoes from here on out.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|I have a love/hate relationship with Still Alice by Lisa Genova. While I loved learning about the actual chemical and physical changes in the brain of an AD patient, I hated reading about it happening to Alice. Wife, mother, and Harvard professor and researcher, Alice Howland is struck with early onset Alzheimer's Disease just shy of her 50th birthday. Not only was she very cognitively involved in reading, writing, lecturing, attending conferences, and mentoring, she was also a dedicated runner, activities that are supposed to stave off effects of the disease. Alice had inherited the condition from her father, and from the book I learned that this specific type of AD can be detected early in life.<br /><br />Still Alice affected me in both cognitive and emotional ways. I learned a lot about the disease itself and became more familiar with neurological terms and some new research. For instance, there is too much of a soluble protein known as amyloid-beta 42 in the brain of an Alzheimer's patient. I was touched emotionally by the changes in Alice's family as they rallied around her. It was also quite interesting, though heartbreaking, to read the story of Alice's altered mental state from her point of view rather than from the other people in her life.<br /><br />One particular passage made me feeling like laughing and crying at the same time, the one in which she's describing her perceptions as she and John walk to Harvard for graduation. She feels \\"conspicuously ridiculous\\" in her cap and gown and finds herself doubting John's wardrobe decision for them that day until she sees \\"masses of people in similar costumes and hats but in a variety of colors funneled from every direction onto the sidewalk with them.\\" Although she couldn't remember the details, at some point during that day, Alice recognized something about the place and excited feeling that she had once been a part of, an \\"implicit knowing that it had been rich.\\"<br /><br />I particularly loved the scene at the end of the novel when Alice is holding her grandchild while watching her daughter Lydia rehearse a part for a play. She can't understand everything Lydia is saying. In fact, she doesn't even know that it's her daughter. She does, however, clearly recognize that LOVE is what she's expressing, something Lydia tells Alice that she got \\"exactly right.\\"<br /><br />While many books just end, Still Alice offered book club discussion prompts and an informative interview with the author. From the interview, I learned even more about current research and about the author's motives for writing the book. I also picked up some advice about writing and learned that the author is an advocate of self-publishiing. To quote Genova, \\"Woohoo!\\" There's hope for all of us.hen Alice is holding her grandchild while watching her daughter Lydia rehearse a part for a play.

B0050PYNN0|4.0|W.T.F.  Why the hell are there so many bad reviews in here about this movie?  This movie was hilarious!  Think about it; Natalie Portman, a Minotaur raping a skinny little guy, a character created just so they can say \\"dick-less\\" servant, and a forest full of naked hotties are just a few elements of this film that make this a very good movie!  If you had high hopes for this movie, then you're just not thinking right.  That like grabbing a glass of 7-up and expecting water when you take a drink.  I'm just saying.<br /><br />Seriously though.  Take it as it is.  A fresh swing at a stoner type comedy.  It isn't a re-make of any other movies, unlike a lot of the other movies on the shelves right now.  You don't have to be high or drunk to enjoy it, although I'm sure it might enhance it.  If this isn't your cup of tea, then chalk up your rental fee as a loss and STFU.  As for the rest of us that liked it, I'm going to wait a couple months and watch it again and laugh my ass off...again.  Btw, If Natalie Portman is reading this.  \\"hi\\"
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I just read a fellow lady Spartacus lover's review and had to add my own. Suffice to say she echoed a lot of my own sentiments precisely, but I'd like to add a bit more on the subject.<br /><br />The hubby and I are not big television show watchers as current fair seems to be \\"non-reality\\" realty TV and  a glut of tales big on drama short on substance.  When we have time we tend to either rent movies or see if we can find anything worth watching on Xfinity (pfffft).  It was through the latter enterprise that we stumbled upon Spartacus on STARS ON DEMAND.  As  an avid Greco-Roma-phile I was intrigued so we watched Epi 1, 2, and 3 of the prequel.  We immediately ordered BLOOD AND SAND on DVD and could not resist watching a few episodes on Amazon.<br /><br />Blown away--Just blown away.<br /><br />THE ULTRA VIOLENCE<br /><br />Many have harped on the graphic nature of the violence but I have to say that while it makes me a bit squeamish at times, there is a certain dark poetry to it.  It was for this reason the Colosseum was even built...not that I would ever in reality want mankind to travel back to such times, but the allure then was not simply blood splashing upon the sands.  It was about champions meeting champions; heroes rising--and falling.  Slaves, townsfolk, noblemen could all relate to the romance of a man of meager means being given the opportunity  to join the gods of the heavens.  It had to it, a certain majesty.<br /><br />The people who concentrate on the gore are losing the theme of Spartacus.  Such ones would perhaps want to revert to movie tales where a man  pricked by a sword  falls over melodramatically, moans and dies a bloodless death.  Not very realistic.  Spartacus death's scenes are dark, barbaric and not pretty.  Sure the blood is excessive but I think the art direction as well as the director vision is dead on perfect for the type of story Spartacus is.<br /><br />Also, unlike a lot of films that offer this style of violence, there is a real meaty story to be told here.<br /><br />I for one an somewhat glad that the rose colored glasses have been taken off the subject so those who swoon about how great the era was can see what it was really like.<br /><br />FOUL LANGUAGE<br /><br />I chuckle when I hear people talk about the profanity in Spartacus.  Do they really think profanity and epithets were created in the 20th century?  Course language always existed and salty talk would especially reside on the tongues of  fighters as they would sailors.  Did the F-bomb exist back then?  Probably not, but a Latin equivalent mayhaps did.  If they want Spartacus to be  absolute purist, then this tale would be told in Latin.<br /><br />SMEXY SEX<br /><br />Those who know me who know I am hardly a prude when it comes to the subject of sex, in fact, I am often championing the idea of more honest open discourse (without the shame and guilt associated with the subject).  Dare to dream.<br /><br />There is a healthy balance that can be struck where a respect for what human sexuality \\"IS\\" is coupled with the idea that it is a natural biological drive  not unlike the drive to eat or drink, and the shame is only a byproduct of a society who fails to understand its power--or beauty.  That said, I find the sex scenes appropriate to tale and drives the story along as much as the dialogue and political intrigue.  Assuming most watching these shows are adults, I have no idea why homosexual themes, womanly nipples or a penis would  offend--but then I don't look at sex as being a nasty dirty icky poo closet topic either.<br /><br />I also find the sex scene choreography as it were, more believable than on shows like TRU BLOOD...<br /><br />We heard stories of Roma excesses of sex and violence but we tried to tell this story in a way that mitigated the power of their cautionary tale.  SPARTACUS has finally risen up to the challenge telling this by holding up twin mirrors or horror and loveliness (I mean my god, the costumes, the CGI settings--lush--lovely--the vistas breath taking...the casting dead on perfect LUCY LAWLESS--gasp--I am in lesbian love with her in this.)<br /><br />Why should a woman not be drawn to tales of heroes, lost loves and erotica?  This is after all a pure human tale from the Greco Roman era, a time that has always fascinated us and probably always will...<br /><br />I have finally found TV show to be \\"hooked\\" on and have already made way through episode 6 of BLOOD AND SAND --just wish we could find episode 4, 5 and 6 of the prequel GODS OF THE ARENA....<br /><br />Also learned our protagonist is ill and bravely fighting a hard battle of his own--does anyone know how he is recovering--Godspeed his wellness...<br /><br />Aliciain lesbian love with her in this.)

B004EPZ08O|4.0|Death does not like to be cheated.  Not only does death not like to be cheated, it apparently has a sense of irony, a macabre sense of humor, and compared to the previous movies in the series, seemingly endless and original ways of restoring the balance.<br /><br />I went to see this with two friends, one of whom had never seen a Final Destination movie, and she definitely did not want to see this one, she wanted to sneak into the Smurf movie instead.  If FD was bad, she would leave and go home and take my other friend, because she was his ride.<br /><br />So, as the movie introduces us to our usual collection of destiny deceivers, it presents the different characters in new and interesting ways.  This time, a group of people going on a company retreat, though not all of the people work for the company.  This time it's not a plane about to take off, a freeway pileup, or racing cars in a stadium. It's a bus on a bridge, and I was surprised to be so gripped by what happened on the bridge I forgot what happened in previous movies.  The further you get into the movie, the more gripping it gets.<br /><br />If my friend wanted to flee she could not, maybe because she was rooted to her seat.  Amateurs.<br /><br />FD5 offers an interesting twist on a successful formula.  Death has a new rule, by which it can be successfully cheated, and this creates an ethical dilemma for our participants.  We get the stock characters, the suspicious police detective, who thinks the accident was no accident.  The creepy mysterious guy who turns up at every scene and tells our survivors death does not like to be cheated.  Is he death personified, you wonder? And then the bodies start piling up.<br /><br />\\"If they didn't deserve to die, then why do you deserve to live.\\"<br /><br />The scenes are great, and highly inventive, and they tease and taunt you.<br /><br />Particularly the gymnastic routine, will it be the pointy screw on the balance beam, the loosening bolt on the parallel bar, the frayed wire to the fan, spilling water creeping across the floor, or the defective and shaky over head air conditioner.<br /><br />As the girl prepares for the Lasik scene, you think, doesn't she know?  For the Lasik scene. I had to close my eyes at times. How it toys with your emotions. You can be squirming one moment while anticipating the next.<br /><br />As I looked around I noticed many people covering their eyes at certain points.  A little kid sitting next to me seemed strangely unperturbed by the goings on.<br /><br />And, as a trainee chef ambles into the restaurant and there are naked flames and long skewers, and sharp knives everywhere, you wonder what is he thinking.<br /><br />With our usual assortment of up and coming actors, I wondered who the survivors would be. I remember thinking she is too pretty to die early, but that was short sighted of me, as death does not respect the pretty.<br /><br />Having seen almost all the Final Destination movies, I consider this the best since the original.  Obviously, these types of movies are not for everyone, particularly not my smurf loving friend.  But, if you have enjoyed Final Destination before, you will undoubtedly enjoy this one again.  I loved the twist at the end.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful, and I think you will enjoy the movie., or the defective and shaky over head air conditioner.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|this app is awesome. the game is fun, the difficulty level ramps up at a good pace and the enemies are entertaining. hint: kill the zombies before they get you
030745455X|5.0|I wish that there were more of his books to read.  I didn't read them for a long time.  I wasn't sure I would like them.  When I picked up the first one I was hooked. What a shame he died so young. He was a brilliant writter.
B005HSL626|5.0|is this app good? yes. should you get it? yes. will you be glad you did? yes. will you waste several hours on this game? what do you think
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far my favorite virtual keyboard on the market! Flex T9 has one of the best voice dictation programs out there, but SwiftKey X has the best keyboards layout.
0486438600|5.0|Great book packed with elaborate and intricate designs which vary greatly from the basic and silly designs offered by many \\"Henna artists\\" seen at fairs and festivals. Stunningly fast shipment--received the day after ordering, having purchased only snail mail.  Product is worth that which was paid, and is a great value!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|So many readers have spent their time praising every aspect of this book to the moon, so I won't reinvent that wheel or try to come up with erudite catch phrases about how awesome it is.......it simply IS.  I COULD NOT put this book down!  I grew up in the 80's too, watching my big brother play video games after school with his lunch money and mine, and while I didn't have the skill to play Donkey Kong or Paperboy or Super Mario Brothers for literally hours with one quarter like he did.......I was an avid fan of his skill and totally immersed in the game too.  I voluntarily gave up those quarters for years.  This book made me feel like I was back in the arcade watching my brother play, and after a lifetime of reading great books, it's the first one that demanded I write a small review.  This author will forever be endeared to me for all of the high-falutin' things other reviewers have said, but most importantly because of Wade's staunch defense in the book of \\"Ladyhawke\\" and \\"Legend\\".... two of my top five all-time favorite movies that continue to be ridiculed to this day.  Bravo, I say!!  Write on, Mr. Cline----Oh Emperor Of Geeks, because your gift is astounding  and better than a magical sword any day!!  Now to the disappointing search for ANY book that even comes close to being that dang good of a read.......
B00004R99J|2.0|I would not suggest allowing children to watch this film unless you are completely comfortable with perpetuating sexist and racist stereotypes. Annoyed by depictions of female being \\"saved\\" by male counterparts, and glowing depictions of \\"life being perfect\\" for Natives prior to arrival of whites is a bit of a stretch. This film perpetuates several misconceptions about Native Americans, which are incredibly unnecessary.
B00005RHGL|5.0|On my DVD player upscaled to 1080p it simply looks amazing..Plus the uber cool book case and extras DVD make this a very good purchase..    There is a used in very good condition copy fullfilled by Amazon(free shipping) for under $8..BUY IT..    The director's cut is so much better..I mean it is really amazing the difference from the original release.    Better than the Director's cut Of Gladiator in terms of video quality.    Two of my favorite movies that I haven't upgraded to blu-ray..
0062060554|5.0|Before I Go to Sleep was one of the best mystery/thrillers I have read in a long time! It was engaging from the beginning to the end. I loved the way the author told the story from Christine's daily journal entries. Throughout the whole book I kept wondering if Ben was trustworthy or not. This book is a definite page turner and has a great twist towards the end. My only wish with this book is that it would have had a less abrupt ending and/or would have included an epilogue. I highly recommend this book! This has been my favorite book in 2011 so far.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Excellent movie - well worth the money.  We ended up paying even less than we thought which was great!  Since we pre-ordered, it arrived just a day or two after the release.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|This series gets better and better - love it and can't wait for the next chapter. I think the characters are great but I must admit I would love to see Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) brought back in some way without taking anything away from Joe Mantegna who plays Rossi.  There is one thing that may seem to be trivial - it seems that the packaging and presentation of all the CBS series gets poorer with each series available in DVD format. I include with Criminal Minds all the CSI series and NCIS. They all started with pictures on each disc and far superior box sets. Does anyone else think, like I do, that once hooked one will take the view that anything is better than nothing in order to buy the next chapter?
B001AII4RM|5.0|Robert Zemekis has always been hit or miss. He has made some awesome movies (BTTF 1-3, Cast Away, Forrest Gump) and some not so awesome movies (Death Becomes Her, Polar Express). I believe this to be one of his better films. I enjoyed his interpretation of the material, and the flaws he gives the characters. The animation is absolutely amazing, especially with the blood and guts in the unrated version. Yes, some of it is silly, but thats the point! Great movie, I very highly recommend it.
0446615625|1.0|I still have not received my product.  This has been the WORST experince that I have ever had on amazon!!!!!!!

B001UV4XHY|1.0|The movie was fantastic, but the quality of the DVD is totally unacceptable. The movie is so dark that you can not see the scene. We returned one copy and got a second one which was no better.

B001E45XT4|4.0|When I ordered the GameCom 367 headset, I was looking for headphones that were inexpensive but still good quality.  I'm a casual gamer, so I also wanted a built in mic.  These GameComs fit my needs excellently.  The sound is very good, although the bass is a tad weak, and the mic picks up my voice accurately with very little background noise.  The pads are very soft and much more comfortable than the fake leather that I've seen on other headsets.  Even though they are closed-ear headphones, they don't muffle sound hardly at all unless the headphones are actually producing sound. Once the sound starts up, though, you can barely hear anything else unless the outside noise is very loud, which is perfect for me.  However, I do have one problem.  I have an average sized head, but these headphones pinch my head very tightly.  I've seen other reviewers who say that they have large heads and this headset doesn't bother them, however, I think this is because when the headset is NOT stretched out to fit a larger head, all the pressure from the \\"headband\\" goes towards the lower part of the heaphones, right above my jaw.  It's not horrible, but I've gotten headaches from prolonged use.  A little adjusting of how the GameCom's sit on my head helps, but never quite fixes the problem.  I bet if my head was bigger, it would bend the headphones apart a little more and even out the pressure.  So in summary, this headset is a great bargain as long as you don't mind them being tight.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Now that I've been using these for about a year now, I can look back and see that after a month of \\"breaking them in\\" they became much more comfortable to use.  Now they are much less tight, and I use them non-stop.
B001AQO3WY|4.0|I'm currently deployed in Afghanistan serving with the US Army. Though this is a depiction on what the Marines went though the invasion of Iraq it's still a great mini series to watch!
0553801473|1.0|The first three books in this series were amazing. AFFC was ok, nothing amazing but a decent read considering it consisted of secondary characters. ADWD was just awful. It was slower and Martin somehow made me hate all the chapters except for Johns. Arya's were painfully submissive (and she was my favorite character), Cerci's were drawn out, and Dany's were uneventful and were completely useless. After half the book I simply wanted this to end, skipped all of Dany's second half chapters until the last, and actually had to put the book down for a few weeks because it was so, so boring. I think the thing that made me most hate this book was that the characters lost their personality. Dany was a little girl, Arya was more like Sansa, and John comprises his morals at the end. For the following two books I'll simply attempt to find an online summary unless Martin finds a new editor or finds the passion that he lost.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|is one of the most beautiful and heart-breaking songs I have ever heard.  Other songs have Hiatt's stellar combination of rock, blues and folk.  Buy this CD.  You won't regret it.  Liked after 1st listening, but loved after the second and repeated plays.
1451629184|5.0|I read this in one nite. It is a very good book but very difficult to read. The very beginning, reading what he did to this innocent 11 year old girl, I had to put it down for a little while it was so upsetting. This remarkable and strong woman tells it exactly like it was and does not hold back. I truly admire Jaycee. It is so beyond my understanding how she remains sane. This is a must read. I am raising my 2 granddaughters age 16 and 14 and when they are older I will let them read it. My 50 year old brother can't even read it. My mother has it now. Please buy this book new. I could have got it cheaper some where else but a portion of the proceeds go to something Ms. Duggard started so please help this fantastic lady.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I'm working on my master's in clinical psychology. For my child and adolescent psychotherapy class, we had to choose a movie where we could take the character and do a diagnosis, treatment plan, etc., and I chose Stephen King's \\"Carrie\\". Fascinating when you view it from the framework of her therapist! Try it. Even if you've seen it before, now watch it and figure out what resiliency factors she might have, what to do about the things that happen to her. You'll have a lot of fun and I think you'll be surprised at what can be done for her. Other than that, I had trouble sleeping the night I watched this movie!!!
1455502626|5.0|After reading my first Nelson DeMille book I was hooked.  His wit and humor always makes me smile or laugh out loud.  The first page of Plum Island again set the stage for a story I was sure I was going to enjoy -- I was not disappointed.
B005C0EH5W|3.0|(Note : I really wanted to rate this 3 1/2 star as I think it's a bit better than just 3 stars)<br /><br />Being a huge fan of Karmakanic's \\"Who's the boss in the factory\\" - not to mention the Flower Kings and other swedish prog - I was very much looking forward to this album. While I wouldn't say that I was necessarily disappointed in \\"In a perfect world\\", I will say that I don't think it was on par with \\"Who's the Boss\\". I can't really point to any one thing I didn't care for on the album, but none of the songs really impressed me as being more than well written, but pretty straight forward modern prog in the same vein as Flower Kings.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Turn it up\\" is a strong effort that sounds like something that could break into radio rotation on quite a few stations. \\"Can't Take it with you\\" is also a lot of crunchy, macabre fun but in the end, there's just not enough on this album that sets it apart from many other albums just like it.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I'm not sorry I bought the album, I have enjoyed listening to it and I don't think if you're a fan of their earlier stuff or just modern prog in general you'll regret buying this album if you decide to do so. However, if you're limited on funds (like most of us) then this album can probably wait for now.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Little can be said about Malick's \\"The Tree of Life,\\" because there are so many words that must be written to mostly defend it from an audience that didn't like it. I'm not here as one of those reviewers; I'm here to tell you why I loved it, because that's what matters with this film: the impact it has on each viewer.     I read one synopsis of this film before I watched it in theaters, and thought okay, \\"it's about a loss of innocence.\\" Boy, was that the wrong synopsis. This film captures--the Universe, the creation, the life, the emotion, the spirit. Yes, from the very moment of creation, through the time of the dinosaurs, until it stops in a small Texas town with a family of five. This is where the film gives me hope. I say this, because as I watched the images of the creation of the Universe and the images of space, I sank into my seat, and told myself: \\"We are just like a grain of salt in this Universe, each and everyone of us.\\"     As we are sent to the town with the family, I felt a glimmer of hope. Each person, each family, each town, they create life and give it meaning. For the entirety of the creation of the Universe you feel no other emotion, and put no thought into pain, suffering, jealousy, or any other human emotion. But it is in that home with that family, that the human connection is made. I will not say anymore about the events that unfold in that home, only that it is the most natural acting, and quite possibly the greatest onscreen family that has been captured onscreen. Pitt portrays a stern father, not an abusive one as some people will try to have you believe. Chastain portrays the playful, loving mother. They provide a balance in the cruel world that awaits their children.    I saw what I saw, I felt what I felt, and I cannot explain anymore. Maybe you should give it another try, or maybe this was not the film for you, and you want to give it one-star. That's okay too.     5/5
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I think this movie is a masterpiece. It's a great representation of how crazy big families can be. Throw a fake fiance and an internet computer virus into the mix, and it creates havoc, and thankfully, entertainment! I can personally relate to this gigantic, crazy family, and love seeing how everyone interacts! =)  This movie made me laugh SO hard, cry, and then smile at its beautiful ending.
0757302661|5.0|This book is used in conjunction with HypnoBirthing classes at [...].  Great! AnnapolisHypnobirthing works in conjunction with your provider and Anne Arundel Medical Center Clatanoff Pavillion or any other Birthing Center - Special Beginnings, local midwife, etc.  OB/GYN's refer Annapolis Hypnobirthing regularly. Ask the labor and delivery nurses about Hypnobirhting patients - it really works! You will be calm and in control.
B00457WZEI|4.0|A good, easy read with an interesting perspective.  While the book is recommended for children 9 and up, I would suggest a possibly older age limit due to some of the content within.  It's a good intro for younger readers to WWII history, a step stool to later conversations.    If you are like me, neither parent nor young child, and were inspired to read this book after seeing the live production and in anticipation of the live action movie, you may find this title wanting.  All of the characters, save for perhaps two or three, sound and act almost exactly the same.  Dialogue is presented in large blocks of uninterrupted text, leading me to believe that people of that time period only spoke in monologue format.  I kid, of course, but this was rather off putting for me and interrupted the flow of the story on more than one occasion.  I did appreciate the setting descriptions however, which were just enough to give a clear picture but not get bogged down in the details.
1451629184|5.0|I read this because Jaycee Dugard and Elizabeth Smart are two women I greatly admire. They each have handled severe trauma in such an exemplary way. Jaycee's book is a candid picture of all she endured. It is not a 'good' book as far as the subject matter is horrendous and ugly, but it is an important book because her story deserves to be heard. It's also very helpful in that it helps those not familiar with abuse to understand or at least see the mindset abuse victims develop (dependency on the abuser, fear so powerful that the victim doesn't even think she can attempt to seek help,etc.). I applaud her bravery at putting her story out there for all to see and hope it helps other abuse victims to know they can and should speak up.
B00479SVBU|3.0|I bought this on the basis of the numerous great reviews.   Well, it was as described by these users, and I was happy with it till I noticed that the shuffle program keeps repeating the same (up ot about a dozen) songs before venturing into new territory. If you travel relatively short distances, this becomes a huge annoyance and everytime you re-start your car, you've got to keep fowarding the songs till you hear something new. I'm so sick of doing it. I would be willing to pay a little more for a song randomization program that works, but sadly this is the best that's available.
B003UMW68O|5.0|A sweet and hilarious story, gorgeously rendered monsters and an adorably precocious little girl all make this a must-own for any Disney/Pixar fan. As my review title indicates, you may want to get yourself checked out if you don't have a special spot in your heart for this picture. Blu-ray version rocks!
B005C6NFIG|5.0|Love this cd! Maybe not one of their best albums because most of the songs are mellow and I think most fans enjoy their more upbeat songs, but it is still a very good cd.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|I really happened on The Big Bang Theory on a whim...I was in a Costco and saw the first two seasons on DVD for $10 each and thought I'd give it a chance. So glad I did. The ultra-nerds are totally relatable for me, and the writing is so witty and well done I laugh my way through a season in a weekend. Season 3 ups the ante, further exploring Leonard's hopeless crush on Penny and bringing Sheldon's unintentionally rude commentary to a whole new level. I wish they would be a little quicker in bringing out the Blu-Rays, though. I feel like I've waited forever to see Season 4 in all its HD glory.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I purchased these head phones because i needed some for my new electronic drum set, and i saw these they where a low price and i saw that they where Behringer and i was sold. Once they arrived i was happy to see that they had a converter for the size of input, i plugged them into my laptop and played a couple songs that i thought would give me a good idea of the quality. They sounded wonderful and i loved them instantly, deep low, good volume and crisp highs. The only complaint i have it that they could fit my head a little better.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Unless you count A Bug's Life (and I don't), Pixar has been churning out the hits for Disney over a long time now...and WALL-E is easily one of my favorites. The Blu-Ray edition is flawless and has some pretty cool special features worth checking out. Just a note: take a second to reflect on how much emotion and gravitas they were able to put into the WALL-E character...a character that doesn't speak throughout most of the movie. Impressive.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|There are several negative reviews or reviews saying other books are better. What this book has going for it is that it is so personal. Kissinger sat down with Mao and took part in opening US/China relations and has been a part of that relationship since. He is a little professorial in laying an immense groundwork, but he uses it quite a bit later, so it is worth the investment. He talks about events and conversations in the first person because HE WAS THERE!    He does gloss over opinions of world leaders (on both sides) or buffs out smudges, but what else could he do? He realizes the political forces at work and recognizes leaders respond to their populace. He knows because he has been in the position to feel the effect.    It's not an easy read, though. You need to sit down and prepare and there are parts where he repeats points in a previous chapter as if he had forgotten he wrote them. Overall, though, it's difficult to imagine a more personal invitation into the last 50 years.
B0050PLT8W|3.0|I really enjoy Theory of a Deadman, and Scars and Souvenirs was one of their best.  I was looking forward to this new cd coming out and was a little disappointed.  This new music seems to have a 'country' sound to me, with a little twang.  I have listened to it more then once and I got a little more used to the new sound after a couple of spins.
1463683685|4.0|As I find with most \\"classics\\" this novel took some time to completely capture my interest. Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.<br /><br />Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have truly enjoyed this new cd, Adele has such a strong and powerful voice.  The songs on the album are all wonderful and it is a pleasure to sit back and enjoy!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|If you love horse racing and didn't happen to be around when the greatest race horse ever was eating up the triple crown, you will love this movie. \\"Big Red\\" was a legend in his own time. The movie related his story very well and all the cast played their parts great. You will enjoy the story of \\"Big Red\\" and his claim to fame. I have watched this over and over but I grew up around horses. I saw \\"Big Red\\" when he ran. Something you will never forget. You will like this movie. ENJOY !!! The flag is up !!!
B003UD7JEO|5.0|Nikita is an excellent television show. It is exciting, action-packed, and the plot moves at a rocket pace. The fight scenes are plentiful and very well executed, with Maggie Q doing her own stunts and portraying a very convincing strong female lead. The other actors also do a fine job, including a very enjoyable, deliciously dark and intimidating character played by Melinda Clarke. The show is never boring, with enough twists, intriguing characters, and action to maintain a high level of entertainment throughout the whole season. I highly recommend watching this brilliant series.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|The package arrived on time and in great condition. Could not be happier. Watching The Notebook in Blu-ray is like watching it for the first time all over again (slight sarcasm...but the blu-ray is nice)
0316067938|4.0|Last but not least! Very happy to have gotten to the end of this saga.   I found the writing quite good and appreciated that even though the subject matter is a bit \\"special\\", it was very captivating. (couldnt put it down, in fact) Very vivid descriptions! Enjoy!
B004RKXN44|5.0|Wow!! What can I say?  This book was so hot.  It was hot without being sexually crude.  I loved how the author allowed the reader the pleasure seeing Sieena and Hawke's relationship progress.  And what is not to love about Hawke.  Hawke is the ULTIMATE MAN.  If only we can all find us a Hawke.    If you want a heavy dose of the ultimate paranormal romance, get this book; you will not be disappointed.  I guarantee you will enjoy it!!!
B000063Y8F|5.0|Granted I may have held on to my 1981 garlic press a tad too long, but I LOVE my new Rosle garlic press.  I was at first shocked at shelling $39.00 for a garlic press but it is so worth it.  The garlic comes out cleanly with almost no waste left behind (I always peel my cloves, I was not raised in a barn).  If this is what I can expect from this brand they are my new favorite and I will look for them on my next gadget hunt!  For the record, while I was shopping for this press I actually broke a different one in the store so this press is also very durable.
B000OOMXYI|5.0|I was very positively surprised by the details of Revell's Easy Kit collection, both in colour and texture. I bought some \\"paint not required\\" model kits before where the colours turned up to be defined by the colour of the plastic, so no details were highlighted in colour. But in this kit several details (of course not as many as if you painted it yourself) are ACTUALLY PAINTED. Very detailed interior includes a black painted Darth Vader figurine, looking just like in the movie. It holds together very well without any glue, and it could even survive a few minutes in a child's hands, even though it's not really sturdy enough to be used as a toy. THIS IS A MODEL, NOT A TOY.  A small shortcoming, though: no display stand.   100mm long 77mm wide 64mm tall
B004I8WD6E|4.0|My old casing for my iphone had been falling apart and I decided to try this one out. It's definitely very sturdy. It's nice and thick, but not so thick as to make it bulky. My phone is always falling out of my pocket or bag a lot and when I take the casing off, it's basically as good as new. The front of the casing, where there's no plastic covering, is actually pretty well protected as well in that there's a bit of a lip protruding on the sides a little farther that the face. So, if the phone were to drop on its face, the screen itself wouldn't hit the ground, though I suggest you put a protective screen on it anyway.<br />Only reason I didn't give it a complete five stars is that it can be a bit tricky to put on and take off a first since you need to stretch it, though my difficulty is probably due to the fact I had a simple snap-on case before. But it's definitely not a huge issue.
0553801473|4.0|I actually liked A Dance with Dragons more than any since A Game of Thrones. Finally, I've learned to ignore the many knights, crows, guards, etc., who have little to do with the main plot and concentrate on the main characters. Yes, the book hasn't moved very far along, but this wasn't expected with 7 books planned. I found myself rooting for characters to succeed and shocked at the fate of several. There are quite a few cliffhangers in this book, with some resolved several chapters later and some awaiting their fate in the next novel.<br /><br />I started this series back in November and have read all five in the months since. As in the case of any series, it's difficult to wait for the next book. However, there are good summaries online that help refresh and also an app for Game of Thrones with maps, places, and characters. I also plan to watch the DVD of the HBO series when it comes out.
0312370849|3.0|In order for a narrative conceit to work, it can't get in the way of the story.  In this book, de Rosnay employs two conceits, one of which, alternating chapters between 1942 and present day, works fairly well.  Unfortunately, I felt like I was continuously tripping over the other conceit, that of referring to the main character of the historical chapters as \\"the girl\\".  It seems completely unnecessary to refer to her that way, since the reader can easily guess her name, and it's eventual revelation is completely anticlimactic.  Ditto for the revelation of the name of \\"the child\\" later in the book.    The story itself is engaging, if somewhat predictable.  Certainly, de Rosnay is to be given credit for bringing to light a part of the Holocaust - the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup in Paris - that gets little attention.  She's not exactly subtle about it, but her point is well-taken.
1401207529|5.0|First off I'd like to say that Batman Year One is a MUST for Batman fans but is also very entertaining if you are not a die hard Batman fan.     If you are looking for a superhero/villain face off you will be disappointed.  This isn't a story about a villain, it is a story about Batman.  This is the origin of Batman and how he started out crime fighting.  When I began reading I expected to be kind of bored because we all know the story of Batman's origin.  But surprisingly it didn't linger on anything too long.  It moved pretty quick although it all made sense and kept you captivated.  It didn't skip anything important but it also didn't linger page after page with stuff every Batman fan already knows.    The story itself is a page turner and makes you wanna know what's going to happen next.  There's action but nothing too exciting(no insane villain ect.)  But if you take the story for what it is(a story about Batman's origin) then you will be able to enjoy the action it does have alot more.  Though I went into it expecting much villain type action but I was still very pleased.    The art is amazing.  It keeps you enthralled in the story.  It's not the best I've seen but by far not the worst.  Though with every comic book there will be people who don't like the art and people who do like the art.  It's all a matter of peoples tastes.  I could write 20 paragraphs about how awesome it is and some people will still dislike it.  Or I can bash it and some people will still like it.  It's really all up to the person.  But I for one feel like the art was done very very well.    I would suggest this book for anyone looking to get into Batman as well as someone well versed in the Batman universe.  I think the reason some people didn't like it is because it's a story we all know and it wasn't anything new.  But for a story that everyone knows, Frank Miller did a wonderful job in making it seem like a new experience.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|although the story line felt more meant for kids, the game play was very challenging and entertaining, and i definitely enjoyed the HD grafics. Beat the game in a couple weeks. worth it.
B000OOMXX4|5.0|I was already positively surprised by the \\"Tie Interceptor\\" of the same collection, but I was totally amazed by the richness of the details of this model, both in color and texture. I bought some \\"paint not required\\" model kits before, where the colors turned up to be defined by the color of the plastic (and poorly so), so no details were highlighted in color. But in this kit many details are ACTUALLY PAINTED. Through a transparent, painted edges cockpit canopy you can see the pilot with diferent collors for the face, suit, chest pack and even helmet decoration, with stripes and dots. Remarkable, since we're dealing with a scale that I estimate to be 1/72. R2-D2's decoration is equaly minute. It holds together very well without any glue, and it could even survive a few minutes in a child's hands, eventhough THIS IS A MODEL, NOT A TOY.   A small shortcomming, though: no display stand.   110mm long 97mm wide 30mm tall
0307592839|5.0|I purchased the audio book version of The Goon Squad, and I have been running to it. I really enjoy Roxana Ortega's reading, as she gives each character a distinctive voice. But skip the chapter where Sasha's daughter reads her power point presentation as it is excruciating in its detail of the pauses between songs, it must work so much better on the written page.

B005BGBPBG|3.0|Looked cute/funny so gave it a try.  I loved John Krasinski.  He was the best part of the movie.  They could of gone so many ways with it...and they chose the worst in my view.  I would of loved to see a different angle and someone  you kind of hoped for..get the girl. I don't want to give the movie away...the ending is what is expected...which is too bad.  Boy gets girl but wrong boy.  Also Kate Hudson's character...they took the easy way out in making her look the reason for failure..that was just too easy a write in.<br />I gave it an ok.  I enjoyed seeing this but just wished for more creativity in the  script and options.<br />For those that love a love flick...you get the happy ending and its enjoyable. Just wished for something more~

0345529057|5.0|I have never been a fan of Medieval styled books, but this series rocks! You find yourself forming special relationships with all of the main characters. You WILL become emotional while reading this well written series.  I am a true fan of Tyrion Lannister \\"The Imp\\", and respect the honorable character of \\"Ned\\" Stark and his family.  Of all the characters, you will find that no one trumps Tywin Lannister, because he is a leader of warriors, is cunning in his ability to strategize and make effective decisions and the gold does hurt either. He is the Darth Vader of this book! You do not want to lock horns with him! Winterfell! Hot Pie! LOL     Pay no attention to those folks complaining about the price of these books.  A good book is priceless! Go out and get a set for yourself!
0553386794|5.0|I am one of those people who saw the show and then decided that reading the book was probably a good idea. I really enjoyed the show. I thought it was fresh and entertaining and the perfect amount of gore. I also love fantasy, so it was a good fit for me. This is one of those stories that translates well no matter what format it is in. I love this book. Martin creates a new world that is not too fantastical. This may sound like a complaint, but to me, it is a compliment. Sometimes I read fantasy books and the worlds do not seem well-planned out. The names sound nonsensical and everything seems almost too unrealistic. Martin does not have that problem. He creates a world filled with everyday problems of our own reality- there is lust for power and deceit and plenty of murder. He keeps the fantasy section alive with tales of dragons and a new element all of his own, called the direwolf, which is much like a wolf but a great deal larger.<br /><br />Martin begins his story with the Starks, who live in Winterfell and are rulers of the North in the Seven Kingdoms. Lord Stark's old friend, King Robert Baratheon comes to visit in WInterfell with his family because the Hand, who rules the kingdom for the king, has died. The previous hand, who was a friend of the two men, dies under mysterious circumstances. King Robert's in-laws, the wily Lannisters, are the antagonists to the noble Stark family, and the current connection between the three families is tense. The King also faces opposition from Targaryens, who are the children of the king which Robert and Lord Stark deposed years before. Beyond the political intrigue lies the Wall, an ancient 700-foot high barrier that protects and fortifies the Seven Kingdoms, and is protected by the Brotherhood of the Night's Watch. Life is an ever-present danger, and it quickly becomes apparent that you either win the game of thrones or you die.

B0000067L2|5.0|They really were 'the cream' (creme de la creme) of 1966-67 (possibly '68 too), and this album proves it.<br /><br />Way ahead in sophistication musically & lyrically, the amazing Australian-artist cover doesn't quite live up to the music (very nearly though).<br /><br />Clapton & Ginger Baker are at their peak (I think Jack Bruce reached his the next year with their Wheels Of Fire set) and Jack's powerful vocals & Eric's perfect-pitch harmonies superbly round off this powerful, heavy, psychedelic, blues cross-over (the original heavy-rock-psychedelic-blues cross-over) power trio.<br /><br />Cream were the first to seriously threaten The Beatles' top position, especially as the latter had stopped touring; and as a result of Cream's ecstatic reception in the U.S., it was Cream who were now appearing on all the top U.S. TV shows - The Smothers Brothers, The Glen Campbell Show (on which Clapton played a brilliant Country, non-fuzz version of \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" - the heavy fuzz original coming from this album.<br /><br />'SIDE NOTE'<br />(You can see Lennon & Jagger crowing about Cream's demise on \\"The Rolling Stones' Rock and Roll Circus\\" DVD - a fairly recent release of a circus-style rock show that was filmed in late-ish 1968, but before Cream's official disbanding. Mick's saying, \\"I hear you've got a new band John\\" [this is during the 'White Album' sessions too]; and John says, \\"Yeah...\\" and proceeds to name the members and mentions Eric as being from \\"the late, great Cream\\" and Lennon & Jagger snigger as he says it. There were rumours that John & Paul held out the carrot of replacing George with Eric - I think that's the only thing that would've made Eric leave his beloved band. Sure, they were sick of touring, but the Beatles had shown that you didn't have to keep touring. Anyway, that's my opinion...even Ginger sang, \\"the bad Captain Madman had told them to stop\\" that year, their next album after this.)<br /><br />Only one slight low point on this album for me - \\"Blue Condition\\", but even it has a kind of magic about it, even with Ginger's almost deadpan, cockney, 'talk-song', and the bar-room piano-only traditional cockney song: \\"Mother's Lament\\" is intentionally hilarious (they all sound pissed - that's 'drunk' for U.S. readers).<br /><br />\\"SWLABR\\" is just so powerful, so exciting, so heavy, and so stimulating that most people don't notice the fairly complex time changes - it just flows so smoothly. (I didn't notice them until I started trying to work it out for my Cream tribute show in 1998.)<br /><br />\\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\" is a classic - the same progression as \\"White Room\\", but predating it by a year.<br /><br />I think this was the most magical album (in a subtle, sophisticated way) from the most magical year in Rock music, with beautiful fuzz tone on Eric's guitars, wicked bass from Jack, and the most original & different rock drumming from Ginger.<br /><br />This was the band that made Eric Clapton internationally famous, and the other two members were equally rated by everyone at the time.

Maybe not one of the more iconic efforts, but definitely warrants a try... the only thing you need to know is there is a very strong spanish anthem sound (as evidenced by the name) that can be over-whelming for those not initiated...

B004NDJHB8|5.0|The Art of Possibility by Rosamund and Benjamin Zander has the potential to tranform´s one's life, expanding our knowledge and mental boundaries and creating the awareness of many tools to deal with what we perceive as daily problems and negative emotions. It's a book to read once and re read it, taking notes to ensure using the \\"practices\\" regularly and timely.    I am extremely grateful to these two fellow human beings for sharing this precious knowledge with all of us. This book transforms an human from the inside making him a better \\"contribution\\" and eventually, part of an improved world. We need people of this caliber to inspire political leadership in coping with the current civilizational changes. Thank you.
B000002UVX|5.0|Well done to whoever transferred the original vinyl to this CD - just as good, only with a little more oomph - just what I like.<br /><br />I often forget Hendrix when I'm playing slightly more ethereal music (from the same time), but when I put him on, I'm always blown away; and this live set from New Year's night, 1969-1970 is so powerful, yet also soulful, and also relaxed, confident, chilled out, and all that from a 3-piece.<br /><br />I do also like earlier Hendrix with Noel Redding on bass, but Billy Cox on this album is confident, interesting, yet never overrides Jimi - who was rightfully always the star, the leader, the focus.  Billy & Buddy Miles provide a perfect foundation for Jimi to be able to soar, for his fancy to take flight through those magic fingers inspired by a beautiful soul within.<br /><br />And I keep hearing new things on it - like this time, (don't know why I missed it before), there's a gorgeous high, sustained note fairly early on in \\"Machine Gun\\" which just blows me away (and I play guitar, & keys & bass).  I THINK it's bent, but it's bent so perfectly, with some amazing 'beat' happening with it, like the 'beat' you get when two strings are slightly out of tune, but it doesn't sound like two strings slightly out of tune, but it's got that kind of 'beat'/recurring-rhythmic-hum to it.<br /><br />And the it's not just the music that's inspiring - for that song Jimi introduces it with \\"I'd like to dedicate this next song to the draggy scene that's goin' on, to all the soldiers fighting in Chicago, Milwaukee, New York...oh yes, and in Vietnam\\" (like an afterthought), but a dedication telling it like it was - the beginnings of a revolution in the U.S. that didn't quite come to fruition (a good thing? Who knows?...<br /><br />...and \\"Who Knows?\\" is the title of the first track - as good a laid-back, but still-funky soul-groove as you'd get from any dedicated soul band - but this is Hendrix: one of the kings (and originators) of heavy rock - heavy rock when it was smarter, more varied, and therefore more powerful, with strong elements of blues & psychedelia - not like the one-dimensional, derivative, dumbed-down stuff that came out of the U.S. (& surprisingly the U.K.) after ca. 1973.<br /><br />There are only two low points for me (most of even my favourite albums have them): Buddy's imitation-guitar-singing starts pretty good, but descends a bit into something like a rooster getting 'goosed' (English term, pun intended).  If he'd kept his 'guitar'-singing soft I think it would've worked.<br /><br />The other low point is \\"We Gotta Live Together\\" [last track, great lyrics] gets a bit weak for me...a bit too much downbeat - almost just thrashing simply to get the crowd going, but hey, it's a live show, and the other 5 killer tracks are more than worth it for me.<br /><br />Speaking of the crowd, what a great crowd - they start to cheer, make noise, etc when Jimi says \\"Happy New Year first of all\\", but immediately quieten down when he adds \\"don't know if we'll have too many more of them though, if we get through this summer\\"; and I love the way the label has kept the same original cover, with the centre-fold photo of some of the crowd in a gallery with a huge altered-U.S. flag: the red-and-white stripes are there, but in place of the stars is a huge peace sign (white on navy-blue).  Yeah, Peace, Cool.  Peace was really threatening to that U.S. Military-Industrial-Complex - threatening enough for them to blow away peaceful student demonstrators at Kent State.<br /><br />Band Of Gypsys is part of the soundtrack of the wonderful American people's long protest against their war-mongering masters.  All my favourite English bands said, \\"we got our best response in the States - they loved us.\\"  There's nothing wrong with the American people, it's only their masters who have a lot to answer for (napalm in the 60s-70s, napalm in the 1990s, and napalm in the 2000s, and a lot of it fell on women & children), and thisis part of that amazing 60s-early 70s music that gave voice to the American people's protest against it.ican people's protest against it.

In other words, don't play Russian Roulette even if your model says you will never lose.

0385737955|3.0|The Maze Runner (book 1)<br />James Dashner<br />YA Dystopian (younger range of YA)<br />Spoiler: None<br />Rating: PG (Some blood, death, etc, but nothing extremely graphic)<br />Coffee Beans: 2.5/5<br /><br />I finished the Maze Runner by James Dashner and have mixed feelings about it. It's a good concept (young boys dumped in a maze with no memories of anything. All they have is a drive to solve the maze and to escape). There's a fair amount of mystery and things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />Now, I know that this is intended for the younger spectrum of the YA crowd, but I still felt like it could have been developed more to hold the reader's attention better. The characters were a little flat and clich&eacute; for me to really get into and enjoy. Granted, there were some twists and turns I didn't see coming, I wasn't addicted to this book like others I have been to in the past, and it wasn't until the very end that I was like, \\"Whoa. That's cool!\\" when Dashner really caught my attention.<br /><br />I didn't have the intention to pick up the second book in the series (Scorch Trials), but when those last few pages hit, that's when I got invested in the story and in the characters. Maybe book two will be better than book one, but do I have the motivation to pick it up and the time to invest in it when I have so many other great ones that are demanding my time? Probably not.<br /><br />Pick it up and decide for yourself, but for me, it was just...meh.<br /><br />[...]

B0058A119G|5.0|I am not sure whether those posting negative reviews, criticizing the husky-voiced singer coming through the speaker, have been listening to the same CD as I.  Barbra Streisand, a woman who soon will have spent seven decades on earth, five of them entertaining us better that any of her contemporaries before, during or since, has released yet another CD that showcases her voice in the same beautiful way that she has for fifty years.  I am not sure whether the negative reviews (a small fraction compared to the superlatives) reflect ageism or personal attacks on Barbra herself.  Whatever the case, this reviewer and long-time fan urges anyone who has forgotten what beautiful, melodious, and truly poetic music is all about to rush out and grab What Matters Most.    As opposed to those who have reported a husky-voiced singer, Streisand sounds more beautiful than she ever has.  It seems that she is only improving with age.  While listening to the CD, I kept thinking that Streisand still holds those notes and reaches those instrument-sounding vocals that have made her voice a national treasure.  Additionally, during certain numbers like Nice n Easy and That Face, she shows that she can jazz it up with the best of them.  I would love her to release a mid to up-tempo CD off all classic jazz tunes.  Let's face it--she is Barbra Streisand.  Not only can she do whatever she pleases, but she can also do it in a way that she re-sets the bar.  You still got it, girl!  The only thing that I miss about her earlier albums is the free and easy style of her youth; perhaps What Matters Most is a bit over-produced.  But, Streisand is no longer a kid; she can sing these lyrics while personally feeling each word.  I would rather a slightly over-produced Streisand than no Streisand at all.    Oh, and to all those who erroneously believe that Streisand's voice is not what it used to be--I have seen her live in concert where there are no technicians altering her voice.  That voice in person isthat same beautiful voice that was recorded for What Matters Most.

B000T2PRF2|4.0|As part of music industry's regular practice, this stylish cover shot is cropped to show  only half the singer's face. I'm wondering what they are trying to say.    Let's get down to brass tacks. If you want more bang for your buck, The Very Best Of Diana Krall Deluxe Edition is the way to go.    This pleasant set features 15 selections from Love Scenes, All For You, When I Look In Your Eyes, The Look Of Love, Live In Paris, The Girl In The Other Room, and From This Moment On.    Look out for three unreleased tracks. You Go To My Head and Only The Lonely taken from Look Of Love sessions. The third being The Heart Of Saturday Night from The Girl In The Other Room sessions.    If you are looking for a comprehensive DVD collection, this one will disappoint as only nine videos are included. But if you view it as an add-on to the CD then it's a bonus. Songs NOT on the CD are here on the DVD. Narrow Daylight, Temptation, Almost Blue, Abandoned Masquerade, The Girl In The Other Room and What Are You Doing New Year's Eve. The DVD is a balanced mix of music videos, studio and live performances.    This compilation really picked the best cuts from Diana Krall's catalogue, creating that surreal, gentle Bossa Nova swing, making this a great buy.
B004ULNJF8|4.0|Blitz was a very entertaining film and had an old school feel to it very much like an old Charles Bronson revenge flick but with a fresh take.<br />Jason Statham plays 'Brant' a bad a** cop with not many if any limits when executing justice and he teams up with Paddy Considine 'Nash' who is a gay cop who has somewhat of a sordid past.The two get on well together after the gay ice is broken.They of course have to throw in a couple of cracks about Nash's sexuality such as phoofer and pillow biter.Once the ice is broken and trust established between Nash and Brant the gay thing doesn't come back up and he's treated as he should be ,a good cop,thankfully.<br />They are on the trail of a brutal cop killer and there are a few surprises thrown in along the way.I really liked it and thought the ensemble cast was excellent.The villain is a particularly dislikeable character and you will be glad you're on the hunt 'via this movie' with the detectives. Somewhat your typical Statham fare but much more interesting than some. two thumbs up.
B001W79MBI|5.0|I love how Sword of the Stranger were able to make me  hold my breath as they swing their swords at each other.  Even though the ending left us audiences to interpret of what happened....yah =D  It would keep us sitting on our butts until the movie ends.
0007270968|3.0|I didn't really want to have to read through an entire biography, so I thought this might be just my thing.  Unfortunately, it was a bit too short.  Felt like there was waaaaaaaay too much missing or skimmed over.  It definitely did put Gordon Ramsay in a new light for me.  I'll probably pick up a proper biography at some point, though this was an okay starting point.  Considering the length, I don't think it was value for money at all.  I read it in less than 2 hours.  There are only about 80 pages, and the print is quite large.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Let me start this by stating that i'm a huge Tarantino fan!He is an absolute genious and a landmark in filmaking..But he was at his best in the 90's with Reservoir Dogs,True Romance(writer),and my favorite of the 3 Jackie Brown..Then he went off the map for almost 6 years and then Kill Bill hit the scene,although a great movie it was very different from his other films then the sequel followed and it was a kind of a miss.Kill Bill was really stacked with action,blood,and some cool anime sequences but it had nothing on his 90's takeover.Kill Bill vol 2 was kind of slow and just not as good as the first and complete crap compared to his early stuff..Then there was Death Proof which was an hour and a half long guilty pleasure of a movie.Just mindless,plotless,sleazy fun,But a good movie it really was not..  So little to say I was almost scared that Tarantino kinda lost his touch,Then this brilliant absolutely brilliant film known as Inglorious Basterd's came to my attention..This is Tarantino at his best..The dialogue,the set pieces,the story,the cast everything is perfect in this movie..Brad Pitt is at the top of his game,not since Fight Club as he just owned a part like he owns Aldo Raines,and Christopher Waltz is just flat out sick,so good at playin the SS Colonel Hans The Jewhunter that he should have just been given is award at the begining of the cerimoney because there was no way anyone was gonna top his performance.I never though I could see a movie where ther is so much language change,french,german,english and its all so beleivable,and well spoken by all the actors that this film feels so real and authentic it almost feel's like your there with them all..This is Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction and in my opinion his best work of all time,it's just so good i'm having trouble putting it into words..Lets just say it's got lots of bloody violence,nazi scalping,revenge,double crossing,Brad Pitt snorting speed and doing his whole accent thing which in my opinion he still does better then anyone,one of the most charming and all around frightening villians ever created and lots of fun alternate history..Not one second of this movie is boring,and for all of you Tarantino haters out there..Clue in,grow a brain and if you can't handle his style stick with you Transformers and kung fu panda's because you odviously got the mind of a child and his movies are for big people that know good movies and true talent..So that being said Inglorious Basterds is Tarantino's finest work and if your a fan then you will love this..Do enjoy...
B002ZG98G4|4.0|\\"Morning Glory\\" (2010) is directed by Roger Michell (Changing Lanes, Venus, Notting Hill).  The film is about a young tv show producer, Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams), who gets a call from a national network to produce a morning show called Daybreak. This morning show is in a shambles with one producer being fired after another but Becky is determined to make things work, and she even brings in a stubborn old news anchor played by Harrison Ford, whom she has always admired, to try and raise the ratings for the show. But initially this results in what seems like a downward spiral for this 40 year old show as there is immediate conflict with the current morning anchor (Diane Keaton). This wonderfully uplifting movie reveals how a positively motivated person can affect change for the better to those around them.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I may not be a music teacher, or even a pro when it comes to producing music or making electronics. I can't tell you anything about the parts in this thing or exactly why they sound like they do.<br /><br />What I do know? These headphones are the greatest thing I have ever purchased. Period.<br /><br />I have never been so astounded by quality of sound in my life. I was bracing myself for a lot of hype and no delivery, but these things have met and exceeded my expectations as a user. The first thing I did when I took them out of the box was plug them into my computer, throw on some music with a strong section of trumpets (the instrument I play and a sore spot that can't be properly played on any of my other headphones), and cross my fingers. When I had my volume maxed, I couldn't notice any crackling or distortion of any type, and it was almost as if I had the horns in the room with me! These are simply the only set of headphones I will ever purchase in the future, for as long as Sony makes them.<br /><br />The other thing that these do which other headphones don't is stay comfortable. I have big ears, so most sets push them against my head, discouraging long listening sessions. These fit like a dream, adjustment was easy, and they were incredibly soft as well.<br /><br />For an avid music listener, I cannot recommend these highly enough.
B000209ZAE|2.0|My Proxxon Rotary Tool stand came last night.  My wife wanted something to drill glass, and after reading the reviews here, it seemed the best choice.<br /><br />Based on my experience, I'm elevating my rating to two stars only because I was able to modify it to make it usable - sort-of.<br /><br />Opening the box, the parts were loose in the box, they had been in a plastic bag, but worked their way out thru a tear.  Parts were also loose or had fallen off the stand.  There was not even a simple instruction manual to tell you how to put it back together, but it was simple enough to figure out, except for one thing.<br /><br />The vertical post had what appeared to be a set screw to hold it in place, but it had no head or recess and was screwed in flush.  It took me a few minutes to see that the set screw was in backwards with the head inside against the post!  I was able to work a allen wrench inside the post hole and turn the set screw out enough so that I could remove it the rest of the way with my fingers.  Then, properly installed, I was able to secure the vertical post.(I wish that had been one of the parts to fall off during shipping!)<br /><br />After finding where all the parts went that had fallen off during shipping, and getting it assembled, I pulled the handle down, and the drill kicked about 0.2 inches to the right as soon as I started moving it. It came down stiffly with spots that were binding. It had a lot of side play even when pulled completely down, at least 0.2 inches, totally unaceptable!<br /><br />I adjusted and re-adjusted all the screws to no avail.  Then I discovered the problem, a brass bushing guides the head as it moves downward, sliding down a flimsy post that could be easily bent, but looked reasonably straight.  The bushing was floating in a fork assembley very losely which is where the play appeared to be occuring.  I disassembled the head and took the fork out to my vise and squeezed it closed until it snapped tightly onto the brass bushing.  This is where I discovered that the bushing itself had a very sloppy fit and was far too loose on the guide post.  Nothing could be done about that but to get a new post or a new bushing that fit properly, and there was no warranty or instructions on how to request a new one, not even a address on the box.<br /><br />I then reassembled the stand, and found that almost all the side to side play was gone, there was still too much due to the loose bushing, but I deemed it usable.<br /><br />To summarize, the QC is poor to non-existent, and the design is just plain quirky.<br /><br />I'd return it for another, but would not have hopes of finding the next one to be any better.<br /><br />No warranty sheet (I believe this violates US consumer law) no instructions, I'd would have passed it by if I'd known. Note, after finding the Proxxon website, I did find the information, and will ask them about a replacement bushing, the guide post looks to be pressed into place.  I'll see what happens.that the bushing itself had a very sloppy fit and was far too loose on the guide post.

B000001C6M|5.0|That metal show has told people that anything before RIB is garbage because of production. Slayers 1st 2 full length Lps are masterpieces (so is Haunting The Chapel EP). Show No Mercy has Tom singing at his best, he does some pretty cool hellish sounding screams that send chills up the spine. Lots of the riffs here, are very Priest/Maiden/NWOBHM sounding with a razor \\"SLAYER\\" sharp edge. The drum tracks are perfect, just picture Metallica's Kill em All drumming but tighter and better, with a dark jungle/voodoo vibe. If you are at all a fan of Metallica's Kill em all, or any old school metal, you will like every song on this LP. The 1st few tracks of show no mercy are all thrash anthems, but the last part of the albums is where it gets really good! Metalstorm/Face the Slayer is one of the Slayer epics recorded that nobody knows about, they should play this one live. Tormenter is another lost SLayer gem, that never gets played live! Once your done with this cd, pick up Hell Awaits. Slayers 1st 6 Lps are all good heavy metal music. Eddy Trunk and the d-bags on that metal show are too busy sucking the mainstreams balls with slash and sammy hagar, to even know what the heck they are talking about.

0062060554|4.0|In the opening page of \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" protagonist Christine awakens in a bed beside a man that she doesn't recognize in a room that she's unfamiliar with. The man says he's her husband, that they've been married for years and that she suffers from a persistent amnesia which prevents her from remembering anything once she falls asleep. Apparently, she's been repeating this morning ritual of explanation for years, each day as if for the first time. The premise for this quick-reading mystery is simple enough. How does someone who can't remember anything for more than 24 hours piece together the truths of her life? Quite a conundrum and an intriguing premise for a story.<br /><br />The answer to Christine's problem has a somewhat simple solution with a rather tricky execution: keep a journal...but don't let the journal's existence be discovered by anyone that might be feeding false information. Not so easy for an amnesiac. Before I Go To Sleep traces the evolution of Christine's journal as she learns new facts and attempts to piece them together, all the while essentially starting from Square One each morning.<br /><br />The tension comes from vague suspicions, fragmented events half-remembered and hints of subterfuge. Are the people surrounding Christine telling the truth? Are they hiding things from her? If so, why? What were the circumstances surrounding the accident which left her with a non-functioning memory? Author S.J. Watson reveals details and clues in small drops; just enough to keep you guessing and just quickly enough to keep you hooked. One might guess the conclusion prematurely if not for Watson's constant introduction of doubts and misdirection. How reliable are Christine's faculties? Can she even believe what she's written in her journal? Who stands to gain from lying to her, if anyone?<br /><br />Despite some repetitious scenes (almost unavoidable for a character with Christine's circadian memory deficit) this is a solid and satisfying mystery. The pay off is a little pat, but sometimes its perfectly acceptable to have a neatly wrapped up tale.e pat, but sometimes its perfectly acceptable to have a neatly wrapped up tale.
0345529057|4.0|I'm very happy with my purchase, mainly because of the price, but there are some remarks, nothing crucial though:  - First and Foremost: ~80 pages from A storm of swords are missing. They repeat ~80 pages from previous chapters.  - The ink is easy to wipe off, but if you don't try to do it there won't be any issues.  - The fonts are small, but I guess that's not really an issue, keeping in mind that it's a boxed set at a very reasonable price.
067144901X|5.0|My 11-month-old loves this book.  I've been reading it to him for several months.  He watches your mouth while you make the animal sounds, and always enjoys it.
0307272702|5.0|When I first heard about Atkins around 2003 (I know it's not new, but it was new to me then), I never really bought into it. I didn't need to lose any weight, and I thought all the protein and grease would be bad for your heart and liver/kidneys. I didn't read the book, that was just my gut reaction.    Now, I'm looking down the barrel of middle age, and I've got a little bit of weight to lose, 20 pounds or so. I have to say, calorie restriction REALLY SUCKS! I can't imagine doing that for the rest of my life. You can help yourself by choosing foods that go a long way (aren't calorie dense), but I still am hungry for a portion of the day.    I was really happy to read this book, because it goes into great detail about the science of weight loss. It is very factual and makes a LOT of sense. Yes, we in America can be a bit undisciplined at times. But I never believed that, as a whole, we are so undisciplined that we can have the levels of obesity and diabetes that we're seeing today. This author points out that these problems are results of insulin imbalance. He shows how insulin affects fat gain and distribution, how genetics affects how sensitive we are to insulin, and then how carbs in turn can affect insulin.    His take is that we can't really help our genetic predisposition to either being insulin sensitive or insensitive. But we can very much control how much we allow our insulin to be affected by carbs. For this reason, almost everyone should be able to see some improvement on a low carb diet, even if you don't end up as thin as magazines tell you you should be (it's going to be up to your insulin sensitivity at some point).    I love not being hungry. I love that I can focus on just the parts that are making me fat, instead of starving everything. Fat is really satiating.    I would definitely recommend reading this book to get a good understanding of how your body actually works.
0316067938|1.0|Okay let me start off by explaining what got me to this point. I was pretty obsessed with twilight when it came out. People actually laughed at me when I told them how much I loved this book about a human and vampire in love. But I pushed through the hate and jumped up and down when I saw a second book was coming out the next year. The second one took my breath away. I loved the (almost) nonexistent Edward and the whole wolf pack storyline. It had really great tension and I loved the ending. I wish someone had told me to stop there. Now Eclipse wasn't horrible, but I thought Edward's possessiveness was bordering on psychotic. Anyway Eclipse ends with Bella and Edward engaged, and everything looking up for them. So STOP! It's over!!! Please if anyone reads this before deciding to read Breaking Dawn, don't read it! Don't! I'm serious. This book ruined any love I had for this series. I now can't even think of this book without feeling an immense amount of shame for once calling myself a fan.     Okay so now let me begin with just how awful and horrendous and hurtful this book truly is: (SPOILER)     The biggest issue I have with this book is there is no sacrifice! Bella gets everything without any sacrifice or conflict at all. She gets Edward and his baby, keeps her father, joins the Cullens, becomes a vampire, gets a beautiful house, gets an awesome power, and still gets Jacob.     The whole character and relationship of Jacob with Bella is completely belittled with his imprinting on her baby. I can't even say this out loud to anyone for fear of being laughed at. Bella's birthing of Renesme was disgusting. Sheesh! That was totally unnecessary and made me hate their baby before I even met her. But I could live with a creepy baby. What I cannot live with is Jacob imprinting on it. Horrible! When it happened I think I dropped the book and walked away for hours before I could bring myself to pick it up again. At that moment I lost any love, respect, or silly infatuation Iever had for this series and I still have no respect for what Meyer did to my favorite character in a sea of stupid \\"beautiful\\" vampires.     There was literally no plot in this book.     Bella gets an awesome power that protects everyone and everything, so that when evil vampires come to kill her baby she just puts up her shield and they all give up. What?! And conveniently there was another half-vampire already in existence and Alice found it! Yippee! That wasn't even necessary at all!     Another thing that truly bothered me was the introduction of like 100 characters in the last 100 pages that we're supposed to care about. I just started skimming any parts they were in to get to the (nonexistent) action.     A lot of people say this reads like a fanfiction, but I think it's even worse than that. I've read some fanfic and I can think of ten stories at the top of my head that had more plot, better angst, and more respect for its characters than this \\"book.\\"     I think the one part that sums up just how bad and truly painful this reading experience was for me is when Edward calls Jacob \\"son.\\" This is supposed to be a beautiful moment of two people reconciling, but just thinking about it now makes me want to laugh.     I actually liked the last two pages. It was fluffy and cute, but by no means could it make up for the rest of the 400 pages of this monstrosity. I can't really explain how truly sad this book made me.     So I recommend you stay away from this book because even now 3 years later, I'm still angry about it. I say read the first 2 as those are fun reads. If you must read the third, but dear God pretend there isn't even a fourth novel and picture for yourself how it all ends and write it into a fanfiction. Trust me, it will be a thousand times better than this book.

B0046ZG2VG|5.0|This is a welcome replacement for the discontinued Polaroid 600 film. I recommend it highly and am satisfied with its performance.
B003JTH1FQ|5.0|If you look at the credits you'll see the script was based on the well researched non-fiction book \\"Imperial Life in the Emerald City\\" by Rajiv Chandrasekaran (who is listed as a co-writer of the screenplay for the film). The truth is always too liberal apparently (as are reviews from soldiers actually there). Nobody even now wants to hear about the atrocities on BOTH sides of WW2 (incendiary firebombing civilians in non-military targets in Dresden and Japan... and Vietnam), only how evil the OTHER guys were.        Like it or not this film is extremely faithful to the truth. No wonder it wasn't popular. The Neocon's (well named actually, world class con artists), saw and believed only what fit their preconceived desire to feed the military industrial complex (re: Halliburton, just coincidentally formerly run by Dick Cheney). Believed is too generous... they cynically thought they could get away with it, and stupidly thought no one would notice or care. Maybe not so stupid either as it turns out. What, we're in a war? Their most brilliant move was to not institute a draft. That much WAS learned from Vietnam... if upper and middle class kids (and their parents and grandparents) have to face the real consequences of following their leaders idiotic (possibly criminal) decisions, there might be an actual (and sustained) protest.       False \\"intelligence\\" (an oxymoron ... emphasis on moron), trumped up and never vetted came from a handful of expat Iraqis with their own agenda (in particular a single individual, \\"Curveball\\"), gave our \\"leaders\\" the plausible excuse ... and the fleets of Young Republican Bushie loyalists from the likes of Oral Roberts University were put in charge of post-invasion policies rather than those with middle eastern expertise, gave us the resulting mess. All were screened on their views of Roe vs Wade... one such a 24 year old ORU grad with zero financial training put in charge of \\"rebuilding\\" the Iraq stock market. Political partisanshipwas the primary source for the idiotic decisions that led to fueling anarchy, looting and creating a MASSIVE new insurgency and generations of motivated new terrorists. Ah but we're safer now, right? Billions to contractors that accomplished nothing, except corruption... and electrocuting dozens of American kids in their showers.        9 years and nearly 5000 lost American youth and a vast unfunded treasure wasted in Iraq (with Afghanistan still going strong), over 100,000 casualties now struggling for the oft promised help at home and getting their GI Bill college grants ripped off by online for-profit fly by night \\"colleges\\". Oh, also... let's not forget upwards of 500,000 dead local innocents. A body count ratio we'd have been be proud of during Vietnam. Too bad we didn't learn anything from that fiasco.         Yup... the truth is indeed \\"Liberal\\" it seems. Can't risk that... certainly isn't particularly entertaining is it. By all means, rent or buy \\"The Patriot\\" if you want patriotic pap and our mythological \\"Christian\\" ethic of treating our neighbors as ourselves. That kind of \\"Golden Rule\\" unfortunately (and literally) doesn't pay dividends.       Oh, and by the way... remember, it's all Obama's fault.

0062112430|2.0|If you've been on the internet for any length of time you've probably heard the phrase `basic bitch'. If you haven't, the urban dictionary defines it as \\"one who has no personality; dull and irrelevant\\".     That is exactly what this book is, it's a basic book. It's trying to ride the tide of popularity that dystopian YA novels have been receiving recently, and it just fails in comparison. The idea is very interesting (government mandated lobotomies) but it just fails in execution, not unlike another dystopia I read recently *cough*Bumped*cough*.     This book suffered from poor world building issues, that raised some questions but never answer them. Why did the government choose love instead of hate, what exactly happened to make electricity and fuel scarce, if you don't allow population trade between cities why is there no restriction on the population growth? Writers really do need to have a reason for their dystopias other than \\"Eh, some scientist dude fixed people of love, and they lined up out the door for this cure. So now we force it on everybody because.\\"     On the plus side, the writing was well done, so even though I had issues with the book, I still wanted to keep reading to find out what happened. Lena really did feel like a stupid-in-love 17 year old, and her voice was totally believable. Alex was your typical post-Twilight perfect boy with a little Invalid bad boy edge. Hana was an awesome friend who went through as much (if not more) character growth as the main character. I have to say I much preferred the Lena-Hana relationship compared to the Lena-Alex one. On the whole, it was an enjoyable read, but I won't be reading the next two in this series.    Recommend for readers who like taylor swift and think their love is so perfect and pure it's doomed to fail and they will write a love song about it.
0143038419|1.0|Not even close!  I was so excited to read this book.  But even as I *trudged* through Italy, I knew I wouldn't, couldn't finish it.  I think i gave up somewhere in India, so i have no idea what happened in Indonesia, and i don't even care.  There are sooooooo many more, much better written, literary masterpieces out there.  Why would I want to spend my precious time on this drivel?  Self-serving, self-involved and self-important...that's how this author comes across in this book.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Ok, I gave this movie a 2/5 simply because whilst the graphics were amazing 5/5, the plot was a -1/5. You know that you are in trouble when the pornographic parody of your movie has more of a plot than the actual movie does. Also, he stole a TON of star wars sounds and Halo vehicles.<br />Spoiler<br />He turns into his avatar. That is it, that is the entire movie.

1451629184|2.0|I am so, so saddened by what Jacyee had to go through. I understand this book may have been part of her healing process and I commend her for writing it so bravely.     But this is not a book I could finish. I was sick part of the way through at the graphic detailing of the sexual abuse. I don't know how anyone could finish it. It's heartbreaking to know she actually lived this - but I know enough of her story to be ok with not being able to relive it through the book.

The heavyweights of WW2 are ALL here and with their inside commentaries! The heavyweights and the complete insiders heretofore unheard of....people to the right of Churchill, Roosevelt and Hitler to name just a few! And Hitlers' people will astonish you! They didn't film it like this before then, and they CAN'T now....as all are dead...this is, was, and will always remain the finest of its' kind of ALL time and an absolute essential if you are to study WW2....buy it, you will not regeret it even for a second...and your childrens children should and will watch this...be certain of it.

B0038BBA4I|4.0|I could throw a bunch of words around to try and tell you how good I think this album is, but I don't have the vocabulary to describe the experience of hearing (finally) something new and awe inspiring. After the been-there-heard-that feel of Radiohead's King of Limbs, my faith in the art of making a complete, cohesive album was shaken.  Nobody even tries anymore in the era of the single song download.  But this whole album seems to be about becoming the best selves that we can be and is set to vocals and arrangement that go from simple and quiet to swelling, complex and chill inducing.     It's some of the best music that I've heard in a long time, and where did I hear about Mumford & Sons? On the *gasp* radio.  Yeah, I know...that stodgy old, pooping itself, living-on-life-support format actually led me to something good.  I cannot recommend this album highly enough.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|My only complaint would be that the on. Screen keyboard doesn't seem to fit my giant meat hands.<br /><br />AWESOME APP!!!! :-)

The melodies and instrumentals seem fresh & exciting, while at the same time like songs you've known & loved your whole life. M&S are masters of swelling, emotional, technically incredible music. The CD is literally stuck in my CD player because I refuse to take it out. I can't recommend this album enough- I'm really looking forward to the next one!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I purchased this on Kindle after reading all the great reviews it received and was very disappointed.  The storyline is really weak and the characters do not endear themselves to the reader.  Wished I had not wasted my time or money on this book.

1594744769|5.0|I'm not going to give you a run through on the story, I feel either you will be intrigued enough with the title to either pick it up or not.   I will say that the writing is excellent, I believe it isn't easy to write so well that it flows and you don't come to a complete halt while reading because something doesn't make sense or the editing is off.  Ransome Riggs is an excellent writer and an imaginative storyteller.  That said, the use of the photographs is what puts this book over the top for me.  Just flipping through, the photos are off putting and wondrous.  But building a story around them is genius.  It adds so much and even the breaks in the story to study the pictures did not interrupt the flow of the story for me, in fact I found them creepy and perfect.  I don't know how this book looks on a kindle, I believe it may take something away from the story.  I would suggest the hardcover for this read.  It makes all the difference.
0545128285|3.0|I guess I expected a greater deal of insight into Dumbledore's life through his interpretations of these stories. It is a rather short book, but I am sure it accomplished what J.K. intended for it to be.
B003C1SPX8|4.0|Yes, the video is not up to snuff for a Blu-ray, or even just a plain ol' DVD release, but the sound quality is truly stunning.  Like the mix of the refurbished Brothers in Arms CD/DVD Audio, it presents the music in such a fashion wherein details come out that couldn't possibly have on earlier versions.<br /><br />The video is rather sub-standard, to say the least.  The initial shots of the band playing pool are, really, quite shocking in terms of their graininess.  With technology that could make films from fifty years ago look pristine, I'm not sure why something couldn't have been done to improve the quality of something filmed in '84.<br /><br />That being said, however, as other reviewers have pointed out, the music is nearly flawless.  \\"Tunnel of Love\\" is breathtaking in its scope and depth, and the version of \\"Sultans of Swing\\" is arguably the finest yet committed to tape.  The arrangements of all the songs are precise and executed brilliantly by not only Mark Knopfler, but by all the excellent folks he assembled to dress up his magnificent songs.<br /><br />It's worth the money, whether on Blu-ray or otherwise.  Where the video may disappoint, the audio will infinitely satisfy.

0679759328|3.0|Edith Hope is vacationing at a sedate Swiss hotel, waiting from some sort of scandal to die down.  Does it have to do with her affair with a married man?  She writes romance novels under a pseudonym and therefore remains anonymous to the other guests who are fans of her work but not opposed to voicing the occasional criticism.  One gentleman there is on to her, and he strikes up a friendship with Edith, who is intrigued by a very wealthy mother/daughter pair.  Another woman, with an eating disorder and a small dog to help disguise it, seeks out Edith's company also.  For someone trying to keep to herself and complete her next novel, Edith is somewhat in demand and becomes privy to all sorts of gossip and liaisons.  As it turns out, she is too distracted/dispressed to write anything but letters to her lover that she may or may not be mailing.  This is one of those slow-moving, nuanced and very British novels, with a spinster heroine and a skeleton in the closet, which is not scandalous at all by American standards.  Ultimately, Edith has a decision to make--return home and make amends for her past behavior, or seize an opportunity that's not all that appealing but has its advantages.  A chance observation serves as a wake-up call, clarifying her options and helping her realize what is important to her.  The book feels like it belongs on a live stage, with its confined setting and stifling group of characters, and was apparently adapted as a play for television.
B005IEWT8E|5.0|Wow, some really good quotes in this episode.  \\"I'm not in danger Skylar White, I am the danger\\"; something close to that.  I was getting kind of worried for the series as the previous episodes were kind of dragging, but this episode brings back the sense of impending danger and explains where the main story line is going.  I'm finally starting to feel excited about where the season is heading and can't wait for the next episode.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Though I had not seen this in decades, I wanted to get it so that I could watch it with my kids.  For the most part, if they can sit through them, they jokingly tolerate my efforts to infuse some culture into their daily consumption of electronic media.  But this film held their attention and they had plenty of questions about it.  I regard this as a mini-triumph, but then, it is easier to do with a film that is this good.<br /><br />For myself, it was also an almost completely new viewing experience:  this time, rather than a personal history about the loss of love, I saw it from an historical perspective that I lacked as a youth.  In that way, with the overt references to WR Hearst - the rise of yellow journalism, overt meddling in politics and even international relations, and the manufacture of news - it was doubly fascinating for all of us.<br /><br />Still, the sadness of Kane's plight comes through with perfect clarity, indeed as perfect drama.  It utterly riveted me, was even painful to watch most of the time.  I even liked the level of psychological depth in all the characters.  Not to exaggerate, but I found it as complex an experience as one would expect from Shakespeare.  It is that good, even after 70 years.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
0425241505|5.0|This book was vastly entertaining. If you are into alpha males and smart-ass heroine, then this book is for you! I thought the ending could have been better, but overall, a very good book. Can't wait for the next one.
B000UD0ESA|2.0|I love the movie, let's get that right up front. The fact that the DVD pack came with the documentary was gravy, but definitely a plus. Now I realize that I was getting the DVD for a good price and that corners might be cut somewhere, however it was somewhat telling that when I first opened the plastic case housing the discs, the actual plastic DVD case tore as if it were paper! No big deal, it's just a case, right? So I was able to watch the movie and loved it. However, the second DVD (the one with the documentary) would not play. After examining it, it definitely appears to be faulty as the physical DVD appears cloudy. I tried the disc in multiple players without luck.     While I am still happy to own the movie, I would be hesitant to order from the same supplier a second time not knowing where they source their movies.
B0058A119G|5.0|I admit that I was skeptical.<br /><br />I wasn't one of the Streisand acolytes who went crazy over Love Is The Answer. I, like most folks, enjoys the quieter, simpler, quartet versions contained on the second disc. The first disc was over-produced, and Streisand seemed to be pushing herself in an over deliberate, over planned, over perfectionist manner. So when What Matters Most was announced, I thought the somewhat older voice would sound quite past it's peak.<br /><br />I was wrong. Streisand sounds magnificent. First of all, she isn't pushing herself as hard as she did in Love Is The Answer. Streisand actually sounds relaxed, yet in full control of her magnificent instrument. There are notes that sound a little scratchy. But like the fine burnished finish on a beloved work of art, this is the aged patina of a musical life that adds texture and beauty to the timbre of Streisand's voice. Most of Streisand's high end is still there. None of it sounds digitally augmented. It remains, quite simply, a voice that thrills.<br /><br />Sinatra had Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen. Streisand has Alan and Marilyn Bergman, and a group of extraordinary musical collaborators. The couple's lyrics/songs fit Streisand like a glove. From the stunning acapella opening for The Windmills Of Your Mind (in itself an act of bravura musicianship) through the stunning Solitary Moonn, to the familiar Nice'n'Easy - the disc is a wonderful introduction and re-introduction to some of the most finely crafted songs in the American Songbook. When you get to the song That Face, and you hear that famous little laugh in that voice singing That Face - well, it simply doesn't get any better than that. That Face swings - naturally, casually, nice'n'easily. S'wonderful.<br /><br />The deluxe version has a second disc with some of the older Bergman songs known to Streisnad fans - The Way We Are, You Don't Bring Me Flowers - as well as some other older songs that are not as familiar. In the overall context of this double disc set, they sound vibrant, fresh, and vital. Again. But I'll state a heresy - I think Streisand's voice is better now. (OK - read that with a small grain of salt - A Piece OF Sky, which closes the second disc, may be a little kitschy, but it is still capable of giving me goosebumps.) No, the voice is not as flexible, not as precise - there are less acrobatics.  But I think that is all for the best. Where there was acrobatic soaring, there is now a beautifully burnished timbre. Listen to the closing eponymous song on disc one - What Matters Most. Streisand sings it with extraordinary beauty. It is subtle and sublime. It is sung by a woman who has live long enough to truly discover the meaning of the song.<br /><br />Look- I will always consider The Broadway Album to be the peak of Streisand's career. Some of the edits are obvious, and talk about being over-produced - oy! But that CD is an extraordinary listening experience - a performance by a true broadway baby.<br /><br />If you're worrying about whether or not Streisand will ever be able to scale such heights again - don't waste your time. It's a point in time that can never be re-captured. But if you're concerned about purchasing this disc, fearing that Streisand has become a worn cliche, or a woman who has become so wrapped up in her Liberal causes that she has lost touch with her muse, don't hesitate. Buy it. What Matters Most is a solidly musical experience that reflects a lot of solid musical work by one of America's premier entertainers. Audiophiles should know that the production is beautiful - almost \\"analogue\\" in sound. Fine soundstage, solid focussed bass, and a voice that is captured and framed with slight reverberation.<br /><br />I know I've been a bit hyperbolic in my praise, but it is heartfelt. This is solid musicianship - not some knock-one-more-disc-out. What Matters Most may go down as one of the finest vocal career capstones in the history of recorded popular song.<br /><br/>Or then again, there may be one more album to come......

B004GYY714|4.0|Some of the stations come in with a great deal of static which make even listening to them difficult. I sometime enjoy talk radion and there is a great deal of echo in the quality of the sound. I think the application is easy to use and has a great deal of variety. I think there could be more broad attention on local stations and popular stations being added to the application. Overall I think you will enjoy the application it brings radio back to the old transistor models to date myself and available on your smart phone. I think is a good nice to have try it.

0375842209|5.0|Nothing says Merry Christmas like having your heart torn out and stomped on by some red and black-wearing pus hole. You know, for whatever reason, I don't know why, I'm irrevocably drawn to books taking place during World War II, more specifically the European Theater and many times, the Jewish plight and what they went through. I spent a semester researching concentration camps for a paper for a class called Jewish Literature. Talk about depression. And I mean verifiable. Do you now they found 3 tons of human hair at Auschwitz when it was liberated? 3 tons. 6,000 pounds. Can you even imagine how much, visually, that is? And Dachau is a constant presence in this book as the town, Molching (Mol-king) is a walk (they don't say how far but far enough for the starving Jews they march through the town) down the street. Close enough to smell, that's for sure.    But this book offers a different perspective. Liesel is the daughter of a Communist, or a suspected Communist, that's sent away to live with some foster parents because her mother is being taken away. Her brother was supposed to go with her but he didn't survive the trip, however he does make a posthumous appearance a couple of times in order to guide Liesel on her way. It's in this foster home that Liesel grows up a good blonde German, except she has brown eyes. She's halfway to Aryan but if push came to shove, it wouldn't be enough.    Her Mama (foster mother) is a bulldozer but her Papa (also foster) is the loving, caring, consoling parent in her life. He's the father she never had and offers her the helping hand that she never had. The boy next door, Rudy, becomes her best friend but she loses him all too quickly. And her family too. For a girl so young she certainly loses so much. But in the end she gains back something so intensely important to her that it could rightly heal the wounds that have been torn in her psyche for years. It's because of this regained entity that she ends up surviving, after all. Sheowes so much.    What I liked most was how the third person omniscient narrator was Death. And he isn't some dude in a black robe swinging a scythe. Or so he says. But it offers such an amazing and clear perspective of what's going on not only with Liesel but all around her that it just sucks you in. All of these World War II stories are about how death affects life. Well how about how life affects Death? He is, after all, haunted by humans. And he tells a damn good story too, that's for sure. And he's not subtle either. When he alludes to something, it's very blatant but it doesn't ruin anything. It just prepares you for what's coming.    Even for its length, even for how long it took me to read it (longer than normal, a little more than a week), I didn't want to put it down. The story builds up at the end to the prologue at the beginning and you can't help but want to know what happens in between to get to that point. What's the deal with the Jesse Owens incident? What's with the kiss? What is with Liesel's compulsive kleptomania?    The Nazi stronghold isn't the dominating force of this story but it fuels it. Liesel is where she is because of the Nazis. She becomes the person that she does because of the Nazis. She writes because of the Nazis. Without them, would Death have even taken an interest in her? Would he even want to tell her story? Would she even have a story without the Nazis?    And, again, it's a damn good story. It's coming of age in Hell. True to form Hell. Where the wrong eye color can get you kidnapped. Where reading can get you in a camp. Where not joining the right (or, well, Reich) party can get you shipped off to die. Where you lose everything that you've ever loved, even, at times, the words that held you together. Teens today think they have it tough. Right.    If you like stories set during World War II, if you want to read about a girl with such strength and emotion that it'll tear your heart out, if you want a good cry, read this book.It certainly won't disappoint.
B0058A119G|1.0|As probably Barbra's biggest fan I can hardly find the words to say what a crushing let-down this CD is. My boyfriend gifted me, knowing what a fan I am, and I was so pleased that he chose such a personal gift. But when he played it my jaw dropped. I thought they had put the wrong CD in the package at the factory. The voice that came through singing \\"Windmills Of Your Mind\\" was deep and throaty, husky almost, and the degree of technical enhancement was just plain absurd. We examined the CD and, sure enough, it was the right one. But on all the songs she sings in a register lower than Tony Bennett's. All the songs, without exception, are slow and plodding and dreary, and can be likened to a collection of funeral dirges, if you ask me.   After listening two or three more times to what amounts to just a lot of congested yowling and strained attempts at the former vocal theatrics at which she was once so adept, we decided he could give this CD to his grandmother instead since she also loves Barbra Streisand and her hearing isn't so good.   I guess that's it for Barbra, then. I mean, I'll still cherish all my old releases. But if this is what it's come down to then I really can't see throwing money away on what is essentially a mere shadow of a voice that once was truly glorious.   Maybe she could start writing children's books instead of singing. It worked for Julie Andrews. Or better yet- cookbooks! She always says the thing she loves most is food.   A word to the wise, added later:   Those of you who sense a hollow ring to a lot of the glowing 5-star reviews you see for this product and others, no- you're not crazy. As someone who has worked for a major media corporation's marketing department for the last twelve and a half years, I can tell you directly that many of these reviews are \\"plants\\" by people who have a financial stake in the product and need it to do well. These people don't care that many who purchase the product will end up being disappointed. This is irrelevant to them. They care about one thing: taking your money. These same people will pile their comments on to the end of an unfavourable review like football players in a game of tackle. Their aim is to intimidate the reviewer into deleting his contribution to the discussion. Some of the comments posted in response to this review have been so foul that Amazon has apparently found it necessary to delete them.   As the old saying goes: \\"A fool and his money are soon parted.\\" When considering what you read, ask yourself:   Honest opinion?   Or Sales Pitch?
030745455X|5.0|Reading this series of books, the Millenium series, of which TGWPwF is the second, has changed my outlook and even my behaviors in subtle ways.  They're not books I would have thought I would even like, but after reading one page, I couldn't stop until I had finished the third book.  I think Stieg Larsson's too early death was a great loss to the world.

0553801473|1.0|I don't believe the story will ever be finished and I don't believe any additional books will recapture what made the series so addictive in Books 1 - 3.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that HBO cuts ties with the book after season 3 the way they did with the Sookie Stackhouse books OR that Martin gives up all together and lets talented ghost writers take the wheel.<br /><br />I'm kind of glad that the next book probably won't be out for six years because it will probably take that long for me to get over my bitterness over the weeks I wasted reading Books 4 and 5.

ITs kind of a funny book but not intended so.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|I had this album in my Wish List for well over a year waiting for the deluxe edition of this album to come down below $18.  On the day Amy Winehouse died, I decided I wouldn't wait anymore.  I'm so glad I got it; it was worth every penny.  Amy Winehouse reinvented Jazz and brought it together with pop with brilliant results.  She was brilliant and she will be missed.

But if you aren't a completely boring stick in the mud, then you will very much enjoy it!

B0050I2P32|2.0|The Horrors - Skying (2011)<br /><br />....and they really wear them on their sleeves too. By and large they lack an original sound, but I admit they come pretty close at times. On \\"Sea Within A Sea\\", apparently the most revered song from their last album, PRIMARY COLOURS, they ripped off the rhythm and bass guitar from Can's \\"Mother Sky\\" which I found quite annoying. I haven't detected any outright thievery on SKYING, but the Echo & the Bunnymen and Psychedelic Furs influences are quite obvious, as are many other sounds clearly inspired by the 80's, most obviously in the synthesizers.<br /><br />Still, I admire the way they explore and change their sound as they've done over the course of three albums including this one. And I'll also give them credit for taking that 80's sound and giving it a more modern update, adding some modern production and sounds as well as some subtle musical undercurrents that are often more sophisticated than most of the 80's music they emulate.<br /><br />But the main drawback for me is that I just don't think their songs are that good. They don't grab me or move me. I don't dig the melodies and most of the hooks don't catch me. I also miss the harder edged guitars from their earlier music. And quite honestly, I don't think the singer is very good. He can't seem to hit the notes he should be hitting; he sounds off key. I hovered between giving this album two or three stars since it does have some positive things going for it, but for me two stars is the most honest rating considering the fact that the songs themselves are lackluster and I simply won't be listening to it, opting to reach for original vintage 80's albums instead.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|The ONLY tour I have never seen live..and of course I am sick after watching this!..unbelievable and awesome..she continues to raise the bar..this tour looked like it had so much energy and love...and of course the show is always done to perfection, and never dissapoints..I have followed her and loved this woman for over 25 years, and no one will ever compare to her type of music, and what she does to entertain..yes, there is Celine Dion, and Barbara Stresiand, but they are in a different class than Madonna.  She is truly the Queen of Pop..she should not be compared and criticized for not having a voice like one of these woman..she will never be in that category..nor will Lady GaGa..or Beyonce...we admire and love them for the talent they bring to that stage..,it may be over the top for you..it may be x-rated for you, or just distasteful..it's ok...we love our idols because they touch our hearts and wake our spirit...and we relate to what they are feeling in their music..Madonna's music and her song writing, and her never ending changing and evolving is what she is...and I will love her until I am old and gray..and pray she never stops making her music..magical to me..Long Live the Queen!

B0000AMRJC|2.0|Can you say violent?  I lost count of the bloody murders after the 15th slaughter in this movie.  I'm no prude, but when you have killing for the sake of killing it gets a bit ridiculous.  And using f**k every other word gets a bit tiring after the 100th usage of the word. Even Michelle Pfeiffer's character agrees with me.  At the end it said the move was dedicated to Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks.  It should have been dedicated to Quentin Tarantino.  Hawks and Hecht would turn over in their graves if they saw what passed as a \\"slight\\" remake of their classic.   This movie is like the original in only the title.  Al Pacino is a great actor, but compared to his classic jobs in the Godfather and Serpico, he should be ashamed, and this was almost 30 years ago this bloody joke was made.  The gore was way over the top(the blood fests by Tarantino were Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by comparison).  If you want to see a classic, don't rent or buy this movie.  It isn't worth it.
B001FZ0A72|5.0|Sounding heavy and portentous but richly detailed ,\\"Within The Realm Of A Dying Sun\\" had a transcendent effect on me when I first heard it years ago. The production value on this CD is very deliberate, leading some reviewers to regard this release as precious, pretentious, or bombastic when compared to later releases that explored a growing embracement of world music, while in truth it's the most heavily orchestrated release in their catalogue.     Most of this release is driven by percussive instrumentation: the listener at various times will encounter a heavy bassline, chiming bells, piano, drums, and synthesizer, which are occasionally interspersed with strings and horns. As mentioned by many previous reviewers, \\"Within The Realm Of A Dying Sun\\" is arranged  so that the first four songs are centered around Brendan Perry's ruminative baritone and introspective lyrics, and the last four around Lisa Gerrard's powerful, fluidic, magnificent contralto/soprano range, serving practically as an instrument of its own, spanning the range from primal to highly refined.     While some listeners find the overall tone of this CD to be somber and brooding, I find it to be wistfully meditative. And while I'm sure that some of this music had to be created by synthesizer and is augmented by modern technology, the sound is rooted in a universally eternal spectrum that defies easy categorization or placement, though it's routinely interpreted as medieval instrumentation. Tracks worth listening to any number of times include \\"Anywhere Out Of The World\\", \\"In The Wake Of Adversity\\", \\"Xavier\\", \\"Cantara\\" and \\"Persephone\\".     If you're reading this review to decide whether to buy your first Dead Can Dance CD, I would recommend that you not make this your first purchase. Get \\"The Serpent's Egg\\", instead, which blends elements of medieval instrumentation and the incredible vocal dynamics with orchestration that's much less baroque in nature. But definitely pick up a copy of this one afterward.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Iron Man 2 is one of those rare films that's as good as if not better than the first film.  I never read a lot of Iron Man comics, so I don't know how well they portrayed the characters and story VS the comics, but I really like how it was done.  I thoroughly enjoy this film and recommend it to others who like superhero and action films.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|The director's Russian vampire flicks are interesting, if uneven, B fare. Wanted takes those B movie sensibilities to new levels of stupidity (and there are plenty of spoilers in this review). The whole curving the bullet trick I could go with but the idea that the guy's son was the only one capable of doing this job was beyond lame. The training was laughable as if in a few days (could've been weeks but who knows the time frame with this movie) he was able to master this. The butcher knife fight scenes were far too brutal really for the subtext of the flick which was about skill with a gun.<br /><br />The cast is terrific as you have Morgan Freeman as some sort of all-knowing Obi Won, Angelina Jolie as an assassin (does she have some sort of mortal lock on assassin roles?) who doesn't have to hide her real tattoos (hey, all that aside but eat a burger once in a while because although your beestung lips are nice, you are looking coat-rackish at times in this) as well as the ubiquitous Terence Stamp. The problem is the script is laughable despite some classic lines.<br /><br />Wait till you get to the dolphins with frickin' lasers...I mean mice with IEDs strapped to their bodies. Willard? Are you there Willard? I'm not making this up. There are actual suicide bomber mice in this.<br /><br />This movie jumps the shark several times that your jaw just drops how dumb it is. Given that the opening and closing scenes are thrill rides. I still think the whole shoot a bullet from miles away deal is way too implausible in the key murder scenes.<br /><br />No extras at all on the particular DVD release I saw this on, so very low scores even from the Russian judge on this one.
030788743X|5.0|I listened to this book on a recent car trip.  Both Wil Wheaton's reading and the words themselves drew me into the story.  The descriptions and action were so vivid that it was like watching a mental movie rather than listening to an audiobook. I am not a geek.  My brother played D&D and tried to get me to play but I didn't have the patience to read the guidebooks and understand the rules. And I grew up in the 70's, but the cultural references reminded me of the time. Like the multi-layered puzzles in the story, the story is multi-layered exploring themes of culture, technology, individuals vs corporations, what is reality?, what is friendship?  There is alot to discuss here and think about.
B001TODCII|3.0|\\"Quickly! There's no time!\\" Review must start now!<br /><br />Don't bother buying this version of the DVD as all you get is two versions of the movie--the theatrical release and unrated version. There are zero extras.<br /><br />Having said that it's an entertaining thriller in which Mel Gibson...oops, I thought ALL movies where the dad gets angry and seeks revenge as a one-man team by himself starred Mel...it's Liam Neeson in this one.<br /><br />Huge plot holes and improbable one man vs. everyone where (it's Hollywood, 'natch) all he suffers is a hurt wing in the entire movie but takes out approximately 9,555 Albanian (yes, Albanian!) criminals in Paris (yes, set that movie in a foreign locale to boost that overseas box office).<br /><br />The dumbest plot device (or non-device) is the fact we are introduced to his three other ex-CIA buddies who now work security for a pop singer. Now, to me, rather than going it alone to Paris given he has only 96 hours to save his daughter from a life of white slavery, he only enlists one guy to do some research on the criminals who may be involved with the kidnapping of his daughter. You don't think these guys would take 96 hours out of their lives to help their buddy, if asked?<br /><br />I just didn't get that. Why introduce these guys as his friends and have them bond at a backyard barbecue then on a job working security, then say bye bye. Did they not have enough in the budget to pay them all to fly to Paris?<br /><br />Anyway, there are some cringe-inducing drugged out scenes of horror as young girls are forced into prostitution so fair warning those who don't dig needles, disgusting room conditions and the whole world of human trafficking. Other than that plenty of bad guy fu, explosions-a-go-go and all around non-stop action.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I will just keep this simple. This product does exactly what it says it will do, it holds my flashlights securely. It is a bit tight at first but it will break in. I am using it at this time for my MAGLITE XL50 and it is perfect, very secure. I have many flashlight's and this holster works well with them all. Oh and yes I almost forgot it, is under $8.00 what more could you want ?
B00005JMX6|5.0|Yes, this is a movie about one of those implausible high school hookups--nerdish guy next door scores the hot babe after trials and tribulations. Yet this rises above the usual dumb high school comedy on so many levels. The premise is thin but the script is sharp, funny and dramatic.<br /><br />Kudos to Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch who have great screen chemistry. Toss in all the bit part actors and they work well too especially Timothy Olyphant who reprises his \\"Go\\" drug dealer persona but this time as a porn producer (is that moving up, down or sideways career-wise?).<br /><br />The extras do make this worth snagging on DVD as you not only get the usual deleted/gag reel scenes but a good look into how this project came into being and how it veers from the norm. Cuthbert and Hirsch also do voiceover commentary on some key scenes in the extras.<br /><br />Look, guys, you're going to buy this for Elisha Cuthbert anyway but it is a flick you can get your girlfriend to watch, too. It has heart.
B0009A40ES|5.0|This certainly is quite a movie! How crazy can you really become in a world full of people equally as delusional? Certainly is an accurate portrayal of an era in American history not so long ago, and we can only hope we've progressed D: Cheers!
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Let's face facts, Woody Allen has long since ceased to be relevant to cinema and seems to make \\"films\\" based around this narrow New York bubble he exists in.<br /><br />Thankfully, he finally made a movie outside of that bubble and gave us what most of us want--a sensual pic set in a beautiful foreign locale (Barcelona natch!) and occupied with a range of characters running from the gorgeous and mysterious to the plain and mundane.<br /><br />Even so this movie falls so flat. The ending just seems like he ran out of money and shut the camera off. Plus the way he actually treats relationships is almost cartoonish. the potential in the story is there but he's unable to weave multiple storylines (hey, Woodman, go watch a guy Ritchie caper flick to see how it's done in the 21st century) without seeing them simply left hanging and unresolved.<br /><br />Also, stop treating us adults like we can't figure out the gaps in scenes. the voiceover narration is like some sort of instructions to the blind. It's beyond annoying. First rule of cinema, if you have to use narration, especially a third person one, to explain what is going on you've done a terrible job in filmmaking and are flat-out lazy.<br /><br />There are zero extras on the version of this DVD I watched the flick on. That's sad as a whole Gaudi/Miro travelogue and making of is what I was dying for. Throw in the whole Javier No Country and Penelope Cruz dynamic in real life it'd be interesting to know what went on during the production of the movie.
B000816TCY|5.0|I've used an off-brand replacement En-El8 battery, and at first the life seemed to match my original Nikon. However, it soon became apparent that it was losing battery life quickly. After a couple years, my original Nikon was going strong while the off-brand would only hold a charge for a few minutes. Finally, it would not hold a charge at all. Since I often go all day without access to charging, I need to be able to change out batteries to keep taking pictures, but I also can't carry 5 batteries with me. So, with this past experience, I went ahead and bought another Nikon En-El8 battery, and it did come in the retail packaging as described with the correct 730 mAh as indicated in the photo.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|Skip the movie and go straight to the extra features. There's a terrific one on the whole \\"hollow Earth\\" movement that fueled Jules Verne's imagination to write the terrific book on which this lame movie is based on.<br /><br />No amount of special effects can save this as the movie just meanders all over the place. Brendan Fraser cannot carry movies unless they are comedies. The female actress (whose name I've forgotten already) is unmmemorable and if she's supposed to have an Icelandic accent it keeps morphing into British. The young kid is also hopeless in this.<br /><br />Really, it's not any of these actors' faults as the script is just brutal.<br /><br />Literally, I ended up doing chores around the house as this ran as after awhile I just gave up. It's beyond dull. (Plus as posting of Aug. 25, 2001, there are over 200 used copies of this for sale starting from 16 cents so that says a lot more than any review.)
0316069485|1.0|The ebook version is almost twice as much as the paperback.  That is obscene!  Kindle readers shouldn't be penalized for purchasing in this format, by the big six publishers.  You can't tell me that it costs a publisher twice as much to produce a Kindle book, than it does to produce a paperback.  Hmmm....no returns, warehouses, printing costs.....Why are we being asked to pay twice as much?  My negative review is directed at the publisher, not Amazon.  Amazon went to bat for us.      As for the book--definitely not his best!  If you are a Kindle user, download a sample first.  You probably won't want to bother with the book, if you do.
B00383UJ2U|5.0|I am seriously addicted to this album and have turned a lot of my friends on to it, and they love it as much as I do.
0786956291|5.0|Hello all, long time gamer here. Always had an interest in Pen and Paper games but never had the friends (a common problem I hear). Well my girlfriend and I bought this just for fun to try together, and let me tell you what: This is a fantastic little box o' goodies. I doubt we'll even PLAY DnD 4th edition (3.5 is just far too appealing for me to deny), but that doesn't even matter. For the price of a movie ticket, I got this beauty delivered to my door!     It has been designed EXACTLY for people who have no idea of what to do, but need a little push out the door to get started on their own adventures. The \\"player's book\\" is where you should start, and helps you through the otherwise daunting process of character creation. You actually play during character creation, and the story is affected accordingly!    Pros:   -SUPER, SUPER high value purchase for anyone even remotely curious about DnD 4th or a newbie in general  -Nice fold out, double-sided map with several different areas to use for referencing  -PC and NPC tokens for easy referencing on a map or even just a table  -Almost full set of dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) Not made of jade or anything exotic, but they are fine starter dice. Only missing d% which isn't necessary to play.  -Both the Players Book and Dungeon Master's Book (Not the full, core rulebooks, but still PLENTY of information given)  -Classic box design graphics. It feels like I'm stepping back in time 40 years when I look at the box and realize how much fantasy games have come over the decades. Very, very cool feeling of \\"coming home\\" as a PC gamer who never played growing up.    Cons:  -DnD 4th edition in general seems to favor schwag items (things that are only aesthetic serving and even sometimes required?). The biggest thing comes to mind is the grid-based combat and the almost literal need for an ARMY of miniatures in order to play by the rules. I personally prefer using my imagination and maybe just a token with the number of enemies.The drama and suspense felt between the DM and players could easily be ruined by instead players trying to better position themselves on a grid for numerical advantage.    -Combat is perhaps over-simplified. I have dual degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science, and I was almost insulted coming to this from my 3.5 players manual. Wizards rolling like fighters for attack rolls? I can't even find a spot for concentration checks in this little set, so I'm guessing they are removed from 4th?       Final Words: I was trying pretty hard to think up Cons for this package, but in all fairness they are null and void given what you DO get. Buy this now, maybe several. They could change a young girl or boy's life forever as gifts, and at less than $15 for this you would be hard pressed to find a better value for your money.
B000TEMRIU|3.0|There is an albums worth of 5 star music on here.  That being said there is a lot of junk in between.
B0051GOB26|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised when I received my order within just a few days of ordering, via standard mail. When I opened my package I was even more surprised. My DVD was packed exceptionally well, and the DVD was in very good condition.  I highly recommend SOUNDS-NYC to all.
B00505VUCM|5.0|Now read closely people!  Believe me, normally I'm not the person who writes reviews to albums which haven't even  reached the addressee! But this time I just can't hold myself back doing just that.  Couple of days ago, my sister invited me to listen to some new singer - well you know  who - after going threw 'jar of hearts' it just made my jaw drop real bad...  It not only wants you to listen to the song over and over again, it makes you feel the person  who sings it!  Now if there's someone who can list up on one hand who is capable of doing that with this glance  he'll be stuck at his ring finger, that's for sure!  You just got to love this woman and how she performs her into words cast art.  By the way - covering songs is one thing, but how she does it, it makes me go crazy.  The font she selected for her debut-album speaks for itself and makes me love her even more!  If you don't get yourself this album, move back in time and listen to some women who you  think can bring along messages like that.  Now Christina don't you ever stop... writing beatiful songs... and keep some skin free of  tattoos, just like in music - intermissions often say more /;)  Love, Juergen
B0009SS00A|4.0|Well I just finished this book \\"Digital Fortress\\" by Dan Brown and I have to say that it was a good read. It was a definate page turner. I notice that most of the 1 and 2 star reviewers were mostly people in the field of cryptology and computer science etc etc. Well I am not a cryptologist, or a crypt-keeper, or a crip from the hood. I really enjoyed the book. Someone said that Dan Brown is a bad writer. WOW, I totally disagree. He may be many things but a bad writer he is NOT!!!  I thought his similies were original and creative. I saw him as an author pulling away from the trite an over used. His characters were not flat, they were quite rich and tangible.  This is one of the things I like about Dan Brown's characterization -the man knows how to flesh out the people he creates.<br /><br />I was going to read this book a long time ago, but someone stopped me. I had read DaVinci Code, and then Angeles and Demons and then Deception Point and then The Lost Symbol, so it made sense to move on to this -the only book of his I hadnt read.  Someone said that this book was awful and that I should instead read \\"Minerva Virus\\", I read Minerva Virus and while the first 10-15 chapters were awful, the story did pick up and by the end I was loving Minerva, however, there is a bold difference between the two writers. Had Dan Brown written Minerva, I think it would have been a phenomenal masterpiece.<br /><br />Dan Brown knows how to stretch out a story and fill everypage with interesting details and suspence.  You want Dan Browns characters to succeed -both protaganist and antagonist -it is a feeling that is just indescribable and that is what I love about Brown's work.<br /><br />Digital Fortress is a book about the NSA tapping into the personal lives of the public and one man's effort to stop this behavior that he feels is immoral and un-American.  This man claims to have created an unbreakable code which could be downloaded to every computer in the world and once downloaded mainstream people would have a defense against NSA spys. It turns out that the man tricked the NSA Director and so the story just goes on unfolding one mystery after another until it comes to a simple conclusion.<br /><br />Some people said that they knew how the book would end. I expected the ending I got, but I still enjoyed the journey. It was a great book.  I will say that Susan Fletcher was kind of stupid for a supposed genius. My favorite character was Becker.  Not only was he cute, but he was brave, unrelenting and brilliant.<br /><br />I gave this book 4 stars because the overall topic of the story just was not interesting. I really didnt care about some lame old computer virus (or \\"worm\\") What I liked about the Minerva Virus was that this virus became a self evolving entity that laid claim over the human race and sought to rule or destroy. That is what I thought this book would be. Oh, well. Dan Brown is still one helluva writer and I look forward to his next work.<br /><br />Mr.Brown if you are reading this, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, give us another Robert Langdon book.ld have a defense against NSA spys.

B004GUSG4M|2.0|It was too repetitious and too unbelievable.  The waking up every morning going thru the same scenario and this lasting for years and years was too boring.  I found myself skipping through the pages without reading them.  The story line really lagged for me.
B003L77GG0|5.0|The 10th, and final, season of SMALLVILLE was a refreshing mix of the old Smallville and the new. Tom Welling did some of his best acting in Season 10 as Clark Kent/The Blur and soon-to-be Superman! Clark finally morphed into a confident, mature hero that longtime viewers could see becoming Supes! And FINALLY Erica Durance was in EVERY SINGLE episode in Season 10 as Lois Lane! Welling and Durance as Clark and Lois were able to take their chemistry to another level and become the iconic couple. It may be \\"Smallville\\", but this version of Lois and Clark is going to be a tough act to follow!<br /><br />In addition to Welling and Durance, Season 10 regulars included Cassidy Freeman (as Tess Mercer since Season 8) and Justin Hartley (as Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow since Season 6). And Allison Mack reprised her role as Chloe Sullivan in a limited fashion (appearing several eps throughout the season, including the finale).<br /><br />Season 10 also brought back virtually all of the important characters during the show's formative years (Martha and Jonathan Kent, Lex and Lionel Luthor, Zod, Kara, Brainiac). These old characters served as a reminder of where Smallville came from and how it got to the point where it was, while still managing to move the story along.<br /><br />The Season 10 story arcs are the arrival of Darkseid through the portal that was opened in the Season 9 finale when Zod and the Kandorians went to their new home world, the clone Lex storyline, and the VRA subplot. While I thought the Darkseid stuff was a mixed bag and the VRA pretty useless, the clone Lex story was the saving grace of the subplots, as well as Clois. Also, it was in the Season 9 finale that Lois realized Clark's dual identity so in Season 10, she knows all about him, but doesn't let him onto it until the right time.<br /><br />Season 10 got off to a great start with the fascinating episode Ep 1-LAZARUS, a wonderful teaser as to Clark's future potential as Superman with an aging clone of Lex Luthor (excellently played by MacKenzie Gray) escaping a Luthorcorp facility and wreaking havoc on Metropolis and Lois Lane; Clark has to save the day in typical Superman fashion! Also, a lone surviving clone of Lex, the little boy Alexander, is saved by Tess from the facility before it is destroyed and this clone ages to several stages of Lex's life in future Season 10 eps. The ep ends with a heartfelt conversation between Clark and Jonathan's ghost (reprised by the esteemed John Scheider) and the entrance of Darkseid!<br /><br />Arguably the best ep of Season 10 is Ep 4-HOMECOMING (also the 200th ep of the series), which has a sort of \\"Christmas Carol\\" vibe with an improved, futuristic good-guy version of Brainiac (brilliantly reprised by James Marsters, who played the role in Seasons 5 and 7) taking Clark on a journey through his past, present, and future which leads Clark to realize his potential as Earth's savior. It also includes one of the best moments of Season 10 (heck, the series!) with a beautiful Clois scene at the end of a declaration of love and Clark floating!<br /><br />Other early standouts of Season 10 include the underrated Ep 5-ISIS, a very funny, quick-witted ep which allows the 4 main cast members to all shine (really enjoyed Justin Hartley's work in this ep!) and includes semi-regular character Cat Grant (played hilariously by Keri Lynn Pratt introduced in Ep 2-SHIELD) and has yet another smashing Clois moment at the end with Tom Welling delivering an amazing speech to Lois! Also Ep 7-AMBUSH brings back the always reliable Michael Ironside (reprising the role of Lois' dad General Sam Lane) and Peyton List (again playing Lois' sister Lucy); both characters were introduced in Season 4, Lois' first season on the show. Ep 8-ABANDONED is a haunting ep where Clark, Lois, and Tess are forced to confront their familial demons from the past. Ep 10-LUTHOR is one of the top Season 10 eps with Clark accidentally going to an alternate universe wherewe again get to see Lionel Luthor (reprised by the great John Glover, who was a regular for the first 7 seasons), who in the alternate world raised Clark's evil doppel ganger Clark Luthor. Ep 11-ICARUS is the one where Clark proposes to Lois.<br /><br />The second half of Season 10 includes the standout eps 13-BEACON (where the radiant Annette O'Toole returns as Martha Kent) and a teenaged clone of Lex (well played by teen idol Lucas Grabeel, who actually played the real teen Lex back in a Season 6 flashback episode) seeks revenge on Clark. Ep 14-MASQUERADE is a funny, witty ep, the one where Clark realizes he must start wearing glasses to hide his true identity.<br /><br />The last part of Season 10 goes out on a high note with a string of awesome eps! In Ep 16-SCION, the clone Lex story comes to an end as the teen clone (Grabeel again in a fine turn) turns out to share Lex and Clark's DNA and ends up as Connor Kent (future Superboy!). Ep 17-KENT is another best ep of the season contender as Clark Luthor returns sending Clark back to the alternate world where he meets none other than the alternate Jonathan Kent (reprised again by Schneider), a bitter man because the alternate Oliver Queen had mined farmers' land for Kryptonite in order to find a way to stop Clark Luthor. Ep 18-BOOSTER is a suprisingly entertaining ep with future superhero Booster Gold (hilariously played by Eric Martsoff) dropping in on Metropolis to steal Clark's thunder, as Clark must immerse himself more and more into the nerd-with-glasses persona to throw people off. Ep 19-DOMINION marks the return of Zod (reprised by the mercurial Callum Blue, who played the role all of Season 9) as Clark and Oliver travel to the Phantom Zone where the Kandorians have imprisoned Zod. Ep 20-PROPHECY is the pre-finale ep where Lois gets Clark's powers for a day and makes a shocking pronouncement at the end; Durance's emotional acting at the end of this ep and also at the end of Dominion is Emmy-worthy!<br /><br/>Eps 21 and 22 are the FINALE parts 1 and 2 (shown as a 2-hour episode originally) that includes Clark and Lois' wedding, Darkseid's attack on Earth, and the return of none other than Lex Luthor (reprised by the terrific Michael Rosenbaum, who brilliantly essayed the role for the first 7 seasons)!<br /><br />In the end, I'd say SMALLVILLE gave the fans what it really wanted...Clark Kent becoming Superman!<br /><br />Season 10 Regulars: Tom Welling, Erica Durance, Cassidy Freeman, Justin Hartley, and Allison Mack.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|I don't understand the low ratings on this movie. I really felt drawn in from start to finish. Action, drama, emotion and great PQ and AQ on a stunning bluray! What else could you ask for? Well, this movie will stay in my collection forever. Thanks to Warner Bros for a not to be soon forgotten movie......      I really feel as though this movie is a steal for the price!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Sequel please.<br />Although I have to confess, I was worried by the opening.  It starts as a standard issue war movie, a false start as it turns out.  I hate false starts; they're a stale gimmick sorely abused by those who think a shot of action will get us all pumped up for what's to follow.  Unfortunately, when you follow an aborted scene of action with something truly mundane, it has the opposite effect.  Instead of being in the thick of it we're mired down by people with issues, a rocky past, leaders with no experience, a lot of macho posturing, and LOOK, meteors with a sense of direction!<br />Yes, it's a clich&eacute; plot and yes, it's riddled with clich&eacute; characters, so what.  I eventually ended up liking this movie a lot because it was so safe and predictable and I liked the characters that stuck around long enough to tell them apart (most were DOA).  I also liked the pairing of a by-the-book war movie with a Sci-Fi creature feature.  Although I would have liked a better look at the creatures they were fighting.  Maybe they'll do close-ups in the sequel?  I also think they should have stuck with the original title: Battle For Los Angeles.<br /><br />It's a keeper!
159514188X|5.0|Title: Thirteen Reasons Why  Author: Jay Asher  Genre: YA     Where I got it: ODLC (the e-book library)    One sentence: Clay Jensen finds cassette tapes recorded by his classmate and crush, Hannah Baker, who committed suicide weeks earlier, and he discovers that he is part of the thirteen reasons why she killed herself.    Themes: Suicide, guilt, lies, truth, judgment, teenage angst    Main character: I really loved Clay. He seemed down-to-earth, and though he is touted in school as the \\"perfect guy\\", I found that his character was much more multi-faceted than that. His emotions were easy to connect with and believable.     Secondary characters: As much as I liked Clay's character, it was the character of Hannah that really struck me and raised such mixed feelings. As much as I dislike the idea of suicide and have negative emotions toward someone who would put themselves and their family through such a painful experience, I found that I didn't hate Hannah. I understood and connected with her, even if I didn't agree with her ideas, and that really made her decisions and actions hit home for me.    Writing style: The alternating narration between the cassette tape playing and what Clay is doing at the same time threw me for a loop at first, but I grew to really appreciate the parallels between Clay and Hannah and their unique emotions    Plot: The plot truly intrigued me from the beginning, the idea of receiving cassette tapes from a girl who had just committed suicide. I thought it was suspenseful, emotional and kept me thoroughly entertained as there were few dull moments.    Best scene: The thirteenth reason kept me on the edge of my seat, especially using a twist on what we had come to expect.    Positives:  Characters, entertaining and suspenseful plot, writing    Negatives: There were some ideas that Hannah held that I didn't agree with, but they really worked to characterize her, so I suppose that this negative is almost a positive.    Ending: Loved it. It drew everything to a close in a bittersweet moment that had me jumping.    Verdict: A fascinating and heart-wrenching read that reverberates in the reader.    Rating: 9.0 / 10
B001E45XT4|4.0|I have to admit that this product remained on my wish list for the better part of 6 months maybe even longer. Alas I made up my mind and bought these PlainTronics GameCom 367s along with some other timely purchases, (noted a new laptop).<br /><br />First off i'll tell what you need to hear. The sound quality reviewed by a non audiophile like myself who would probably be content punching into my ear holes a cheap pair of orange foam ear plugs connected to a string and have a mute hum me a song until I was either deaf or dead. In other words I'm most certainly not an \\"audiophile\\" and could not possibly offer a bullet point review on the minutia of and specifics on headsets. What I can offer however and tell you is how much I paid for these puppies and how much I do like them.<br /><br />My account saw the mear amount of no more than $24.03 taken from me in exchange for these puppies. Elsewheres these go for more than double what I forked over in US tender. I honestly could not be more proud of myself for making such a purchase. CRACK! Hear that? That was the sound of me breaking my own arm by padding myself on back for making such a wise decision. I genuinely like these things. They sound great, feel comfortable, the noise cancelling is not as impressive but otherwise. If you're a student who is low on funds and in need of a decent pair of earmuffs with which to listen to some serious tunage and simultaneously mask those ungodly noises being produced by your flat mate and his girlfriend on the otherside of the dorm. Then you go right ahead and charge your daddy's Master Card and tell him Skuller sent ya and you're welcome.
0385737955|4.0|Title: The Maze Runner  Author: James Dashner  Genre: YA Thriller    Where I got it: ODLC (the library's e-book collection)    One sentence: Thomas wakes up with no memory of his past in a community of teens inside a giant maze, but as soon as he gets there, things start to change in the maze and in Thomas, as he realizes he might hold the secrets to finally escaping the maze.    Themes: Secrets, loss of memory, suspense, mystery, post-apocalyptic    Main character: I felt like there was very little characterization for the main characters, Thomas and Teresa. I couldn't really connect with them beyond imagining what I personally would feel in the situations they were in. Thomas had Gary-Stu qualities; he showed up having no idea where he was, magically knew he wanted to be a runner, broke all the rules, became a runner anyway and earlier than anyone before, and ending up leading the entire group.    Secondary characters: I found that I liked some of the secondary characters like Newt, Minho and Chuck better than Thomas or Teresa, simply because they had more depth. They had faults that I could connect with and were interesting to read.    Writing style: A little dry. Sometimes I knew there was an intense moment and I just couldn't get into it because of the writing. I like how Dashner came up with new slang for the Gladers because it really expanded the world and reflected the fact that they had been so separated from the rest of the world that their vocabulary had evolved differently.    Plot: This is what really drew me into the story. I loved the idea of the maze and how Dashner wove in the post-apocalyptic bits. The only part that really disappointed me was the ending (see section below). It probably should have just cut off when they left the maze.    Best scene: Where Thomas, Minho and Alby spend the night in the maze    Positives:  Plot, suspense, gasp-worthy epiphanies, setting, mysteries of the maze    Negatives: Characterization, some dry writing, ending.Ending: A little disappointing after a good rest of the book. Probably could have waited until the next book, just because it was so different from what the rest of the book had been.    Verdict: A good, suspenseful read. The few flaws did not distract me too much from the great plot. I will definitely read the next book.    Rating: 7.6 / 10

0553801473|3.0|I'll read the next books when they come out, but if fantasy fiction at its highest level is supposed to be an epic story of good vs. evil, then this book (and series) falls well short of the mark.  I've read all five books after hearing Martin on an radio interview plugging Dance when it came out.  He has created a world that is many-layered and endowed it with history and fable, and the characters are interesting, although one gets the sense that some of the \\"skin-changing\\" episodes aren't limited to the ones that the author intended.  I've seen one character morph into another across the span of the series.<br /><br />The plot wobbles all over the place - with the point being that life is that way, I guess.  But this is fantasy - the reason for the story is that this is supposed to transcend \\"the way life is\\".<br /><br />Long and complex doesn't equal genius, however.  I'll read the next books, but I'm certainly not on the edge of my seat wondering how things are going to turn out.  Bottom line:  Martin's series is slightly above the norm for this genre, but to compare him to Tolkien is to compare Quayle to Kennedy.
B0013JYSOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I saw it while on a church trip. We all were watching it eyes glued to the screen! It is such a wonderful movie about love, hope, dreams, and music. I recomend this movie to everyone.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I would have given this app five stars but the two player mode is terrible and difficult to play will change review when fixed
B005CLT86E|4.0|This is a great album from a relatively young band. About half of the songs are classics. I think its better than their last, but it could use a little more guitar edge. If they could strike the balance between this and their last then we would have a true classic album. If you like english style dark pop rock just get it.!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian is amazing.  If you want results and have a short attention span, this is the video for you.  I sweat more in the 20 minutes that I do this video than hour long classes at the gym.    I have to compare the exhaustion index to that of a spinning class.  A really good workout in very little time.  My legs are so sore for days, but I have seen results almost immediately, so no complaining from me.  This is so much better than a gym membership.  Just thinking about 20 minutes and how easy it is to fit it into your schedule makes this totally do-able.  The 3 different levels keep you from getting bored.  I highly recommend this for a total body workout and visible results.
0316172324|4.0|Overall, this was a really great book. It was a fast read, and filled with a lot of cool information about the human mind and what Gladwell refers to as \\"thin-slicing.\\" It really opened my mind to what the human brain can and can't do.  With that said, I've noticed a lot of people reviewing this book and complaining that there's no epiphany at the end like his other book, Tipping Point. It's clear this book has gotten worse ratings than it deserves because it's being held up to that standard. I feel like this book does a lot to reveal the potential of the human mind and shows great examples of what thin slicing can do. It's the kind of topic that can't be built up to and magically revealed at the end as a great epiphany, Gladwell has to lead you through it and build it up as you go along, and I think that's why a lot of readers feel robbed of a great conclusion.  Overall, it's a great book, and while it doesn't train you to make snap judgments, it can shed light on the processes behind it, and it generally just a really good read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome little puzzle game, very relaxing. Its worth the 99 cents for sure. I think they should have a demo tho, to check out before trying.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|I would personally thank Miranda Kerr if I could. I bought this book; because I think Miranda Kerr is fabulous and honestly, I wasn't looking for any self help books. I wanted to see how she wrote, and she writes VERY well. She isn't as shallow as some people think she is, because she's a \\"super model\\" she has a head on her shoulders and knows that the best way to use her fame is to help others.<br /><br />I loved this book, and had trouble turning my Kindle off at times. I'm not ashamed that I chose this as my first self help book because it helped me discover things about myself. I no longer linger on what I could have done differently in past situations. I try to live every day as it comes and accept the challenges that come with it. You get a peek into her life, and what it's been like and how she didn't exactly have a smooth ride to where she is today. It's a very zen book and when you feel down about yourself, it's a great book to pick up and just know that there will be days like that; but it's a fleeting feeling when you have a supermodel telling you that you are a beautiful creature in your own respect. People come in all shades, shapes, and sizes. Learning to accept and treasure yourself is the first step to being truly happy.
0553801473|4.0|Still entertaining, but as others have said, it is a let down when compared with Storm of Swords (though how could it not be, especially after such a long wait?).<br /><br />My main problem with the series as this point is that the world is just too big.  We are no longer focusing entirely on Westerosi politics; instead much of this book takes place on Essos, and we are reminded of the existence of a southern continent as well.  (BTW, Westeros is the smallest of those three continents!)  Once you start to realize how big the world really is, and how many other civilizations there are that have almost nothing to do with Westeros, then it really takes away a lot of the impact of the happenings in Westeros that made the first 4 books so great.  I mean, does it really matter who sits on the Iron Throne when 3/4ths+ of the world could not care less?  Or, perhaps more damaging: who the hell cares if the Others take over, when most of the world will be completely unaffected?  Sure, maybe Westeros will fall... but that's not a huge problem to people in Essos.<br /><br />The second main weakness of DwD is that a lot of new characters are introduced.  This means that, first of all, the reader may not find the new point of views as interesting, and secondly (and more importantly) it means that the story lines of the \\"main\\" characters barely moves forward in this book.  In other words, ASoIaF is starting to fall prey to some of the issues that the Wheel of Time series did.<br /><br />All of that being said, if you enjoyed the previous books, then I think this one is definitely worthwhile.  It is not quite as bad as some people have made it out to be.  You will still enjoy it, and there are some great scenes.  (And frankly, some of those reviewers seem to feel overly entitled to me, like Martin \\"owes\\" them \\"better\\" -- where \\"better\\" is any number of fanboy demands.)
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I've always wanted to live a more minimalistic lifestyle, but never really had the drive or the feeling of excess to get me motivated. This book was a great way to get motivated. I could envision a home that only contained what I really needed and wanted.   Her \\"Dear John\\" letter to her stuff was one of my favorite parts of the book and I'll probably reread it when I need more motivation. I love how she expresses that she's neglected the stuff and it will probably be happier with someone else who will pay attention to it and adore it. I have so many things in my attic/basement/garage/back of closet that I only pull out every five years and appreciate for five seconds and then shove back. This five seconds just doesn't compared to the feeling you get of a clean and organized home. Getting rid of the excess has allowed cleaning and organizing to be SO MUCH EASIER! I now have more time for family and the things that really matter in life.
0553801473|2.0|I must admit that I eagerly awaited this book, the second half of a book about 8 years in the making.  I will not worry if it takes another 8 years to release the next one because I'm not sure I will bother listening/reading it.<br /><br />I find myself fast forwarding thru sections just because nothing seems to be happening, just constant blah blah blah from about half of the characters.  Not even close to the quality of the other books in the series, it seems to he was more interested in just filling in 1000+ pages and finally completing something.<br /><br />Update: I wrote the above when I was about halfway through the book, now, after I finally forced myself to complete it I will give you a hint.  Read the last 20% of the book, that sets everything up for the next book, which should be out in about 10 years.  A total waste of time until the very end...enjoy.
1593272790|5.0|I was totally stunned and overjoyed by the nearly pure visual nature of this work.  I've enjoyed things like the [[ASIN:0877790515 Merriam-Webster's Visual Dictionary]] so when I read that this was a visual book I was expecting a lot of pictures, not all pictures.  It is an excellent and beautiful example of visual communication.  I can see anyone who has touched Technics being able to learn interesting possibilities from this regardless of their ability to speak any language.  It is also a testament to the value of a physical book.  While I could see value in seeing this via an e-book reader, the higher resolution of paper lets you appreciate the vivid beauty of the pictures even better.  Kudos to O'Reilly and the author.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Very cute movie!  Funny, Romantic, and perfect for a girls night or even a date night. If you like romantic comedies I would definitely recommend something borrowed!
B000LXHK2C|4.0|We purchase this movie to acquaint ourselves with Provence before renting a home there for a family vacation.  The movie truly captures the beauty of the land, the friendliness of the people, and the longing to remain, or at least return.  It is beautifully photographed - and a true keepsake.  Seller was excellent in shipping right away.
0439023521|4.0|Incredibly addictive read, even if it's meant for grade-schoolers... The plot line and the world conceived by the author, Collins, are both incredibly disturbing. But somehow it all comes together to form a really fun read that you will not be able to put down. Plus, just learned the movie's coming out next March (2012), and it stars Woody Harrelson and Lenny Kravitz... what's not to love?
B000KCHZK6|5.0|If you like Norah Jones, you'll like this CD ... not much else to say. I think this CD showcases the broad range of styles of music that Norah Jones is capable of singing and it has introduced me to some very nice new music.
1936719010|5.0|I just read the 1-star reviews for \\"Do The Work.\\"<br /><br />Every book I plan on buying or reviewing, that's where I start. If a book has haters, I want to know who they are and what they have to say. I want to know if they have a legitimate beef or if they just like to trash someone else's work because they can. I am particularly fascinated with negative reviews when the book being reviewed badly is a) very good and b) predominantly well reviewed.<br /><br />Here's the skinny on this book:<br /><br />It's simple and it's short. It is brutally honest. More importantly, it is eminently helpful. Could it have been longer? Yes. Could it have expanded on its lessons? Yes. Could Steven Pressfield have talked more about the process of writing and rewriting \\"The Profession?\\" I wish. But that's all weakness. The point of the book is this: To get your ass back to work. Period. To give you that quick little push when you need it.<br /><br />What the book doesn't want to be is a distraction. So ask yourself: Do you want to read a 300 page book on the creative process and Steven Pressfield's struggles, or do you want to get back to work? If you are looking for an excuse not to do the work, go buy a 300 page book or wait for his memoirs (Steve, that's a hint). If you want to unstick your process though, buy this book and thank your lucky stars it is as short and direct as it is.<br /><br />It works. Buy it.
B000002OOY|5.0|For some reason lately I've been listening to a lot of movie soundtracks. One day it popped into my head that this would be a good one and I wasn't disappointed. Great music with a great feel. Brings you right back to the scenes it helped set the mood for.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this because my stroller (City Mini) did not come with a cup holder.  Initially I thought I could live without it, but once I got moving I decided that I really needed one.  I looked at different models online and scoped out the other strollers in the neighborhood-at the park, the bus stop, farmers markets, and saw that many of them were using the Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy.  I wanted something to hold drinks, keys, and other essentials so that I did not have to take my purse along on every single walk.      It was definitely the best price compared to other brands/models. I am able to carry all of my stuff around without spilling or losing anything.  The cup holder sections hold everything from a take out coffee cup (hot or cold 16-20oz), water bottle (I usually have a camelback 24oz bottle), or a baby bottle without spilling or falling out.  I also like the inside zippered pocket I can stash my keys, phone, and a few $$ in there while we are out walking.        It does attach with velcro so I do need to readjust it on my stroller handlebar every few weeks, but that is easy enough!  Definitely a great product and fantastic price I would highly recommend it for any other City Mini owners.
B004WN96ME|5.0|Deffinetly one of the best boxsets ive ever ownded. It is a must have essential for collectors and huge Megadeth fans, as there are every imaginable scrap of information about Peace Sells. Though, if you are just an ordinary fan of the band, i wouldnt say this is for you. The versions of cds sound very alike, though for a collector like myself, the differences make a huge difference in the sound. The vinyls included are also gems, as there is a normal black vinyl of Peace Sells, with remastered audio. Then there is a black, white and grey, psychadelic like vinyl with the first 8 songs from a concert held in Clevland, and the final vinyl is clear, with the remaining 7 songs from the same show. The booklet included is also very interesting, with Peace Sells reviews from Lars Ulrich, Dave Mustaine and megadeths manager (i belive) The additional lithiographs, flyers and stubs are also worth while. Id give this a 5/5, a must have boxset.

006054094X|1.0|I'm amazed that intelligent people I know were impressed with this. Menzies' ignorance (certainly) and  dishonesty or self-delusion are almost beyond belief. I wish I could give a negative rating. It's so sad that this book has an overall good rating.
0316069884|3.0|Eating Animals is a compelling book. It starts with a narrative about the beginning of a life, that of Foer's son, and how to relevantly capture the values surrounding our most important task to survive: to eat. Foer confronts the industrial food system, which has developed norms of its own, independent of our historical values surrounding eating. He pursues his thesis (that if his analysis of the production of meat in the US is accurate, then it is responsible to withhold from eating meat) not with philosophical method, but as a creative non-fiction work informed by his writing style from his fiction work. The book is steeped in rhetorical flourish and unconventional writing devices, which often serve in the place of strict premises for his argument.    There are a number of positive contributions in the book. Foer provides an up to date version of the harms surrounding the industrial production of meat. He relays this by weaving back and forth between a variety of writing styles. Among other things, he highlights the importance of personal cultural values around eating via stories of his grandmother and her past; he uses data and observations from factory farms, including interviews with a number of active participants in meat production; he highlights our varying reactions to the treatment of our pets instead of animals raised for food; and he provides a mini-dictionary of terms from the world of food and food production, which when juxtaposed, serve to challenge our standard thoughts on meat.    But there are too many things Foer doesn't address, unfortunately. The most glaring mistake was to overlook some of the more central figures from the animal rights literature, which would have provided more substance to his account. Not including a mention of Peter Singer's [[ASIN:0061711306 Animal Liberation: The Definitive Classic of the Animal Movement (P.S.)]] or Tom Regan's [[ASIN:0520243862 The Case for Animal Rights: Updated with a New Preface]] in his investigation is too big an oversight, for me. For someone exploring the significance of animal mistreatment and spent significant time developing an argument against it, Foer missed the chance to further the debate.    Also, while his literary devices often power the book through this exploration, and provide strong rhetorical support for his narrative, Foer arrives at something resembling a thesis only in the last half of the last chapter, but it is muddled and unclear. He categorically states that each consumer possesses the ability to take part in direct action (by refusing to buy factory farmed meat). Within a few pages of this discussion, he states that individual consumers, although only representing one person, can influence the farming industry, via our connections and sway with other eaters, given that eating is such a social act.    However, he doesn't have anything resembling a strategy for improving animal welfare other than to not purchase them. This is a good preliminary strategy, but he doesn't address the obvious collective action problem: even if he stops, this doesn't entail that anyone else will, even with the influence of other vegetarians. Further, he neglects to discuss why it would be bad to try to reform the actions of participants in the food production chain when the greatest improvements to animal welfare might simply come from things like better slaughterhouses. A utilitarian like Singer would advocate for improving animal welfare standards for meat sold at Wal-mart, given that making such changes at one of the world's largest retailers would greatly reduce animal suffering in one fell swoop, even if he strongly supports Foer's main recommendation. Working with Wal-mart isn't a panacea for all that Foer describes, but might be one of the only means for implementation of better standards for animal care.    These problems unfortunately take away from what was a clearly a personal book, which provides enough of a positive account for vegetarianism that should compel you to find additional resources on animal suffering. However, the account serves more as a sidestep for a movement which has provided evidence similar to Foer's for nearly four decades, with stronger arguments to boot. A better book which surveys the issues, with interviews from a variety of consumers and presents a clearer set of questions and arguments, is Peter Singer and Jim Mason's [[ASIN:B003HV7NEK The Way We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter (Hardcover)]].

B0026IUXO2|4.0|The story of Queen Elizabeth is a remarkable one. It has been told over the years several times through many films and documentaries. This movie captures the story of a single time in the queens life, when she is crowned and is pushed to quickly find herself a King to share her thrown.<br /><br />Much of the film's beginning is dark and filled with quiet whispering. Rooms barely lit with candle light and often the scenes are so soft spoken one has to strain to hear what's being said. After Elizabeth is crowned Queen, the setting seems to brighten and whispers give way to normal dialogue.<br /><br />Right from the start the movie is intense and filled with action. The time period has the Catholics and the Protestants waging wars of the church against each other. There is blood, violence, sexual situations and brief nudity, so obviously this is not a film for children to learn their history from.<br /><br />In trying to capture a very intense love story from English history, this movie is extremely well done. I did however enjoy the more lengthy and historiacally accurate film series [[ASIN:B00005LC1D Elizabeth R]] just a bit more. The series, made many years ago is not of the same blockbuster quality sets and filming as this version, but it's still outstanding just the same. If your interested in a much more lengthy and very well done story of Queen Elizabth, check out [[ASIN:B00005LC1D Elizabeth R]]. If your interested in a more modern film that focuses on the love story from the Queens life, this is the movie your looking for.
B004EPZ070|3.0|Wow really surprised with the reviews given to Kate Hudson here. I thought her character, although annoying, was the liveliest one in the movie. I thought she was great!  Darcy and Ethan were the most upfront characters in the movie. The other characters were on the boring side.  Anyway, I enjoyed watching it --my husband enjoyed watching it. Looking forward to seeing Something Blue (I enjoyed that book more anyway :))
0470913029|5.0|This book is well worth the look. Exellent information and well written.  Very  good, with all information, not just about this specific diet, more about what you eat.  So it is a good book for information and Recipes.  It is not pushy, though by reading it you wil make up your own mind. As all diets seem to be going this way.  Well worth the read.
0316056863|5.0|This book is a wonderful read.  I have never laughed out loud so often.  Her stories and \\"advice\\" are pure comedy.  Tina is a witty & intelligent writer, and I sincerely hope she writes another book soon.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I deliberated long and hard about making this purchase. I considered many different knives, as well as the different use cases that I could see myself and this knife in, and what would be expected from it.     If I was to ever need to carry a single knife with me into the woods to do everything I needed, this would likely be the knife I would take. The best way that I can describe it, is to say that the BK2 is large knife stuffed into a smaller knives body. Because of the thickness of the knife, it has some decent heft to it. This lets this knife chop for you if you need it to (not as good as some larger knives and hatchets, but if you hold the handle WAY back, it works pretty well).    The thickness also means this thing batons like a champ, and really splits the wood well, and can stand up to ANY abuse you throw at it in this regard (seriously, check teh interwebs on this one, someone batoned his BK2 through a lawnmower, refrigerator and satellite dish). Great batoning was to be expected though. What I did NOT expect though, is how well it does smaller tasks. It makes fuzz sticks and builds traps with the best of them once you get used to the added girth. The edge retention is also quite good, and even after a good trip with extensive use, it took about 15 seconds to bring back to hair popping sharp.    I wear mine scout style (small of back on belt), and its almost the only tool that I use while camping (other than a folding saw), just because it does everything so well. The only weakness I've seen that it has is something you can't blame it for. Where I live, its a bit short for batoning lots of the wood thats laying around, so I'm looking for something larger to carry around in the jeep/on the pack for the larger wood.    Great knife, and from showing it to other people out camping... Becker has already sold a few more knifes :).
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I can't believe this is being advertised as the original trilogy?  What about the original films I grew up watching?
0545259088|4.0|Grace and Sam are now in opposite positions since Sam has been cured of changing into a wolf with the help of Isabel through an infection of meningitis while he was in wolf form.  Now Grace is changing into a wolf and she has run off into the woods where she isn't seen for most of the summer.  Isobel and Cole are featured throughout this story and it is their interaction that supplies most of my favorite parts. Cole becomes a focal point that the main plot twists around.  I didn't think he could play such a huge roll in the story line, but I am glad that he did.<br /><br />I thought the story was a bit slower than the first two installments with more descriptions than dialogue which I guess makes sense since Grace is in wolf form for most of the book.  There was a lot of tension building towards the end when you wondered if Grace would find her way back to Sam and if Isabel could restrain her father's actions.  (Those actions are the cause of most of the turmoil in this finale.)  I think everyone know how this ended by now and well it was not a perfect ending it worked for me.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas needs to give us the ORIGINAL trilogy on this set!  Heads up to everyone wondering if this contained the original theatrical cuts.
1416955070|5.0|Oh my goodness! I can't believe that ending! I am glad I'm a little late on the scene and can read, from what I hear, is the next two books to resolve this storyline. It was pure torture at the end, I was reading as fast as I could to hurry and see what else would happen. I will have to do a reread later to savor it a bit more.<br /><br />I've heard tons of good things about this series and of course about Jace. I do agree, he's a very intriguing character and I'm glad I've finally got to meet him. The storyline wasn't too clear on the book blurb and soon I found myself enthralled in the pages, unwilling to put the book down for love or money (okay, you get the idea), until I had read every (well, almost every) last word. Okay, so I admit, I was so engulfed in the story I had to try my hardest not to skim too much at the end, but I could only hold myself back so much!<br /><br />I'm glad to see the hype for this series isn't exaggerated. I found it adventurous, amusing, dramatic, and a little heartbreaking. I'm pretty sure I felt every emotion reading this book and when I finally put it down it had me desperate to get my hands on the next.
B0000057D8|5.0|Yes, these pieces done by Pinnock are the best without a doubt and have always come back to them.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|Overall, I love this movie like I love the other movies.  Harry Potter is, and always will be, part of my childhood.  It's hard not to love something that I've known the majority of my life.  However, I have some things I'd like to address.  FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE(S)/READ THE BOOK, SPOILERS FOLLOW.    I enjoyed the movie, but after re-reading the book right after seeing it, I noticed that Part II mostly focused on the Battle of Hogwarts.  Understandable, since that was a very crucial plot element.  I enjoyed the way they portrayed the battle, what with all the sparkly CG effects.  It was very nice.  However, they left out things in the movie that I REALLY wanted to see.      Rather than do some long-winded explanation of the other things I loved/hated, I'll just make a list.  THINGS I LOVED ABOUT THE MOVIE:  --Voldemort's death:  I like the way Voldemort dissolved after Harry \\"killed\\" him (though, technically Voldy killed himself, since the Elder Wand wouldn't hurt its true master).  I thought that was far more climatic than the way he just dropped dead in the book.  Of course, they left out a lot of the dialogue between the two, which I loved when I read it in the book.  The dialogue also explained why the Elder Wand would fail Voldemort, something that was added in the end as an after thought, almost.  Again, I think the music really made me love this scene even more (playing Lily's Theme at the end where Voldy's turning to ash...wonderful).  --Snape's Death & Memories:  I was super touched by these scenes.  Alan Rickman does an absolutely amazing job at playing Snape.  The Prince's Tale left out several scenes (most from Lily and Sev's childhood friendship), and it added the scene where he holds her dead body crying (that was the part that made me cry almost uncontrollably). I loved the added scene where Lily was whispering to baby Harry, too.  Again, waterworks on, full-blast.  Snape's Death scene had more dialogue and was different from the book,but I loved how he told Harry that he had Lily's eyes.  Again, I was so tearful I could barely make out the screen.   --Battle of Hogwarts scenes:  I LOVED the \\"Statues\\" part, where they're all lining up to defend the castle.  Excellent music there (I think movie soundtracks make a difference when it comes to how much I love/hate a movie).  Also, I loved the bit of comedy added by Minerva.  I laugh at that every time.  And, of course, I liked the shiny CG effects (Aberforth's wave Patronus was pretty freaking sweet).  --The Gray Lady:  I liked this scene more so in the movie than the book (though it was EXTREMELY different).  I thought Helena had more emotion in the movie, and I thought that was appropriate.  I wasn't a big fan of her in the book (too haughty for my liking), but I liked her scene in the movie.  I think the two scenes, movie scene and book scene, are completely different, though.      THINGS I DISLIKED ABOUT THE MOVIE:  --Dumbledore's story:  this was a third of the final book, and yet it was only mentioned in passing in both parts of the film.  I know you can't include EVERYTHING from the books in the film (imagine how long that would be...), but I thought they left out this crucial part.  Since it really puts doubts in Harry's head about his mission Dumbledore left him, and Dumbledore in general.  --The Horcruxes:  they were never properly explained in HBP, but now, suddenly, Harry knows what all the Horcruxes are and where to look for them (for the most part).  I think they should have added more in HBP about this, since I can see how it would be confusing for those who haven't read the books.  --The Hallows:  absolutely no explanation for any of them aside from the story scene in Part I.  Nothing about how Harry was related to Ignotus or how he was the true master of the Hallows, etc..  Again, I understand that the film isn't a book, but I thought they'd put that in...I mean...since the book/films are named after the Hallows....  --The Elder Wand:  what really ticked me off was that Harry broke the Elder Wand and threw it away.  I mean, jeez, I know he didn't want it, but...  He was SUPPOSED to fix his wand, be all happy that it works again, and then leave the Elder Wand with Dumbledore.  Very disappointed in this....  --Neville x Luna:  wat....?  No; just...no...  --Percy:  he made two minor appearances (I admit, I didn't know it was him at first...).  I really wanted to see the scene where he reunited with his family, and ESPECIALLY the scene where he shields Fred's body after he's killed.      In all, I loved the movies, but I felt like it was rushed in the sense that the film makers were cramming in order to meet a deadline.  They left so many unanswered questions, and left out so much (again, I KNOW movie = not book).  I loved it, but I still could have been better.  The flaws aren't going to stop me from buying it when it comes out, though (hardcore Potter fan).  I do look forward to see what the deleted scenes are going to be.    Well, that was long-winded, anyways, wasn't it.  Oops.  EmmKays
B001CMOH8G|2.0|I watched it based on its 5-star ratings.... Not for me, not for most people I know.  If you are not a huge Bowie fan, I would think twice about this one.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|Not exactly for young kids, this action movie has an entertaining perspective in the psychology of a professional soldier. There is not much dialog; instead the movie relies on visuals to help tell the story.    I have waited for a Blu-Ray copy to come available (I've seen it before on DVD) and I believe it was worth the purchase.
0618164413|1.0|I handled the book very carefully, yet in a short time the binding of the book came apart.  Very disappointed with the quality of  the binding.  I thought I was getting a lasting book for my collection but not so..it may as well go in the trash.
0061992860|3.0|I've had the SAS Survival Manual for years and purchased this guide to carry with me as part of my emergency survival kit.  It packs a lot of information for such a small book and doesn't take up much space. Is it worth having?  Can't hurt.
B002HK9I04|5.0|Great movie. Matt and Trey have a commentary track. If you already have the VHS, buy this for the commentary. It's worth it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The Little Mermaid is a wonderful princess movie. It was one of my favorites as a kid and I still love it. I have a 3 year old who I knew would love it but this is one that they aren't selling in stores. But I was able to find it on here. I was so excited to purchase it for my daughter and we have already watched it so many times! Would highly recommend this movie!
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This is a morally questionable show, however the only thing you won't be questioning is how riveting and suspenseful it is. Season 3 is by far the best yet and I would recommend it to anyone.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I've never been this excited for superhero a movie. Everything appealed to me, the WWII setting, the cast, the difference from usual Marvel movies, and the fact that it was the last movie leading up to the Avengers. And I wasn't the only one, a lot of hype surrounded Captain America: The First Avenger. But does it live up to all this anticipation? My answer: pretty much, yeah.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that Chris Evans is perfect as Steve Rogers, the skinny, patriotic weakling turned superheroic icon. This is a character who wants to be selfless and brave, to lay down his life for his country, but his physical limitations just won't let him.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is spot on. Stanley Tucci is Dr. Erskine, who chooses Steve to become the first of a new breed of super soldier that will give the Allies an advantage in the war, especially against the Nazi division called HYDRA. He ends up serving as a mentor to Steve, and is also quite funny. Tommy Lee Jones is great as Colonel Phillips, proving a lot of dry wit. Haley Atwell is Agent Peggy Carter, and sometimes characters like her frustrate me, as if they're only there to make a feministic statement. Fortunately that is completely averted, and while the Carter/Rogers romance is nothing to write home about, Atwell and Evans handle the characters well and they get many fun scenes. Dominic Cooper is Howard Stark, and his swaggering performance just screams \\"Iron Man's dad!\\"<br /><br />I kept expecting Hugo Weaving's Johann Shmidt (otherwise called the Red Skull), the head of HYRDA, to erupt into campiness and explode at Toby Jone's Arnim Zola. After all, Dr. Zola isn't exactly comfortable with Shmidt breaking away from Hitler and having HYRDA go rogue, and he's had some failures too. But instead, they both have very interesting interaction and the characters are well played.<br /><br />There's something to be said about The First Avenger's wartime atmosphere. You get the distinct feeling that you're in the proto-Marvel universe. This is what started it all, Cap is chronologically Marvel's first hero. And not just any hero, but a symbol, an icon, not a mystery man. Kids in the Marvel world grow up reading about a very real super soldier who saved the world.<br /><br />The action is great and you can see everything that's going on (unlike a certain other superhero movie about a certain Norse god...). And don't worry, all the cool shield throws and Cap stuff you would expect are present.<br /><br />Okay, so what I do I not like? Well, for one, Sebastian Stan as Steve's best friend, Buck Barnes, gets really shortchanged and I think they should've done more with him.<br /><br />But other than that, I think there's one central problem that leads to a lot of other problems. And here it is: By film's end, I still felt like Steve Rogers was still that Brooklyn kid who just became a hero. I don't think this is Evans' fault at all. First, the pacing gets messed up. Everything is fine until, right after Steve goes on his very first adventure as Captain America, the movie jumps into a montage. Suddenly Cap is leading the Howling Commandos and destroying HYDRA war factories. I wanted to see more of his training, more of the camaraderie of him and the Commandos. As if that weren't enough, we don't really know how the heroes are taking down these factories, we just see them fighting. That way, HYDRA is very unthreatening, and I never believed for a second that they could take over the world. You could say that Cap's WWII career doesn't feel storied enough. I would have liked multiple clashes with the Red Skull, (and that way there would have been way more Hugo Weaving). He should not have been a looming big bad, but a true, diabolical nemesis.<br /><br />Finally I must talk of Cap's finest hour. Ya know, he gets frozen. It's done alright, but it's also in the shadow of what the TV series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes has done. In EMH, Bucky and Cap have prevented the Red Skull from using the power of the other Realms and winning war. The Skull is going to get away in a rocket, so Cap tells Bucky to stay behind and resolves to defeat the Skull once and for all. The rocket takes off, with Cap climbing the outside ladder, only for him to find that Bucky has followed him. Then Red Skull ejects using his 'jet seat', safely getting away and revealing that the rocket is going to explode. Bucky can't jump off because his foot is snagged on a broken part of the ladder, but when Cap attempts to save him, Bucky just kicks him off to save HIM. Cap falls into the water, about to be frozen for the next seventy years, while Bucky dies in the explosion. In The First Avenger, Cap is alone, and it's less...dramatic. Still, it's good, and I won't spoil what the last thing he says is.<br /><br />I have some frustrations, but I still think that Captain America: The First Avenger is a great movie. It's got it all; the tone, the themes, the characters, the acting, the action. Next to the first Iron-Man, this is arguably the Marvel cinematic universe's best movie so far.<br />8 out of 10kull from using the power of the other Realms and winning war.

0062060554|5.0|Compelling, tightly written, suspenseful and fascinating. I couldn't put it down, and had to read it again after I finished and had all the pieces of the puzzle. I am astonished to see that S. J. Watson is a man -- he captured a woman's voice so well.    My only quibble are the scenes in which the main character, whose memory loss makes her wake up each morning believing she is in her late 20s, complains about her actual 47 year old body. I can see how waking up 47 years old would be a shock for a 29 year-old, but 47 year old bodies and hands are really not THAT wrinkled and droopy. Maybe this betrays the author's gender.
B0050KEVO6|3.0|The game is a novel idea: Combine elements to make different ones. After a few plays it gets kind of old IMO. There are no hints as to what elemental combos might work and no way to keep track of what you've tried to combine before.  All in all it's not a bad app if you're sitting somewhere with an hour to waste.
B00005TQKQ|1.0|The Sony 8mm Head Cleaner was a waste of money!  $35 down the drain!  Ended up buying a used camera to see my videos for over $100!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|You can read the other reviews to see the tremendous praise this movie is getting. Maybe the only flaw is that it was released after Pelham 123. I had no desire to see this on the heels of Pelham 123. Big mistake! Tremendous film filled with memorable cinematic moments. Denzel Washington shines, as usual, but his young sidekick (Chris Pine) steals the show with the film's best sequence as his character, Will, connects the rescue engine with the runaway train, as news helicopters hover close-by to record this heroic effort. Incredible filmmaking!    I'm sorry I didn't see this movie in the movie theater. Wow!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I liked the idea of the story, and Dashner does extremely well at keeping the readers read. Whenever I read, I chose the chapter to mark when stop reading, but I always ended up around 10 chapters after that. But the sad thing that pissed me off was that sometimes things can be so predictable. First off, it's kind of like the movie \\"2012\\". He somehow gets lucky so many times it's too unrealistic. I'm trying hard not to spoil the story, but for the people who know what I'm trying to say: you know what's going to happen between Thomas and the \\"only girl in the story\\". I hate stories where the main characters begin as \\"the chosen one\\" (which makes me not like Harry Potter that much). And you know what's going to happen to his \\"best buddy\\" when there's a thrown knife right about to kill Thomas.
0307592839|3.0|I have to say I was surprised, no make that stunned, when I saw this book had won a Pulitzer. I'd read it and found it mostly boring and forgettable. Everyone's taste in literature is different, and obviously, I don't have a Pulitzer vote so what do I know. I thought the pace was plodding and at the end, there was very little point to having read it.    And, the huge sections of PowerPoint slides posing as chapters? That comes off as a desperate ploy rather than genuine creativity. If you want some creative fiction that's edgy and exploratory, read Vonnegut. Let the powerpoint in the conference room.
038541627X|5.0|Excellent book. Arrived within the given dates and in acceptable condition. Thank you seller.<br />These stories are pretty hit or miss. Some of them are amazing but some of them are just ok. A solid book tho and necessary for any sci fi collection
B004EPZ070|5.0|I received this order quickly, and the movie is very funny, loved it, will probely watch it again. thanks, joyce
B004XQO90O|4.0|Source Code is a Sci Fi Thriller with an Inceptionish premise.  A US soldier(Jake Gyllenhaal) is trapped in a capsule of some kind and is being sent to an alternate past over and over again where he awakes on a train and keeps repeating the same sequence of events on an 8 minute duration.  After these 8 minutes have passed, all of a sudden a bomb explodes killing everyone on the train, and he returns to his capsule.  The soldier is informed little by little about why he is there and what the point of all this is.  He is dead and exists in a strange new technology called \\"Source Code\\" and the military is using him to find out who was the bomber on the train.  The soldier must go back over and over again, looking for clues and searching for this mysterious bomber.<br /><br />I first saw this movie and the video store and I'm a sucker for Sci Fi so I thought I'd give it a try.  At first I was a little confused about what was going on but I was instantly sucked in and wanted to know more, You're right there with the soldier trying to find out who the bomber is, searching for clues and anything suspicious.  They did a great job of creating elaborate characters, building a solid script, and creating an atmosphere where you just had to know what was gonna happen next, and the special are very well done.  The score, writeen by Chris P. Bacon, fit the scenes very well and helped to build suspense. Kudos to Duncan Jones, the director for giving us a real blockbuster.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I watched the interview with Jaycee and Dianne Sawyer and I knew I had to get this book. I had in my mind that if I bought it and wasn't interested in reading it, I'd have at least supported her in purchasing it. I remembered the story of Jaycee from when I was a little girl and it would come on America's Most Wanted and it was frightening. Now that I'm a parent, I cannot imagine going through not knowing where my child was or what they were going through. Jaycee prefaces that she is not a professional writer and she sets up the expectation of jumping around and jumbled thoughts and emotions and that's just what it is. It's her story written by her, how she remembers it and how she wants it to be told. There are parts that I just skimmed past because they were repetative, which is prefaced in the beginning as well. There are some parts that will jerk tears from you but the part that got me the hardest was her reuniting with her best friend. There are parts where you will find yourself saying outloud,'Tell someone who you are!' or 'They do still love you, don't worry!'. I do recommend this book. Portions are a bit graphic but they are told unshamefully. I want to be Jaycee's friend. I'm glad I watched her interview first, it gave her a voice and a personality so as I read it, I could hear her telling the story. Read the book, you won't be disappointed!

B004I8WD6E|5.0|Really impressed with this case. I love Amazon and the fact that they themselves make quality products. I did not use the screen shield that came with it... but the case looks great on my white iphone 4. it has all the openings for each port and feels like a sturdy case. I love the clear, it allows you to see the iPhone in all its glory. Not many are a fan of the circles on the back and I admit they are a little tacky but i dont mind, they add a nice abstract effect to the case and accents the Apple logo on the back of the phone. SO far I have not dropped the phone with the case on, but knowing that its made of TPU i know that it will make it thru small bumps. I used the Speck Pixelskin HD before this and it worked well when dropped the few times that I did, so i am sure that this one will be fine. I would say to be careful about the openings because there is still a possibility of damage, but overall the case should do fine. The one thing I worry about is the flash on the back, though I have not tried it.. most cases now use a black ring around the camera hole to lessen the distortion with the flash, they did leave a larger hole for the camera so I dont believe it will be an issue. basically... for 9 bucks this case cant be beat. GREAT deal. if you need a nice basic case.. get this it will be a good one.
0780626966|5.0|I've been a Freddy fan since 11 and I was thrilled to have gotten this set. I got it back in 2007, but I just recently purchased the Neca Freddy figures from the ORIGINAL A Nightmare on Elm St. movies 1 and 2 so that made me decide to do a review on this set. I really like all of the Freddy movies except for Wes Craven's New Nightmare which is a pointless movie and isn't related at all to the series and I despise the God awful 2010 remake. I like the first two original Freddy films the best because he was really serious. He was cool in movies 3-6 and FvJ, but he was more comical as well as dangerous in those sequels, where in the first two he was way more on the serious side. Each dvd has basic features such as scene selection, 'Jump to a nightmare' which is being able to see only the kill/Freddy scenes, different audio options, audio commentaries, and a booklet. The extra dvd has documentaries about the characters, the making of the films, how Freddy was invented, and the ideas around him and what he does. Lastly the box set comes with 3D glasses for the 6th film Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare because you can views parts of that film in 3D and the glasses make it come to life. So That's the skinny on this set and if you love blood lust films, this is your set.
B004G6009U|5.0|This is a cute film. I really like Disney's version of Rapunzel. I think this is a great movie for kids and even for adults. There are messages about selfishness (from the villans), forgiveness & etc. I think that anybody can get something positive out of this movie and there are funny parts to.
0446563048|4.0|I found Delivering Happiness inspirational and motivating with regard to making changes to preserve the culture at my company.  Similar to Zappos, we have a very collegial culture, and sometimes my mentors outside the organization have frowned upon it, suggesting we're not a \\"real\\" company, or that we are improper in some way.  However, after reading about Zappos, it dawned on me that what we are trying to do is not wrong, but rather that corporate culture can be just as innovative as products themselves, each reaching out to a target market of employees who live life by the same values by the company wishes its employees to abide.  While my reaction to many of Tony's suggestions was, \\"of course! duh!\\", I nonetheless probably would have never thought to do it, or had the confidence that those tactics / ideas / activities were at all effective, until I read the evidence (albeit, a rosy picture).  I glommed onto the idea of building a pipeline, the culture book, and other suggestions, and am currently figuring out ways to implement them in my own office, to preserve our culture as we rapidly grow.<br /><br />The reason why I didn't give this book five stars is that the first and third parts are less interesting than the part about Zappos itself.  The first part is funny and engaging, but I agree with some of the negative reviews that Tony paints a picture of easy come, easy money.  While he appears to be such a role model leader in the second part, the first part can be somewhat demotivating for readers.  I also am not a fan of people philosophizing on happiness and other such things, as Tony did in the third part.  He's no expert on what it takes to build a lifetime of happiness given less than three decades of life.  Really his expertise is in creating a good company, and I rather wish he stuck to what he knows.<br /><br />Finally, there were some story inconsistencies that also contributed to my 4 star review.  Like, what ever happened to Nick?  And Sanjay?  Maybe I missed it (I'm a notoriously undetailed reader), but one minute they're BFFs and among company leadership, the next minute they've vanished from the book.a notoriously undetailed reader), but one minute they're BFFs and among company leadership, the next minute they've vanished from the book.
B003Y5H5A6|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen this year and, for me, that is big. I've watched The Rise of The Planet of The Apes and the new X-Men movie, but I really liked Captain America. It has a lot of positive messages and different scenes and action parts that keep you interested. It isn't the same old thing.     Although, I wish Captain America would have said, \\"I love you,\\" to his girlfriend, when talking on the phone. It seemed like they were getting to that point but he never confessed it. I think that would have been a heartwarming moment.    Other than that..... the movie was great! It's a family friendly video and you don't have to worry about your kids hearing or seeing anything bad. I can't recall any curse words and there were no inappropriate scenes or jokes. The women in the film were also well dressed and I didn't see any women dressing provocatively.     I give this movie an A plus and I recommend this movie to anyone!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This product first was extremely easy to install and was very user friendly. The swtich on the front allows you to easily switch from digital opitcal to coax. Also it was nice and compact to be able to hide away
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This is a 5 star movie! This is a great film with a very interesting plot, characters and movie. This movie will keep you interested through out the whole film and this is a movie every person should have in their home!    Sometimes we see the same things over and over in movies and we know what to expect but in Ratatouille everything is NEW! =) This is one of the best Pixar films out there you must buy it!! You won't regret it!! Trust me!!
B002M2T1UO|4.0|This is a great way to purchase the series, taking up very little space with the coffee table book design.  Our only complaint is that removing/replacing of the discs from each page can be difficult, with only a thin piece of paper separating them from the book.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is a lot of fun and a great value. I like that it gets complex and challengling as it goes on. I think it is cool that there are a lot of leavels.
B002JODUI4|5.0|What can you say in a music review.  Like all art forms, it is so subjective, I may love this one, while it makes someone else's ears bleed.  I like his style and it stays in my iPhone, but I'm not trying to persuade anyone.  If you like dance/house/electronic/dubstep try it out, you may like his stuff.

B001S86J1C|5.0|So many memories. I can't remember the first time I saw Ferris, but it has to be one of the top 10 comedies I've ever seen. Not quite up to Young Frankenstein, but definitely an awesome fun time. I'll watch it again and again.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|Seiko has long been a favorite brand because of the style and durablility of their watches so when I was in the market for a diver's watch Seiko was my first choice.  The model SKX009K2 with the metal bracelet is the perfect watch.  It looks good, has the 200 meter water resistance rating, and the dial is clear and easy to read under all conditions. This watch is also an excellent size at roughly 40mm in diameter.  Very easy to wear with any choice of clothing from a suit to sweat shirt and jeans.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Great movie its aim more for the older kids Johnny Deep is great one of my fave hope he does more cg movies
B001EN71CW|5.0|One the best shows out there. Like everyone else that watched it and fought for it to return, I'm sad that they cancelled it with all that potential. Sound and picture quality are good, in the darker scenes you can see some of the grainy-ness of the film because of the type of camera they used.  Great characters, great story, great acting...it will be missed.
0375842209|5.0|A read that left me in tears, I will go back to this one again and again. This one has found a permenant residence in my heart.
B0055PMUSU|5.0|Like virtually every movie made based on a true story, it was a little overly dramatic.  But it was very well done and AnnaSophia Robb does an excellent job. Some say oh her acting wasn't as good as Dennis Quaid, ya think?  Geesh. Anyway you really thought she didn't have an arm. That in itself was kind of amazing to me. She just pulled it off so well (pun intended).  Yep it has religious undertones in it. If that offends some, then TOO BAD!   But imagine being a young athlete and losing your arm, but then when you get back home your thought isn't oh my how will I live with this disability, but what do I need to do so I can compete in surfing again.   She also becomes an inspiration to others and she understands that is part of Gods plan for her as well.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Save your money folks. This is a story of a lonely girl finding love in a disastrous boy. The ending is sloppy at best.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|This movie reminds me of what happens to wallstreet apprentices. The main character stumbles into something that seems like an opportunity. But as he gets deeper into it, he sees the danger; but is so far in, he can not get out of it. Of course, there is a love interest that makes everything more dangerous for him and her. It becomes a balancing act, one that he has to win at if everything is to turn out all-right. My husband and I liked this one.
B003OUXECE|3.0|What you see is what you get with Bioshock: Rapture. Very, very few novels based on video games are worth reading, which I assume is because they are pre-written stories looking for authors, rather than than stories produced by authors. The publisher is more interested in brand than substance.  BS:R is a prequel to the video game series Bioshock. Players of the game will recognize events, places, characters and quotes directly from Bioshock and Bioshock 2. In fact, they may grow weary of all the recognition. In the games, players are given hints and information in the form of \\"audio diaries\\" recorded by the population of Rapture (Andrew Ryan's underwater dystopia - the setting for both games and this book). In BS:R, several of these \\"audio diaries\\" are quoted word for word, and sometimes in incorrect context. There are so many direct quotes that I actually grew tired of them about 75% of the way through the book.  There are no surprises for readers, here. BS:R is a straight march down the Rapture timeline leading to the first game.   As a lover of the Bioshock game series, I felt completely at home in BS:R, and got basically what I was looking for; a return to the underwater city that I love (and love to hate). That is the most (I think) a reader can get out of this novel.
B004XQO90O|5.0|What a thrilling ride this movie took us on from beginning to end. It is not predictable but has an astonishing ending. My husband and I liked it very much.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Exciting, surprising!! Keeps you guessing and coming back for more!  Wonderful writing and acting!! So glad a friend turned me on to this series!!
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Ok, so i must admit at first that i really thought this movie was going to be bad so i went into it with already low expectaions.  I even waited for it to come out at redbox to see it.  About the movie, the opening sequence was really good, probably one of the best openings i have seen in awhile.  After watching that though, the movie takes a huge spiral down.  The main character Baby Doll is put in a mental hospital, she dances and gets put in this world where she can get hit by a two story samurai made of metal, going about mach 1 into a house, pretty much destroying it and then gets up and is all ok.  If your confused , don't worry i was too.  After that scene I knew she would never be in any real danger and that this world held no rules or consequences for anything that happens in it.  Yeah I know its a world created by her, but really doesn't make for good drama when the main enemy force of this movie can hurl you like a cannon into a house and you live.  My final thoughts on the film are that is was made to combine to awesome things into one movie, awesome fighting and an all hot chick cast.  They got the all hot chick cast down in my opinion and the action sucked though in my opinion as well.  Others may have liked this movie, but the fact is there is never any real threat danger or tension in this movie so its not a good story nor something I would recommend anyone to watch.    Thanks for reading my review and hoped you enjoyed it and it helped.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is the most well done transition from book to tv/movie I have ever seen.  The books are so epic and amazing.  I was prepared to be disappointed in the show, but once again, George and HBO pulled through.  They delivered an amazing story in a way that I would have never thought possible.  I HIGHLY recommend this show, and even more highly recommend the books.  Watch it, read it, buy it, love it.

159420229X|4.0|My review won't be all that extensive.  While this book didn't go into various memory techniques as deeply as I would have liked, I still found it to be an extremely interesting read and highly recommend it.  It's nice knowing that anyone can train their memory if they apply sufficient time and effort into doing so.  I tried one of the techniques out (the Memory Palace) along with the author as he was trying to remember a \\"To Do\\" list and I very easily remembered everything.  In fact, I still remember everything from it.  That's quite impressive for me, so it's a testament to how good these techniques will work if actually used.<br /><br />Applying them to real life situations though (those that don't require memorizing a deck of cards, for instance) is questionable and that is touched upon in the book also.<br /><br />I wouldn't consider this a self-help book as some might, so don't expect it to be like one.  It's just an informative look into the world of memory.  Some history and science behind some mnemonic techniques and looking at various people who have incredible memories (ie savants like Kim Peek) and people on the other end of the spectrum who forget stuff the moment they are distracted.<br /><br />Overall, good book.  :)
0765350386|5.0|I loved this book.     I started reading \\"The Way of kings\\", by the same author, and I was looking for a thinner book to read on the way to my job every morning. I purchased the first book of the Mistborn trilogy based on a friend´s  recommendation.     The book is charming. The characters are well structured and charismatic, and the world Sanderson has created is solid and believable.     In my point of view, the two most important things about this book are the innovative way the magic is presented (the metals and the way allomancers use them) and the main character, the poor Vin, one of the most charismatic heroines ever created. The definition of an underdog. You care about her. You want to see her overcome the odds and succeed. By the end of the book you feel her as a friend.    It is also remarkable the way Sanderson presents the social differences between classes, and how they interact between. The long time oppressed skaa and their fear of the mist, the arrogant nobility and their parties, the Great Houses putting together a network of conspiracy, betrayals and alliances...    As I said, I absolutely loved this work. If you want to live a beautiful experience, begin your journey across the Final Empire and let lady Valette hold your hand... but be careful... you could fall in love ;)
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Seems to work fine. Probably not for overclocking, but cools my qx9770 just fine at stock speeds (3.2). You do need to pull the motherboard to install this, but it is a really nice mount. Hard to over tighten etc. Over all a very nice positive mounting system for LGA 775 socket. PWM is a plus too.
0307460444|5.0|I received my item in great condition and am very pleased with the excellent value from amazon.com! The book is in perfect condition and came in a timely manner from when I ordered it. I am very happy with this purchase!
B0038Q3UKA|5.0|Radu Lupu is one of the finest pianists before the public today and is comparable to the best of the past.This  collection offers the listener an overall view of Lupus ability to change performance moods to suit each selection  His playing is sensitive and brings out the best of each piece, each one of which put together gives an excellent  overall view of the composer's feeling. Lupu's playing is reminiscent to that of Murray Perahia, both of whom are  among my favorite pianists. I already had several of Lupu's CDs, but knew Amazon would have the excellent varied  collection that comprises this set.
0590431129|5.0|Adorable book with pages that open up. Very sweet and cute for children from toddlers to old kids. Nice illustrations.
0061729078|5.0|Love the book.  The service of Amazon was great and the price of the product.  I will be definetly be buying more things on Amazon.
0439023521|4.0|Fun book.  I wasn't  sure at first but it sucks you in.  Now you have to read all three.  Now my kids want to read it before the movie comes out.
B002LFIZDG|5.0|It took me awhile to really appreciate this one. I tend to really listen for alot of musical detail, and I like profound lyrics that inspire thought. The Kings are a bit more distant - in a good way - their lyrics are much more stream of consciousness, than say the studied poetics of Paul Simon. And yet, they are excellent in completely their own distant way.     How this cd works for me is to put it on, and sort of weave in and out of the music while I'm in some sort of quiet, introspective state. It is a very pleasant sort of Sunday afternoon listen. The processed guitar melodies are really quite gorgeous - airy and very light. They sort of drift through your memory and linger there. It really helps to bring you into a very relaxed pleasant state.     If you really listen, the way they weave their guitars together, the way they weave their voices together (the chorus of Rule My World actually plays up the difference in their voices very nicely), it is something very rare. Quite beautiful.     I never thought of myself as \\"an aggressive listener\\" who always sought musical detail to delight in. The Kings taught me to be a passive listener and let the music take me into their artistic space.     Very reflective and very nice. I actually find the last half the cd, from Renegade on, to be the best as it just flows from one tasty piece to the next. The first four songs are of varying quality, featuring the best (Boat Behind) and the worst (maybe the second tune as it might be a bit cliched - but it still isn't really bad) of the album, at least in terms of my ears. The last 8 or 9 are more homogenous and even in terms of quality, and that is where the Kings' relaxing spell gets woven.
0553801473|1.0|George has written 5 books of a supposedly 7 book series. There was the threat that the Others were returning to do something... You've got two books left in which to tie up the myriad of loose ends AND the introduce the invasion of the Others. Good luck with that. I'll just read wikipedia to get a quick plot synopsis since George has apparently never met a word he didn't like.
0553801473|5.0|I bought the book as a present for my godson because he had read the collection and he loved the book.
0307887960|4.0|I'm a definate low carb eating fan.  I went on the Atkin's diet and lost over 70 pound and kept it easily off for 3 years, but have slid a bit on and off in the past few years, but going back on the initial plan takes it back off again in very little time.  So I thought I would try the Dukan to see the results in trying to get off the 15 pounds I'd gained over last winter. I scanned the book initially to gage a difference in the diets and then centered on reading the stage one..Attack Phase and starting it.      I felt that this book and diet to be somewhat more complicated than the Atkins diet.  Lots of more tweeking of what foods you can eat on what days.  I really didn't care for this, had to keep referring back to the book.  I found the book to be a little dis-jointed in reading it.... maybe this is from the translation from French to English. I did lose the weight, but not as quickly.  I did like the facet of adding oat bran to your daily diet, for any Low Carb diet does have a constipating effect that one constantly battles with and most resort to eating the alternative sugar alcohol candy or bars to help with that (sugar Alcohol's have a laxative effect, for some it is very extreme)but it can sometimes effect your body and put your weight loss into a stall, so I prefer to not resort to them.  The Atkin's diet does refer to using bran to help with constipation, but does not actively require you to use it daily as the Dukan does.  I do appreciate how this book does contain several creative recipes in the back section of the book.  I found most to my liking and will definately be using them on a regular basis in my diet plan.  I think it's a good plan, I will definately use it, tweeked a little to my own life preferences, a little more structured, but all in all I would recomend giving it a try, it is a good life plan diet.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a LONG time. By far the best adaptation of the book. It made me want to go read the book again! Absolutely beautiful. It left me in tears. Perfect!
B005CVWWJY|5.0|I loved every second I spent reading this book. I wish I had written RPO. Get it! You won't regret it. ENJOY!
B003PPDBQ2|4.0|I sincerely hope that Lupton will be writing more books like this one. The plot was pretty convoluted but kept my attention all the way through to the nail-biting finish. This book stayed with me long after I had finished it.
0061997811|5.0|I knew the book was going to be interesting, but all the neat inserts made it even better. I was sooooooo pleased when i received this book.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|A really great read. I enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down! It was not what I expected and actually more. The plot twists and turns keeps you guessing!
0802473156|5.0|Very informative and should be very helpful to anyone in any type of relationship, even friendships. Highly recommend to any and everyone.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't think I've reviewed much in my extensive amazon/kindle history, but this book is outstanding.  Do you read io9 or gizmodo? Did you enjoy Snow Crash, Neuromancer, or Blade Runner?  Did you grow up in the 1970s or 1980s and play video games? Did you watch syndicated sitcoms after school? Then you will like this book. I liked it so much I might buy it again in hard copy to keep on my shelf and lend/gift out to geekily-inclined friends.
034552554X|5.0|WOW! WOW! and WOW! What a beautifully written novel. The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh is definitely a keeper. Victoria Jones has spent her life in the foster care system. Now that she has turned eighteen it's time to be on her own. The novel rotates between past and present where we learn of Victoria's triumphs and hardships. For most of Victoria's young adult life, she spent it with Elizabeth who teaches her about the language of flowers and that each flower has a distinct meaning. She carries this knowledge to present day where she gets a job at a florist. Customers continue to come to her with specific requests for flowers to heal and/or help them in someway. During the time working at the florist, she meets Grant who happens to be Elizabeth's nephew. He shares her love of flowers which blooms to actual love. Some parts in this novel were very sad seeing what kids in the foster care system have to go through and how it effects their future. In the end, Victoria makes peace with her life and starts a new beginning. Loved the dictionary in the back with all of the flower meanings: my favorite flowers: Gardenia (Refinement); Lilacs (First Emotions of Love); Sunflower (False Riches). Thank you Ms. Diffenbaugh for such a wonderful novel. Looking forward to your next one.
0385534639|5.0|I first chose this book, knowing nothing else about it, because of the cover art. I am a fan of clocks and black, white, and red stripes, so it drew me in immediately. I'm not that big a fan of circus freaks, but reading that it was a \\"Night Circus\\" made it seem a bit cooler.<br /><br />After reading the first few pages, I was put off by the tense it's written in. I'm not used to reading this sort of writing, and it irritated me so much that I couldn't enjoy it. I fully expected to be leaving a low review. The concept and story set up pushed me to move forward. I HAD to know what this challenge was all about!<br /><br />I have to say this book totally won me over (thus the 5 star rating). Perhaps the tense made it seem as if you were really there, walking through the mystical circus, smelling the caramel corn, watching the clock spin and change. Or maybe it was the two players, both so innocent of the game, yet intoxicatingly dangerous. Whatever it was that pulled me in, it held me tight and wouldn't let go until the last page of the book.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy imagining other worlds such as snowy wonderland-filled tents or seas of ink with floating boats made entirely of books where the sails are book pages fluttering in the breeze... you will be transfixed. A lot of the imagery in this book reminds me of the movie \\"What Dreams May Come\\". You also get a feeling of falling down the rabbit hole. All the players are familiar, but somehow much more than what they seem. And you aren't sure - even in the end - what each player has hidden up their sleeve.
B0050VI5SI|5.0|This is easily the catchiest album i've heard in years!! Perfect timing for the hot summer weather... it's the ultimate summer day album. Trip to the beach with windows down, wakeboarding on a boat, canoeing in a lake.... it's the perfect summer soundtrack!<br />if you're a fan... check out their latest music video... you will love it!<br />[...]
B001E45XT4|3.0|I found it to be good for gaming and other things but after a few months it snapped near one of the earphones, It may have been due to the fact that it is not flexible anywhere on the headband. I would not recommend this if you have a head that is slightly above average size by Plantronics's Standards.
1451629184|5.0|A great book with a story told from the main character that had to live this hell in earth.  I'd recommend it and, also, could be used as warn for parents, as nobody knows what could be waiting for kids on their way to school.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|Quick response received on time and product was in good shape truly recommend seeing this movie none quite like it.
B004NOH9LW|4.0|To believe or not to believe ...<br />Is that really the question?<br />I believe it's the asking of these questions(and others), the desire to explore possibilities, open minded people, & creative beings that can bring such a seemingly heavy topic to an artistic level making it both inviting & intriguing!<br /><br />I'm always skeptical when an award winning actor becomes a director/producer.<br />Even the great Clint Eastwood!<br />I'm not one to seek out movies for that specific reason...however, I do have to confess that I'm a sucker for a handsome & talented actor such as Matt Damon!<br />I watched the movie's preview a few times before I finally decided to give it a shot.  It was one of those nights when not much jumped out at me & I decided to give something I might not normally watch a chance!  Good thing I did so!<br />I have the attention span of a butterfly - I see something shiny & flutter off to the next shiny object.<br />So, to say that this movie captivated me from start to finish is no great feat!  I was pulled in & held in a state of wonder.  I've never been on one side of the coin or the other of the idea of psychics or whether there is a white light, life after death, or hereafter.  But, I pride myself on keeping an open mind in every aspect of my life possible.  So it wasn't a far stretch to sit back, open my mind & take in the cinematic beauty of this film's message.<br />The story & its characters are seamlessly sewn together to form a breath taking fabric.<br />I enjoyed having a leading actor such as Matt Damon who talented enough to carry a movie but also was able to let the other characters of the film shine through.<br />To me, director's such as Ang Lee & Clint Eastwood are some of the select few directors that come to mind that you can instantly tell that music plays a strong piece in their attempt to tell their story!<br />I enjoy a movie that tickles all of my senses, keeps my attention, leaves me in a state of wonder & has me wanting to persuade friends & family to watch it too!<br />If you have an open mind & an open heart I highly recommend you watch \\"Hereafter\\"!t too!  If you have an open mind & an open heart I highly recommend you watch \\"Hereafter\\"!
B000JIHP88|3.0|I decided to get this mobile because it is very cute and matches my sons decor. It functions awesome and the battery life is very good. My only problem is that you can not even hear this mobile in the same room with it on. My son loves to hear music and loves to watch the mobile move so we had to buy another small toy that plays music for him.
0307887960|5.0|In the past year I have tried Atkins, South Beach, The Cinch Diet and protein shake meal replacements without much success.  I have been at a serious plateau and can't seem to get those last 5-10lbs of baby weight off no matter how hard I workout and diet.  Well, today is my 5th day on the Dukan Attack phase and I can't beleive how the scale has been moving-from almost 134lbs to 127 in 4 days!  I finally broke the 130lb barrier which is a huge mental boost.  I have felt very good and enjoyed many of the recipes.  On other diets, I have felt irritable and tired.  I am very grateful to Dr. Dukan and I hope to follow through all four phases so that this can be a permanent lifestyle for me.  How great is it that in the third phase (Consolidation) you can have one or two \\"celebration\\" meals per week which include an appetizer, main course, dessert as well as a glass of wine and it is supposed to be anything you want!  Can't wait for that celebration cupcake.  In the mean time, I am happy to be resembling my old self before having 3 babies.  I highly recommend trying this diet for its quick results which are incredibly motivating and uplifting.
1451629184|5.0|Excellent book! Comes straight from the point of view of Jaycee Dugard. The books kind of jumps around,but it feels like a very intimate account of what she endured, and she simply wrote what she thought.
0802130208|4.0|The book came really fast and was just as the ad described.  The book is very interesting...different from my usual James Patterson.  I really like it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.
B003O86MY8|5.0|I heard David Garrett on the car radio, checked with Amazon, ordered it and received in 3 days. Service is great, Garrett is even better.
0823095223|5.0|This book wasn't at all what I was expecting. This book is particularly good for anyone wanting to understand techniques in wax sculpting. I have avoided wax because of my shear ignorance in the subject but after reading this book I'm going to give it a try. The book has inputs from at least seven sculptors. Polymer, epoxy putty, and Castilene are also mentioned, but the book is really devoted to working in wax. Glad I bought it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|My son and I loved this mini mystery game!  It was cool to be able to download it to my phone and play on the go.  We usually have to play at home together.  It makes a road trip much more bearable.
