B003YOXINU|5.0|Always has been always will be. His voice ranges from deep and guttural to ear-peircing screams that just SHOCK this monkey every time!Keep the music alive, Peter!
B008KE3960|5.0|Good entertainment value.  You can play and earn enough points to buy upgrades without paying real money.  There are lots of levels, replay value is high.  Highly recommended.
B005EVVESM|5.0|But dang that boy still knows how to hit the top of the charts. Almost every song is hummable if not downright singable, no matter HOW poor my voice is compared to his!!
0062103377|4.0|Bought this as a gift for a friend who got us hooked on the TV show.  I really wish that I had bought one for myself too!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I fell in love with the characters instantly. I am 22, an avid reader, and don't like silly-romantic books easily, but this actually has a great story line. I definitely recommend as a light read.
B0073U2FB2|1.0|this movies was a stupid waste of time and money i would not recommend anyone see or purchase it a very boring and dumn movie
B00846REIS|4.0|I know lots of people compare these books to the Fifty Shades trilogy but, I don't think that is fair. I love BOTH for different reasons. Yes they are both erotica and yes they both have gazillionaires who fall for younger women, and yes both men are dominant but, they both fall for totally different types of women and the stories are not that similar. I've learned NOT to compare books from the same genre after reading and LOVING this book. This story is about 2 'broken souls' who find each other and have a LOT of obstacles to overcome. I must admit that some of the words used are major turn-offs for me but, the story is so great that I can overlook them (which is why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars) **HIGHLY RECOMMEND**
B00005B36H|5.0|Good cd, shipped fast and not very menu scratches on it. Played smooth and did not skip during the playback
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I enjoyed Anthony's book and found it to be very honest and genuine. I didn't feel like he was pulling any punches, and that this book was highly confessional for him. Very entertaining.
B00000099Y|5.0|Good cd, shipped fast and not very menu scratches on it. Played smooth and did not skip during the playback
B004NS710C|5.0|This is a great, clean action movie about a runaway train that threatens a Pennsylvania city. It has non-stop action, and tells much of the story through the news reporters who follow the action with fast-moving helicopters that fly alongside the train, swerving to avoid obstacles. Mixed in with the action are several personal stories that are very believable - a man trying to get back together with his ex and child, and a soon-to-be-forced-into-retirement railroad veteran who shows that he knows his trains and their capabilities. Together, they battle the unmanned beast that carries hazardous materials, and battle corporate idiocracy, leading to a cheering victorious end! It leaves you with a good feeling!
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great way of having fun in a very cold winter day , love it! . I can play for a long time, I enjoy my kindle to no end.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is really fun and really makes me think hard. The only problem I had was that some of the ones were really hard and I couldnt get the answer so I used my few free hints only to find that I had to pay fore more. Now I find if on youtube instead.
B005IEF27O|4.0|The sound that made them popular has returned. Only minor gripe is how distant the vocals sound on this album which is why I removed a star.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game the multi player is so good it almost never glitches. it's the best app ever released
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Finally got this to work on a very inexpensive android tablet. It's just like having a kindle. I love it.
1423140605|5.0|Book 3 was a very enjoyable, fastpaced, full of surprises and a few unforseen twists, story.  Thank you Mr. Riordan for the great conversation my family had about this book.  Now please hurry up and finish the next book.  My family can't wait to read what happens next!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun and addictive.  Good way to pass the time when you are bored.  Relaxing to play after all the kids are in bed.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is great! I use it more than the controller that came with the playstation! My only problem was the way they shipped it. It was barely wrapped in some light bubble wrap and basically had nothing to support it. Luckily nothing happened on the way, and it's a great controller! Definitely check it for damage if you order one!
0553386794|5.0|I bought this for my sister as a gift.  It came on time and was packaged well.  She is going to love it.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Everyone should read this book, even if you're not interested in weight loss. Taubes gives an entertaining lesson in history and science that leads to a stunning conclusion: eating the standard American diet will kill you.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie keeps your attention thru out! There is nothing boring about it! Very well planned out and written. The graphics are phenomenal!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! I would recommend it to all women!<br />I would even recommend it to men. I think they could learn a few things.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Being a fan of the original & of the remake I always wanted to see what happened next & this did not disapoint
B004QOB8SO|5.0|BBC's current incarnation of the classic Sherlock Holmes is wonderfully written, acted, presented. Just a bit of British humor, lots of Sherlock/John Watson friendship, a great ensemble cast. Both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are wonders in their roles. Don't miss both season one and season two. And put the subtitles on, so you don't miss all that wonderful dialogue.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All 3 movies are a must have for any Batman fan. Christian Bale gives a dark & gritty feel to the character that it always needed. All 3 movies met & surpassed my expectations.
B004132HZS|5.0|Great writing, directing, acting, a wonderful ensemble cast. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are breath-taking in their roles as Sherlock and John Watson. Don't miss this one.... the BBC always does it up right.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I had all of the other series so I was looking forward to this....the last one.  I would recommend it to any adult that enjoys action.
B0098QBEXO|2.0|I rented this because I love Benedict Cumberbatch and I'm trying to find and watch the work he did before &#34;Sherlock&#34;. This film is British (I am American), and the actors mumble and josh around with each other and make comments under their breath, so without subtitles, I was semi-lost. And since it's a dialogue-driven film, not being able to understand them seriously hindered my enjoyment, of course. I will say that Benedict is *gorgeous* in this movie-- he plays a young man tragically dying of cancer, and he's convincing in his portrayal of the physical problems his character deals with-- fatigue, debility, severe pain, dependence on pain meds, as well as the expected emotional problems of fear, despair and ruthlessly facing his own demise.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, you MUST SEE IT! A sad story, but my oh my, A GREAT ONE! I could watch this over and over and over again.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|to hear a band making this kind of quality music so far in their career is rare... they just keep getting better. their last 3 were amazing and each better then the last. progression and persistence. most bands from the 90s either sell out and start making trash for the radio (korn), get too old sounding or stopped making music all together. these guys have always been one of my top bands but at this point they might just be my #1. this is by far the best heavy rock out there. melodies are beautiful, electronic, airy but still hard as hell. this album is awesome top to bottom, beginning to end! no flaws or fillers. track listing is set up perfectly as well. i cant wait to see them, yet again on another great tour!
B0044LHN0G|5.0|I much enjoyed this film. There was a lot of hard work and time and love put into this film by the crew. I must have watched this movie 20 times, analyzing each and every scene. My type of story line. Great cast. Beautiful. They played their parts so well in English. One of my favorite movies.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The only issue I have with this camera is you have to have the kindle in weird positions. It takes beautiful pics. of me, me  meme. However its only a one sided caera on the tablet so it is impossible to take a pic of someone else and see what you are getting. I have lots of pics of my dogs feet or the ceiling or floor to prove it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Puzzles are nice but sometimes loading fails. very nice free puzzles. Would recommend it's easier to store than a traditional puzzle.
0316223239|5.0|Even though this book is very unlike most others I enjoy I loved this book about a child and his mom living in a room.  Couldn't put it down.  I kept turning the pages to try and figure out why . . .
0399536108|4.0|This book is for everyone who recognizes the importance of living your life on your terms and for the rest who aren't. This should be required reading for high school students.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I was a little weary about buying this movie. I had no idea what it was about and it was marketed to the young female audience. I started this movie and the picture was amazing. The forest was drawn like a work of art. I was amazed at how much detail the Blu Ray contained. At first the events of the movie shocked me a little. I had no clue what was going to happen. There really wasn't a bad guy like most Disney movies; however, it didn't take away from the story. There was a lot of humor to the movie that propelled the story and kept you interested. The best part out of all this movie has to offer is how well the side characters were implemented into the show. The voice acting fit very well with each character and gave the movie a lot of depth. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good Disney Pixar animated film.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has given us another winner with &#34;The Last Man&#34;.  Mitch Rapp is as ruthless and cunning as ever.  Will we see Mitch succeeding Irene Kennedy one day?  Keep them coming Vince.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I will read all of Vince Flynn's books--Reason!!!!  great reading---The last man was one original Mitch Rapp.mindset<br />outstanding.  He always amaze me.
B003RV43X4|5.0|Great movie,brought back memories of watching the original. Like how they made it updated. Going to watch the next one!
B008ENA74E|5.0|I greatly admire Greg Smith for writing this book.  He provides an in-depth look at the workings of the world's most powerful financial institution, and he lays down in concrete, understandable terms what its core problems are.<br /><br />The book was humorous, insightful, and even inspirational.<br /><br />A must read for any individual looking to work on Wall Street or in finance in general.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|because yeahhh!!!<br /><br />why 18 more words required ?<br /><br />for my, costumer, that I write is enough, enough,enough, enough, enough, enough
B009Y8EUT6|4.0|I have no idea where all the reviews are for this. There is no way I'm first. But anyway.<br /><br />This is not like their old stuff. At first, I didn't like that, but a band can't sound the same forever. I wasn't a big fan of Shallow Life, and I thought this album would be much of the same, but it has some good songs on there. Different, but good.<br /><br />My Favorites:<br />-End of Time<br />-Upsidedown<br />-Losing my Religion<br />-Trip the Darkness<br /><br />For $5, I don't regret the purchase.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Fun movie, I can't believe Tom Cruise can sing!<br />All the music brings back memories of my  younger days.  Yeah
B006ZDS7CE|3.0|I really enjoyed listening to this and find it to be a great album to add to my rotation. Unlike a lot of people, I was not introduced to her through Video Games. Instead I came across her by accident, and was pleasantly surprised.Her vocals and the musical style are rich and moving, however I find it really hard to get past what I think are extremely trite lyrics. If you are not the sort of person who pays attention to lyrics, it's not big deal, but for me it's hard to get past (National Anthem for instance). That said, if I don't have to listen to every song in a row, I find myself enjoying every song on here, especially Radio and Summertime Sadness.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderful story told by a great cast.  Moving to a strange country because you can't afford to live in your country when you retire should make this a very sad story but the characters adapt and end up enjoying their new lives.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I have no idea what the purpose of this app is, but it is a total waste of time and storage space.  I is totally useless and don't waste your time or storage space with this.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am an avid reader and this book kept me wanting to read more and more. I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know what would happen next. I recomend you start with book one. There are five in the series. I'm just finishing book 2.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Enjoy the intensity and action would recommend to everyone.  I can't stop watching and wanting more it a must see show
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen probably every version of J.E. ever made and I can  say that this version is the best.<br />It has much more detail in it than any movie, and this Rochester has more of a sense of humor than others I have seen.<br />Would recommend this to any fan of the classics.
1451648537|5.0|I won't be able to contribute more than what has already been said by people way more knowledgeable than myself, so I'll just keep it simple and give this 5 stars and a definite recommendation to anyone who is considering making this purchase because, regardless of literary excellence, the subject of Steve Jobs is one of modern relevance that has impacted the world in many facets, and this is the official biography.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I heard Wbber was making a sequel to POTO.<br />I didn't approve.<br />Then I saw this production.<br />Now I approve.<br />Damn you, Webber.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like this a lot but it doesn't update... I can't play with my friends. If amazon could please get the updates going faster that would be great.
B008Q7O6VS|4.0|Of course, this is a great album.  However, I would suggest you stick to the original CD master if you can.  This one has been mastered too loud, so much so, the kick drum distorts with the music slightly falling away each time due to the compression.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Seen the commercials and had to see it the comedy lived it to what was expected. This movie made the trilogy !
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Enjoyed the book, as I have a huge admiration for our military and their commitment and sacrifice.  Though I am torn between how much should be revealed in these stories.  I am also concerned that while the percentage of college educated SEALs has shot up, the ability to keep a secret has obviously fallen a bit.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|No issues, just as described.  Owned the Blu-ray and could not wait to get the 3D version.<br />Was not disappointed.
1401225756|4.0|served the purpose<br />Came relatively quickly and worked great for class would recommend purchasing books again always looking for cheap books for school mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
B002BWP49M|5.0|Love the series, no issues with the DVD. Just watched it again before going to see Part 2.  See something new every time I watch it.  Can not wait for Part 2 to come out on DVD.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Ever question your parents about what they did during the war?  This was an absolutely amazing book. It is one with a good surprising ending!  Love it
B004SMD4H2|5.0|I love the mysterious, the unknown, unknowable.  I have always been a Stephen King fan so it surprised me that I didn't discover this jewel until its third season.  It was like finding a buried treasure.  I hope it keeps because the cast, the writers, the stories, the setting...everything about it keeps me coming back for more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i think it great its for kindle fires to it wakes me up for school and it is very loud.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|The graphics were very good and the product was easy to put up - my 6-year-old grand daughter put them up by herself.  Seem to the staying on the wall without and problem.
0525953728|2.0|There are plenty of in depth reviews of this book already, so I'll be brief with this one.  Basically, the book is just another book to add to the loads of other mediocre works on military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with nothing to set it apart.  The writing is not impressive, there is no suspense or anything particularly interesting, and the only thing kept me going was the promise of \\"setting the record\\" straight.  Most of the chapters are just broad overviews of operations filled with just enough detail to let the reader know how awesome the author is.  There is plenty of chest thumping and practical joking throughout the pages if that's your thing though.<br /><br />One thing that bothers me is thinking about what this book could have been.  When I think of books about secret operations that are not sanctioned by the authors' communities, \\"Kill Bin Laden\\" by Dalton Fury is one of the first that comes to mind and I can't help but compare \\"No Easy Day\\" to it.  While there are similarities in the books, there are quite a few differences between that really distinguish them from each other.  Dalton Fury made his book an ode to the men he fought with, and never tried to inflate his own ego which Mark Owen seems to do the entire book.  Dalton Fury really does set the record straight, and does so without badmouthing his superiors or implying they are less than capable.  Finally, \\"Kill Bin Laden\\" was written years after the events it describes, and was not published during the media frenzy that followed.  \\"No Easy Day\\" really just appears to be a book published to capitalize on the fleeting interest of a recent even and make a quick buck.<br /><br />Most of the cons to this book are brought up frequently in the 1 start reviews.  I agree with most of them but I didn't find the cons egregious enough to warrant a 1 start review, however.  Certainly not the best book I have ever read or even a good book, but not the worst either.  There is nothing earth shattering and I don't really see how Mark Owen sets the record straight.  He confirms what most people already know: Seal Team 6 did a helo raid on Bin Laden's compound, a helo went down, and they shot Bin Laden.  There are a few more details, but that's about the extent of it.  Save your money if you are looking for anything with much substance.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|My kids are older now, but this was a favorite movie of theirs!! I am giving it to my<br />grandkids this year!
0061122416|5.0|If you haven't purchased nor read this book this a great read, I think its a must read! Order it!
030758836X|1.0|Not all books I read have to be literary genius, but I typically avoid complete trash.  I missed the mark with this one.  The first 50% were tedious with repeated facts and limited plot progress.  The second half turned into a nonsensical plot line with poorly developed characters that frankly, we not likable enough to care about anyway.  If I hadnt been stuck on a long international flight, I likely would have dropped the book.  But I persevered to possibly the worst ending of a book I have read in years.  I honestly wouldn't waist my time with this book.  Its a light beach read AT BEST, but even then you can do a lot better.  Avoid.
B007704HO6|5.0|James Bowen and Bob, you are both a true testament to the power of love, on this wonderful journey of change.<br />How a fury little friend could just love you unconditionally and you him, is a lesson for us all.<br /><br />Gandhi said &#34;You can judge the moral character of a society by the way the treat their animals&#34;.<br /><br />The pain and suffering that children suffer alone, is just too sad to convey.<br />Let's hope many read this book and get themselves back on the right track.<br />Congratulations!<br />Jackie x
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed the storyline overall. The action was nicely described, the small love story was interesting, but I felt that the story didn't reach too deeply. The plot twists were predictable and the imagery was very flat. I understand that the book was written for the adolescent demographic so I will cut it some slack and honestly that's why I enjoyed the book as I read it. So yes overall the book was good if I wanted to be entertained for a couple of hours but if I wanted to be completely moved and think about the analysis of the story I wouldn't read this book.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Another excellent addition to the Night Huntress. Cat and Bones work so well together as characters, their relationship evolving as the book progresses. Even the secondary characters change and grow. Ms. Frost is fast becoming my favourite all-time author. She excels in characterisation. She also writes an awesome love scene vamp style. I highly recommend this series.
0756655307|5.0|This is the must have reference guide for Marvel fans.Cannot explain how it feels to be holding a book that holds the descriptions of so many Super Heroes.Every household should be made to compulsory purchase this book for the sake of the' What's a Super Hero?' generation!Awesome!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I would recommend to parents to watch the movie with their children the first time. My daughter (3) got kind of scared when the Mom had turned into a bear.
0156027321|5.0|This book was funny, exciting, sad and inspiring; it has it all.  I seldom read a book twice, but, I will read Life of Pi again.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Once I was able to install Amazon for Ipad it worked out great. Good quality, easy to use, no complaints.
B007T99ENE|5.0|I hadn't thought that lightning could strike twice in the same place, but Ian McEwan has disproved that with this book. Atonement was the structural precursor and although different in many ways from Sweet Tooth, the same smile crossed my face when I got to the resolution.<br /><br />The book also shows that weak and annoying characters can make a great novel.<br /><br />McEwan is the only novelist I know who gets under the even further under the reader's skin than that of his characters.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of the funniest Christmas movies I have ever seen.  Watch it 2-3 times a year, every year.
B00A5052YE|4.0|One of her most well thought out albums she has created. Not many fast tracks on this record, she keeps in midtempo-slow groove with strong pen writing. Key tracks are New Day, When It's All Over, and That's When I Knew. Great to have her back in midst of all the dancepop crap. @BiggiBenzo
1452110581|4.0|I bought this book for my sister, who is a cat nut.<br />She loved it and thought it was great.  I read it and thought it was kinda silly.  So I think if you are a cat lover, this is a great book.<br />If you are not, your going to think... huh?<br />I figured she would give it 5 stars, and I would give 3, so I averaged it at 4.
0061537969|5.0|A very interesting read from the view of the dog. Funny and introspective and totally entertaining. A good choice for a book club discussion.

B00364K6YW|5.0|While living in England for 5 years, I enjoyed much of all the BBC offerings. This tops the list in my book.<br />It holds you long after seeing it. The acting is suburb by all. Keep creating DVD's like this.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|This is a riproaring suspense film that is brilliantly cast, and has a cat-and-mouse plot that thankfully doesn't rely on the old shoot-em-out action sequences.  Tommy Lee Jones is pitch perfect as a relentless lawman who loves the chase, and has no mercy for his quarry, but gradually comes to sympathize with Harrison Ford's character, Dr. Richard Kimball, who is innocent and looking for the elusive one-armed man who killed his wife and got him sent to prison for life for murder.  Sympathising doesn't make him soft though, he's still going to get his man.<br /><br />The thing I love most about this movie is the small scenes, the throwaway lines, especially by Tommy Lee Jones.  Such as when one of his people says \\"It's hinky\\" and he gets annoyed.  \\"What does hinky mean?\\"  The guy explains.  He says \\"well then say that.\\"  Then he waits a beat and spits out, irritated, \\"I don't want any of you all saying hinky anymore.\\"<br /><br />I mean, there's absolutely no need for that sequence, it doesn't advance the plot, and yet it helps us understand who this man is.<br /><br />ION TV has been repeating \\"The Fugitive\\" for the past couple of weeks and I must have watched it three times, it never gets old.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very basic..it does what it's suppose to and it didn't cost anything.  if you're looking for a basic calculator for your device,  I recommend this one.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|I didn't care for the first Resident Evil CGI film &#34;Degeneration&#34;. I thought it was very boring, with uninteresting new characters, and a forgettable plot.<br /><br />This sequel &#34;Damnation&#34; is a lot more entertaining. Way more action, and a lot of scenes feel like you're watching someone play Resident Evil! Very fun.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with the film is an annoying comedic character that follows Leon around. With a very, horrible, 'Russian accent'. The voice actor for this guy somehow forgot and got lost in the accent because eventually the character goes from a generic faux Russian accent to sounding like Triumph the Insult Dog from the Conan O'Brien show.<br /><br />Seriously, if it wasn't for that idiotic character I would have given the movie all five stars on this review.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I got this app for my grandkids to play but I find myself playing it.I find it a challenging game even for me. The kids like it and its fun for them.

0425263908|5.0|Was a huge fan of the 50 Shades series, and wanted to find another great read...this is it! This is more realistic and better written...I am in love!
B004GYY714|5.0|Best app going. If you have a good wifi signal. and your battery is charged,  tunein gets you any thing you want to listen to while you read books. Play games or just surf. If you don't have it get it now.
B001NHN7TU|4.0|A classic balance of horror and comedy. I can watch this over and over again especially on Saturday afternoon with overcast clouds.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really like Alawar...... This game is worth the money.... Hidden object searches have the pinch and zoom in feature.... good storyline, with a creepy atmosphere... including an awesome clown character ...... Long game play time..... Just wish it didn't ever end.... I really enjoyed this one.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Eureka season 1 is pretty good. I like the way that the show takes science, and makes it fun. For a Sci-Fi produced show, it was very interesting. Many programs on the station are lame and uninteresting to me.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|I love the fact it helps keeps legos out of the carpet. My seven year old loves it because it has stars wars all over it and he can be in the middle of building something and be able to zip it to work on later. This box is bigger than I expected. It's a nice size fit quite a few legos, but doesn't take up a lot of room. Great purchase!
B000063V8T|5.0|I found that as the seasons went on the star trek stories became more complex and believable delving into deeper and perhaps more profound issues of humanity's never ending search for meaning and happiness.
B009G7ZYUO|1.0|I was a fan since first hearing an advance copy of the cassette back in 92.  I still remember playing the album for my friends and hearing them say \\"this sounds ok, but it will never catch on\\".  For once I was right!!  Anyway, Sony and the band should be ashamed of this release, really over $70?  Ok let me break it down for everyone.<br /><br />1 - The self titled debut which has already been released numerous times.<br />2 - Three b-sides which most fans that initially jumped on the band wagon already have because of the fan base's thirst for more music by the band.<br />3 - Demo tracks that were always available from day one.  It is well publicized that they sold these at their early shows, and the demos were always around on the tape trading market, and in recent years on youtube.<br />4 - A VHS which was later released with some pretty cool show footage, and videos that also formed part of the same VHS, or can be viewed on the web. This DVD is available here on Amazon for roughly $12, I've seen it for half that at other stores.<br />5 - A concert from a few years back that is on youtube.<br />6 - The album on vinyl<br />7 - A book with unreleased images and linear notes by Chuck D.<br /><br />If you are a die hard fan, you already probably have all of this material, and perhaps want the vinyl, or are a collectionist and would like to have the boxed set it self.  That's cool, I understand that, but for the average fan?  This definitely is not for them.  For someone like myself, I have purchased the album multiple times, including as part of the boxed set that was released a few years back, isn't it awfully greedy that you release this one more time?  It's their album, and they can do what they want, but you can't preach about being for the people, and releasing this in the current economic environment, and expect it to sell.  Had this of come out for half of the money, I would have applauded them, or if it actually contained material that was actually never available before, well than I might have checked it out.  Even if you want to argue that the show from the UK has never been released, seriously it does not compare to the early footage of an angry, hungry band that had something to prove.  They have nothing to prove to anyone, they are no longer hungry, and unfortunately will not release anything new for the foreseeable future.  Can't wait to see how they try to rip off fans with the Evil Empire boxed set!

B009S8PEHY|5.0|Merry Christmas Baby by Rod Stewart This is a great Christmas album. We are really enjoying it. I'm finding out I like Rod Stewart more now, than back in the day.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This is a truly awesome game. How can a game about a velociraptor-spider hybrid NOT be awesome?!  The graphics, music, story....all very old school and very cool.  The only thing I would change is maybe have a control option to slide with your finger to move instead of tilt. Either way, love the game.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Quite literally one of the best films I have ever seen. Starts a bit slow but ends with immense emotional power and creativity.
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my son when he was a baby up to about 8 years old. Such a sweet book & the illustrations are beautiful. You can see the kitten grow into a cat too! The ending seems bittersweet. It was never a disturbing experience with my reading nor to my son.<br /><br />Like Beetlejuice... there will be that freakish 5% chance that it'll freak someone out!
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|What a horrible movie.  Movies like this are an insult to people's intellect. I could not finish it and turn it off. Over rated and stupid.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|This were great movies and still they are.  Now they have perfect picture and sound that rocks your home theatre.  Great buy and great price from Amazon.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|best game in the world. I rate this a 5 star rating. I love this game. It is the best game.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|The book reminded me of being there then.<br />It is a kind memoir, but so evocative of the time. New York has changed so much since those days.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Jobs emerges as the poster child of bad behavior, the counter culture warrior, the essential genius for the 60s and co-sponsor of the new millennium.  Isaacson had amazing access to this man and his work and made full use of it.  I have read his books on Einstein and B. Franklin and this work on jobs falls in the same category with the same 5 star quality.  Jobs clearly chose his biographer well and it is his final gift to us.

0060734191|5.0|I first read this trilogy in high school, I think my sophomore year, by borrowing the books from my school's library. I absolutely loved them, and within a couple more years I wanted to read them again. But my public library didn't have them available, and there were still more books from the school library that I wanted to read, so I took the new books rather than these, since there's a limit to the number of books that can be withdrawn at once.<br /><br />Finally, this year (my second year out of high school), I asked for these books for my birthday. I was a little worried, since I knew they were not particularly new books, so I didn't know how available they'd be. Then I came across this listing on Amazon, and I knew I HAD to have it. I was worried they might have been a lower quality reprint set, particularly the art and text on the covers, but I wanted them anyway.<br /><br />Along came my birthday, and I unwrapped this boxed set... FANTASTIC. The printing quality did not disappoint me at all, they feel very comfortable in the hand, and they have that great book smell too. I can't wait to dive back into the world within these pages, as with so many fantasy books beforehand!
B00633W614|5.0|Just a master story teller. The development of the characters was amazing. So fun and intoxicating which meant a few tired days because of forgoing sleep to finish. The only issue is waiting 5 months for the next book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I first saw this at an All Pro Dad meeting and had to have it.  The whole family loves the movie
0547884591|5.0|Well I was stunned to see how big the book was, I bought it as part of a 3 book deal so I got he 4 hour body and week also, it was a workout just getting it home. I wished we had this type of book when doing home ecomonics at school. Maybe I wouldnt have been be so clueless in the kitchen. So I come under the cant cook well category, sometimes it has been so bad not even the dog would eat it. Although I have managed to sustain me and my 3 children, they are getting a little bored of my staples of shepherds pie and spag bol  etc. This book blew my mind, my 7 year old is now looking at it telling me what receipes I should do, so i have hidden it from view as those were for those people highly skilled in the kitchen. So this book is great for those who burn water to those who are way cooler than me in a kitchen. Easy layout with good visual pictures so you have an clear idea of what you are supposed to be doing. One day i hope i will see these receipes in pre-prepared ingredient boxes in the supermarket so you can try them out without committing to buying a whole load of ingredients you only use once because you did not like the receipe or like me you have managed to torch it. I think the section on learning is cool, have been trying to learn a language for years but mother tongue always seems to win the battle. So I hope you consider buying this book it seems to be more relevant for the modern age. Bon Appetite
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is such a nice slow paced game.  I began playing it and kept thinking, ok just one more...just one more...then just one more.  Oh wow it is very hard to stop playing it.  I honestly enjoy it very much.  Not hard to learn but tests your brain skills for sure.
B008NMT684|5.0|My granddaughter is familiar with their puzzles and has enjoyed the transportation and animal puzzles. She was thrilled to have another one to play with. They are well put together and although the first level is free, it is worth it to pay for the additional levels.
0446580848|2.0|I've read alot of Nelson DeMille books and loved all of them until this one. I got about half way through and had to put it down. I found it really boring and, like another poster, got tired of the wisecracking John Corey. I found myself flipping pages thinking I would find something going on, but no such luck. I will have to think twice before reading another one of Nelson DeMille's books.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter can't get enough of these  puzzles. She loves popping the balloons when she finishes a puzzle.

B0079XNWQA|4.0|This album is definitely \\"toned down\\" compared to his previous albums. Not much funk, mostly slow acoustic songs, but Jason's voice and lyrics keep the songs from being run-of-the-mill 4/4 pop. (In fact, there's one song called 5/6 that plays with unusual time signatures.)<br />I'm not upset about the lack of fun in this album, because instead of fun there are a lot of feelings, reflections, and thought. Not that Jason's songs ever showed a lack of thought, of course. Thinking back on his discography is like listening to someone grow up, except the younger years are just as great as the later years. They're different and that's okay. And I'm looking forward for more.
B009FOBMBI|1.0|I bought this album because Three Days Grace has made many of my favorite songs.  Only good song on the album is Chalk Outline.  All the rest didn't even sound like them.
B004J64QSI|5.0|An absolutely wonderful concert production and thoroughly enjoyable. Highly recommend! Lots of top notch performers--even Ramin Karimloo before he became famous for Phantom. And what a stage presence! Love Norm Lewis in the role of Javert. Ah, and Alfie Boe as the lead was very well cast indeed. He receives a well deserved and lenghy ovation midshow.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook reports an update. It's not in app store...where is the update? Super jinky app. Major feed issues. No fun :(
B008VNIBFO|5.0|A timeless classic movie about a has been wealthy movie star and a broke script writer trying to make his mark in the industry.

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The end of the series after a decade - will we see anything as good in the next decade?  A great story to entertain yourself with.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the third book in the trilogy.  This book is not as good as the second one, but better than the first.  The story finally has a conclusion.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|It was a breath of fresh air to see a super hero who stayed pretty close to the original story....
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Everyone should read this if you want to have a better relationship with their spouse.  There are even other love languages written for children.  etc...
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I didn't even know this book was around until I started seeing previews for the upcoming movie.  I downloaded it to my Kindle and began reading immediately.  This book was very well written with so much detail and color that it wasn't hard to imagine all of the sceens.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is great if you are willing to read about BDSM and it's effect on a young virgin.  Nasty! WOW!
B009Y2KGSQ|3.0|I'm a long time Aerosmith fan and was excited to know they were doing a new studio album, but this album was a disappointment.  The songs remind me of vintage 70s Aerosmith but the songs don't have the same energy that made their music awesome.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the second in the trilogy with a deeply troubled man and his virgin counterpart.  This one is ever better than the first book.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you like films that are a little off the wall yet Norman Rockwell like with a dash of small town humor, you'll appreciate this film and want to watch it more than once.  Not your typical &#34;coming of age&#34; film though definitely approaching the subject in a sweet and innocent manner as opposed to the dime a dozen &#34;American Pie&#34; movies out there.  A must see for all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting and kept my attention.  I couldn't put the book down.  I didn't like the ending UNLESS another book is coming so I can read more.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|This movie is a Christmas classic in my family and have really enjoyed watching it in HD this holiday season
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Lisa Genova made Alice a very authentic character. My heart was with her during the entire story. The family interactions were very real, as well.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|I got one of these to go with my NR818 and it works well, but I probably should not have bought it.  I would think most users of an Onkyo network AVR would put their receivers on their home network, which would include WiFi, and they probably have either an Android device or iPhone/Pad/Pod.  That is how I am set up.  Because I installed the free Onkyo app (which is very basic but works well) on my phone, I can stream music from my phone via WiFi, making the UBT-1 unnecessary.<br /><br />Update: Since writing this review, the device has really annoyed me and I keep it disconnected unless I'm actually using it.  It has a habit of randomly forcing the input of the receiver to switch to it when there is a paired Bluetooth device nearby (i.e. my phone).  Very irritating.
B005SV9X22|5.0|I think Gaga is amazing!  I bought this for a friend from work during the holidays.  He was so excited
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Like most of the reviewers on here I watched this not expecting much.  Was I wrong.. No big name actors, no problem, no big Hollywood budget...no problem. This film was great. If you have read the books and played the games, it has a solid story line.  It ties in amazingly to the last two books and Halo 4.  In terms of Cinematography, I can't believe how they pulled it off.  The actors are young but great, the scope and landscape perfect.  Even the CGI plays a great role in adding to the story without ruining it like most non-maintstream movies.  The single greatest thing about this.....is FINALLY seeing the Master Chief in real life, it will bring chills to any Halo fan.  I could ramble on for hours about this.<br /><br />Long story short, buy it and watch it.  A great flick and kudos to those that made it.
B007C9N4H8|5.0|Me and the bf decided to watch this movie bc we were a big fan of the muppets growing up.  I thought it was nicely done!
B009VB998I|5.0|Highly recommended this movie.  My daugters and myself really enjoyed it, and I will buy it if it's ever on sale.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|played one, its excellent brand new. the other is to be a gift, so won't open till exmas, but looks new and all sealed up. perfectly new and so cheap thrilled about my purchase.
B003QSMCKO|4.0|This movie was a great surprise.  Had no idea Eddie Murphy was the voice of the dragon.  Kids loved it.
0547884591|5.0|I'm pretty savvy in the kitchen. I can hold my own when it comes to a dinner party. This book may not be for everyone but, it is for me! The book has a \\"Seek and Find\\" style that I love and have enjoyed in all of the other books (4-Hour WorkWeek, 4-Hour Body). I'm also a trainer by trade. Sometimes you have to throw out what you know to explore a new way of thinking. Then, revisit your previous knowledge to bring all together. This is the same reason we copy recipes into our own books instead of just following along in the many cookbooks we own! That is how I approached this book. I'm looking forward to having kick-ass dinner parties and having fun in the kitchen! Also, it's great to have the book at Amazon because all of the suggestions for purchases are already here! Convenient! Keep up the great work!! I follow you on Facebook and Twitter...you should too!
0307352145|5.0|For a majority of my 30 years here on this earth, I have been led to believe that something was wrong with my mannerisms and how I socialize.  People around me have always labeled me super quiet, unemotional, nonchalant and stand-offish (all which my be true to some extent) which makes me feel bad about being myself because no one around me could relate.  As a matter of fact, I think I may be the only introvert in my immediate family.<br />  I have never had the support system around me that nurtured my personality and allowed me to build my self esteem by playing to my strengths.  I've always been a socially awkward guy but I felt that this was a weakness that I could change with constant exposure to social situations and supplementation.  This book opened my eyes to the fact that introversion is a genetic trait and no matter how hard I try to escape my reality, its something  that I have to learn to live with.  This book made me feel a lot better about myself and helped me understand that I am not the only one who's going through the struggle of being a introvert in a society geared towards extroversion.  This book is a total game changer for me and I am happy that I stumbled upon it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this, differences from the movie but its the best book I've read since I can remember. I feel like I'm watching it!
0385366752|1.0|I've heard nothing but good things about this book and after listening to various coworkers rave about it I had to read it. So I got it on CD to listen to during my commute. This goes to prove that just because \\"everyone\\" loves something it doesn't mean I will.<br /><br />I got three tracks into the first CD and I had to give up. I don't know whether it was the excruciatingly in-depth mental process of the main character or the narrator's pendantic style of address but this book is not for me.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener works just fine. Does what it says it does but I find that the edge comes out even better if you follow up with a sharpening steel. I had lots of dull kitchen and pocket knives and this sharpener has taken care of all of them. I recommend it.
030758836X|1.0|It's a mystery to me how this book mangaged to become a runaway bestseller.  When Nick and Amy leave New York after losing their jobs they return to his small hometown in Missouri where he buys a bar with his twin sister, Go.  After two years Amy, however, isn't working nor has she made friends.  No surprise here.  Both characters are profane, self-indulgent and just plain silly.  One day a neighbor calls Nick at The Bar and tells him his cat is outside the house and the front door is open.  Nick rushes home to find Amy GONE.  Who cares?  I was more concerned about the cat.  Nick doesn't bother to feed the kitty or call Amy' parents.  People call this a page turner? I kept turning pages and skipping paragraphs to  find out how bad the ending was. I knew the conclusion  was lame going in but I didn't know a runaway bestseller could be this bad from the start.  Run readers run from this turkey.
0894803123|4.0|I couldn't wait for this book to arrive in the mail. It has lots of ice cream recipes and some introductory background information about ice cream info and making at the beginning which is great. What is peculiar about this book is the art work inside. They have chosen to use what I guess looks like a psychedelic motif in the back ground art om most pages.<br />I expected a normal recipe book, you know, with titles and lists of things and instructions in there, and they are, but this book winds up looking much like a children's book. The pages have this odd art work, if you can call it that; when my wife opened it she immediately asked me where I got this children's book, said that her nice would like one.<br />I am sure the recipes are just fine, others recommend this book and that was my basis for buying it, guess its about what you'd expect from a couple of old timers.
0545265355|4.0|Kept me glued to my kindle until I was done with the series! I do wish that the author had gone a bit further with the last book. It felt a little rushed.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|Was real reluctant to order after reading about all the QC problems from the pressing plant. And now awaiting my 3rd copy of Rubber Soul trying to get a unwarped and unscratched example.<br /><br />On to Sgt Pepper-- This is a real fine copy, and the sound is rich, warm and full. What really pops out at you is the quality of the bass response. Plentiful, not muddy sounding and tight. It truly make the experience complete.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|When I started reading the first book I simply could not get into it at all. Nothing about it kept me interested. I pushed on, however, because I had a friend who swore this series was amazing. I made it through book two and didnt even attempt at the third. The characters were unbelievable, there was no plot or story line- just simply sex atleast twice a chapter. I kept reading because I kept hoping that some sort of story would develop but it never does. Here is the story in a nutshell: Girl meets boy (100 sex scenes), Girl wants more then just crazy sex (100 sex scenes), Boy doesnt (100 sex scenes), Girl leaves boy (100 sex scenes), Boy begs girl to come back (100 sex scenes), Girl comes back (100 sex scenes times 2 more books beyond the first).
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|Would love to have a good copy of this really great Beatles album. Both have arrived severely warped and one also had scratches. It is truly amazing Amazon has not quit selling these re-releases. These have zero quality control and is truly just a money making venture for Capitol/EMI and God knows who else. I will return my copy again and wait for a few months to order when demand slackens and maybe Capitol/EMI  will find someone who truly wants to produce a quality product.<br /><br />Update 12-5-2012<br /><br />My third copy arrived today. It is now the best of the 4 remasters I have bought. Perfectly flat and the sound especially side 2 is fantastic. I guess it was worth  the wait and hassles of returning the previous two. If you can live with the possibility of having to exchange a copy or even two, I would recommend without hesitation.
B005P39GOI|5.0|Ben Howard is brilliant at the guitar and is heard throughout Every Kingdom. In addition, his voice is beautiful and lyrics poetic.
B0041KVV8U|3.0|By far the best remaster that I have received. A pure pleasure to listen to. No distortion, warm and full sounding, unwarped, Volume 1 has the best of the early Beatles, and Volume 2, well,  this is the Beatles. Yes I have heard the songs a zillion times, but never so pure and open sounding and free of distortion. Comparing Hey Jude on the remaster to the Hey Jude album, there is no comparison. This is a winner.<br /><br />EDIT 12/18/2012<br /><br />Finally got around to listening to side 2 of LP #2 and found it horribly pressed off center. It totally soured the vocals and steady tones on the LP. What is weird is that the other side is perfectly centered. Oh well, just more proof that there is no quality control in todays world. It's all about the almighty profit dollar.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Definitely a must buy of the year! All the Little Lights is one of the best albums of 2012 and Passenger is a brilliant singer/songwriter. Beautiful, poetic music...definitely will not disappoint. If you haven't heard of Passenger yet, you will be sure to hear him soon.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|This movie tells an entertaining and heart-touching story of growing up.  I loved it!  As good as the 1st one!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I saw the remake of this in the theater before I saw this one but that was good so I picked up this one. The remake is better but this one is good too. Actually theyre both just as good at least in my opinion. This is one of the few movies that I watch which  is in black and white. like I said theyre both good . I especially like the way-in both of them but nevermind-that they proove Kris is Santa Claus. You should get this. Merry Christmas.
1616960922|5.0|I love Sanderson's books and this did not disappoint. Since it's short, it's probably a good place to start if you haven't read Sanderson before.
B0048IMZMG|4.0|She is so amazing.. Who else in today's mainstream is as talented as Taylor? She always gets it done. Giving all haters a chance to appreciate Country Music.
B000WMGXZC|4.0|E.T. is always going to be a classic and good to watch but when they put in the description original movie from its not true, they left the bathtub scene in the original ersion but it wasn't the 1982 version it still had the new automated et in that one, so that part was a disappointment but i will always enjoy watching it regardless.
098555780X|4.0|Awesome pictures with helpful tips to make the knots and designs easy to follow. Doesn't tell how much cord to use at the start of each tie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It is the natural continuation of the hunger games and reads just as fast. If you read the first one you got to go for this one as well.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I am a newcomer to this franchise. I love this series!  I love all horror and this is a great show right up there with Supernatural.
1615470158|5.0|One of the big challenges to being an early adopter of any software product is the lack of documentation that accompanies it.  This isn't a big deal if the software is intuitive, and error messages are well crafted to help you get through them.  Unfortunately, while PowerPivot is amazingly powerful, and while you can do some amazing things with it, DAX (the formula language within PowerPivot) is neither intuitive nor are the error messages helpful to an Excel pro.  As the owner of [...] and a Microsoft MVP, I'd like to think that I know a little about working with Excel, but despite the fact that I've been a huge advocate for PowerPivot, and using it extensively for 2 years, DAX has remained a power that has been just out of reach.    That ended this past week.    Last week I bought a bought Rob Collie's new book \\"DAX Formulas for PowerPivot: The Excel Pro's Guide to Mastering DAX\\". When you are ready to take the DAX journey, you MUST have this book.    Rob's writing style is identical to that you'll find on his blog at [...]. In fact, the only difference is that he doesn't fill up any real estate with movie quotes.  What you do get is a huge amount of insightful information.    Four days of working through this book with my own data and I am now making some amazing stuff that eluded me before.    What I love about this book is that Rob sat down and carefully thought through how an Excel pro should learn DAX, then started at the beginning. It progresses logically, is very easy to read, and actually gets you there. Yes, you need to practice, but weren't you going to do that anyway? And when you practice...    There's something really important between these pages that I doubt you'll ever see in the advertising. With any programming language (yes, Excel formulas fit that bill, as do DAX formulas) there are two critical things to learn. The first is Syntax (how you do something), and the second is how to debug something. Rob gives you both, which is critical on the path to mastery. He has some nice little charts that explain how filters are applied to the CALCULATE function, (which is like SUMIF on steroids.) With those charts, you can actually follow the steps to figure out exactly why your measure is not doing what you want. (Trust me, it was doing this that actually helped me finally get that Eureka moment that I've been looking for!)    Four days. I've gone from not being able to make anything but the most simple DAX measure to the point where I can create some pretty cool CALCULATE functions (my new best friend), with nested date/time intelligent functions as well. I've been pursuing that for TWO YEARS!    After struggling with DAX for so long, I think it's fair to say that I wouldn't have been able to break the DAX barrier without this book.    If you're struggling with DAX, or just getting ready to start the PowerPivot journey get his book. You owe it to yourself.
B007ZM9I1I|4.0|This is a really funny edition of Monopoly. The cards were weirdly stuck together and I couldn't get them apart without ripping them at parts so that was a pain. Other than that, awesome product!

B008MG1E4A|3.0|Interesting first hand narrative but it seemed  the author couldn't decide between the book being a historical, personal novel or a newstory narrative.  Much of the book is about other missions or training.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|I just felt like this movie was struggling to get most of their humor.  There were a couple of ha moments but for the most part I guess I just expected more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The title says it all. This game is mindless fun for when you need a mental break for a few minutes.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|Was disappointed for two reasons.  One being the way Rod Stewart sang the songs (too slow and not much spirit).  Two being I got a voucher for free to buy an Mp3 for $1.99 but I thought it was for any Mp3 and not just a choice of eight.  I wanted the Susan Boyle Christmas album.  Next time I will read the fine print.
B0093X805W|5.0|remember reading when i was a kid. now im 21 and still wouldnt mind reading it again. great book.. i think its better than both the movies that were made from it.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Gotta love the classics. I haven't read this in about 20 years, but I am now reading it with my teen and enjoying it very much. It's great to be able to get so many of these old classics for free on Kindle because they are worth re-reading, or discovering for the first time.American treasures.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I was not really expecting much from this book, but I just could not stop thinking about it when I was not reading.
B005R32L66|5.0|I hate cell phones because I can never hear on them very well and have trouble working them. I'm not  very technical person. Skype on my PC and on my tablet is my main phone now and I love that it can do so many things.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I loved the idea of this. It's a sleek design, well packaged. Not easy to install, as the battery pack doesn't exactly fit so well in the mouse, and I was afraid of breaking one or the other. But I managed to do it, after one attempt that left me having to use something to pry the battery pack out of the mouse. I plugged it in, and 24 hours later, the light was still blinking and the mouse wasn't responding, it was dead. I've tried twice to charge it, but it still doesn't work. I also tried charging only the battery pack so I could use the mouse in the meantime with the apple rechargeable batteries, and I couldn't even get the damned blinking light. So I'm sending it back.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Obviously, the writers found their groove. Every show was excellent. i do not watch the series during the season, but buy the completed set and watch the series as a marathon. Flaws in the storyline, flow and character development show up--if there are any. Boardwalk II passed the test. Good stuff--well done!
B007WKEM8C|4.0|Good cookbook, Well  written with a great sense of humor. I've tried some of the recipes with great success. She is a talent
B005FISBTO|2.0|This is one of those series that started with a bang!--ran a couple season off the &#34;idea&#34; and has petered out. The 6th Season had a good first show and last show but was FLAT and easily perdictable.. If they want to save the series they need to come up with a really good serial killer who will make the viewers sleep with their lights on!
B005SDMDRW|2.0|The lead story is excellent, the other couple of short stories are also very god, my complait is I would ahve preferred another story, no the beginnig of a new novel.<br />Overall not good value really
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Boardwalk Empire was developed by a top notch crew from costumes to set design. There were a few weak characters mixed in with some top notch acting and character construction. &#34;Jimmy's&#34; war buddy was an excellent character with a number of interesting twists. I assume he will extract revenge in Season III. The writers need to develop his &#34;skills.&#34;<br /><br />The writers kept their historical fiction right on track with real life events and stayed away from &#34;Two and a Half Men&#34; twisted sex, but hinted at devent behavior. IF the writers keep the storyline on track and the costume crew keep up their SUPERB work--Boardwalk will maintain itself as a premire series!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I truly didn't think it was possible for J.K. Rowling to write anything but outstanding works of literature which is why I plodded through the most boring ,badly written  book I have ever read in The Casual Vacancy. The characters in this book were dull, uninteresting, and in all cases the most unappealing mean spirited people that could possibly live in one town. The entire town of Pagford and The Fields was at war ,and one could only deplore man's inhumanity to man as represented in all of Rowling's characters in this book. We can only hope that Rowling  gets back to writing in her true genre of magical characters in a world of fantasy ,as opposed to dwelling on depressing characters living in their dull and uninteresting world.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Great game for Kindle Fire. My son loves it but it took a little while for him to get use to the controls on the Kindle.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I have no complaints about this case for the time that I had the Samsung galaxy and provided great protection and gave me access to all of the ports
B0024SQW2Q|4.0|I have enjoyed this movie though not as much as I would have thought. I love that the creators took the viewers into the past so that they can understand how the other movies co-inside together. I only wish this movie would have gone more in depth of Lucian's life after escaping and loosing the love of his life.
B005WQ42JC|3.0|there's nothing super special about this movie you pretty much know what's going to happen before it happens but it's worth a watch
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man is excellent. As always, Flynn keeps the reader guessing and adds enough twists and turns that it's difficult to put the book down. Politics are pervasive throughout.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|how can you not like the Harry Potter movies I've watched all of them and have enjoyed watching each and every movie with my family
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a huge fan of Vince Flynn and Mitch Rapp and always look forward to the next book. The Last Man was great!
0061992860|3.0|[[VIDEOID:moD25UHERBQ6OI]]When I Ordered This Book I Didn't Know That It Was The Miniature Edition This Is More so a Pocketbook Rather Than a Real Sized Book It Does Have All the Pages But Again It's May Be A 4 X 4 Inch Book. Make sure to let me know if this video was helpful to you!! Its just one click.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The action and excitement with Mitch Rapp is back in The Last Man, loved every minute of reading!  If you love the earlier Mitch Rapp volumes, this will hold your interest throughout the book.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|why are you reading this?! you should be watching the series! there is nothing I can say about the series that hasn't already been said this is a great series and I doubt that you could probably find anyone that can watch the 1st episode and not continue throughout the series.
B0098460O4|5.0|An excellent first CD, when the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.  Exceptional musical ability, and nice too.
B006INDGFE|5.0|I love the  hangover series or just 2 movies both of them funny and at a better price when you rent them on Amazon
193609648X|4.0|This book is for fiber enthusiasts who like smart, sophisticated garments. So many crichet patterns are dull and boring. Not the ones in this book. And they patterns use Noro yarns . Enough said.
B0015AARJI|3.0|It stopped working and we've only had it under 45 days. We're pretty disappointed that we now have to send it back. What a pain!!
0739378341|2.0|I love John Grisham mysteries. But this one didn't work for me. The main character just wasn't as sympathetic as others have been. The plot seemed only indirectly related to the central conflict. I didn't mind wondering what the heck was going on but in the end it seemed overdone and implausable. Plus, from the time it happened (spoiler aleart) I worried about a dog that got left in a fenced in back yard out in the middle of no where while his owner was put in prison in another country.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|This is a great movie!  I had seen it a couple of times before I decided to get a copy myself.  It's an over happy, fun movie.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|She's got a nice voice but not powerful or mature, so some songs work well while others need work. I like the minimalist jazz accompaniment probably more than the singing; very retro and sophisto. Adorkable!
B0098VXCR0|4.0|This was a well executed movie.  Great special effects, a good fantasy story, and some interesting characters.  Not in the league of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings but still a pretty good movie worth watching at least once.
B00821PCJS|3.0|I'm a sci-fi fan, so I was very interested in a new take on the overall &#34;aliens invadate, earth fights back&#34; story... Unfortunately, the series is full of boring side-plots that fall flat mostly due to some rather bad acting.
B0090EJ99A|3.0|Definitely some laugh out loud funny moments and Sacha Baron Cohen pushes the envelope once again.  But it seemed a little more stupid than Borat and tried a little hard in parts.
0739377957|5.0|My 14 year old needed this for her high school language arts class, and she has dyslexia. Large-print books are a godsend for people with dyslexia! This was a great price (hard to find for large-print issues), and she really enjoyed the book.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This isn't Minecraft, but a game like it. you can fight dragons, complete quests, and travel to Hell and Heaven BY FOOT. there is a website where you can chat with other players and submit ideas about updates. Talk to Paul, the creator! [...] is the website. look for me, I am Dark Lord. A great game.
0385535147|5.0|Once again John Grisham grabbed my attention and I was lost to THE RACKETEER until I closed the book! How does he do it every time?
0307891372|5.0|This will help you when you get stuck and gives you hints, tips, and spoilers.  A must have to enjoy the game without the frustration of getting stuck or not knowing what to do next.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Actors, writing, cinematography - this is the best of it all. The cast is fantastic. The history is accurate. The writing is intelligent and captivating. This is a brilliant show.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is such a fun movie! I rented it once, and had to buy copies for myself and my adult children! Best movie about miscommunication! If you loved Shaun of the Dead, or watch newer horror movies, buy it!
B003R50FRI|5.0|This book brought me back to the India I visited and loved. The drug scene, gaol and fighting were not what I had experienced. However the sights, people and feelings the book evoked were so clearly described it felt like I was there again sharing in the simple delights, tragedy and sharing that happened with these interesting, kind, humble, sharing and gentle people.
0679805273|5.0|I'll be giving this book to each of my sons teachers so they can write a passage for him to read at graduation when he gets it.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I haven't read the books so I'm not comparing the movie to the book but simply as a film it's a very entertaining rehash of a premise made popular in the past.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|The epic struggle between \\"The Capitol\\" and \\"The Districts\\" is matched only by the struggle to see what is happening in the story because the camera is incessantly zoomed in too close, jiggled, pointed off-center, etc., until it is simply TEDIOUS to watch.  If the same morons run the cameras in follow-on movies, they will not be worth watching.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Fun reading.  A sympathetic character who you root for the whole way. Grisham lives up to expectations, I can't wait for the next book.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|I previously had a Pegasus model backpack from Wegner and loved it. I really like the colors on this one, but that's a personal preference. I'm not overly thrilled with the way it shapes into a bell when it's full but that's my only disappointment with it. It's got plenty of space and pockets for all my stuff. I can easily fit 2 15-inch laptops and their chargers with some space to spare. I'd buy it again if the need arose.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this trilogy and like the first book this one didn't disappoint at all! The Games are alwasy exciting!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good blend of sexiness and story line! The romance between Eva and Gideon had me completely obsessed with this book!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I enjoyed this book as well but I wouldn't have been able to read another book if there was one.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Off the wall, silly and fun series. This was the only oepisode not offered by on demand for some resaon. End of season and I had to watch it! Easy to do on my computer with this download.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Like everyone else in the world...I loved it and was instantly hooked. It had me reading the whole book in a few days.
B007KOMTUI|1.0|When I purchased the first two episodes of &#34;Season 5&#34; I assumed I was getting something new. What I got was two reruns from season 4!! Season 5 does not start until episode 3! Had I know I was paying for two episodes  that I had already seen, I would not have purchased them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in just a few days. I couldn't put it down. The suspense over the Games was awesome.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I absolutely loved it. The quality was great, and even I was a little hesitant about getting a used product. But it worked, thank you.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book was good and I enjoyed it but at some points it gets a little repetitive with the fighting and making up.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|This app won't download onto my brand new kindle fire 2 (non hd)<br />Why? My device doesn't acknowledge it at all, no downloading messages,etc.<br />Any help? Anybody else have this issue?

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was sad that the trilogy had to end but at least we have the movies to look forward to.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The various points are clearly made and can be followed even by elderly people such as myself. It is not as comprehensive as the book on Kindle by Michelle Demers.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Yes, it's great to have an ad free version of Angry Birds, but it comes at some additional costs (and I'm not just talking about the .99 price). First off, the updates are painfully slow to roll out. If Rovio updates the free version in the Google Play store, it will be months before Amazon gets around to updating the paid version. That's unfortunately true for most items in the Amazon App Store, but it's especially true for all Angry Birds Games. It took them over 3 months to get this latest update out, that's simply unacceptable.<br /><br />In addition to the slow updates by Amazon, the past two updates erase all of your progress. So if you're like me and been playing the game casually over the two years since it's been around... everything you've achieved will be gone. Even various backup apps that save game progress won't work with these updates. I find that very unfair considering the time many people devote to this game. There should at least be a warning, but there isn't. So... those are the prices you pay for an ad free experience. I hope things improve down the line.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|To be prefectly honest, I bought this book from my local bookstore (so sue me). I read the excerpt of the first chapter on my kindle and had an instant love affair. Both characters are beautifully broken, or as the title advertises, beautiful disasters. Both of them. And that is quite unusual I find when reading books. But then again, maybe I am just not reading the right books... anyways! The ending gave me a sincere &#34;WTF?!&#34; moment, as well as the major plot curve-ball, but they were both lovely in their own ways. Love a happy ending? READ THIS BOOK. Enough said. Almost. While he seemed a little emotionally dependant on her, it was in a sincere emotionally-stunted-from-screwing-around-but-I-love-you kind of way. Though is playboy-ness pissed me off to no end when they weren't together. Enough said, actually. I will not spoil this awesome and almost tear-wrenching book/my-love-affair for anyone.
030758836X|3.0|I have to agree with Sharon Spicher's review. I had a hard time getting into the book because I did not like any of the characters. Ms. Flynn is adept at creating characters of many levels, with many details, but I did not care about them at all. It was a thriller, very good with twists and turns, but the ending was just weird. I was very depressed when I finished the book. My book club read it and we met last night to discuss it and I was not the only one who was depressed. We all thought the book was disturbing to say the least. Maybe Ms. Flynn should write Nick Dunne's book Psycho Bitch next.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is fun,and  am looking forward to playing it on my new kindle to see if itsthe same as on my iphone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Im definitely addicted to this app.. so many ideas and neat things you find. I have already made several desserts and meals from this app, all in which were two thumbs up! Nothing bad I could possibly say about this app.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|unlike Samantha at the beginning, and take some time to enjoy this book. Even though it's light and funny, this book does have things to say about what counts as success and how much people give up to have it.(And I thought the Geigers were ridiculously hilarious...)<br />This would make an excellent movie(ok, Brits, \\"film\\") although, as always when this level of high-powered career is invoked, I do wonder if there really are women learning to get off in six minutes, or if that is comic exaggeration. Never having been on that track in real life, I guess I can never be sure.<br />More fun than I expected...Kinsella is on a roll.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I Couldn't get through the first 5% of the book. There were to many characters and not enough substance to keep me interested.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Excellent albums done by the same people who remastered the Beatles music for CD. Great quality and sound in a fantastic package.
B0091QS88K|3.0|Downloaded this for my niece but it doesn't have instructions of how to play it. Guess they want you to  buy one. But, not much good without instructions. Does look cute though.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Most everyone here has already included a quick synopsis of the book, so I won't bother with that. Rather, let me excite you with my personal review and feelings on this series.<br /><br />I first read Sabriel thanks to my college friend, who gave me a pre-loved book for my birthday. I remember loving it so much that I started having daydreams of being Sabriel in a movie adaptation, even if I did not have her pale skin nor her quiet bravado. I remember thinking how well-written it is (the backstories, the fantastic imagery, the fleshed-out characters), and how it evoked from me the desire to immerse myself in her world, much like when I became obsessed with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. It is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read, and one of the most inspiring too considering that these books are centered on strong female leads with good heads on their shoulders. I would rather read this for the rest of my life rather than read one of those horrid vampire novels about whiny teenagers who think the world centers around them and who lose their heads when they're \\"in luv.\\" Highly recommended for tweens and teens and adults. A thousand stars for this wonderful series, if that is at all possible :) Thank you Garth Nix for these wonderful books, may you continue writing similarly evocative and beautiful novels for the rest of your life!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Its one of his best yet.  It is current up to date events dealing with whats happening in the real world.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|It's a good movie I'm not complaining, but they should have offered the Extended Edition. Thanks You from Georgia :-)
0399230033|5.0|This is one of the sweetest books I've ever purchased for the 2-to-4-year-old crowd.  There are very few words, so you explain the story to the child as you look at the pictures.  By the time my niece was 3, she could recite the entire story back to me.  It's just fun and very, very personal to be able to read a book like this and see the child's eyes light up as he/she begins to understand the story, point to the pictures and explain the story back.  Highly recommended.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|This book is excellent.  It keeps you guessing.  Well written. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mystery and conspiracy theories.
B000HEWEJO|1.0|What's all the fuss?  This is overrated crap about a hot-tempered idiot who can't control his mouth any better than his reproductive organs (5 kids).  I see enough dumb people like this in real life - ones who lose their cool after putting up with a few years of their self-induced misery.  Why would I want to watch it on TV during the holidays?  Okay, so he met an angel that helped him realize things aren't so bad.  Doesn't matter.  Anyone with half a brain would have figured it out on their own.

B004XVMCPI|4.0|I enjoyed Stephen Chow's fun treatment of Soccer + Kung Fu.  It's reminiscent of the slapstick comedy of Airplane.  It's just plain funny though you are first wondering, Soccer?  Kung Fu?  Huh?  But I applaud Stephen for going outside the box in this not-your typical kung fu movie.<br /><br />Shaolin Soccer's Stephen Chow has been able to marry kung-fu and comedy that doesn't make you wince like Jackie Chan.  Shaolin Soccer is has a great story line.  It is witty and fast moving.  OK, not the best martial arts I've ever seen but in the context of a comedy that had a good storyline this was unique and made me laugh.  Mission accomplished.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Les Miserables has several versions, and also many cast recording. What I want to say is that this one is the best~~~ All the dream casts are in 10th anniversary concert, Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Philip Quast as Javert, Michael Ball as Marius, and Lea Salonga as Eponine~~~ All these casts are my favorite!!! Philip Quast is the best Javert I ever seen! He performed so well and song well too!!! I really love this album!!!!

B008N1LL42|1.0|This is my first movie review. I felt compelled to write this one because I only got a few scenes into the movie and want my $3.99 back. The scene where the \\"rebel\\" tough guy spots the girl with huge breasts pouting over the bar because she didn't get a burrito (from a bar?) and he walks up to save the day but she (while sticking her breasts out and pouting) acts all snotty and says \\"I'm hungry!\\" when the guy asks for her name, tells me all I need to know about this movie. It was written with teenage guys in mind. It will be lots of mindless action and hot women acting like men kicking ass. No thanks.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|This was my first experience with a visual novel/puzzle game and I am very much impressed. First I'll start with the \\"bad\\",<br /><br />1. If it takes a few tries to get a puzzle and you keep going back to get more hints, you're forced to re-read the slow, scrolling dialog explaining the instructions... each time.<br /><br />2. Since you're on a small DS screen (I actually play on an XL and still had this problem), you can often click the wrong item and then have to read through the dialog about the item.<br /><br />3. Some dialog seemed unnecessary, and I don't mean story progression wise. Without any spoilers, one example of something that started to annoy me was characters asking at almost every door if everyone is ready for it to be opened... then you have to wait for all characters to agree. It's like jeez, just go through the door already!<br /><br />4. Degree of some of the puzzles. Some were so easy I was thinking why did they even make this part a puzzle? Then others were quite difficult and for a while I could only stare at the screen wondering \\"Wtf am I supposed to do?\\". Anyone who claims all the puzzles in the game are too easy obviously hasn't done every puzzle behind every door. However, this isn't a big issue because in the entire game I only came across 3-4 puzzled that gave me trouble.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, all those \\"problems\\" become irrelevant after your first couple playthroughs. After you play once, you can almost instantly scroll through text you've already seen. If it gets to a part you've never read, scrolling will automatically stop. Considering I've played through the game multiple times to get all endings, this was much appreciated. Moving on to characters, I loved them all! &lt;3 They all have distinctive personalities and after a few go arounds while getting deeper in the story, I felt like I was really getting attached to them. Possibly a /SPOILER, but I'm not ashamed to say I cried during the \\"true ending\\". After a lot of trial and error, it was the last ending I got and so deserving of the tears. \SPOILER. As for the plot... I was so unprepared for the twists and turns in it, all I can say is simply a great story.<br /><br />I don't recommend this game if you don't like reading, I think people should keep in mind it's generally a visual novel. If you're prepared to do some reading, and like the idea of some puzzles along the way I highly recommend this game. Once you get started it's VERY addictive and hard to put down. It's absolutely one of the best of its type and I feel quite spoiled after having enjoyed it. Now I'm just waiting for them to fix the bug in it's 3DS sequel so I can get that next : )and error, it was the last ending I got and so deserving of the tears. \SPOILER. As for the plot...

B007FG9LIE|5.0|You cannot go wrong by selecting this book. It was one of the most riveting stories I have read in a long time. This book never slows down, and is one of the very few stories I have read that I can honestly say was a real &#34;page-turner.&#34; For those of you who think this is horror, it is not. It has some elements common to horror, but it is a little bit of everything. I usually read from the epic fantasy/science fiction genre, and I found this to be very different and refreshing. I beleive that anyone who likes to read could easily get hooked right from the start. There are no slow parts, and it will keep you guessing and sitting right on the edge of your seat the entire duration of the story. The ending is quite shocking and unexpected, but in a really cool, original way. I give all the praise to Blake Crouch. It was the first time I read his work, but I found his voice to really paint a vivid picture. I look forward to reading more original stories of this caliber.

0547884591|5.0|I think a lot of people don't like the way Tim Ferriss comes off in the book because he is writing from the prospective of someone who has more money than he knows what to do with and is now trying to fill his time with activities other than work for purpose of making $. The lessons in this book apply to people working 60 hours a week; however, you won't really appreciate the topic TIm is writing on until you get down to 10 to 15 hours per week of real work (or less). I'm a successful entrepreneur who is about 5 years younger than Tim. His insights into life after work really connect with me. I'd already taken on cooking as a hobby, and I was playing with the idea of starting to go deer hunting as another hobby so this book was a perfect for me. I'm a big fan of Tim's writing in general. He is a very good technical writer who is able to clearly explain concepts in a way I understand and am able to replicate. A lot of his story telling is a little annoying to me; however, I imagine that he did a bunch of focus groups and found that most people like those kind anecdotal beginnings to chapters.

0375507256|3.0|Have you ever flown a small plane through a cloud bank?  You're cruising along in the clear blue and there in front of you sits a big, puffy cumulus cloud.  It's kind of thrilling the first time.  You approach this thing that looks so solid.  Your heart beats a little faster, anticipating the impact, and before you know it you're right up against it and *** poof ***.  Nothing.  Just silence and claustrophobic, wispy whiteness outside the glass.  In another minute, you're through.  If you imagine real hard, you might feel a little damp on the other side, but not much else.  But only if you imagine real, real hard.<br /><br />That's kind of like the feeling I experienced while reading \\"Cloud Atlas\\".  I thought, 'well, look at this', and plunged in.  And now I'm out the other side.  No impact.  Just thin air and water vapor.<br /><br />For the clever conceit - a sextet, for the fluid prose, for its droll humor and a few laugh-out-loud jokes, for its enjoyable sci-fi rompiness, for its bite-size chunkiness that allows one to pick it up and put it down and not miss much, for some bits of wonderful, memorable word play, for all that \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is an easy book to recommend.<br /><br />But for its dime-store environmentalism, for its liberal use of dated sci-fi tropes, for its graphomania, for the pretense of 'linked' stories, for the ineffectual swipe at the post-modern, for the (to my ear) at times horrible, clunky dialects, for the headache I got trying to decipher the 'bridge' piece (Sloosha's Crossin'), I'm hesitant to recommend the book and, admittedly, somewhat baffled by all the praise it has received.  It won't be a re-read.<br /><br />David Mitchell's talent is enviable, his intelligence remarkable, his work ethic evident.  But after reading reviews claiming that \\"Cloud Atlas\\" evokes \\"the eloquence of Nabokov\\" and \\"the depth of Murakami\\" I begin to wonder whether those reviewers have ever read any Nabokov, and who was it who told them that Murakami was \\"deep\\".<br /><br />In \\"Slow Learner\\" Thomas Pynchon warns writers of the danger of trying to develop plot and characters around an abstraction like \\"a thermodynamic coinage or the data in a guidebook\\", as it usually results in the kind of apprentice writing exercise that \\"Cloud Atlas\\" too often resembles.  I'm not being mean here, but had I read this four or five years ago, I probably would have concluded that someday, somebody is gonna be making a film of this.  Starring Tom Hanks.<br /><br />I, like most readers, am aware of and sensitive to the environmental and social concerns that Mitchell (more than) touches on in the book, but his proselytizing tone in introducing these important themes is counterproductive, heavy-handed.  If he would insist that it wasn't his goal to underscore the evils of racism, rapacious colonialism, environmental pollution, militarism, et al., then one may rightly wonder what the point of the book is supposed to be.  If it's \\"just a story\\" then it fails as one story, or even a sextet of stories.  As written, the characters just aren't interesting enough.  As a novel, the structure is gimmicky, its logical sequencing tenuous.  As a collection of short stories, it's just weak.<br /><br />Certainly there are moments of luminosity - Sonmi's isolation, Frobisher's picayune complaints - but these are mere particles of light.  Taken separately, the episodes are not sturdy enough to stand on their own (with the possible exception of \\"Letters from Zedelghem\\", though it would require a great deal of 'filling in').  It almost felt as if Mitchell couldn't decide between locking the thing down in an iron-clad plot or allowing it to float free like a none-too-arbitrary collection of ruminations on a theme.<br /><br />Whichever he chose - and I'm still not clear which - it didn't work for me.<br /><br />Despite its size (approaching 600 pages) \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is peopled with characters woefully underwritten, spouting a watery, politically correct, laughably anachronistic kerygma and ending up nowhere.  Apparently.  An exquisitely detailed, utterly directionless, scrupulously elegant chart of floating water vapor, or by any other name a Cloud Atlas.chronistic kerygma and ending up nowhere.

B00006F7S4|5.0|...Those are just a few words I use when asked to describe Sea Change, one of my favorite albums of all-time. I'm a huge Beck fan and I admire the way he's able to evolve and pursue a radically different sound on every album. His constant reinvention and knack for hopping genres is a rare gift that few musicians have been able to pull off so successfully. As much as I enjoy his more bizarre and experimental work, I often find that many of my favorite Beck compositions feature stripped down arrangements and more pensive lyrics. He's done some amazing work, yet Sea Change still stands the tallest in my book.<br /><br />You don't have to be nursing a wounded heart or be at rock bottom to connect with this album. Anyone can enjoy the melancholy tunes and sad tales that he weaves here, yet it works best when you're hurting. No matter what may be troubling you, this album with help soothe it. The story here is certainly tragic, as songs like \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" and \\"Lost Cause\\" quickly reiterate. However, it would be a mistake to assume that this album is just another whiny, self-indulgent breakup album. Beck paints with an entirely finer canvas here, weaving intricate tales of loss and pain with hope and perseverance. The album starts off with darkness, picking up the pieces of a fractured relationship and eventually ends with the advice, \\"Let it pass on the side of the road\\". It's haunting and wonderfully done.<br /><br />The production is nothing short of perfect. Beck's voice effortlessly carries every song, allowing the players around him to add their subtle instrumental touches into each track. The production itself is warm and creates an intimate atmosphere that's easy on the ears. It's one of the best sounding records I've ever heard and Nigel Godrich never fails to bring out the best sounds and performances with any artist he works with.<br /><br />Sea Change is life-affirming and gorgeous. It may throw some fans for a loop, especially if you're expecting the fun and energetic genre mashups of his other work. Don't be turned off: this is Beck at his most real and direct. The result is a modern masterpiece. It may not make you feel better, but it will remind you that someone else understands what you're going through. Sometimes that's enough.fun and energetic genre mashups of his other work. Don't be turned off: this is Beck at his most real and direct. The result is a modern masterpiece.

B007XF4J70|5.0|My wife and I are big Casablanca fans. We recently bought and watched a Blu Ray version of this film. I cannot tell you how detailed and great this film looks. The background detail really stands out. Details that were blurry are now clear and sharp. Want to really see the oriental lamps standout? Ingrid Bergman is absolutely lovely! I urge anybody to purchase or watch a Blu Ray version. The only thing better is seeing the movie on the big screen, but then again the big screen does not have the sharpness of Blu Ray.

B008AT71WI|5.0|LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS started as a black and white cult film in 1960, then an off Broadway musical and finally we got this magical musical color film version LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS in 1986.  The film is in no way dated and is more glorious than ever on this brilliant blu ray release.  The film when first made had the darker ending that was the same as the off Broadway version.  Screening audiences did not like it at all so a new theatrical version was made.  The film was first released on dvd in 1998 and no dvd version compares in any way to this brilliant blu ray.  The Director's Cut with the original ending was contained on the 1998 dvd release but it was in black and white and in no way appeared the way it was truly intended.  Here, for the very first time, we get both the theatrical and original Director's Cut version shown in the exact same quality.  What a treat for fans of the film and this blu ray should certainly earn the film many new fans.<br /><br />The video here is superb with excellent black/white ratio and colors that are vibrant and pop when need be and tone down when called for.  The film needs to go from the slime of Skid Row to the glamour and glitz of the clothing of the story telling trio and the transition is seamless.  Clarity is superb and flesh tones are realistic and clean.  Close ups have crisp detail as does every detail of clothing, background and scenery.  The plant itself is glorious and looks realistic and colorful.  This film really does go all over the place with dark and bright, dull colors and vibrant colors and all scenes look amazing.  The grain has not been changed at all either so the film looks exactly as it was meant to.  Audio is also excellent.  The songs and score here are excellent and all speakers are utilized with the DTS 5.1 audio track.  Dialogue is crisp and clear throughout and the music blends in perfectly.<br /><br />Rick Moranis shines as the nerdy Seymour and Ellen Greene is glorious reprising her off Broadway performance as Audrey.  Their duet on SUDDENLY SEYMOUR is a definite highlight of the film.  Steve Martin and Bill Murray both have superb cameos.  The story of a nerdy flower shop worker who discovers a strange and unusual plant that totally changes his life is original, wacky, witty and totally effective.  This Director's Cut version comes in a great digibook with info on the cast, the making of the film and tons of color pictures.  There is also a personal message from Frank Oz.  This film was an all time favorite of mine when it came out and here on blu ray it far surpasses any expectations I had. It makes sense the stage version ending which worked great in the theater wasn't as effective in the film but finally the Director's Cut is seen as intended, in its entirety with the same respect as the theatrical version.  This blu ray far surpasses any dvd version of the film released before.  If you are a fan this is indeed a must buy.  Blu ray makes this film sparkle and shine with great video and audio.

Collins does a great job with Katniss' internal monologue and the description. Never was the book dull and I was gripping my kindle until the very last page. I can't wait to read book two!(:

B007HACDLK|5.0|The Mitch Rapp evolution just keeps getting better & better. I cannot wait for the next one! Keep them coming Vince!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|A BEAUTIFUL COLLECTION OF INSPIRATIONAL, TRANSENDING SONGS AND UNIQUE VOICE MIX MAKES THIS A GREAT CD.  EACH SONG CAN STAND ON IT'S OWN, HOWEVER AS THEY ARE ALL INCLUDED ON THE SOUNDTRACK MAKES THIS CD TOTALY AMAZING.
1452110581|5.0|I bought this book for some comic relief for my over worked bosses at the vet clinic where I'm a technician. Everyone enjoyed it including the receptionists and kennel assistants. The cat humor was definitely right on par and it's almost like this book was actually written by the cats themselves.
B008J34466|5.0|HER GRITTY HONESTY COMES THRU LOUD & STRONG.  A BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND INTENSE LYRICS MAKES THIS ANOTHER  MONSTER HIT.  ALWAYS SURPRISING, KEEPS PINK FRESH AND THE LISTENER WANTING MORE.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I was going to buy this until I saw \\"UltraViolet Digital Copy.\\" That outdated system can go die a firey death. It's easier for me to freaking pirate movies than watch the UltraViolet digital copy. I won't be purchasing any more movies that have UltraViolet. I'll give my money to companies who aren't using this garbage.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp series is an excellent series. It's my favorite series to read. That's usually a 7 day read for me which is good because normally I finish a book in about two weeks or more.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Played it with my kids; they love it! Works great on SG3. Got it when it was the free app of the day.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Absolutely Love this band and I am sooo happy they are back together, recording, and sounding fantastic. Just like hooking up with an old dear friend that you haven't seen in a while. Taking the time to get caught up.<br /><br />Won't go into the individual songs. You will get that from other reviews. Just know if you are a fan of what they are capable of you will LOVE this album. Amazing voice and lyrics. (DUH!) Song arrangements and individual performances. The sound itself produced VERY well. And of course...Their incredible ability to get you tapping your foot to an odd time signature, before you realize it's NOT 4-4! If you are a fan you know what I mean!<br /><br />This review is obviously for the true fans. BUY IT! You won't regret it! If you are not so big a fan, or on the fence...All the more reason to buy it! Listen and realize what a talented rock band can do!<br /><br />They ARE the contemporary Led Zeppelin in my humble opinion!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Read the book in a day and a half.. I sure hope the USA has actual men and women like Mitch Rapp to keep us safe and free, because the present administration did not do all it should have to keep it's ambassador and his support staff safe.  If this is your first Mitch story, there are 12 previous ones you can read after you are hooked on this one.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I ordered this CD after I had searched for the most moving rendition of Silent Night.  When I played the CD, it brought tears to my eyes.  No other artist came near to Celine Dion as far as feeling the song.  I am using this CD in my church's Christmas play this year.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a book all must read, especially if you want to know more about this immortal woman, who made history with the use of her cells. It was very sad to see how her family was so uninformed about their mothers care and treatment. Henrietta was never given the prestige, and financial restitution due her at that time, while others made fortunes.  She is buried in a unmarked grave!  Now, I know why we all have to be aware of signing any documents required by Dr.'s and hospitals and what these documents mean.  Always read before you sign your tissue, and or cells away.
0062132288|5.0|We bought this for my 8 year old nephew's birthday because he is a HUGE fan of the movie. He was so happy and said this was his favorite birthday gift. It's full of pictures from scenes of the movie and filled with fun behind the scenes information. This is a great gift for fans of the movie.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|I thought the plot interesting and had a few unexpected turns.  Although I did think it was a bit predictable....A good B movie night.
B009MZQQWA|3.0|This is a campy and somewhat bizarre transvestite rock & roll musical.  The 1st 20 minutes or so is excellent for the way it sets the story and presents wonderfully and, in the case of Tim Curry's entrance, striklingly staged and acted musical numbers.  The middle portion of the movie loses steam with regard to plot, acting and musical score.  The exception being the entrance and cameo musical number by Meat Loaf.  The touching and nicely orchestrated &#34;I'm going Home&#34; is the last good thing that happens.<br />I've watched this movie a few times, and have decided that Rocky Horror should be viewed as a series of similarly themed music videos, not all of which are worth watching.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Why did I fall into this trap of intrigue?  Writing was not much better than the first Shades of Grey....The whole series of books could have been written in one book, by leaving out some of the over used suggestive precursor to the &#34;simmering Mr. Grey&#34;.<br />This author must be laughing all the way to the bank!!
B0014JLYS8|3.0|I bought this croc for my son as a gift. He had slipped mine on once and liked how cushy they felt. I ordered these bistro not knowing that they are a harder material croc. Makes sense for kitchen work. So this is not a negative review of this shoe, just a heads up as to the feel for wearing.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Didn't realize they made a sequel to &#34;Lady Chatterly's Lover&#34;...ha ha!  Really poor writing, but I guess I'll forge ahead to see how this seductive Mr. Grey comes to find love and happiness?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I've been playing this game for about a week now and I have not been able to put it down! I have never been this addicted to a game!! It can get pretty challenging, but I think that's why it's so hard to walk away from! Once you start playing be prepared to waste at least an hour or two!!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|More of the same....starting to get a little closer to the reason behind Mr. Grey's sexual appetite.  I think I get an A+ for finishing this series.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is another exciting Mitch Rapp adventure from the pen of Vince Flynn.  A masterful storyteller, this is a must read if you enjoy this genre and author.  Although the conclusion comes too soon, it is a worthwhile read.
B003A9OVS0|5.0|I really liked their music form, unique  from other artist.<br /><br />i suggest test out you by testing the songs first though
1442359315|5.0|Awesome book! Everyone should read it. I bought the audio version as well. This book truly makes a great gift.
B002P8O29K|5.0|They were turbulent times indeed. Most people like too think of the 60s and early 70s as a time of free love and peace and that Woodstock symbolized what was going on. But when the Rolling Stones gave their free concert at Altamont Raceway, mayhem ensued when the Hell's Angels had their way. This concert is really what the times were about. Disorder, confusion, and chaos. Other artists include Jefferson Starship and the Ike and Tina Turner Review. This video is a must for any Stones lover or pop culture historian.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  Every song on here is really good and I put it on repeat all day long.  The lyrics are really beautiful and I cannot wait to go to their concert in Feb.  Will be the highlight of my 2013 year!!!

B000Q67876|5.0|Shawshank is a great movie.  It has a great mix of good acting, comedy and an awesome plot.<br /><br />I could watch this movie over and over and every time its on TV and never get sick of it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|exactly as described<br />amazing free app<br />thanks so much for helping us who can't afford to pay for good apps
B007REV4YI|5.0|To start off, I need to say to all the jokers that say this is a bad movie... I wish you would fall 300 feet from a bridge into water like Bond did at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />This is a top 5 bond film (behind Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, Casino Royale, and Goldeneye).<br /><br />We finally get a glimpse into Bond's past, see some things we've never seen before, and get completely shocked by others.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is an amazing Bond, in the mold of what Fleming originally created.  Behind Connery, Craig is #2.<br /><br />I took my girlfriend to see this movie, who has only seen Casino Royale as her other Bond film, and she LOVED it.  Not only does this film give you action and an adventure, but shows the depth of Bond (and Craig) as a human being.<br /><br />This is a MUST WATCH, MUST OWN.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|Without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time!! Tom Hardy is great in the movie. This movie is done very well. Everything from the acting to the cinematography is great. It's unbelievable that this is a true story too
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Good album.  Can't add much to what others have already said.  If you like Bruce Springsteen, you will like this album.
B0034G4P94|4.0|This is a very enjoyable movie. The acting is excellent. The only problem I have is that the movie drags a little at times, but when the action picks up you are glued to the screen.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the movie. The book is better. Still loved the movie though. They did a good job translating a book to a movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was okay...the book was great.  I didn't like how they changed certain details from the book in the movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's books are really fun and they go fast. Well written with good character development, and the hero always brings the bad guys to justice.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This is one of the best super movies I've seen. The cast works phenomenally well together. The writing is top notch and finally there is a film hulk played by an actor that 'gets' it.
B00A17AD36|5.0|So original and refreshing compared to the majority of crap that litters the radio.  I also appreciate how many songs there are and how long they are.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|Nowhere near Hornby at his best. If felt more like a fun idea he had while reading the paper one day. So he rattled it off and published it.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Another wonderful princess movie by Disney.i wish the father was more involved since this family is actually all still together. It focuses on the mother/daughter relationship, and Merida and her mother both learn important lessons in the end.<br />My 3 yr old likes it but found the parts with the bear to be slightly scary. I could see those parts giving little ones nightmares.
B000YHG72E|4.0|This is just a little more than a Will Ferrell movie. It is definitely among the better of his offereings. Plenty of surprising and quotable lines that will try to get you laughing out loud.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|ambercrombie tells a good ingaugeing story from start to finish cant wait for the next one to finish it up
159102594X|3.0|To give you some context my current favorite series are Mistborn and Game of Thrones. I saw many recommendations for this series since I liked the previously stated. It's only ok... I started reading the second book only because I had it already and didn't have anything else to read. I wasn't tearing my hair out to keep reading. It's funny but I like the auxiliary characters alot more than the main characters<br /><br />I feel like its a novelization of a Sci-Fi Channel original series. You know what I mean... If you like those sort of shows then you will probably like this series.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|'Brave' is entertaining. It is visually pretty, has some touching parts (not as many as the directors were aiming for, I'm guessing), has some funny part, and has some exciting parts. The story is ok. But when all is said and done, the movie is not memorable.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|If your a fan of Shaun of the Dead, this is a must see. It was a constant surprise. It has dumb humor but it's a great parody on cliche cabin-horror movies.<br /><br />Enough said, go watch it!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I have been a fan of marvel since I was a child, and this was a movie done for the fans by a fan. The casting was great, and the humor made this a movie I wanted to keep going back to the theater to see over and over again. Glad I now have the 3D blue ray edition.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas who like me loves musicals. She'll be ecstatic! She lo es Zach efron
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Don't miss out on this one, and the artist who collaborate with Rod Stewart are an added bonus, especially Cee Lo Green!
0316212377|3.0|Reading this book, I wondered if Banks felt like his protagonist, bound to an uplayable instrument and unlistenable music. I don't think he had much fun with this work, I wonder if he was under a contract deadline.<br /><br />Even so, it's workmanlike and Banks moves the story along. I enjoyed it and parts of it have stuck with me. The description of a truly ancient human, and how he managed his memories, reminded me of late Asimov and the 30,000 year old Daneel Olivaw.<br /><br />It isn't, however, terribly novel. Banks returns to old themes, but doesn't add a lot new. I didn't get the usual sense of a deeper meaning underneath a commercial product.<br /><br />Not that the meaning is completely absent. In this world there is an afterlife, and for some it's a Heaven. Certainly far-smarter-than-human entitites think it is -- and yet there is a bit of doubt about the nature of heaven.<br /><br />It is a heaven, however, without any hint of Judgment or Justice. That's relevant when you consider how the book ends, and where our villain goes. Banks has visited this story before, Surface Detail includes a synthetic Hell and cruel judgment.  In a sense HS and SD are complementary books, but as usual Hell makes for better writing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game! I cant stop playing this game. I like the prizes and all the fun bonus coins. Ok back to playing.

B0084U0IEG|5.0|Intrigue, deception, history, nuance.  From the moment I picked this up (actually, tapped  its cover page on my Kindle app), I was hooked.  Took me back to the Cold War, Ian Fleming, John Le Carre, and more.  The ending was a big surprise, and makes me want to go back to read it again to look for any clues I may have missed the first time through.  Enjoy!
B009GJCFL8|5.0|I'm not usually a big fan of Live CD's, but we have a great set list, and magnificent sound quality here. Recorded in Switzerland, while on tour promoting the Omega CD, this CD just sounds great!<br /><br />Asia-nation...be prepared to add another great CD to your collection! You will love it! These guys really are getting better with age. The set list mixes old with new quite well with Phoenix and Omega tracks mixed in well with the 80's stuff.<br /><br />Track List<br />I Believe<br />Only Time Will Tell<br />Holy War<br />Never Again<br />Through My Veins<br />Don't Cry<br />All's a Chord<br />The Valley of Rocks<br />The Smile Has Left Your Eyes<br />Open Your Eyes<br />Finger On the Trigger<br />Time Again<br />An Extraordinary Life<br />End of the World<br />The Heat Goes On<br />Sole Survivor<br />Go<br />Heat of the Moment<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's possible but John Wetton is singing better now than ever before. His voice and natural ability are amazing! \\"Don't Cry\\" really showcases John. AWESOME STUFF!<br /><br />For me \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" is my favorite song the band ever did, and the version on this CD is great!<br /><br />The mix on this CD is heavy on highlighting Wetton's voice. The CD name \\"Resonance\\" really says it all. Webster's Dictionary defines the word Resonance...\\"to relate harmoniously : strike a chord\\". The guys resonate quite well and have produced one of the finest live CD's I've heard.<br /><br />To top it off we have 2 Steve Howe solos of \\"Alls A Chord\\" and \\"Valley of the Rocks\\".<br /><br />The entire 4 man band is in top form. As always, Geoff Downes lays down the massive foundation for all that you hear.  Carl Palmer's relentless effort and amazing ability can really be appreciated on \\"Resonance\\". The mix sort of downplays Carl's drums, but put on your headphones and hear Carl in top form here again.<br /><br />This is a 3 disk set which includes 2 Audio CDS and 1 DVD of the concert. Worth twice the price! This disk set is a true treasure chest of Asia's best, sights and sounds, performed flawlessly. It's a treat to hear how they sound today, and just know, these guys are performing better than ever. When you add in the modern recording technology, you get a first class work of art.

B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Murder. Cannibalism. Death. Obsession. Revenge. Blood. Goth makeup. And lots of razors -- \\"at last, my arm is complete again!\\" Sweeney Todd exults.<br /><br />Somehow it doesn't come as a shock to me that Tim Burton adapted Stephen Sondheim's musical \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" -- or that he somehow spun it into something so delicious. That dark, grotesque, hilariously melodramatic story is perfectly suited to Burton's style, and Johnny Depp is absolutely stunning as the titular bloody barber.<br /><br />The malignant Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) lusts after the wife of Benjamin Barker (Depp), so he convicts Barker of a crime he didn't commit, and enfolds his family into his evil hands.<br /><br />But fifteen years later, the Barker returns to London and sets up a barber shop over Mrs. Lovett's ghastly meat pie store. Of course, he's enraged when he learns that his wife was raped and since poisoned herself, and that his daughter is the ward of the lecherous Judge. Enraged and maddened, Barker renames himself \\"Sweeney Todd\\" and vows revenge.<br /><br />And he finds that he LOVES using his razors for a far bloodier task than shaving. With the help of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) -- who finds a thrifty use for those bodies -- Todd cuts a bloody swathe through all who have wronged him. And when his daughter is punished for refusing to marry the cruel Judge, Sweeney closes in to get his revenge at last.<br /><br />There's always been a gothic look to Burton's movies, and he's always dabbled in very twisted, macabre storylines. And he really tops himself with \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" -- London is painted in black, white and grey, right down to the ghoulish faces of the characters, and their bleak little dens of horror. And songs -- lots of magnificently horrible songs.<br /><br />But Burton pretty obviously adores the combination of gory grotesquerie and very, very sick humour (\\"They don't commit sins of the flesh, so it's pretty fresh\\"). And he doesn't try to make Sweeney or Mrs. Lovett palatable, thankfully. While we sympathize with Sweeney's losses, and the horrors that have changed him into the Demon Barber, you just can't pass over scenes where they sing, \\"It's man devouring man, my dear!\\" \\"Then who are we to deny it in here?\\"<br /><br />There are some moments that relieve this gory gothic parade -- there's a sweet love story between Sweeney's daughter and a young sailor. And the plot becomes progressively darker toward the end (yes, it CAN get worse), when the plot throws us some shocking new twists, resulting in a Grecian-tragedy finale soaked in even more gore.<br /><br />Oh yes, there's blood. Tons of it. It spurts like Monty Python's bloodier sketches, which ends up being more hilarious than yucky -- as is the casual introduction of cannibal meat pies. And there are some spectacularly gross moments, like a finger found in one of the pies.<br /><br />Burton uses some of his favorite actors in this one, particularly Depp and Bonham-Carter. Depp is THE perfect ideal Sweeney Todd -- his creepy eyes, pallid face and still, almost seductive manner are perfect for the maddened murderous barber. He goes through the movie slashing his razors at the world, and injects a real creepiness into scenes like Sweeney cooing at his \\"friends.\\"<br /><br />While she's only a passable singer, Bonham-Carter is eerily wholehearted as Todd's equally amoral partner-in-crime, who is quite happy to assist him.... and make tastier pies in the process. Rickman is wonderfully loathsome as the Judge, and Sacha Baron Cohen has a small but priceless role as Pirello, a huckster acquaintance of Todd's who starts causing trouble. He really steals his scenes.<br /><br />Most directors would have prettified, sanitized and defanged the grotesque \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\" but Tim Burton and Johnny Depp revel in the gore and madness. Astoundingly great.'s pretty fresh\\"). And he doesn't try to make Sweeney or Mrs. Lovett palatable, thankfully.

B006VSP906|4.0|Mortality gets high points for honesty, but is lacking in emotional revelation. For readable treatments of death from a third person perspective, try The Year of Magical Thinking, Blue Nights (both by Joan Didion) or A Widow's Story: A Memoir (by Joyce Carol Oates.)
B009CPES4I|5.0|For those of us in our retirement years this movie was a beacon of light on a dismal planet.<br />Life assuring and realistic.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard so much hype from the media that I decided to find out for myself.  The book is  sex, sex, sex, a poor plot line and not well written.  Sorry, just not my kind of book.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|I liked the action in the call of the wild, especially the scene with buck and spitz barking for supremecy.
B000NY12LO|3.0|My book group had an interesting discussion about this novel that deals with a fictional school shooting with echoes of some real tragedies that we have read about.  The message seems to be that boys who are bullied sometimes turn around and take revenge but the characters are not well-rounded and simply exemplify various 'types'.
1615470158|5.0|One of the characteristics of a really good, classic movie is that it has a lot of memorable dialog.  I could go on for hours quoting one-liners from The Blues Brothers or Princess Bride.  Likewise, I think a good book leaves the reader with gems to ponder and to stimulate ideas.  Such has been my recent experience reading Rob Collie's \\"DAX Formulas for PowerPivot, The Excel Pro's Guide to Mastering DAX\\".  The title doesn't have the allure of an action thriller but it's been a while since I've read a book so entertaining and effective at teaching a valuable skill.<br /><br />I've challenged myself to learn more advanced DAX while honing my skills with PowerPivot and SSAS Tabular Model design.  I understand a lot of the basic concepts but I really need to get deep into practical business calculations.  But unlike the past few years of my BI career that I've spent using IT development and performance tuning tools, I am finding my self embracing the PowerPivot designer in Excel.  In recent BI client work, I see a growing need to help business professionals do their own analysis and self-service reporting.  To educate them, I need to think more like those business users.<br /><br />I have an arsenal of books and resources that are all really good.  However, I chose to focus my attention on using DAX in the Excel add-in for now and then I'll come back to the topic of solution architecture and larger-scale design a little later on.  For now, I'm reading Rob Collie's book page by page and working through the examples.  The pages just ooze with personality and have no shortage of opinion and advice.  I like this quote:<br /><br />\\"Much like the heat and pressure in the earth's crust seize the occasional pocket of carbon and transform it into a diamond, the demands of the modern world `recruit' a certain kind of person and forge them into an Excel Pro.\\"<br /><br />...that's profound.  This isn't a book written for programmers or IT professionals but for the new generation of Excel business super-users.  Rob's book is unlike most of those technical books that decompose a software tool and lay each part on the examining room table, detailing its features and nuances.  He tells you what he thinks and how he has used the tool successfully and then moves on without explaining all of the ways to \\"do it the other way\\".  The pages are full of screen shots, images and diagrams with call-outs and commentary.  Reading it makes me feel like he's personally showing me how to access all the cool trap doors and secrets.  As a technical book writer, it's very apparent to me that this book - although I'm sure it's been thoroughly proof-read and reviewed, has not been subjected to the rigid formatting rules and unforgiving styling of a large publisher.  In places, it's almost like a hand-written manuscript with the author's doodles & personal notes in the margins.<br /><br />There are a lot of good books on the market about PowerPivot, tabular models in SSAS and DAX.  This book focuses entirely on DAX for the Excel professional and teaches DAX calculations and expressions, and not queries.  For me, this is the best book I've found to learn how to think like my business clients and to understand the practical application for the self-service BI designer.<br /><br />More information about this book is available here on the PowerPivot(pro) blog: [...]b's book is unlike most of those technical books that decompose a software tool and lay each part on the examining room table, detailing its features and nuances.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|I wanted to get this movie for a while now a a few days ago I managed to get it. I was very happy to know that it came early and was even more surprised that the disc was were it should be, which is what normally happens when I buy DVDs. The movie looked new, was affordable, and played without able trouble, I hope I can get the same when I find the last movie~<br /><br />Overall, it was a great buy, I couldn't be happier <33
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|I really enjoyed the characters that Cassandra has created in this book, but without over complicating them.  Didn't figure out the twists early on in the book which is great for me as I hate it when I am reading through and have figured it out in the first couple of chapters and am just waiting for the shoe to drop.<br /><br />I recommend it if you like the less gory side of the supernatural.

B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|In a way I feel bad for Rihanna.  She has really tried so hard to embrace this hard image she adopted after she was assaulted and I feel like she was rushed into becoming something that doesn't always fit her aesthetic well.  I've had this issue with her since `Rated R' when she first incorporated this level of edginess into her music.  When Rihanna first popped on the scene she was yet another pop princess with little to differentiate her from every other young singer in the game other than a slight accent in her singing.  Then she dropped `Good Girl Gone Bad' and left us with `Umbrella' and `Disturbia', two tracks that cemented her in the game in a big way.<br /><br />She had the right amount of edge to sustain her career.<br /><br />Sadly after her life altering altercation with Chris Brown she became intent on lacing her every move with a hardness that almost at times embraces the abuse and uses it as a catapult into a newfound musical territory for her.  It works at times, but I have been turned off by Rihanna's intent on throwing out four letter works and singing about killing people as a way to convince us that she is hardcore.  It feels forced and uncomfortable.<br /><br />When she fits so comfortable into tracks like `Diamonds' and `We Found Love' why is there a need to try so hard.<br /><br />`Phresh Out the Runway' is the perfect example of her just sounding stupid.  Yes, let's color every sentence with twelve F-words and try, yet again, to be all gangster when it never sounds right coming out of my mouth.  It doesn't really stop there though.  The poor choices on this album are pretty detrimental.  `Numb' is a vocal fumble, leaving Rihanna sounding really bad.  Her attempt to give an edge to her verse deliver just makes her sound out of tune.  The trend continues right into `Pour It Up', which is atrocious.  The lyrical content is obsurd (singing about wasting money in a strip club does not make you sound as cool as you think it does), but the vocals are the worst she has ever contributed to any track.  She comes across like a young teenager trying to look cool in front of her peers.  \\"Look at me, I have lots of money and like naked women!\\"  She even uses the line \\"I'm going dumb with all my friends\\" and that is exactly what it sounds like.  The disco throwback that is `Right Now' was ill advised.  It doesn't fit and loses all edge and sounds like a dated misstep regardless of the forced techno vibe.  `Get Over It' is also kind of bad.  It just feels poorly executed and boring.  I hate the lazy development of the chorus.<br /><br />But nothing on this album is as offensive or as tacky as `Nobody's Business'.  I really think that someone should have sat Rihanna down and informed her that the tragedy that took place between her and Chris Brown became the world's business when it was plastered all over the place, and while she has made a career out of exploiting that situation and has effective completely remodeled her image, singing a song WITH Brown basically sticking it to everyone who has supported her through this is just in poor taste.  It doesn't help that the song is dated and dumb, but I'm just insulted and offended that she thought this was a good idea.  If you have forgiven him and love him and want to be with him then yay for you, but singing such a tacky song with him about your affections was just wrong.<br /><br />So that's a lot of bad; but when she hits high marks they are really high.<br /><br />`Diamonds' is intoxicating, alluring and the best single Rihanna has dropped in four albums.  `Loveeeeee Song' has such soulful flare and delicate vocal delivery that proves Rihanna has the vocal chops.  `What Now' is astonishingly good, with such vocal highs for Rihanna that I'm shocked and amazed it's on the same album as `Pour It Up'.  Those chorus vocals are just beautiful and emotionally touching.  `Stay' is also very touching and beautifully sung (and features a male vocal that doesn't make me squirm).<br /><br />Then there are some admirable tries that don't nail it but come close.  `Jump' features a ripped chorus from the 90's classic `Pony' and it also features a SICK beat that makes this must have club music.  The dual `Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary' opens with a beat obviously inspired by `Message in a Bottle' and it works really well.  It does feel a tad disjointed in the segues (it almost feels like three separate songs) but it isn't disjointed enough for me to find the song offputting, especially since Rihanna flows into each section flawlessly.  `Get Over it' may be my favorite island inspired Rihanna song.  I find her attempt to bring island flare forced a lot of the time, but she gets this one very close to right.  `Lost in Paradise' closes the album on a nice note.  It isn't her finest moment, but it has a real uplift to it that makes it feel almost rock ballad epic in parts.<br /><br />So, in closing, I'm disappointed in where Rihanna has taken her career.  Reinventing her career and going the hard/edgy route was not a bad choice, but she hasn't learnt how to balance that out yet.  `Loud' was the closest she came, but she got too tacky with `Talk That Talk' and seems to have lost her way entirely here.  Despite having four songs I actually LOVE, this album as a whole is a mess.br /><br />Then there are some admirable tries that don't nail it but come close.  `Jump' features a ripped chorus from the 90's classic `Pony' and it also features a SICK beat that makes this must have club music.

B00005JMCW|3.0|I think most everyone I know has seen the original Disney classic `Freaky Friday', the one with Jodie Foster.  I haven't.  I haven't even seen the original `Parent Trap', starring Hayley Mills either.  Not surprisingly, considering that I was born in the 80's, I've seen both the remakes starring Lindsay Lohan.  I really loved 1998's `The Parent Trap' (for which Lohan should have been up for an Oscar if you ask me) and so I was really excited about seeing `Freaky Friday'.  Sadly, this happened around the time that Lohan's star was rising and her personal life was tanking and, well, it shows in the fact that her acting skills are limited.<br /><br />She had presence, sure (just look at her) and she had major draw because she was young and pretty and young pre-teen girls and boys wanted to watch her in everything, but the talent level had pretty much leveled off and she didn't have the same spark and charisma she possessed as a child actress.  Here, she is just kind of boring.<br /><br />The real show stealer here is Jamie Lee Curtis, who clowns her way through each scene with serious energy that makes a giant impact.  Some of the scenes seem foolish and amateurish (like, she's portraying a teenager, not a child) but she pretty much nails not only the bipolar emotions but also the physical comedy, which can be really difficult to pull off so well.  Still, even with her hilarious performance, this film just doesn't reach the heights I wanted it to.  It isn't very well etched out and the jokes don't feel fresh by any means.  The stuffiness of the film as a whole is a deterrent for it lacks the spark to keep it invigorating.  I was surprised by this, but much like Lohan's performance, this film just kind of left me bored.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|No matter how hard I tried, I could not find enough substance in this movie to like it.<br />Chuck Norris and Arnold both moved around like they were stiff old boards.<br />The writing was terrible.<br />The action scenes were very generic.<br />I cannot recommend this movie to anyone unless your a super super hard core fan<br />of a few of the actors in the movie.
B004FGMV0W|2.0|My biggest issue with Avril is that she has basically become lazy.  I don't know if she's running out of ideas or talent or both, but with each release she seems to regurgitate songs she's already made big and she isn't expanding any of her horizons.  `Goodbye Lullaby' is practically `Under My Skin' with marginally different lyrics.  She has some really good tracks here, and then she has a slew of mediocre tracks that take of large segments of the album.<br /><br />I basically listen to tracks 1-4 and then skip to track 12.<br /><br />`What the Hell' is fun, but nothing new.  `Push' is hushed and moderately edgy.  `Wish You Were Here' is one of the best tracks on the album with the perfect use of a catchy chorus in a thoughtful ballad, but the truth of the matter is that this song sounds like a hybrid of `Tomorrow' or any of her other ballads; the same generic rhythm.  Still, I love the song.  My favorite track is probably `Stop Standing There'.  It balances the ballad aspects with the pop overtones with a fresh effect.<br /><br />Then the album falls off a bit.<br /><br />`Smile' is flirty but conceptually dumb and lazy.  It became apparent at this track that this album was going to blur into itself after a while.  There really is no definition in these songs.  They are just marginally differing variations of the track that came before it (or two songs before it).  Still, the chorus is catchy (aren't they all?) but that verse structure is unfortunate.  `I Love You' is just stupid.  This is the definition of lazy.  The lyrics are ridiculous, that chorus, so skeletal and pre-teenish.  `Everybody Hurts' carries the torch into yet another uninspired `boo-hoo my life is so hard' song that has no relevance because it doesn't say anything at all.  It also suffers from sounding like an early 90's track that was rejected off a Four Non Blondes album or something.<br /><br />A little redemption is found in `Not Enough' that has some dramatics in the right places to give it something special.<br /><br />It's short lived, since the next song is `4 Real', which is just bland for bland's sake.  It goes nowhere and does nothing with nothing.  The hate that `I'm for real' line, which is so dated.  `Darlin' is stripped down, which should have been a nice change of pace, but it comes across boring.  There just isn't anything special about half of this album.  Like I said, they sound like the song that came before it.  No effort was made to make these songs unique or worth listening to even.<br /><br />I really love `Remember When', which is emotional and heartfelt and the chorus is spectacularly constructed.  Like I said, I skip to track 12 (with a brief stop at track 9).<br /><br />`Goodbye' tries something a little different actually, giving it a fairytale like quality and it somewhat works.  Not entirely (her vocals come off strained in parts) but the intention was right and I respect her finally trying something different (it doesn't sound like anything else on the album).  It was a nice way to end the album, even if I only find it marginally effective.  The album doesn't really end there though; for some versions have the extended cut of `Alice' from Tim Burton's miserable `Alice in Wonderland'.  I've always defended Avril, for I feel like she has a great voice, and she demonstrates that here.  Sadly, the song is a forced piece of screaming that never ends.  So, while she shows off her vocal range, she doesn't show any restraint and by the end I wanted to shove a sock in her mouth.<br /><br />TOO MUCH!<br /><br />So, sadly, this album is a mess.  It just doesn't work.  There was a time when I really loved Avril, but it is apparent that she is losing touch with what makes you a relevant artist; change.  If you want to be considered a true artist you have to find that balance of `being yourself' and `adapting to the change in the times'.  Avril is still stuck in late 90's/early 00's view of alternative punk and she hasn't figured out how tomake her sound more modern.<br /><br />Better luck next time.make her sound more modern.<br /><br />Better luck next time.

I am impressed with how Khaled Hosseini managed to relay such thoughts, fears and dreams from a woman's perspective.  I highly recommend this book!

All I can do is rate it from the viewpoint of 1. quality and 2. appeal to a child.<br /><br />On the quality viewpoint the book is very solid construction and I don't see it having any issues for many years to come.  A well constructed book on quality paper.<br /><br />On the appeal viewpoint he jumped up from the floor and thanked us.  He opened the book and stated he would begin reading it that same day.<br /><br />HIT  HIT no misses.

I wouldn't want to be the &#34;bad guys&#34; with these three on the other side. The major surprise in this novel was a &#34;blind sider&#34; and tottaly unexpected. It made me continue to keep on reading even at 4:30 in the morning. Captivating, thrilling, and full of intrigue. The best novel I've read and I've read all of Vince's novels. If you want to be totally adsorbed in a novel and feel that you're part of the story, read &#34;the Last Man, you won't be disapointed.<br /><br />Ken

0375850864|4.0|Have you been searching for books that you can't put down and have to read until the end? You no longer have to keep on playing hide and go seek because When You Reach Me is the perfect book for you. Though you have been warned that people you make first impressions with can turn out to be someone else in the end.<br /><br />When You Reach Me is a novel written by Rebecca Stead. The novel started out in the late 1970s in New York City, explaining a point of view from a sixth grader Miranda. When she starts receiving notes from someone unknown person, she's stuck and confused. Having her mother entered in the $20,000 pyramid after 3 years of trying, problems with Sal and her friends and most important receiving notes from the mysterious person for sure she had her hands full. The start of the book introduced Miranda's mom getting accepted into a game show where she can win money, and Miranda was going to be determined and help her mom win the money. Then there was one day where Miranda and Sal were coming home from school when \\"...he made a fist that came up like a wave and hit Sal right in the stomach...and then the kid whacked him across the face\\"(22). After that day Sal stopped doing anything with Miranda, shutting her out of his life. Along with her first and second note she receives, Miranda starts to piece things together but when her last note arrived she was too late. \\"...Suddenly the laughing man was in the street, his leg flying out in a mighty kick...the laughing man's foot hit Sal's body...the truck hit the laughing man.\\"(160) What she witnessed with her eyes she knew that it was always going to reply in her mind. As I said people who you make first impressions with can turn out to be someone else in the end.<br /><br /> I remember when my teacher handed out the book When You Reach Me that we were going to read. From the title and the cover I wasn't interested in reading it, but like they say \\"don't judge a book by its cover.\\" After reading the first fewchapters I realized that they were really short and this is what I love about books. The way short chapters are set up to me is that you read the title and the writing in that chapter can answer your questions. Though when the story started including all the notes it gave the story a good twist and I was surely ready to finish the book and find out the truth. Family and friendship to me was the strength to this book. It made the reading more interesting because anything could happen with friend's family anyone.<br /><br /> In my opinion, I think that towards the end when the author starts to explain the time travel part, I sort of got side tracked. I felt as if to much information was being given out all at once and maybe the author could have stated it differently. The transformation between Miranda's favorite book A Wrinkle In Time, and its connection to Miranda was hard to keep up with. Other than that the book was well written and you can be easily amused.<br /><br /> This book could be read by any ages. You can read this book in your free time or just something quick and easy. Though I feel as if this book is too easy for middle school because, they should be able to read and understand heavier vocabulary and structure. It would be a good book for 4th or 5th graders because they would have a better understanding and they can keep up with the book. It would also be a good book for them according to what they learn about in school. I am not saying that this book is not good for anyone older than 4th or 5th grade, however adults can read this too because this story has a circular pattern that connects from the start to the end.<br /><br /> Throughout the story Rebecca Stead includes personality phrases or words to tell us what each character is like. For example, when the author describes Miranda as a \\"latchkey child\\" and  \\"...name for a kid with keys who hangs out alone after-school until a grown-up gets home to make dinner.\\"(3) This explains that Miranda has herkey to her house and that she's usually home alone until her mom comes home, showing that she is independent. Also, when the story starts off with her mom receives a postcard from the $20,000 pyramid \\"...after three years if trying, she actually made it.\\"(1) Reminds me of the time when my cousin got tickets for a Justin Bieber concert ticket, she waited 2 years for another one of his tours to come to America. I connected to Miranda when she says \\"...I love to stand in the warm cloud of dry-cleaner and take deep breathes.\\" I don't know if that is weird but when I go by a dry cleaner I just love the smell and makes me all cool and chill like Miranda feels. To sum up, these phrases describe the characters in their unique way.<br /><br />I could really connect to the character, Miranda and to the setting in New York City. Miranda is like me; we both enjoy helping others and making others go first before us. In personal, I had a friend in 5th grade that just stopped talking to me in the middle of the year. She wasn't hurt by anyone like Sal; she would just become real quiet around me. I didn't want to talk to her after calling her and trying to be partners for group work in school for so long. Though towards the end of the year when I she came up to me and said that she just wanted to be away from me and take a break. After I felt so much better like Miranda felt when Sal confused why he wasn't talking to her. I could really connect to the setting New York City because I have been there many times so I could visualize the book in my mind. When the author explained the home of the laughing man I remember that when I walk around in the street of New York City I see people on street corners just like him. Also when the laughing man saved Sal from the truck, I could really picture in my mind, a busy city street and Sal who was about to cross and was saved by the laughing man. To me I could really picture the story in my mind because of all the detail Rebecca Stead included.<br /><br />I can surely understand that from reading this book, Rebecca Stead has showed me her skills. She did a great job of telling the audience of flashbacks and to present day times. Also, the way she included the notes that are spread out through the book, it's an amazing addition. Furthermore, I would give this book a four out of five because it exceeded my expectations.
B000026OW3|3.0|Of course Rubenstein is a very good pianist and arguable the best interpreter of Chopin. However, I would argue against that point at times. Sometimes Rubenstein plays with too much rubato.<br /><br />Chopin's own playing was very steady-paced with the accompaniment hand and only performed the rubato with his other hand when he did. He stressed evenness a necessity.<br /><br />And the Sonatas as performed by Rubenstein leaves something to be desired. In Sonata #2 in B Flat minor, Mvt. 1, it begans Grave, then Doppio Movimento. For the Doppio Moviment, Chopin uses pedal markings and legato (a definite mark of Chopin). Rubenstein plays without the pedal or legato. To me, without the pedal and the legato, the piece loses much of its breath-taking beauty. I absolutely LOVE that Sonata...just not how Rubenstein plays it.<br /><br />Also, the etudes (perhaps what many people know Chopin best for, e.g. &#34;Revolutionary&#34; Etude) are not included in this collection.<br /><br />And though the preludes are include, they are of such a poor quality that all they do is waste space. These are obviously very old recordings, though I mean that in the worst possible way.<br /><br />All in all, I do not hate Rubenstein. But I would HIGH RECOMMEND Chopin Complete Edition by Various Artists (sold here on Amazon) over this.
B002361MLA|5.0|An inspiring read, taking you on a very interesting spiritual journey. This book is one of my favourite, I recommend to read it slowly.
B004WQ2L9G|5.0|If you know anything about music, most especially piano, then nothing need be said about Liszt. This particular collection I really enjoy. It includes his symphonies, symphonic poems, solo piano pieces, organ pieces... if you are looking simply for a collection of Liszt's complete works, then look no further. These works are exquisitely performed by some very talented musicians.<br /><br />Even, or especially, if you don't know much about Liszt or his music, I highly recommend this set.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Love this movie. Although I have seen it hundreds of times and know the outcome, still get on the edge of my seat. Now that I got on blu-ray, it is even better. Love how they trick you in the menu section.

0811877485|1.0|I love these decals but they won't stay on the wall! The butterfly and the caterpillar come bent in the package and immediately bubble off of the wall at the crease. The sun is not bent in the package and takes a little longer to fall off but still does within 24 hours. I am so disappointed!
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro is the finest short story writer of modern times.  This volume is the culmination of her long career, with stories that are memorable, poetic, and quietly breath-taking.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Took FOREVER for the book to get interesting and ended with a hurried, convenient ending. ..but not too bad overall.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Fantastic movie!  Could not have been cast any better.  Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones should receive Oscar nominations for their roles.  All were exceptional.  One of the very few movies I've seen that ended with the audience applauding.  The only fault I found with the movie was the failure to mention Lincoln's fourth son.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|Giving it as a gift.  Have seen it several times and loved it every time.  A must have in your DVD collection.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is a good read and a well executed story.  I enjoy Flynn's literary style.  Having said that, I find it difficult to embrace her characters emotionally.  It's more about the story itself.  It is as if I am sitting at a campfire entranced by a tale of horror and waiting for the Boogie Man to pop out of the bushes!
B007HACDLK|3.0|The &#34;Last Man&#34; is a fair attempt at making an exciting thriller. It doen not stand up to his previous novels and is slow starting. Once you get into it, it will hold your interest but by no means is it a &#34;Page Turner.&#34;

141659521X|5.0|This is the kind of book that you struggle to put down. Every page something gnaws at your gut, suspense sets in and you can't stop reading. Flynn uses is masterful storytelling skills to once again create a masterpiece. Flynn stuck to his guns when writing this book, using his knack for suspense he gives readers delight and horror on every page. Such things such as Mitch Rapp being a less than dynamic character, and the re-use of characters makes this book familiar with Flynn's followers. One of the main reasons I enjoy reading Flynn's novels is that they are highly unpredictable. Some others might be the detailed settings, the depth of knowledge Flynn has for military operations/weapons/tactics/vehicles, mastery of point of views for different characters, the list goes on. Over the years I have had the opportunity to reads these great works in the Mitch Rapp series, I suggest to anyone that they should read the books as well.<br /><br />I give this book a five out of five for its tactful suspense, unpredictability, and its realistic flair.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first introduction to Gillian Flynn and I am definitely going back to read her prior works. This novel was engrossing from start to finish and her characters are well-written and fully fleshed out. The antagonist is infuriating, as all good antagonists should be. Her protagonist could be infuriating as well, which tends to frustrate but keeps the reader engaged at the same time. Flynn's writing style has a fluid pacing and distinct voice, which are two hallmarks of an excellent storyteller--hope to see more from her soon.
B004P7CNUY|4.0|\\"Halloween: H20\\" is an almost perfect \\"end\\" to the Halloween Saga. I'll state why it is almost perfect at the conclusion of my review.<br />  Apparently, Jamie Lee Curtis had the idea to do a 20th Anniversary Halloween film because she wanted resolution for her character, original \\"Halloween\\" heroine Laurie Strode.  That is an inspired idea.  \\"H20\\" sensibly ignores/disregards the events of \\"Halloween  IV, V, and VI\\"  (Great-- because I never bothered with those sequels, anyway). \\"H20\\" brings everything back full-circle by bringing everything back to Laurie.  The original working title of this film was \\"Halloween 7: The Revenge Of Laurie Strode.\\"  Laurie may have survived the original murder massacre of her \\"brother\\" Michael Myers (which comprise the original \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Halloween II\\"), but she is, in many ways, a psychological and physical mess. In order to escape the terror of Michael Myers, Laurie faked her own death. Living under the new name of Keri Tate, she had a son named John (Josh Hartnett) and became a teacher at the exclusive and private Hillcrest Academy in California. She is also a \\"functional alcoholic\\", using several medications to help with her re-occurring nightmares of Michael Myers. As a mother, she is overprotective and paranoid, and John is growing tired of acting as his \\"mother's keeper.\\" To be whole and free again, Laurie must battle Michael Myers on Halloween, 1998-- exactly 20 years after the original nightmare began.<br />  \\"H20\\" functions successfully as a homage to other films; most specifically the original \\"Halloween\\" and Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" (1960), the classic horror film that inspired IT. A classmate tells John that if he remains so attached to his mother, he will end up running a deserted hotel off some deserted highway-- a direct reference to \\"Psycho.\\" Janet Leigh, mother of Jamie Lee Curtis and star of \\"Psycho\\", has a small role as Laurie's secretary. We even see Leigh with the original car she famously drove in \\"Psycho.\\" Recalling the original \\"Halloween\\", it is especially nice to see  Nancy Stephens briefly reprise her role as nurse Marion Chambers from \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Halloween II.\\" It is mentioned that Chambers was the devoted assistant and care-taker to Dr. Sam Loomis ( the late Donald Plesence) who pursued Michael Myers throughout \\"Halloween I, II, IV, V, and VI.\\" Chambers' discovery that Michael Myers has broken into her home and stolen the private file on Laurie Strode sets the plot of \\"H20\\" in motion. When John's girlfriend Molly (Michelle Williams) asks why his family does not celebrate Halloween, he casually answers, \\"We have a serial killer in our family who kills people on Halloween.\\" Of course, Michael Myers does show up at Hillcreast Academy for some 20th Anniversary murders. But, like the original \\"Halloween\\", the emphasis in \\"H20\\" is on suspense instead of graphic murders, so the body count is surprisingly low.<br />  The climax/resolution between Laurie and Michael Myers is enormously satisfying; both dramatically and psychologically. It is an almost perfect \\"end\\" to the \\"Halloween Saga\\"; meaning that THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN \\"THE END.\\" But somebody came up with \\"Halloween: Resurrection\\", which negates everything in \\"H20\\". But, as \\"H20\\" ignores/disregards \\"Halloween IV, V, and V\\", simply ignore the \\"Resurrection\\" and let \\"H20\\" be the perfect end to the Halloween series.<br />  The Dimension Collector's Series DVD features a Behind The Scenes Featurette, a \\"Halloween Trivia Game\\", and a Music Video.o.\\" Recalling the original \\"Halloween\\", it is especially nice to see  Nancy Stephens briefly reprise her role as nurse Marion Chambers from \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Halloween II.\\" It is mentioned that Chambers was the devoted assistant and care-taker to Dr. Sam Loomis ( the late Donald Plesence) who pursued Michael Myers throughout \\"Halloween I, II, IV, V, and VI.\\" Chambers' discovery that Michael Myers has broken into her home and stolen the private file on Laurie Strode sets the plot of \\"H20\\" in motion.

B0002IQNAG|4.0|This sequel to Night of the Living Dead by George A. Romero has probably solidified him as the father of the modern zombie movie. If all western philosophy is footnotes to Plato, then all modern zombie movies are footnotes to Romero's first three zombie films (Day of the Dead is the third). They've all been remade and countless spin-offs and imitations are out there.<br /><br />The movie follows a few survivors in the midst of the zombie apocalypse (though they don't call it that). The action begins in Philadelphia, where a television station is trying to stay on air as long as it can to give people the information they need (and max out their ratings). Even if the information they have is becoming hopelessly out of date. The air-traffic reporter takes his girlfriend (one of the producers at the station) in his helicopter to find safety somewhere else, like maybe Canada.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the military is trying to round up people and get them to safe locations. This effort is not going well since some people are resisting. The racist members of the military use the situation as an excuse to open up on minorities. This part of the film is probably the most jarring and seems like social commentary thrown in for its own sake rather than for narrative coherence. Eventually a couple of soldiers join up with the TV station staff in the helicopter and head out looking for safety.<br /><br />As they fly from fuel point to fuel point, the foursome wind up at an isolated suburban mall that still has electricity. No one is around but the zombies. The survivors speculate that the zombies have some residual memories of being at the mall and it being a happy place. Realizing that the mall has everything they could ever need, they decide to clear out the zombies, secure the entrances, and set up a good life for themselves. Naturally plans don't go according to plan (otherwise, where would the drama be?) and their heavenly haven slowly becomes overrun with problems.<br /><br />The film's best part is the mall sequence, though it takes a good 40 minutes or so to get there. After they've cleaned up the place, they try to live the good life like there's nothing going on outside. Eventually television broadcasts stop so no information is available, furthering their fantasy of isolated security. They try to live happily with all the jewelry, clothes, and electronics they could ever want. The emptiness of consumerism eventually hits them but too late, because new zombies and a biker gang are on their way. Romero is merciless in mocking the low ambitions of all the characters. The drama and the satire are well blended if over the top at times. During the final battle with the zombies, an extended sequence goes comic with, among other gags, the humans throwing pies in the faces of the zombies. I know it sounds like I'm making it up, but I swear I am not! A good five minutes of slap-stick precede the more horrific situation when the zombies get the upper hand and begin to take back the mall and pick apart the living humans (yes, I do mean that literally).<br /><br />The gore is very extreme. I'm not really a fan of gore though I can take it if the story is interesting enough or the characters engage me. So I did make it to the end of this film, but just barely. The social satire is surprisingly fresh though Romero is a little too pessimistic for my tastes.<br /><br />Another thing to note--several different versions of this film exist. The American theatrical release is different from the international release (Italian horror master Dario Argento made that cut of the film, apparently with less humor and more music) which is different from the \\"extended\\" edition which has another 12 minutes that was reinserted by someone other than Romero and Argento. I'm not sure which cut I saw though judging by the humor and lack of music it was the American cut. I watched on BBC's iPlayer, so maybe it is the Argento cut. I don't think I'll watch it again to find out.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great app!  Nice big buttons (Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;) and it shows your numbers and function that you entered earlier.  It's hard to remember if you pressed + or - key, so the display really helps.  Another nice feature is the continuation of the last figure when you return back to the app.  Suggestion?  Ahh, maybe a sound on key entry or posible voice reply to key and product.

B00005NKCM|5.0|I stumbled onto this wonderful period series recently, never knowing or remembering that the masterpiece production dates back to the early 70s.  The show, however, takes place in the early 1900s in posh London.  It is truly a first class operation, fine acting, beautiful sets, superb period costumes, enthralling storylines, and just plain fun to watch; yes there is a share of humor.<br /><br />The premise of the show is the upperclass extremely wealthy family of four, parents and their two adult children. The adult children make their presence periodically, and the servants have their share of dramatic escapades in the lower part of the mansion.<br /><br />The characters are all memorable, engaging, and quite entertaining to absorb.  What makes this such an addictive series to watch is what you learn about how the wealthy and servants behave, perform,  and communicate.  The episodes take you several places without one getting over exposed by the same sets.  It is a wonderful lesson on historical periods.<br /><br />What's good is that you may need to use the subtitles, due to the accents, and just to learn so many new phrases and words that cover interesting topics that one is no familiar with.  The subtitles for Season One are very good, no gaps, and correct titles.<br /><br />Plus, the episodes are fast-paced, nothing drags, content is filled with dialogue.<br /><br />Once you start this, you just keep going into more and more.... I call it addicting.... Love it!  Rizzo.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the style of writing and the set up. I was intrigued to continue reading the whole time, I did not love the ending as much as I expected.

B009E3EY38|3.0|Just finished listening/watching Celebration Day and I have mixed feelings about the release. It was great to see them reunite with Jason on drums. It doesn't happen to often when an iconic band like Zeppelin reunite for a show and it was nice they did to give the fans one last time to reminice of bigger than life drums and monster riffs. I listened to the cd first before watching the blue ray. My first thoughts after popping in the cd was that there seemed to be a lack of energy from the band. My second thought was that Plant's vocals didn't seem strong. I kinda expected that. I think the years have caught up to him. He didn't sound bad, just not as strong as he did back in the day, but then again...expected. Jimmy's riffs as usual played sloppy with feeling (as I like it), but off on occasion. The highlight for me was tracks  No Quarter, Since I ve Been Loving You and Dazed And Confused. The rest of the tracks were fine, but I could've done without In My Time of Dying and For Your Life.  I thought they could've chosen something else like The Ocean or Heartbreaker. As far as the mix is concerned, it sounds a little bass heavy to me and they definitely had some effects on Robert.<br />As far as the blue ray is concerned, I'll just comment on the actual video. The picture is crystal clear as it should be. Very crisp. What I didn't care for was the constant changing of the camera angles and the &#34;fuzzy&#34; effects they put in. No special features on the blue ray. The bonus disc was of a June rehearsal. I thought this bonus disc was a waste. It was shot from such a distance you can barely recognize the band. Same setlist. The only other material is a 5 minute montage of media coverage and the opening Tampa film shown just before they take the stage. Nothing exciting about this disc at all.<br />Overall worth getting if your a completest. If your a casual fan How the West Was Won is a much better live show. Performance wise I even thought The Song Remains the Same was a better recording IMHO.<br />After watching/listening to this show I can see why they won't tour, but it was great for Zeppelin to give the fans one last show.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was interested in reading this book because I was interested to see how J.K. Rowling would come out from the shadow of Harry Potter. I was pleasantly surprised. It was more adult than I expected and touched on very important social issues.

It's the same fast-paced matching game as the Nintendo version.<br /><br />*Each level gives a challenge to be met before time runs out.<br />*Timer runs a bit fast after Level 5...could stand to be slowed by dev.<br />*Would like to see Endless mode included.<br />*Compress the app file a bit...Kindle users are limited on app space.<br /><br />Overall, a solid app. Great FAOTD.
1451695195|5.0|I first heard Dr Alexander speak of his experience on  the TV show &#34;Beyond & Back&#34;, on the Bio channel, earlier this year. I was blown away by his testament at that time, then to see him emerge on TV talk shows was even more amazing! This man has a mission that no one can refute. I can't wait to see him on Oprah this Sunday!

B00535RV8Q|5.0|What can I say? This is McCartney at his best. You know all the songs, equal only to Ram which is also in my collection. I also highly recommend using the Amazon cloud for music on the computer. Very easy to use and very much like my Kindle.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|Well, honestly I love this Joystick, it is very easy to install; the moment I plugged it in to my computer, FSX pick it up and was ready to use. Movability, throttle control, advanced animations, and comfort is exactly what this Joystick bring to flight simulation.<br /><br />The one down side I found about this product is when you leave the stick in a neutral position, the aircraft is still at a bit of a climb. Maybe this can be fixed by calibration or something in that sort.<br /><br />Overall I give this product a 95/100

0812550706|1.0|If you like shallow characters and a story that reads like a video game, dig in. I got suckered into this one and dutifully plodded along until the main character became 'one with the ants' (after destroying their entire civilization)!  I can't beleive the author had the nerve to write sequels (do I hear a k-ching k-ching?).  And such a symbolic name for a guy that destroys worlds - Ender!<br /><br />SF has become a pile of criminal garbage - stuff like this just adds to the heap.<br /><br />So Look up Sheep and stop buying this junk.  Ask for real SF!<br /><br />If I could give this one a zero I would.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|I watched this movie with my dad a few days ago and we both absolutely loved it. I was so shocked that my dad did, because he is a tough critic, and he absolutely adored it. So this is my Christmas gift to him, and I totally recommend it. It was done in such a wonderful, unique way and such an adorable story. Awesome awesome awesome.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon gave it to me free on my computer as a rental! I was so surprised :)

B00004Y6NP|5.0|This is one of the GREATEST Albums of all time in my opinion. Even if you're not a fan of Dire Straits, this album could change your opinion. I'd have to rate this as a top 10 all time album and slot it near the top of the list.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Ever since Come Away with Me in 2003, I have been a big Norah Jones fan. Through a series of hit and miss on her albums, this one ranks as a one of the top picks. When I popped it in, I heard the comforting music I've grown to love.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I really enjoyed Twin Peaks back in the day it aired. I was very impressed with the clarity and sound quality in this edition and would reccomend this to any Twin Peaks fan that wants to relive the experience. Great show and Great Remake.
B003K15IF8|5.0|This book is so beautifully written. The descriptions of the main character, William Stoner, the Classical English professor, is sensitively worded and never boring. The writer never uses a florid style that in many novels becomes long winded with boring use of words. Here the style is so to the point and sensitive. Stoner is the kind of person with whom many of the readers can identify. There are tragic incidents that occurred in his life which has occurred in the life of many people in one form or another that makes the reader sympathize and identify with him. Stoner came from poverty stricken, farming parents but never rose from rags to riches, but from rags to academia. His marriage was a total failure and yet he stuck it out. His only daughter became an alcoholic. His wife hated him and tried to turn his daughter against him. All the intrigues of academia are also well described. Stoner's life was a tragedy and the book will linger on in one's mind for a long time. An excellent book that deserves every star rating that it gets.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|It was a neat game when I got it but now it will not run on my galaxy S2.  This has happened a few times with apps from Amazon.  Stick with the google play store...
0307454568|4.0|We don't see as much of Lisbeth Salander in The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest as we did in the previous two segments of Stieg's Larsson's trilogy.  But we get a good look into her mind which is an awesome thing.<br /><br />I liked the way the author wove his fictional characters into the real-life intrigue in the Swedish government, their politicians, security police and immigration problems.  Larsson either had a phenomenal imagination or inside connections.<br /><br />The introduction of Blomvkist's sister, attorney Annika Giannini, brings a new dimension into the story as Giannini interacts with Lisbeth, her brother, the police, Lisbeth's doctors, current and past, and the courts.<br /><br />Internet possibilities, the dereliction of duty of Lisbeth's childhood physician Doctor Teleborian and its results, both in the past and present, and her current doctor's skill and empathy combine to make a spine tingling finale with some late term surprises.<br /><br />What a pity author Larsson's talent was taken from the publishing world much too soon.
B005LAII08|5.0|I do a lot of shopping with amazon and have always been happy with service. They have even gone above and beyond to get a shipment to me in a timely manner before I was even a Prime member. I own a Kindle Fire HD and I can't transfer the Brave movie to it due to the DRM protection. I don't think this movie and the Kindle should be a suggested sell together, if they don't work together. I do have the digital copy version of the movie and it does not work with my kindle. I notice that they now have ultraviolet copies of certain movies that will work. Wish they would make those available as an upgrade to customers who bought movies through amazon prior to the release of ultraviolet, expecting digital copies to work on kindles.<br /><br />Loved the movie though. Really cute. A little scary for our 3 year old, but she still likes to watch it. She just runs onto someones lap for the bear parts.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The awards say it all.  This is an excellent movie.  Whoever casted this movie knew what they were doing.  Even though it is made up, it could have happened.  I did not read the book, so I am not sure how accurate it is compared to the book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follet is, in my opinion, one of the best story tellers of our times.<br />He makes me learn history entangled with the characters' personal stories.<br />He gives excellent development and closing to all the different stories he tells in this book.<br />I also really like his way to describe people, landscapes and situations.
0439023513|5.0|This was an excellent wrap up of the entire series.  Although Catching Fire had better fighting scenes, this book gives you more insight to the kind of world they live in.  The only criticism I will give is that I thought this last book would give some information on how North America collapsed and how Panem was formed.  But hey, we can only hope for a prequel in the works!
B000001ELP|4.0|Music From The Elder is a very good HALF an album and what I mean by that is when I listen to it,I get the feeling that there's alot more that we didn't get on the album. There are some good stuff & some not so good stuff on this album but its worth a listen regardless.<br /><br />...and what is this \\"Music From\\" business? Why did $immon$ allow this to hit the streets unfinished? He should've known better than that.<br />I would like to see this album/movie/book/whatever finished. I hear there's a man in England making a movie of this. I hope he does it right.

0060734191|5.0|I have read several of Garth Nix's books and while I have enjoyed many of them these are by far my favorite. The books have a little bit of almost everything I like in a book and even some things I usually don&#34;t. I will be the first to admit I usually hate books that have anything to do with zombies skeletons or anything usually found in horror books. While this is found in these books it is done in a way that doesn't bother me so much. There are times when It can be a little slow moving but then things usually pick right up and the next thing you know it is 3 am and the book is finished and you are wanting to start the next one but know you have to go to bed.
B007HJ91HU|5.0|Hey!<br />I was a teen of the 80's!  Loved the original Footloose very much(Who does not absolutely love Kevin Bacon)!  Never have been a fan of remakes.  However!  This one is great...gives the backstory and so much more depth to the story....Great movie!
B0059X53IW|5.0|I have performed in the Magnificat, and loved that music so much I wanted to own a recording of it.  I love singing along.  I hadn't heard the Requiem prior to purchase, but it is beautiful.  All the music brings my emotions up front.  Sometimes I wanted to cry, and sometimes the beauty of the music made me smile for hours, and the melodies echo in my mind at odd moments of the day.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold is complex, and has a hard time expressing himself. As his journey unfolds, so then does the story of his past and you begin to understand his pain. The wonderful characters along the way, who have their own stories add a great deal to the book. Beautifully done and grabs your heart.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i read this book and it was good all the fist page to the last i can want to see the moive.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This is the third or fourth Tinkerbell movie I've bought for the grandchildren for Christmas. They love them, the fact that there is a new one each year, just before Christmas, is something for them to look forward to at the holidays. Their ages are seven and nine, and they really love Tinkerbell.<br /><br />Not only do they love to watch the movies, they take out several fairy books from the library, there are so many. It's great that the movies encourage them to read, especially these days, when children spend so much time playing video games etc. I will probably keep buying the new Tinkerbell movies every year until they stop making them, they are great for adults too, the color is out of this World.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn does it again. Hard to put down. One of the best books I read all year! The Last Man is a more than a little thought provoking too with the way our country is heading.
B007Q0OUNA|4.0|Loved building this one.  Good times with my son.  He is getting ready for the Hobbit release coming out soon.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man<br /><br />Absolutely fantastic thriller. By far, one of Vince Flynn's best books. I could not put this book down, once I started reading it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Fans of Michael Buble will love this album. I really appreciate the different styles he chose for his renditions. There's everything from classic (\\"Silent Night\\") to modern (\\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\") to retro (\\"Jingle Bells\\"). All the tracks are beautiful. Worth every penny.
B008CP93S0|1.0|It made me cry because I didn't want to keep watching it, but I felt I had to because I paid for it.  Terrible acting, the plot was horrid and I feel like I got dumber from watching it.

B007C9N4H8|1.0|I grew up loving The Muppet Show and Muppet Babies.  I had a lot of hope for this movie, especially given that Jason Segel was the one behind it, but I was greatly disappointed.  It was dull and uninteresting and genuinely not funny.  I did not want to give it 1 star, but alas, it really wasn't a good watch.
B00846F1YW|3.0|i love da game , but it only let me play to level 12, then da game cuts off. If it was not for that it would get 6 stars...
B0084IG8TM|5.0|If you liked the books, you'll enjoy the movie.  It stayed as close to the book as it reasonably could within the time frame.  It was very well done and I recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so interesting to watch. Not predictable like alot of shows are today. Certainly makes one ponder the possibility of such an occurance.
B008F5YDRI|2.0|It was a pleasant idea for a movie, with a poorly executed and unrealistic plot (not that all plots are realistic).  It was just too far fetched for my taste, though it did have a somewhat positive message.
B0086213XW|5.0|I have lived this story in my life before, and learned the lesson of the woman in this film. It is a very tough lesson to learn. It is hard to explain exactly what prompts people to ride the thrill that drops them off in exactly the same place where they started, only to regret having taken the ride in the first place. This film tackles this paradox tenderly, and with great poetic wisdom. I love its sometimes dream-like quality; it seems to capture wordlessly the internal dialogue of the characters quite well. Excellent acting all around, beautiful cinematography and screenplay.
B006VRZ5YM|5.0|I did not expect this to be as good as it was.  It was very funny and I truly enjoyed the unique plot.  Anna Farris was wonderful and kept me laughing.  The chemistry between the characters was cute too.
B000JML7EC|5.0|RLS was one of those writers that they tried to MAKE your read in grade school. I resisted for years.  I had heard of the book for years but never really realized that RLS had written it.  I got interested and decided to give it a read. I loved it!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I can't say anything negative but the movie wasn't as fantastic as it looked on previews. Charliez Theoron is gorgeous and rocks her role! Kristen Stewart puts on a convincing performance, but I'm still use to the \\"vampire girl\\". All in all, the movie is good. I would buy it for my personal collection. The kids in my house did watch it, they liked it as well.
B000JQU4TW|1.0|I did not enjoy this story.  I really really wanted to.  I tried very hard but in the end I was just plain bored.  When I realized I was wasting my time I moved on.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Watching Channing Tatum dance was the only good thing in this movie- the guy can move. Matthew Mcconaughey, although he's a good looking man & good actor- he came off as an idiot. Nothing was sexy or exciting about the movie & the storyline was just so dumb that it couldn't be taken seriously. It was a dissapointment!
0765350386|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel, and I think it is one of Sanderson's best works. This written work introduced many new aspects to fantasy, and that was an enjoyable relief from the stereotypical plot and characters.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|I love Tim Burton & Johnny Depp especially, however this film was not funny, the acting was horrible, the storyline was just all bad. I rented the movie & took it back the same day. I would not buy this movie even if I was dying of boredom.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Rapp always gets his man. It's just a matter of how he's going to do it. And of course, there's always justice for those who stand in his way. Glad Flynn got back to his old formula.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I read the LJ Smith books before I knew this was a TV series.  Once done with the first few books I was shopping for more and found out about the show.  I am completely addicted!  I have purchased all the seasons so far on DVD.  All of them have come in perfect condition.  No complaints from me!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Liked everything about this book.  Couldn't put it down.  It's an action book so there is a lot of that which makes one want to continue reading; however there are a number of things that make one think about what really goes on in the world.
0545265355|5.0|I inhaled this trioligy in one weekend.  I hadn't picked up the books before the movie came out but once I saw the movie I had to have them.  They came promptly and the box is very sturdy and looks nice on my bookshelf.  I kept the books in it after I read them and it makes for a nice bookend!

B006JP11HQ|5.0|This is a book that makes you think about what you know to be true filtered from what you have been could be. Every page, almost every paragraph is a time for reflection on man and how society should be organized, and what freedom we give up to have government intervention.<br />Friedman does admit that government has a role, that there are organizing principles and things the group cannot accomplish through private enterprise, but he reminds us they are far fewer than what many think today. In this day of bloated government and deficits, we need to be reminded of that lesson.
B001EIK7IC|5.0|I loved this C D  my husband and i are replacing all our album with cd i was sad to hear one week after buying this Terry Callier passed away now  we are ordering all of his collections.
0785163174|2.0|Getting this $75 book for around $30 was a huge deal on amazon. However the story was just not well put together and without the side stories in Wolverine and the X-men and Uncanny X-men you do not get the entire story. Also as a Cyclops fan I felt this book could not have written him any worse.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present so I can't actually review the CD itself, but incredibly fast shipping and a great price & great packaging. Thanks again!

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This is yet another Hollywood product that envisions/portrays life as an extension of, or proxy for, high school. Although the actors themselves are obviously older, they are transparently playing 15 year olds. Noomi Rapace stars as an over-the-top spoiled brat/drama queen. And there are the requisite doofuses and other stock characters of this genre. The characters' \\"adventures\\" are a result of a mix of their impulsiveness, rebelliousness, recklessness, carelessness, and other compulsive and pointless risk-taking behaviors, enhanced by stupidity and inexperience.<br /><br />Although it conforms to the teen horror movie convention of having characters take the most unimaginably stupid actions, it does not qualify as a horror movie because the surprises aren't. Plus I had no empathy for any of the characters. And the only (mild) suspense came from monitoring my own reactions: Did I think that this character deserved to die a slow gruesome death, or did I simply want him/her dead quickly so that the movie would be closer to being over? Turned out to always be the latter.<br /><br />From the reviews, I knew to expect a mediocre movie in terms of plot, but I watched for the visuals. Not worth it. Although extensive, the CGI seemed quite mundane, but it may simply have been overwhelmed by the massive, unrelenting stupidity of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />And some of the key visuals contributed to the sense of \\"stupid, stupid, stupid\\". One of the strengths of the \\"Alien\\" movie was its claustrophobic feel and that it conveyed the impression of a real working freighter -- it was packed, cluttered, gritty, and suffering from wear-and-tear. In this movie, the inspiration for the ship's interior comes from mansions dressed for a photo shoot. The rooms are humongous and sparsely furnished, leaving vast open spaces. Even the oversized beds -- which seem intended to accommodate partying with multiple simultaneous guests -- don't make a dent in the floor space of the various living quarters.<br /><br />-- Douglas B. Moranliving quarters.<br /><br />-- Douglas B. Moran
B0068THAGY|4.0|Super 8 was a good movie.  Would recommend it as a movie to watch one night with a bowl of popcorn at home.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. Looking forward to the next installment. Plenty of action with characters that have plenty of personality and fleshed out. Interesting how the old greek and roman myths are woven together n a new updated version.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I love the show and don't have a TV so this is a wonderful alternative.  Alway there right away :)
1449410243|1.0|I don't get all the positive reviews for this book. It must be for The Oatmeal fans or something. I bought it based on the high ratings here (4.5 stars), but it feels like I'm not in on the joke. Read through the whole thing in about 8 minutes and didn't laugh once. I was expecting something like Simon's Cat, but the humor here is more juvenile (a cat farting is funny?), and the drawings aren't interesting either. There's not much talk of how a cat would be plotting to kill you either (the title), and instead goes off about how a cat would be a jerk if he worked at an office and how you would look if you switched roles with a cat. Just random nonsense.
B0018AT7DW|4.0|I never considered myself a fan of The Grateful Dead, but then again I never gave them a fair try. My hesitation was due to the extreme cultishness of their fan base and their standard &#34;hippy dippy&#34; poster and album artwork. The reason behind why I first chose to listen to this album is not important. What is important is that I can say I'm glad I downloaded this and gave it a fair shot.<br /><br />I was a little bit surprised after I finished listening. I didn't increase my pot intake, I didn't lose my job or drop out of school, and I am not filling my walls with black light posters of dancing bears and skulls. I do feel changed though. My mind is opened up. Maybe if American Beauty (expanded) didn't ruin my life, other classic cult-rock bands won't either. Then again, American Beauty just might be the gateway album that DARE warned us about as kids.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|If you like historical fiction, this book and &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; are books you must read. The story of WWI and WWII as told through the eyes of each faction involved was so imaginative and their lives well woven into the historical facts.<br /><br />Well done, Ken Follett.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I love this game, but it is great to be able to play it alone and on the go!  I still prefer the &#34;real&#34; game, but this is a great option!
B008MM9630|5.0|this app works great on my kindle. its fun and no need for Internet connection to play. the animals are really cute as well!
B008NMT684|5.0|My two year old is in LOVE with this app!  He can spend a good 15 minutes just playing it and he does really well with it.  Obviously, this misses the motor skills that a &#34;real&#34; puzzle gives (which we have as well), but this is a great game for on the go.  It is too easy for my 4 year old, but the 2 year old just adores it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|What can you say, I think playing Angry Birds is fun.  I play it all the time wherever I go.
1451695195|3.0|I found this book to be NOT as credible as the Newsweek interview (which i enjoyed hearing). I think Dr. Eben could have penned a more &#34;to-the-point&#34;, straightforward synopsis of his experience. I was a bit disappointed, as I found myself reading through this with a jaundiced eye. I don't doubt he was attempting to convey every personal nuance of his experience, but in so doing he comes off-- to me, anyway-- as someone fresh off an acid trip, eagerly trying to relate each and every profound revelation that he came to realize.<br />Don't get me wrong-- I do get the impression that he's credible. But I just think he could have done better by just relating the pure experiences (if that's possible, and I'm sure he would tell you it's not) and minimizing the discussions on science vs spirituality, etc. I know his intent is to validate the story, but in my opinion he goes WAY overboard with that stuff.<br />I took a star off for that.<br />Also, he kept skipping back and forth from his NDE to the &#34;meanwhile, back in the hospital room, my family was saying or doing this or that, etc..&#34; Excuse me- but I think the reader does not care about any of that stuff, either.<br />I took another star off for that.<br /> I know he's trying to lay out the COMPLETE story, but I just want a PURE discussion of the NDE... even if the length of the book were to be greatly reduced as a result.<br />Liked the book, but I can't give it 4 stars for the reasons above. So, I give it three.<br />One more thing-- I hope all of this is true. If it is, that's fascinating and I WANT to believe it.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I never purchased this game for my phone.  Don't know why it is showing up as I purchased it. I will have to research it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Wonderful. Susan Boyle has been my favorite and my idol ever since she first walked out on that stage in Englnd for an Idol competition.  I will buy anything she sings.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|With some minor alterations, this could have been an incredible movie. As it stands, it was a lot better than its box office revenue would lead you to believe. First, lets talk about the good. The premise is actually pretty interesting. Without giving too much away for those who haven't seen the movie, lets just say the movie raises questions about the origins of humanity without directly addressing that question itself. Some things are better left to the imagination.<br /><br />Also, the notion that a human would have super-strength on Mars is reasonable even while the creators take that idea to the extreme. But considering its a movie, I can accept the leap in imagination. The storyline itself deals with environmental change and energy problems, which is obviously relevant to most Americans, and integrates these issues seamlessly into a somewhat muddled central plot that involves a superficial character evolution from damaged self-absorbed adventurer to savior of a Martian princess.<br /><br />While I criticized the movie for being superficial, I must confess my main issue with this movie is superficial in the extreme. The movie is about saving a princess I really didn't care for. In the American classic, A Place in the Sun, male viewers will find themselves empathizing with the male lead because he falls in love with an Elizabeth Taylor at the height of her beauty while being trapped in a mediocre life with a mediocre wife. This princess inspires no such feelings, and while she's definitely attractive, she's not somebody I would risk my neck for.<br /><br />In the end, it's an entertaining movie that is only mildly thought-provoking.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Starts off slowly, but once you get past the first couple chapters you will get into it!  I find that in a trilogy it is important to read all of the books, so if you are trying to read them all just keep at it!

0307744434|3.0|I loved the concept of this book.  My real complaint was with the style of writing -- it wasn't descriptive enough (a lot of tell don't show) and as such I had trouble suspending belief and getting lost in the story.  I couldn't picture the circus the way you could, say, Narnia or Hogwarts.  It's a fast read and I enjoyed it I was just disappointed that it wasn't more magical given it's subject line.  I also completely didn't buy their undying love but that's a completely different issue!
0307272702|5.0|I've already read Good Calories, Bad Calories.  This book is the layman's version of it as many other reviewers have pointed out.  What I would like to add is that recently a slew of studies have come out in the cancer research world proving that cancerous cells can be killed by starving them of glucose.  Clinical trials have been done where patients are fed a no-carb 60 to 70% fat diet while receiving chemo/radiation to help maximize the effectiveness of these treatments.  Read these articles:[...]  and [...].  Furthermore, studies prove that starchy/high carb diets cause your cancer to return: [...].  It seems logical to conclude that if you eat a low-carb diet you would greatly decrease your chances of getting cancer -- although you do have to watch out for cancer causing no-calories sweetners and nitrates -- among other environmental elements.

0316228532|1.0|After reading 194 pages and still not &#34;into&#34; the book, I quit.  What a huge disappointment for me on Rowling, I expected so much more.  Maybe she should have taken Harper Lee's advice.  &#34;I'll put it this way. When you have hit the pinnacle, how would you feel about writing more? Would you feel like you're competing with yourself?&#34;
B00338QENI|4.0|a good read...kept me interested from beginning to end.  I think even my husband would enjoy this one (and he has ADD!)
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|It said that you get the special edition well I got the plan blue ray copy not happy about it at all
B000SFD21Q|5.0|who would have thought that I would be so enthralled with this book?  Really, I've told so many people about it and have recommended it to my friends. It's fascinating and will make you want to learn more;  and there are so many things that you can do immediately to make improvements to you life
B007QEHQY6|5.0|I have always enjoyed Holst's \\"the Planets\\" and some of his various compositions for brass band, but I was not familiar with his other works.  This collection brings together most of his works and is a wonderful way to become better acquainted with Holst.  The price I paid just makes the listening experience even more satisfying.
B005IQZB14|5.0|But I sure did!  I was afraid the book would be filled w/ hiking facts and theory, but there was so much more.  A very brave woman who finds herself along the trail.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|i love these characters.  though i wish a little more emphasis was put on Jane's experience with her cousins, Rochester is played magnificently by Toby Stephens.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and can't hardly wait for new episodes!  I don't know what I'm going to do when this season goes off.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The PianoGuys bring you songs which are, in my opinion, a perfect mix of classical music and popular tunes. The songs blend the two genres seemlessly and it is up to the listener to find out where the classic ends and the popular begins. Some songs will have you tapping your feet and smile. Others will simply sweep you of your feet as you dream away. That in itself, to me at least, makes it worth a listen.<br />But there's more. The PianoGuys show their creativity not only in how they arrange songs, but also in how they perform. They can create an entire song using only 1 piano and a variety of cello's (classic, electric and metal! cello's). Even percussion is often performed on the cello's and piano, instead of or together with conventional percussion. \\"Michael meets Mozart\\" and \\"What makes you beautiful\\" (watch the video on youtube!) are perfect examples of this.<br />The album also shows the Pianoguys collaborating with Alex Boyes, with great vocals, on the song \\"Peponi\\" and the Lyceum Philharmonic Orchestra on \\"Beethoven's 5 Secrets\\".<br />Lastly, I recommend watching their Youtube Channel. The video's, which are beautifully filmed and show amazing locations, complement the music perfectly. And it shows just how much the PianoGuys enjoy making music. That joy translates into their music. I can't help but smile when I see those video's.<br /><br />Who ever said classical music and instruments had to be boring? The PianoGuys will prove you wrong! Enjoy!
B006JD48NM|5.0|Senna was more than a man. He was the last of a group of race car drivers who raced in its purest sense. This movie tells the Formula One career of a driver in a way only Ayrton Senna could be attempted to be encapsulated: Through those that were there.<br /><br />Coming up through the ranks of a gokart racer, Senna made it quite clear that he set his sights for Formula One. He broke into a brotherhood that seemed to be weary of outsiders (those from outside of Europe). Senna called ranking officals out in public on their handlings of situations. One can only hope that Senna made Formula One a better sport because of his presence.<br /><br />He was a purist driver. He believed in racing like this because of his gokart background which he stated was about as racing as it could get. Gokarting had no politics, no electronics, nothing but pure racing. He pulled that approach into Formula One and stood out immediately. He showed the world how to race the most advanced cars in the rain. Because of his purist approach, he rubbed many people the wrong way.<br /><br />Sometimes Senna was conflicted. His legendary battles with one-time teammate and rival Alain Prost exposed a personality that perhaps Senna would regret. He dabbled in the affairs of European racers and struggled with impure approach to racing. His call for purity included the safety for drivers. He was the voice of drivers who seemingly were afraid to speak up to the directors of FIA. Senna was more than happy to express his displeasure.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that as Formula One was ushering in an electronic age, Senna would lose his life in a car provided by a team that began the new age. It was in the Williams at Imola (a weekend that in retrospect could have been warning the world) on lap six that Senna left the world. One can only feel a sense of loss watching the weekend at Imola as well as the on-board camera as we, the viewer, ride along with Ayrton on that fateful lap with Schumacher following on his wing.<br /><br />He raced at the end of an inspirational era. Race cars were no longer ground-breaking. They were only being corralled. Instead of innovation, cars were only being limited. As stated before, hopefully Senna's existance in FIA brought about some change. Formula One has not (to date) had a fatality since. One can only hope that it was Senna's sacrifice that prevented many other deaths in the spirit of motor sports. Whether you agree with motor sports or not, this film is a fantastic view into a man who only wanted the playing field to be fair in a time when it was the farthest from. To hear the constant comments from Brazilians who repeated, \\"He is the only good thing in our country\\" showed that Senna was more than a man, more than a driver, more than a three-time World Champion - he was a god dabbling among mere mortals.<br /><br />One interesting note about Senna's death: Under Italian law, any time a driver is pronounced dead on a race track, the race is to be stopped and a full investigation is to be conducted. With this in mind, the Italian authorities stated that Senna was pronounced dead during the helicopter flight to the hospital, thus circumnavigating the law. The interesting part about this is the doctor stated that Senna, \\"sighed...as if that was the moment his soul left his body.\\" It seems as if the doctor knew that Senna was dead at the scene. Even in death Senna earned very little respect from European directors in Formula One.

B007HACDLK|4.0|great book, though found the ending kinda wound itself up a bit fast. Have the feeling that Flynn was going to miss his deadline so just finished in a hurry. But still overall, very good read.

I bought this for my mother, as my grandmother had gotten her a Kindle, and she loves the intricacy of the design and sturdy material.

B008BM0IUG|4.0|Sean Carroll is clearly one of the giants in his ability to make comprehensible the incomprehensible world of particle physics.  In terms of cataloguing and explaining the fields, forces and matter (and their relationships) that make up reality, this is the ultimate work that I've read so far (at least for those of us not in the particle physics profession).  And importantly, we need to remember that this is an area of science in the process of very rapid evolution.  That brings us to one of the major themes of the book.  Carroll does an excellent job presenting the history and the ongoing research at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) including the critical search for the illusive Higg's Boson.  A word of caution: don't skip the appendices.<br /><br />I'd have to rate this an &#34;important read&#34; for anyone obsessed with understanding what existence is all about.  Not surprisingly it doesn't have the answer, but it does help explain the process and the path science is on to reach that goal.
0785163174|3.0|If the Authority's high-handed Jenny Sparks were still alive (and in the same universe and comic book company), even she may be advocating for Scott Summers to slow his roll. Past story arcs had built up Cyclops into an increasingly darker and more martial leader. And in AVENGERS VS. X-MEN he finally embraces his inner martinet. Not that he'd see it that way.<br /><br />Blame Scarlet Witch and her catastrophic hex. It all spools back to what she did in AVENGERS DISASSSEMBLED, her \\"No more mutants\\" mandate reducing the mutant population down to less than two hundred in rank. It forced Cyclops to make the tough decisions, even as his worldview evolved from idealistic to compromising to autocratic. And young and rebellious Hope Summers, touted as the mutants' messiah, promptly becomes the primary pawn in the epic tug of war between Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the uncanny Children of the Atom.<br /><br />When early warning systems alert Tony Stark of the Phoenix's approach, the Avengers make a beeline for the X-Men's island Utopia. Captain America intends to take Hope into protective custody, fearful that the Phoenix has targeted her for its next host. Cyclops fosters a different opinion. He believes that the ancient Phoenix entity will bring about salvation for mutanthood. He argues that lessons were learned from the Phoenix's possession of Jean Grey years ago and that the X-Men are now better equipped to deal with it. And Hope, after all, is the messiah, mutantkind's savior. So there's your story conflict.<br /><br />AvX pits hero against hero, pal against pal, and, in the case of T'Challa and Ororo, husband against wife. You get the predictable clashes (like Thing vs. Namor) but also some unexpected ones (Spidey vs. Colossus/Juggernaut, the Phoenix vs... an Iron Fist?). You don't think Iron Man has a chance against Magneto? Think twice. One of the better scraps happens when Wolverine goes up against a fellow Avenger. Meanwhile, the best part about Emma Frost's going toe to toe with Iron Man is the caption: \\"Organic diamond meets multi-billion dollar armor. The most expensive punch in history.\\" Somewhere, the supervillains are hunkering down, wanting no part of these, content to let the heroes pound on each other. They may even be giggling.<br /><br />I think the brain trust of Aaron/Bendis/Brubaker/Fraction/Hickman succeeds in inserting a compelling narrative beat here and there. Cap and Cyclops' warring agendas are clearly laid out. I like that I couldn't predict which side Wolverine would choose. I like Spider-Man's desperate last stand in issue #9, a fantastic sequence reminiscent in some ways of his kickass guest appearance way back in UNCANNY X-MEN #190-191. I like that there are long-term ramifications. I like that Captain America admits that he could've done more to support the X-Men (and mutants in general) in their times of need. AvX sets the stage for DC's New Fifty-Tw... er, Marvel NOW! And while I'm holding out on judgment, I will say that the debut issues of UNCANNY AVENGERS and ALL-NEW X-MEN are very promising.<br /><br />I was entertained, yeah, but there are issues. It's a mammoth volume, packed with one skirmish after another. And maybe that's the downfall. AVENGERS VS. X-MEN feels padded. The sheer number of battles eventually has a numbing effect. The plot twist with the Phoenix Five adds a shady element in that I simply cannot buy that a person imbued with the Phoenix force would have so much trouble taking out even the Avengers' heavy hitters. Even the Hulks should've been no match. Again, it sucks that the main series only gives you the broad strokes. There are so many side plots going on that you're forced to check out various other titles to really keep track. What does it say when my favorite bit about this whole thing turns out to be a faux, tongue-in-cheek segment in issue #6 of AVX: VERSUS in which Cyclops and Captain America trade in mutual verbal abuse:<br /><br />- Cyclops: \\"You're the most boring superhero on the planet Earth. And that includes Green Arrow.\\"<br />- Captain America: \\"I'M boring? I thought your mutant power was vanilla.\\"<br /><br />Also in this issue #6 of AVX: VERSUS: Squirrel Girl vs. Pixie and Toad vs. Jarvis.<br /><br />Oliver Copiel, Adam Kubert, and John Romita, Jr. handle the art chores.

B00004WPFX|2.0|I got this album twice, and both times the songs on both sides of the record skip and hop. It's too bad, because it sounds great in between skips. Someone else mentioned that their vinyl pressing was messed up as well. I'll have to return this one and hope they release one that works in the near future.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I heard about this movie from a friend but thinking it was the American version about the Civil War I decided to pass on watching it at the time. I am so glad I decided to go back and watch this gem of a movie. It's not only a great love story but also a wonderful tale about the struggles of the running of a cotton mill. I found the acting to be superb and I fell in love with Richard Armitage and his portrayal of Thornton. This movie is definitely worth watching more than once and is a must have for any DVD collection.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I like this book. I read this previous books in the series but this one is even better then the first 3. The story is very exciting and the book is well written. I can't wait to read the 5th book in the series

This guide is not just for Zombie Hunters like myself, it is for all types of hunters.  Thermonuclear War Survivalist, campers, and even tree huggers will find it useful too.  I can say that it has a no nonsense approach  in how to handle a plethora of scenarios.  The best of course is those dire situations when you say, \\"I picked the wrong day to quit smoking (being a Marine, the NRA, shooting range, hydroponics class, Karate class, alligator wrestling, etc.) or whatever you want to plug in.

B007R11DKQ|1.0|For some reason only a small portion of the movie downloaded.  Rather a disappointment.  Will have to try to get credit for this item.
B00004XPPE|5.0|A film that was overshadowed by the release of Dr. Strangelove yet still has a relevant message of accidental nuclear war. This DVD transfer is crisp and the widescreen format provides additional impact to the live theatre cinematic camera style. The supplemental material included in this DVD provides valuable historical and production information. Shot in an almost documentary style it was exciting for me to &#34;wind back the clock&#34; and see and hear the numerous superb actors that were part of this amazing film. Not just a superb film it captures the mood of the USA during the period of the early sixties. Every one should see this film
B000SEIBB8|5.0|Depending on on how you think of programming, this book could be incredibly insightful, or horribly abstract and impractical. Since I prefer and tend to think in patterns and abstractions, I found this book close to my heart. It uses a variety of languages for examples, so a willingness to explore concepts, not practical solutions, is essential.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I love the Mitch Rapp series of books and this one was as good as all the othersl  I love Vince Flynn.
0374275637|5.0|I read this book with a near-constant sense of fascination. Page after page revealed the most interesting information.<br /><br />And it wasn't just abstractly interesting, it has helped me in my profession--the ideas about taking the \\"outside view\\" over the \\"inside view\\" when making time estimates have been extremely helpful. I also have learned some useful techniques for when I am trying to obtain buy-in for my ideas within organizations: due to the fact that people feel about twice as strongly the desire to avoid loss as the desire to realize potential gain, if I position my ideas so that going against them represents loss, I have increased my persuasive effectiveness.<br /><br />If you are someone who lives in the world of ideas, then: You. Want. This. Book.

1603427244|5.0|I've been knitting over 50 years and yet I still learned a tremendous amount from this book. The cast-on and bind-off methods shown here are amazing and the author does an excellent job at explaining them. I also really appreciate the reference lists she has included inside the front and back covers to help you quickly determine which cast-on or bind-off methods are best for your projects.<br /><br />This book will never, ever leave my library. Even though it has an honored spot on my bookshelf next to my favorite stitch dictionaries, it sits on the table right next to my knitting chair so I can always have it as an immediate reference!
0316069434|3.0|Good, although not one of the very best such as Angels Flight or Echo Park. Strongest element as usual is a plot line with a nifty surprise ending. But Bosch has become a formula character--the angst, the love of jazz, the resistence to authority--and the book's depiction of its LA setting is one note as well. Is Connelly getting bored with his creation? No doubt this is the fate of all such successful, long running mystery series.<br /><br />The daughter Maddie is a new element, but she seems like such a well-adjusted, daddy worshipping character that it's hard to take her seriously as a teenager whose mother died under horrific circumstances. Reminds me of the Travis McGee novels where in late middle age the protagonist finds out he has a delightful teenage daughter whose mother is conveniently dead.<br /><br />As an LA resident, its fun to see what Connelly does with the LAPD, particularly its police chiefs. Both the much admired previous chief Bill Bratton and the current chief Charlie Beck seem drawn directly to life.

0062082353|5.0|Joshua Vernon<br />Mrs. Jones<br />Humanities<br />11/15/12<br />  Book Review for American Sniper<br /> American Sniper is one of the best books I have ever read due to its blunt honesty about the life of a soldier and its way of showing the true American spirit. Chris Kyle is an American legend with more confirmed sniper kills than anyone else in American history. He joined the Iraqi war shortly after 9/11 as a US Navy SEAL assigned to Team 3. Navy SEAL team 3 is a very experienced team that had been to Afghanistan on multiple occasions. This is the main reason why Chris wanted to join this esteemed team. Not long after their training began, Chris and the rest of the team was shipped to the Middle East to assist in the ongoing war against terror. Most of the team was familiar with the surroundings because of previous deployments but for Chris this was a completely new experience. Over the next few years, Chris learns the importance of teamwork, trust, and being humble. When Chris is asked about his military career, Chris states \\"My regrets are about the people I couldn't save, Marines, soldiers, my buddies. I still feel their loss. I still ache for my failure to protect them.\\"Pg. 397. Chris is like this because he doesn't see himself as an amazing person. He simply sees himself as an American who fought for his country and his family. This book describes the life of the great American soldier Chris Kyle and his life in the Navy Seals.<br /> This is an important book to anyone who wants to learn about a man's journey and how he overcomes challenges and obstacles on a daily basis. One of the most important messages that I received from this book is no matter what happens, do not give up ever. There are times and situations of hardships but in everyone's life one shouldn't give up no matter what. Chris puts a lot of emphases on his family and country showing readers these are very important and should be treasured. One of my favorite things about this book is his honesty to the American people.  There is a lot about war that most people don't want to talk about but Chris wanted people to understand on a level that most people didn't understand. He tells the reader about both his family problems with his wife and kids and his wartime problems throughout his military career. In conclusion, Chris Kyle is a true American hero who communicates to the reader that war is a stressful and challenging issue for a family and for an individual person to handle. This book is amazing book and should receive 5 out of 5 stars in any review. Another great book that shows the troubles and life of a Navy SEAL is Lone Survivor. This is a must read for anyone who loves action with a touch of family values and a man's love for God and country.

B000088SYA|5.0|I thought back in '82 when this came out that Men at Work were pretty cool. And I still do, well the exception being this one album. Disappointing that nothing could compare to this and that the group went south afterwards. Anyway, this one is great so-- ENJOY!
0920668372|5.0|An inexpensive book that helps children see/hear that you will love them forever, no matter what mischief they get into.  My son began saying the phrases with me when he was old enough.  I love this book.
B000002G23|5.0|I like this box set quite a bit but I have to admit that even for a super-group of the late 70's to early 80's they did have some songs that they could have tossed out. Now I know this is the complete recordings of the Police so every track they released had to be included to make even the diehard fans happy, YET...I would of tossed out a few as I said before(no one would miss 'em) that werent too radio friendly and kind of sounded like garbage....yes i hate to say this about them but these are mainly early recordings in their career so they dont count. In any event, if you really like the Police...I'd get this 4 disc package. Its worth it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has a lot of fun games. The game has a bunch of different varieties that make the app fun. If your looking for a app that has more than one purpose you should get this app.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I'm a big fan of Mitch Rapp and looked forward to this book's release.  It is a fast-paced page turner like the others in the Rapp series but it was a bit translucent.  It was easy to figure out the Rickman involvement very early on even though the author tried to hide it by making it so blatantly obvious with the shooting in the back of the upstairs body guard and the fact that the safe was not broken into, yet it was empty.  I found myself thinking, \\"No, it can't be.  It's way too obvious,\\" for about ten pages and then realized that it definately was indeed the case.  Nothing, throughut the book, assuaged me off of that conclusion though I hoped to the end that there would be a \\"gotcha\\" moment to prove me wrong.  That was a bit disappointing.<br /><br />But it was still a good read with a lot of shoot-em-up and intrigue.  I look forward to the next one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|LOVE IT. BIG SCREEN who needs anything else?!  Can't get over such a great ap for free!!! Use it on the job all the time..
B005LLX582|5.0|The flow of past & present stories isn't so smooth, but the sheer filming mastery, the artwork, in how the unusual, pre-logos perception of a child, is captured on film, has changed me. When I'm impatient with my kids, I remember moments from this movie, and I get out of my rush & bustle to slow down and enjoy their way of experiencing the world. This is a visual masterpiece.
B005P06AAO|5.0|You always get to see the cliche teen show depicted, of course, with cliche teenagers. But what about the inbetween kids? The floaters? The ones who don't fit in anywhere?<br />The ones who are awkward.<br /><br />This is actually a shockingly accurate representation of how my friends and I acted in high school. We made up dumb words, cursed a lot, constantly had sex on the brain, and ran around like the glorious weirdos that we still are.<br /><br />A quick rundown for newcomers: Jenna, the main focus of this show, creates an overnight rumor mill when a simple accident that makes it look like she's attempted suicide pushes her formerly wallflower self into the spotlight. While she does deal with things all teeangers trudge through (mean girls, gossip, and parental embarrassment), on top of it all she's harboring a serious crush on Matty McKibben, your everyday loveable boy next door jock, who Jenna also happened to lose her virginity to over the summer in a very, very awkward situation. Matty wants to keep their hookups under the radar, while Jenna, who goes along for the sake of closeness, is internally screaming for more. How can one teenage brain handle all this craziness at once?<br /><br />When this show started, a little part of me was going, \\"Alright, c'mon. You've been out of high school for nearly three years, do you really need to be watching some show about a bunch of teeangers having sex and creating drama? Go put on some CNN and listen to The Shins, you twentysomething.\\" But my need for laughs pushed out that opinion, and so I started to watch, and became quickly addicted as I saw my high school self on the screen.<br /><br />Jenna is instantly likeable, and the character I most relate to my teeange self. Her choice of clothing isn't straight off the runway, she has a tendency to deadpan, and is more comfortable expressing her feelings in a blog rather than with her voice. Ashley Rickards is the absolute perfect choice for this role, she looks like a girl you plucked straight up from a lunch table full of weird alternative kids and hipsters.<br /><br />Tamara and Ming, her two partners in crime, are ridiculously accurate representations of those two friends the Queen of Weird always has in school. The hyperactive one who's constantly in a reality of her own making (Tamara) and the one who, despite her own weirdness, keeps up on her grades and is generally the voice of sensible reason (Ming). I haven't seen either of these girls acting in anything else, but I don't think I'll ever see them as anything but Jenna's wonderfully dorky best friends.<br /><br />Matty and Jake, the objects of Jenna's affections, are a breath of fresh air as, rather than the \\"heroine\\" having to choose between the jock and the nerd, she has to choose between two nerdy jocks. Every character on the show was a tinge of awkwardness in them, and these two are no exception. Matty is internally struggling with his feelings for Jenna and how to express them properly, and Jake is so goofy and charming it's hard not to smile when he's onscreen. Both actors (Brett Davern and Beau Mirchoff) are definitely swoon worthy, and you can think what you want of me, the constant eye candy was totally a factor in my initial intrest in the show.<br /><br />Sadie...oh, what not to say about Sadie? Never before have I found a mean girl to make me laugh so much since Regina George! Sadie's attitude is more comedic than cruel to the viewer, and I have now found that I am incapable of saying, \\"You're welcome\\" in a normal voice. Yet another interesting twist is that, instead of a tall, willowy Victoria's Secret model as the mean girl, Sadie is brunette, more of a pretty girl next door than a runway model, and curvy. Her main reason for her attitude is, rather than power or popular right or what have you, that she is angry for having been cursed with a \\"fat gene.\\" This is another reason I find her likeable. Whether at the bottom or top of the high school food chain, every single girl has, at some point in her life, had body issues, and it's interesting to see the villain of the show have such a weakness.<br /><br />A nice little bonus is that when the episodes initially aired on tv, little \\"after show\\" bits would go up on the MTV site. These were either V-Time with Val, Morning Announcements, or Sadie's Anger Mangement. The MTV site, for me, loads very slowly, so I usually don't bother. Luckily, all of these are featured as bonus content on the dvd release!<br /><br />This is definitely a unique attempt at a teen comedy, and a very successful one at that! Season two got even better, and I'm very excited to see season three next year.very single girl has, at some point in her life, had body issues, and it's interesting to see the villain of the show have such a weakness.<br /><br />A nice little bonus is that when the episodes initially aired on tv, little \\"after show\\" bits would go up on the MTV site.

B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Being 19, I had always hear my parents talk about the original 21 Jump Street. I knew the basic plot about how there were young cops. I thought the overall plot was well written, and funny. I don't think that the original generation would like this new movie, but I could be wrong. There is a decent amount of profanity, and I would not watch this with young children. Overall, I'm glad to have added it to my collection.

B000PC0U1W|5.0|I'm not sure why I like this movie so much. The story takes place in England, as now the most powerful county in the world. A masked hero/villain who has a history with the main characters attempts to overthrow this new communistic government. There were many famous actors in this movie. It has to be watched more than once to fully understand everything that is said, and so that you can connect everything together. If you don't, you will miss a few things that help make the movie what it is. Happy to have added this to my collection.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is a great presentation.  I have seen the actual stage show and was captivated by the acting & music score.

A must for Les Miserables lovers!!

B0015AARJI|3.0|I'm writing on behalf of my wife... Even my brother had the same problem as I.<br /><br />My wife bought me a PS3 controller, like this one on Amazon last year for Christmas.  Now, everything was up to par, except for the dual-analog sticks.  For some reason, there was much resistance in the movement of these sticks.  VERY FRUSTRATING TO GAME WITH.  I tried the controller out anyway on a FPS and what a mess that was.  It was incredibly hard to aim and manuever around. I guess the biggest red flag was the packaging that the controller came in was bogus looking.  The inside of the plastic packaging was cloudy and looked like it had been through some tough times.<br /><br />What I'm trying to get at is just keep an eye out!<br /><br />Unfortunately, my wife threw away the receipt and was unable to get a return.

B007HACDLK|2.0|In a word, disappointing, the book is just not up to normal Vince Flynn Standards. When you have to resort to amnesia and personality changes in the lead character in order to tell a new story, then it is time for a new character.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Prior to The Last Man, I have been a big fan of Vince Flynn. Mitch Rapp is one of all time favorite characters in the genre, but this book is not about Mitch. It is about someone who use to be Mitch & who perhaps may become him again. I'll probably buy the next installment, in hopes that this is a one time lapse in judgement by Flynn, but seriously, if this is the course that he wishes to take, then it may be time for Mitch to retire and for the next generation to take over.

B007V65R54|5.0|Statisticians rarely become superstars, but Nate Silver is getting close. This is the guy who writes the FiveThirtyEight.com blog for the New York Times and has correctly predicted the outcome of the last two presidential elections in virtually every one of the 50 states. But Silver is no political maven weaned on election trivia at his parents' dinner table: he earned his stripes as a prognosticator supporting himself on Internet poker and going Billy Beane of the Oakland A's (Moneyball) one better by developing an even more sophisticated statistical analysis of what it takes to win major league baseball games. And, by the way: Silver is just 34 years old as I write this post.<br /><br />The Signal and the Noise is Silver's first book, and what a book it is! As you might expect from this gifted enfant terrible, the book is as ambitious as it is digestible. Written in an easy, conversational style, The Signal and the Noise explores the ins and outs of predicting outcomes not just in politics, poker, and sports (baseball and basketball) as well as the stock market, the economy, and the 2008 financial meltdown, weather forecasting, earthquakes, epidemic disease, chess, climate change, and terrorism.<br /><br />Fundamentally, The Signal and the Noise is about the information glut we're all drowning in now and how an educated person can make a little more sense out of it. As Silver notes, \\"The instinctual shortcut we take when we have `too much information' is to engage with it selectively, picking out the parts we like and ignoring the remainder, making allies with those who have made the same choices and enemies of the rest.\\" What else could explain why Mitt Romney was \\"shell-shocked\\" and Karl Rove was astonished by Romney's loss in a presidential election that every dispassionate observer knew was going Obama's way?<br /><br />Silver asserts that \\"our predictions may be more prone to failure in the era of Big Data. As there is an exponential increase in the amount of available information, there is likewise an exponential increase in the number of hypotheses to investigate . . . But the number of meaningful relationships in the data . . . is orders of magnitude smaller. Nor is it likely to be increasing at nearly so fast a rate as the information itself; there isn't any more truth in the world than there was before the Internet or the printing press. Most of the data is just noise, as most of the universe is filled with empty space.\\"<br /><br />Sadly, it's not just in politics that bias clouds judgment and leads to erroneous conclusions. \\"In 2005, an Athens-raised medical researcher named John P. Ioannidis published a controversial paper titled `Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.' The paper studied positive findings documented in peer-reviewed journals: descriptions of successful predictions of medical hypotheses carried out in laboratory experiments. It concluded that most of these findings were likely to fail when applied in the real world. Bayer Laboratories recently confirmed Ioannidis's hypothesis. They could not replicate about two-thirds of the positive findings claimed in medical journals when they attempted the experiments themselves.\\"<br /><br />In general, Silver's thesis runs, \\"We need to stop, and admit it: we have a prediction problem. We love to predict things -- and we aren't very good at it. . . We focus on those signals that tell a story about the world as we would like it to be, not how it really is. We ignore the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they pose the greatest threats to our well-being. We make approximations and assumptions about the world that are much cruder than we realize. We abhor uncertainty, even when it is an irreducible part of the problem we are trying to solve.\\"<br /><br />There's more: Silver relates the work of a UC Berkeley psychology and political science professor named Philip Tetlock, who categorizes experts as either foxes or hedgehogs (in deference to an ancient Greek poet who wrote, \\"The fox knows many little things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\\"). Hedgehogs traffic in Big Ideas and often hew to ideologies; these are the people who talk to the press and are frequently found on TV talk shows. Foxes are cautious types who carefully examine and weigh details before reaching conclusions. Not surprisingly, Tetlock found that \\"The more interviews that an expert had done with the press . . . the worse his predictions tended to be.\\"<br /><br />In other words, Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the people who supposedly know what they're talking about often really don't, how can the rest of us figure out what's going on?ncient Greek poet who wrote, \\"The fox knows many little things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\\").

B008Z9YGEE|2.0|I never read the books but I heard about the movie and was eager to see it based on what I heard.<br />Maybe you're weren't meant to feel when you watched this movie, maybe you needed to be a teenager who read the books or maybe there just wasn't enough 'anything' to get a handle on. I never believed her relationship with her co-runner, it was never really properly developed or believable. Yes, I know they were running for their lives but even with; personal view here nope didn't believe they cared for each other.<br />Best part about the movie, her relationship with the younger girl, the two of them against the rest, that was believable,made me care; I would have rather watched an entire movie just with them.  I understand all the other dribble was quasi necessary to the plot but for me it was jut fill.<br /> I generally don't watch action movies so I'm sort of oblivious to most of it other than the occasional, \\"oh that was cool!\\" scene but even with I believe we watch to care or even share what we view. Maybe I'm just too old!<br />  That Japanese movie someone mentioned; \\"Battle Royal\\",  that was good, that was SHOCKING, SUPRISING, and believe it or not, you gave a damn...you wanted the bad guys to get it and you felt bad when other characters got knocked out. This movie, (\\"Hunger Games\\") made its money and it'll continue to make it with or without my personal feelings about it.<br />  I'd check out \\"Battle Royal\\" if you enjoy movies but if you're a person that mainly watched Hunger Games for the eye candy or cause you read the books... I  leave it up to you.<br /> I personally can't wait to see ,  \\"The Odd Life of Timothy Green\\"  and  \\"Paranormon\\"  so go figure!  Good Day.

1476715904|3.0|Cover wise, I like the simplistic stage. It's almost as if I'm waiting for the cute Will Cooper to go up there and sprout out some awesomeness. Patiently, I'm waiting.................<br /><br />While I love the cover, the book and I didn't really connect. I think this comes from me being in a Paranormal/Fantasy kick. For some reason just old plain vanilla YA and I aren't meshing well. SO I blaming the score completely on me.<br /><br />So why the connection failure? For some reason, I found the relationship with Will unbelievable. I don't find insta love easy to swallow unless delivered right (like soul mate crap or something) and so the quick attraction between Will and Layken somewhat left me with a eyebrow notched deep into my hairline. As for the \\"mature\\" way of handling Will's mature reaction to their predicament....pft! I just can't see it. Layken acted like a child with her stomping off and such. Over dramatic much?<br /><br />While me and Slammed didn't enjoy our brief interlude of reading, I will give props to the writer for the AMAZING Slam Poetry. OMG, those few lines were all Epic and for that alone I'm extremely impressed. Especially by the ending, very swoon worthy!<br /><br />Overall, I think my review should be taken with as one of those tomato/toomato things. I might say one color is blue and another might say it's gray. I think the same can be applied with this book, while I didn't gush and thrill over it like everyone else, that's not to say it isn't a good book.

0802798225|4.0|For a cover with models, I like the no bells and whistles here. Just a couple caught in the middle of a loving moment. Considering the plot is about romance, this cover is spot on and for that I likey.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I found this bok a pretty decent read. It focuses on romance but also on bridging the race gap and even highlights prejudices and stereotypes. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the last two. And though, I don't find dating discrimination to be quiet as clean cut as the book depicts, I'm happy that the author attempted to GO THERE.<br /><br />As for the writing, it seemed slightly sluggish to me. I just kept feeling as if I was waiting for something BIG to happen. Nothing really did. Yeah, the drug deals and the friend getting shot can be considered action but for some reason I never connected with it. I might as have well as been reading that the weather forecast was going to in the low 60's for as much reaction Elkeles eked from me.<br /><br />Still, Elkeles did a wonderful job growing the romance and creating character's with hidden depths. I think it was those aspects that really saved this book for me. Even though I was slightly bored, I kept reading because I WANTED to see the two MC's pull it off.....that happy ending. So for the, props go out to the author. She managed to hook her claws into my interest and though she didn't have it completely, she did manage to hold it. So because of that, I give Perfect Chemistry four stars.<br /><br />Overall, the book was good. I found it low on action and slow on pace but all the other aspects needed for a good book were there and working correctly..which is what a book should do. I think perhaps I'm spoiled and just expect a little (or big) sucker punch of wow and a dash of excitement in my books.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I've been in love with Batman since the animated series came out in the 1990's on the old Cartoon Network.<br /><br />I was 14 when this movie came out in theaters and I had to see it. (Saw it twice actually) Then I knew I had to get the DVD for Christmas immediately. So yes, I've watch this movie waaaaay too many times where I know the Joker's lines by heart and some of Alfred, Bruce and Harvey's. This movie to me is amazing beyond words or entertaining at its best. Now this movie is NOT suitable for you to watch it along with your five year old nephew. If the rating of the movie didn't give you a sign then I'll tell you teenagers and older can watch this.<br /><br />Why I love this movie so much? Because it has everything that reminds me of the animated series except it's more realistic, mature and darker. I'm not saying this is like the Texas Chain Massacre; I meant there are explosions, people die, but you don't literally see it. The camera moves in a different angle or goes to another scene.<br /><br />Heath Ledger who plays the Joker did such an amazing job that I was angry that the movie ended and I wanted him to be in the finale so bad.<br /><br />If you don't know the Joker-he's a villian duh; lunatic at heart, unpredictable, charismatic (in his own sick twisted way) and that's why I love him so much. Heath took that role to a whole new different level that I have never seen an actor do before. He wasn't acting as the Joker, he became the Joker. He even won an Academy Award for Pete's sake.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I've used Sony headphones before and they have always been excellent -- even the less expensive ones. These headphones were no exception: lightweight and fine sound.  I use them with my PC for listing to videos and such, and they do an excellent job.  The other, absolutely fantastic thing about the product is that Sony packaged the headphones so you could open the package without difficulty, something most manufacturers have yet to learn.  Sony used a clear plastic front and a cardboard back; so you could open the package without a knife or scissors.  Way to go Sony!

1401224792|4.0|This is a book for people who have been reading Fables. It makes allusions and references to the ongoing comic series and ends in such a way as to allow the new locations and characters to be revisited in the ongoing. If you have no familiarity with the setting I would recommend a different starting point, such as [[ASIN:140122427X Fables: The Deluxe Edition Book One]] or [[ASIN:1401203698 Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall]]. That said, you will still be able to follow the plot and enjoy the story if you haven't read Fables before, but won't get everything out of it that is offered.<br /><br />I have been reading, and loving, the series for all of its more than 120 issues. I've followed the exploits of spin-off series, mini-series, and novels. I'm seriously considering attending a get-together in Rochester, MN, in Spring 2013 being put on by the author and several of his friends who write and illustrate similar comics.<br /><br />I really liked this story. I will avoid spoilers in my review. Bigby Wolf, the big, bad wolf of story tales, is the protagonist. He is an immortal demi-god, son of the North Wind. The book opens with Bigby exploring the American Midwest. The author uses the trope of Bigby writing a journal/status report to back home in order to give the reader background on the Fables setting. This trope is used throughout the book to fill in narrative and give us insight into Bigby's thoughts. We flash back to him killing Nazis behind the front-lines of WWII (also seen in issues #28 and #29 of the original series, almost 100 issues and eight years ago). And then the rest of the story deals with him in the present day as he is surprised to discover in Iowa a legacy of that Nazi-slaying he thought he had left in Germany. After the somewhat slow prelude the story really takes off. I took a couple nights to get through the first couple chapters. But then I finished the rest all in one sitting, not wanting to put it down. I look forward to the introduced characters and the town of Story City popping up in and the results of this encounter affecting the main continuity of the Fables series.<br /><br />The writing is pretty good. If you read Fables you'll get what you expect from the author. If anything he compresses the narrative more than usual by use of the journal writing trope and more abrupt scene and time changes. I appreciated this. I think he has a tendency to go on too much in the main series. I wouldn't have wanted this story to be any longer. The two main antagonists go through a change in characterization between time periods that I don't think was well handled. I don't want to spoil anything. But I'll say they act one way in the beginning of the book, but when we encounter them later they are not nearly as well defined. And I don't think the way Bigby reacts to them later makes sense or is well-explained given his attitude towards them earlier.<br /><br />In the ongoing series, this story would have taken seven or eight issues to tell, at least. And it would have had to be significantly altered in its depiction to be printed even in Vertigo, the HBO of comics. I like that I was able to get the entire story all at once without waiting for its serialization. And while I really enjoyed this story, I'm glad it didn't push out the current main narrative of the series. I hope the author continues to do this. I wouldn't mind an annual or even bi-annual hard-cover original graphic novel that explores the (almost too many) characters and settings of the Fables universe.<br /><br />The illustrations are mostly good if inconsistent. A spare style and flat coloring is used that I like. I'd almost call it old-school but absolutely call it refreshing compared to the hyper-detailed tracing and over-saturated and gradient-ed stuff that fills most super-hero comics on the comic-store shelves. It is very different from the style used by Mark Buckingham, Steve Leialoha, or Shawn McManus in the main series and as such it doesn't \\"feel\\" as \\"Fables-y\\" until you get into the story. There are splash illustrations are very good to excellent (and exceptionally graphic). Unfortunately, one artist does not handle penciling and inking of the entire book. Instead four different people have credits which really hurts the consistency of the illustrations. That combined with the generally flat coloring and very similar Aryan-like appearance of most of the secondary characters hurts their characterization and makes the book confusing to read at times. I find it baffling that more than one person was required to illustrate this book. There's really no excuse for it: this is a book, not a monthly series with its tight page-a-day deadlines. Not taking the time it needed really hurts the final product.<br /><br />The physical artifact is excellent. It is a substantial-feeling hard cover with nice dust jacket. The cover fully reproduces the dust jacket art. The binding is glued but is very tight. The paper is thick and semi-glossy. The ink is dark, sticks to the page and not your fingers, and looks good. You'll enjoy holding, reading, and displaying this book and it stands up well to its cover price.<br /><br />This is a book for adults, or near adults. There are extremely graphic depictions of nudity, violence, and sex. Genetic purity, human experimentation, the creation of an incestuous \\"master race\\", murder, suicide, and infanticide are depicted or implied. As depicted, this couldn't be filmed and shown on even premium cable channels like HBO without major editing or censoring. A movie version would be rated at least NC-17. And it would't be printed as-is in the monthly Vertigo-(the HBO of comics)-published series. I'm pretty liberal but wouldn't let my children see this book until they were in late high school.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good if not great addition to the Fables canon. I enjoyed it, and recommend it.<br /><br />(A note on my star rating. I use a four-star review method: one star means I hated it, two means I didn't like it, four means I liked it, and five means I loved it. What does three mean? Exactly.)

I used the free version for awhile and liked it well enough that I upgraded to the Pro version to support the developer and get rid of ads.

0545265355|4.0|'The Hunger Games', 'Catching Fire', and 'Mocking Jay' total 1,163 pages combined; however, Suzanne Collins' fluid and intriguing writing style makes it an easy, enjoyable read.<br />This  trilogy describing a dismal and often horrifying alternative future is obviously aimed primarily at young adult readers, yet  provides just enough sophistication and complexity throughout the story to attract readers of all ages.<br />It is narrated in the first-person through the eyes of the main character, Katniss Everdeen , a sixteen year old girl who posesses the wisdom and maturity of someone twice that age due to the harsh and brutal lifestyle imposed upon the citizens of her post-apocalyptic world by those in positions of authority.<br />The non-stop action, fluid plot development, and a realistic quality that concientiously avoids soap-opera, feel-good quick fixes help make a highly unlikely scenario gradually appear quite plausible.

B00003CXA6|3.0|Even though fictional personal conversations and interactions between characters are included for dramatic effect, this 1993 film from Turner Pictures,  based upon Michael Shaara's novel, 'The Killer Angels', remains one of the most historically accurate and detailed depictions of the most famous battle fought during America's Civil War.<br /><br />Rather long (4 hours 23 minutes), it may prove a bit tedious for the casual viewer.  However, for someone who has studied the Civil War or is merely curious as to  why these three days of fighting are considered by most historians to have been the turning point in the war,  it will prove time well spent.<br /><br />The main characters are portrayed by seasoned, popular actors: Martin Sheen (Lee), Tom Berringer (Longstreet), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain), just to name a few.<br /><br />This movie deals as much with the human element (courage, fear, frustration, heartbreak, etc.) as it does with the actual fighting and tactical maneuvers that made Gettysburg the ultimate example of the nightmare we call war.

B003VANOFY|1.0|My initial thought was: \\"wow Logitech Gaming Wireless Headset!\\"<br />But now, this product makes me mad more than anything.<br /><br />First problem (resolved after receiving a replacement):<br />The headset failed to recharge, but I contacted the Logitech and was able to get a new one.<br /><br />Second problem (Major problem that's happening to almost everyone who own this product):<br />Constant disconnection/re-connection. It's not even funny. It started out with once in an hour....then once in a min...now it's once every 10 seconds.<br />I'm completely serious and not exaggerating.<br /><br />I searched Logitech customer service forum for this problem, and TONS of people were having same problem.<br />Currently none of Logitech's solution is helping. I think I'll buy a wired headphone later on.<br /><br />But...sound quality is pretty good, it's comfortable and light.<br /><br />Only if the disconnecting problem was gone, this product would've been fantastic and worth money.<br /><br />If you are planning to buy this product right now... Don't....I'm telling you....Please don't. I made a mistake to not reading reviews and this is what I get.
0547564651|4.0|Paul Tough bases his thesis-that character traits are molded in the environment in which children grow up. We as adults can intervene with these children and their environments to produce more favorable results. Truly though, it is their grit that helps them continue on in their quest. It just took 196 pages to get there.<br /><br />Tough's research is impeccable. It seems he has read every book I have. Looked at research I never even heard of and interviewed people across the country from all stages of life. I have since seen Justice, one of his interviewees, on 60 Minutes.<br /><br />The book was fabulous and informative, but dry in its writing. It had a tendency to put you to sleep, but well worth every penny.

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I was ready to enjoy this book on the recommendation of friends and enjoy it I did. I will not say that it is expertly written, but I will say that it is an homage of a walk through 80s pop culture (television, movies, early video games and D&D all play starring roles). The story is designed a bit like a video game set to multiplayer with quests and levels. It isn't high art, but it is worth reading.

Some are more modern (CGI), others are pretty classic, and others are a little \\"out there\\" (\\"trippy\\", even).<br />If you're a Matrix fan, you'll enjoy seeing some side-plots for the popular franchise. You'll see plots before The Matrix Reloaded (\\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\"), plots related to weird phenomena in the Matrix, and plots related to characters dealing with fake world/real world issues.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch!

B001QOGYFY|4.0|You know it's not Gone With The Wind.  That being said, it's a solid albeit slightly predictable thriller that is actually a good bit of fun.

I was surprised that I really like almost every track on the album, that doesn't usually happen (the only other album I can think of recently that I also enjoyed this much was &#34;My Head is a Animal&#34; by &#34;Of Monsters and Men&#34;.) In any case, I am very happy with the purchase and am hoping for another album of equal or better quality from them in the future.

B005LAJ16I|4.0|First scene of the first episode almost ruins the entire series.  Baghdad is completely flat folks.  Felt they could have at least attempted to get the landscape right.  Moving past that, it is a descent series.  There are a lot of plausability issues with it, but it's just mindless entertainment for an hour a week anyway.

1451695195|3.0|Dr. ALexander is a wonderful writer.  His detail of the duration of his  coma,  the effect on his brain was very interesting and intense.  However I was looking for more detail on his time \\"in Heaven\\". The lack of detail was frustrating to such an extent that I did not even bother to read the book to the end. He wrote in detail about the feeling of the coma while he was under.  Some parts of the experience  He claims was \\"the other side\\" but not enough to make the reader convinced that there possibly is \\"the Heaven\\".  The butterflies, the humming sounds, the flying things,the woman, the feeling of unconditional love. This was all in his ill brain from life.  Now his brain was in a coma.  His brain was overpowered with puss.  Therefore his feelings and thoughts were NIL.  His Drs. did a wonderful job in bringing him back.  If he was not a Dr. himself, they probably would let him go.  What I found extremely interesting in this book was his account of the entire time he was in the coma. 7 days is not as long as others have been longer.  Medically induced comas last a week, even more sometimes.  He woke up from the coma after 7 days.  He writes in detail about the ease of regaining his  brain power and logic, etc.  His loving family and friends were with him all the way.<br />This was the love he was feeling.  Comatose people are half way here and half way there. The love he was feeling was the love his wife and sons gave him during the duration of the coma.  He heard their words of love and comfort. And because he was in this deep coma he translated those feelings and sounds to \\"the other side\\".  I feel that scientifically all he describes in his book is probably accepted by other professionals as normal lack of brain function.  The 'Heaven\\" part is not quite there.  I left the book in the laundromat for others to read.<br />I read most of it, it but would I recommend it, I think not.<br /> As I said not enough detail on the \\"Heaven\\" part, its all about his life beforeand after like a good biography.  Heaven is still a mystery, if it does exist?  We shall find out when we die.  Once we die our \\"energy\\" leaves our body, and goes to another dimension for sure? or does it?, but where is a question none of us can answer or predict.  I feel that all the books on the after life that are on the market are \\"dreamer\\" rip offs. Good money makers because what is after we die???? is a question we would love to have answers to.  We turn to dust and then what is there an after life, is there reincarnation? do we see ghosts, do ghosts exist, what are these theories all about?  Who knows.  IF THERE'S LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS, WHAT DO WE SAY ABOUT AFTER LIFE AND HEAVEN THEN?  Dr. Alexander belongs to a church, and his faith rules him.  Just like all of us those who have somekind of faith.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game is a Sci-fi novel written in 1985 that is the full interpretation of a short story that was written in 1977(The year Sci-Fi went mainstream \\"a la\\" the release of Star Wars). I read this book at the age of 18 during my senior year of high school when I had nothing but contempt for the required books I was assigned. I loved it then and I still love it now at the age of 22 with college under my belt and more sci-fi experience.<br />I am outwardly amazed by the \\"Battle Room\\" because I am a video game type of guy. The thought that genius kids had to play video games against each other to \\"train\\" their minds rather than viewing video games as mindless entertainment like how the 80's believed that video games were a fad is 5 star to me. A lead character that has committed terrible, great, and awe-inspiring things but still has room for redemption (Ending of the book) is 5 star to me. Ender is 50/50 a person that was: forced to do terrible things (\\"forced conscription\\" into the military) and a person that volunteered to carry them out without much question that is a topic I like to see in story books because of the interesting parallels in society.<br /> I read this book with how I think people would have acted back in the late 70's to early 80's. I like to think, maybe people in that time have no \\"sense\\" of trolling and thought that the Internet at some point in time could be used as a social tool to promote one's self to the statue of a political genius anonymously and gain influence and follows no matter what the person behind the keyboard looked like. That is 5 star to me. Yes this book does ruin childhood innocence in the main characters so if that is not your thing then skip it. Yes it is far-fetched that a kid could command a huge war fleet like a video game and wipe out an alien race. Yes it is far-fetched that two child prodigies could use the Internet for a constructive cause besides trolling and being on Facebook. The whole Science Fiction genre in general is far-fetched which, is the biggest draw behind the genre.<br />The flaw (\\"The Bad\\") of Ender's Game as a book is that while it can be stand-alone good for teens, more open-minded readers, fans of quick sci-fi reads, without out the fluff of back-story it will totally distance others that desire more complexity and more depth, and just more \\"stuff\\". This book shares a \\"complementarian relationship\\" with the other books in the series. The particular roles of Bean and Petra will not make sense if you don't read The Shadow series. The ability of the Wiggin Family as a whole won't make sense unless you read their back-story in the Shadow series. Card's flaw is that he took for granted the fact that some people WON'T want to read another series of books to explain his first book. This book still gets five stars from me.
0307341577|5.0|I picked \\"Dark Places\\" up on a whim: \\"Gone Girl\\" keeps popping up in my recommendations, but it doesn't seem like something I'd enjoy.  I figured I'd give one of Flynn's other novels a try first that sounded more up my alley to test out her waters.  Wow.  Just... wow.  I blew through this book in two nights.  Not because it was quick-reading or fluff, but because I could not stop reading: I had to force myself to put it down and go to bed.<br /><br />For people complaining that the protagonist is unsympathetic and the the story too dark and violent... I don't know what you were expecting from a book about a woman who at seven years old witnesses her entire family being violently murdered.  Of course she's hardened, of course she's damaged, and of course the description of the killings are going to drill their way into your psyche and not let go: to me that's the sign of a brilliant writer.  Anyone who can make me need to step back for a moment and process the emotions and horror of the characters of a book, yet at the same time make me absolutely NEED to grab it and learn what's going to happen next, knowing full well it isn't going to be good, has a very rare and astounding talent.<br /><br />The parallel progression of Libby's life at both age seven and as an adult are brilliantly intertwined.  You know what is going to happen to her family, there is ZERO doubt: it's established in the first few paragraphs.  Yet you still hold on to that tiny hope that something will change- again, another sign of amazing writing.<br /><br />There's nothing pretty about it, and although it is an extremely satisfying conclusion, the ending is just as shocking, emotionally brutal, and harried as the rest of the novel.<br /><br />Do not pass this one up.  Make some coffee, get cozy, and prepare to hunker down with a meaty, intelligent, page-turner that you will want to start over as soon as you are done.

0385536828|5.0|Forget the snotty, effete criticisms from some of the &#34;expert&#34; reviewers....If you like McEwan, you'll love this book...especially the end.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My girls love her and her music is amazing.  I really don't know what else to say.  Taylor needs no review.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I write this review with all due respect to a very successful author.<br /><br />That said...<br /><br />Recently, I read this series, and I've decided to just read spoilers from this point on. That's huge for me as a writer myself, and I'm a bit ashamed to even say it. When I read Game of Thrones I thought the author was just brave, but after reading all the available books I realize that I just don't like his style anymore. It is exhausting. His characterization is amazing and he's sold more books than I have, so he deserves true respect for that, but I read certain types of books for escape, and I felt like Mr. Martin open the dungeon doors, invited me into a grand adventure outside the cell walls, only to loose the hounds and stab me in the belly just as I started to feel free. Then, he did it again and again until I have no desire to trust his promise for freedom.<br /><br />More than any other books Dance of Dragons has helped me to discovered that my pallet craves books that make me feel either better or fuller at the end. If I want a world of dark I can watch the news.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Two thoughts....camera should be included in the device and secondly, the camera should be usable from front and back sides of the Kindle.
0553386794|5.0|Quick; worth the price; accessible. I sent this as a gift to my boyfriend in Switzerland - he laughed.:) Go for it :)
B002SRQ214|5.0|This was a big upgrade from the Athlon x2 5200. I am satisfied with it so far and have no complaints. I'm sure it will take me some time to find the limits on this one. No plans to OC.<br /><br />The package comes with a heat sink w/ thermal paste applied and the processor. I think the heat sink will need to be upgraded for power users if you want to extend the life. Normal temps around 38-42C 100% load temps 45-50C
B007PVHMCG|1.0|This is a small set. I know we all want our kids to win and get what they ask for. But Lego sold this set for $35.00 before they sold out. The least expensive one on Amazon is $118.00?? Isn't this price gouging? This is a small set.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|As a huge 50 fan, I was on the fence about Bared to You. I felt it was a 50 knockoff (because I read it directly after 50 to quell my thirst for sensual romance novels). I really liked BTY, but it wasn't as good as 50 in my opinion.<br />I was reluctant to read Reflected in You. I felt it would be the same feeling as Bared to You...sort of a letdown but something to pass the time.<br />I was WRONG!<br />Not sure if it was because enough time had passed from 50 or if I finally was able to separate the characters into their own story but I love love loved RIY!!<br />We finally got to see Gideon and Eva in a light that I could believe- insanely attracted to each other, obsessed but in LOVE.<br />I highly recommend this book...do not give up on the Crossfire series. This book had me completely engrossed and I absolutely LOVED IT. If you liked BTY you will love it too.<br />Cannot say more without spoiling...except that it is an emotional journey I am so glad I took and I cannot wait for the concluding book, Entwined in You.<br />A+!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|One of the great Christmas movies.  Great slapstick humor along with a funny storyline throughout.  A great cast of characters for sure.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've been a fan of Vince Flynn from the very start, and his books never disappoint!!!  He can always give you a page turner you can't put down!
B000002H6Q|5.0|Brings back the memories. Listen to it often. Embarrasses my kids. Love to play it loud with the window down.
B004DH8IK0|5.0|This was truly a treat! I had the pleasure of getting an .mp3 copy of this album from a friend of mine and it has been on my Now Playing list on my iPod for the past week non-stop!<br /><br />The best way I can possibly describe the sensation of listening to this album for the first time is by comparing it to listening to The Crystal Method's \\"Vegas\\" for the first time. It's mind-blowing and it sends you on a ride that will truly make you smile. I had this album playing in my truck and it was making my subwoofer SLAM! I couldn't help but smile! My favorites on this album are Watercolour and Set Me On Fire. All of the others are amazing, too, but these just stood out for me.<br /><br />Buy this album now!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|What can I say? The app is simple and gets the job done. I need this for on the go so I can keep bidding up until the last second. Works wonders.
B005MMY5RK|1.0|This movie was very very bad.  It didnt really make sense to me at first and then I never really tried to make sense of it, so I stopped watching it.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Kept my interest peaked and made me think alot about gravity and how to suspend a bridge so that it could support weight.
B0086700CM|5.0|So simple, but so hard.  Very addictive, love it! This game will help me pass a lot of time, lol
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. Plot was rolled out very smoothly and kept me reading! Had to keep switching back & forth between characters' perspectives, keeps you on your toes!
B0099G7KDQ|3.0|the lyrics are so Christian-y. As an atheist, I have a strong negative reaction to some of the lyrics but I love the music so much that I can usually ignore that. This album is pretty good but I liked their first one better.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|Hate it when Hollywood warps a great story, and while the movie was entertaining, you just can't beat the original story.
B001AH6ZWY|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a really long build-up to a very disappointing ending. Save yourself time that you'll never get back and don't bother with this one.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I enjoyed the first person narrative, which was creative and helped you understand the character more deeply. I also grew up in a house where the Eagles win/loss dominated the mood of the house on a Sunday. Did not like the ending, was expecting something more to happen (somewhat similar to the disappointment of the Eagles that year!)
1608871452|5.0|This has to be the coolest SPN book I've ever seen.  And this is coming from someone who owns just about everything related to this show.  I love this so much that it prompted me to write my first ever Amazon review (and I've been using Amazon for years.)<br /><br />Coffee-table sized.  With all kinds of great articles, behind-the-scenes stuff, gorgeous photos.  AND all kinds of random inserts (Like a pine-scented tree enclosed in cellophane and attached to a page that features the Impala.  LOL.  Lots of other random goodies.<br /><br />Very much worth the price.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I love Mitch Rapp, but the last two installments had weak plots.  It just didn't seem like much happened. Maybe Flynn has run out of stories.
1449410243|5.0|I was recently introduced to this by a co-worker, and promptly read through the entire archives, ordered the books, and sent several of the comics to my friends and family. If you are a technology enthusiast, or a pop-culture devotee, like sarcasm and biting satire, cats, and frank assessments of society and the United States in specific, you will enjoy this comic immensely.<br /><br />5 stars.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I haven't played any of the other Personas in the series with the exception of maybe 6 hours into Persona 3 (which I enjoyed but I picked it up 2 weeks prior to this game coming out) I was in a game store looking at Vita games and one of the clerks came over and said she was considering buying a vita just for this game because it was one of her favorites. So given that testimonial I went and tried Persona 3 and then immediately ordered Persona 4 for Vita.<br /><br />It's a blast. It has various levels.. I picked super easy because I hate getting stuck in a game. So it's enjoyable and full of OCD appeal. I rarely get pulled into a game enough to finish it.. or even to get halfway through it. This game sucks me in and I'm constantly picking up to make one more social link or to explore one more dungeon. I'll admit I'm no expert and have no clue what I'm doing fusing Personas and such but it's fun. If you're looking for something you can pick up and play whenever for however long (with the exception of the fairly prolonged tutorial/beginning section) then get this game. You won't be dissapointed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Man. Flynn always captures my attention and holds it throughout the book. This one as some unexpected twists that made the book.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|This is an inspirational true story that is cool enough for the teens but with a positive message as well. It's about learning life lessons to be the best kind of person, student and winner you can possibly be. A great story and good acting to boot!  My boys still quote it: &#34;Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate, but that we are powerful beyond measure.&#34;
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This book started out well, certainly an interesting premise for a story - I loved the image of the 100-year-old man climbing out the window.  And I loved the attitude of that 100-year-old man - it is what it is, and what will be, will be.  His present-day story, though a bit outlandish, was fun to follow.  His historical stories, though, sometimes became so bogged down in political narrative that I could not wait to get through it.  For someone with an interest in political history, I think those sections might be very interesting.  Not to me.  But overall, I liked the book.  Maybe not necessarily worth buying, unless it's a really good deal, but worth reading.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!  Best book I have read in such a long time. I would recommend to everyone that this is a must read.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I've read so many rapturous reviews of this book that perhaps my expectations were too high - but, I have to say I didn't get it.  It was certainly readable, which is saying something for me, as my interest in the animal kingdom is primarily in staying away from it so as not to be mauled (it is irrational, I know it, but even hamsters scare me).  And prior to reading this book, I could not have imagined even remotely enjoying a book about a boy and a tiger and a lifeboat - and yet I did enjoy it.  I guess where I run into a problem is that throughout the reading, I had in mind some statement I saw somewhere that claimed that reading this book would make you believe in God.  Regardless of whether I already do believe in God, I thought this was an interesting statement.  But when I finished the book, I could not begin to imagine why it would make anyone believe in God.  And so when it ended, I was kind of disappointed that it didn't strike me as the magical book I'd expected.<br /><br />All the same - the pages kept turning, and I've recommended to a friend (more to have someone to discuss opinions with than because I think it's a book that shouldn't be missed, but, still).
1451695195|5.0|Love this book I felt like it found me and helped me restore my faith and hope for mankind and the afterlife you will not regret reading this book :)
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I'm happy to have access to streaming HBO shows through Amazon.  I'm finally getting to see this award winning series!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The graphics in this movie are outstanding, and the action keeps the young and old waiting for the next scene.  The end of the movie drags slightly, then moves to a faster pace and causes you to reflect on the meaning of the season.
B0091LS07E|5.0|this girl has always been on fire from &#34;keys in a-minor&#34; to this most gigantic disc of music she has changed her style some what to reflect her growth in every aspect of her life.if you know anything about her or don't listen to is you won't,can't go wrong
B003L77GRO|4.0|AH... Where to begin.. Dexter was a great show and  previous season showed that in depth and its villain. But this one... Ugh not as bad as people say but it is worse than season three. Lumen and the group of killers in this show are not anywhere near as intimidating. Lumen is a damaged character but I do find here character not very well developed and that getting rid of Dexter's main love interest was a terrible Idea.<br /><br />The writing in this show is also lacking quite a bit. As the procedures used by the cops here are kinda baffling.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I bought this to replace the older version of this same product because we had somehow lost the cover to the dust collection tray.  This one has more power and even works on very low pile rugs in the kitchen.  It can't be relied upon for heavy duty cleaning, but is nice to get big crumbs off the floor in a hurry.  Our battery charger seems to have some issues, but I have the charger from the old one so that has not been a problem for us.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Given after the first 2 seasons and the medicore but interesting third season it was getting tough but interesting for Dexter how will adjust to becoming a father. Well he is a bit messy in this season. The villain is perhaps the best since the Ice truck killer and becomes the best the show has to offer and is thrilling.
B00002Z88D|4.0|I did not expect to enjoy tbis as much as I did. But, the songs tbat I did not think would be played with a symphany were played and sounded great. Master of Puppets was the high light along with Bells and the Thing that should not be.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|My girlfriend got me on this show and she is right it is hilarious. There isn't much to say other than watch this show instead of Ashton Kutcher on Two and a Half Men... v_v
B00000FCBC|4.0|Has all of the old covers from Diamo.d Head and others. It also has some good new.covers like Motorhead's Overlikk.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is a very interesting novel and look into writing as King is quite knowledgeable in that department and I appreciate the chance to pluck his brain. Any prospective writer should get this.
B000002H33|5.0|The heaviest album of all time! Damage Inc sets the bar along side of Master of Puppets. This cd never gets old.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As a writer myself I admire Martin's epic scope but I can tell that it is going to be a bad idea because of too many characters and plot lines. This problem becomes apparent in later novels after book 2 and 3.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is my all time favorite Slipknot video in its most raw form. They take no prisoners and just annihilate London!!!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I really got into these books & enjoyed them thoroughly. Love that some of the turns in the story you could see coming, but that there were also some that caught me off guard. Great reads!
B008BO61BE|5.0|Awesome set list at the peak of tbeir career! Robs vocals are the absolute best  ever. This show was just incredible and it felt good to actually watch the bonus dvd fron the US Festival of 83.
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|I was excited about buying this book: I have several O'Reilly books, and I've loved every one I've bought... until now.<br /><br />This book is more like a lengthy blog post or a lecture transcription than than an informative book or pamphlet. Its style is somewhat off-the-cuff and opinionated, and it doesn't have the same \\"polish\\" that a formally-published book should have.  Sentences are often wordy, and written with passive voice; complex words (\\"axiomatic\\", \\"heterogeneous\\") are sometimes used where simpler ones would suffice; and the narrative meanders at times, rather than staying on-topic.<br /><br />Instead of answering the question \\"What is HTML5?, this pamphlet seems to answer a totally different one: \\"Why does Brett LcLaughlin like HTML5?\\"<br /><br />Code samples are lacking. There's only one significant code sample: a section of HTML from Twitter, and that one sample is HTML4, not HTML5.<br /><br />Rather than talk about how nice the new &lt;video> and &lt;audio> tags are, I'd rather the pamphlet show me side-by-side (or over-and-under) samples of HTML5's improvements over HTML4.<br /><br />I hate to complain too much about a free book, but with a name like O'Reilly attached to it, I really expected more than I got.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|Slipknot puts on an incredible show filled with a great set list with both new and old songs. This dvd really illustrates how well they communicate with their audience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I payed $7 and It wont install please help me<br />I song know what is happining but when I try to install it gives me an error
B006Z21ZEW|4.0|Great sound and awesome visuals. Once again the South American audience shows why they are it when it comes to getting into the show. Great set list with a good blend of the standard must play maiden songs from when  Maiden ruled the world.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|It was good.  Not a lot of action but enjoyable.  I would rent another movie from this service.  Fast and easy and reasonable!!
0525953728|5.0|I am usually a avid reade but this book captured my attention. it gives a first hand account of what really happened on this most detailed mission.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOW! I don't know what else to say about this book. Not only has it opened my eyes to the PA genre, It has introduced me back into reading.<br /><br />WOOL is aw inspiring I feel. The development of all the characters brings you deep into the story and it is more then just reading a book, you feel emotionally involved with the lives of the people you read about. The story starts with so much unknown and it is exciting to turn each page and learn more about the Silos and the History of it all.<br /><br />Each character plays a vital role it the progression of the story from Holston to Jules and Solo to Lukas each person keeps you laughing, crying, and biting your nails.<br /><br />Hugh Howey I want to thank you for creating a world that can feel so real and for taking the time to focus on the little things and not always on the big picture. I am so excited that there are 2 more books in the series to read and I hope that this Silo's story continues and that in the end Truth will come to all!
B006O6F932|4.0|This playset is just what my kid asked for. I got it on sale.which was even better and had it shipped for free.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Never once suspected how this would end. I love a book I can't figure out until the very last page!
B007RKPO84|5.0|This is by far Kreators best album of all time. Millie.is still mad at the world and his music directly reflects his emotions. One of a very few bands that are just as heavy today as they were 20 years ago.
B0000029LG|5.0|The critics and haters in the public (as well as David Geffen) including large amounts of Michael's own fans turned their backs on him the couple of years before this...especially in the U.S. of A.  People followed the marching orders of the media around on a leash very well.<br /><br />Just the same \\"HIStory: Past, Present, And Future - BOOK I\\" still proceeded to sell FIFTEEN million copies worldwide by the end of the two year promotion for the project.  (Including a year long worldwide stadium tour of over four million ticket sales from late 1996 to late 1997.  Most people in the U.S. including what was left of his fans had little to no knowledge of this tour...and still do not.)  That means THIRTY million discs.  Full running time on two compact discs...and full price in most places during that period.  Meaning between thirty to thirty-two U.S. dollars per purchase.  NOT including the four million copies of the remix l.p. that came out in 1997 called \\"Blood On The Dance Floor - HIStory In The Mix\\" (of which the remixes sucked but the five new songs were quite good and included one of his best called \\"Is It Scary\\"...and the artwork ala the cover and insert were amazing) becoming and still is the world's best selling remix l.p. of all time.  That means thirty four million full priced full running compact discs were sold by the time the promotion ended in late 1997.<br /><br />But the public in the U.S. were told time and again that Michael Jackson wasn't what he use to be.  That \\"HIStory: Past, Present, And Future - BOOK I\\" was a failure of Epic proportions both artistically and commercially.  That the remix l.p. that was never explained as being a remix l.p. in the reports was proof by sales of only four million that Michael was without dought over.  A has been.  Now was the time for 2 Pac.  Garth Brooks.  Nirvana.  Jay-Z.  The Notorious B.I.G., Dave Matthews Band...and eventually Eminem according to most people.  As you were dictated to most of you were very obedient to these clowns as well as the media and David Geffen who are the real abusers of untold proportions.<br /><br />How could the public be so misinformed?  So remarkably stupid?  Was it because they could be led on a leash to their own demises by the media or were they blinded of pure hatred that they only wanted to believe the worst...by what the media were propagandizing?  The facts be damned.<br /><br />\\"Greatest Hits: HIStory - Volume I\\" would be released in the year 2001 which was the single disc of greatest hits from \\"Book I\\" (titled as \\"HIStory Begins\\") of this two compact disc release and would sell three million copies worldwide.  Hardly any acknowledgement there nor the fact a few weeks before the studio l.p. \\"Invincible\\" would be released.  Not only would it (\\"Invincible\\") debut at number one in the U.S. Billboard album charts but it would do as so in the thirteen countries around the world proceeding to sell eight million copies in those first few months.  After actively and purposefully being sabatoged by his own record company.  Yet the public were only informed of the sales in the U.S. of A. for \\"Invincbile\\" which were of very little in comparison to the worldwide sales.  There was no escaping the judgement of public perception.  Facts be damned.  No mercy.  No sympathy.  Total disregard.<br /><br />This project for \\"HIStory: Past, Present, And Future - BOOK I\\" was Michael's last hurrah in scope and scale of any type of promotion before the tied had turned on him mercilessly with total acceptance in reports that would be proven to be false according to what was written in the settlements of the accusers themselves.  (\\"Invincible\\" would have no teaser trailer and no promotional campaign in comparison which again would be used as proof by the critics, haters, public, and HIS OWN RECORD COMPANY that that project was a failure as well.)  Yet it (\\"BOOK I\\") still became and is the best selling multi-disc set of all time with twenty million copies in thelast few years of his life.  Equating to FORTY MILLION discs sold.<br /><br />How could a product of such low quality still sell to so many people who were told repeatedly to no end that this was an abuser of children?!<br /><br />Was it because they did not believe the lies?<br /><br />Did the work of the media and David Geffen fail?  Perhaps not.  Or perhaps so.  For behold no matter what success Michael Jackson would have in life and death the media, Epic Records owned by Sony, and David Geffen accomplished their goals of sabatoging and blocking Michael Jackson and all of the potential success and future projects (and there were many of all types of media, events, and even theme parks that were suppose to happen in the years to come (ala \\"Kingdom Entertaiment\\", \\"MJJ Music\\", \\"Neverland Entertainment\\", \\"2 Seas\\", and \\"AEG Entertainment\\").<br /><br />Where are the media in their acknowledgment of ruthless never ending judgement upon him and his products both artistically and commercially?  Do they present in case and time of their judgement anything less than silence?!<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />On a side note.  There were four music home videos released for this project:<br /><br />The first was released worldwide in 1995 on the same day as \\"HIStory: Past, Present, And Future - BOOK I\\".  It was entitled \\"Greatest Video Hits: HIStory\\".<br /><br />The second was \\"The HIStory World Tour Live!  At Olympic Stadium, Seoul, South Korea 1996\\" and was only released in that country.  Released in late 1996.<br /><br />The third was \\"HIStory: On Film - Volume II\\".  Released worldwide in mid 1997.<br /><br />The fourth was \\"Michael Jackson's Ghosts\\" and has yet to be released in the U.S. on music home video.  It was not aired on television in the U.S. until the year 2001 on VH1 and MTV at which point the public were entirely confused as to what it was and for what purpose it served as at best they thought it was something for \\"Invincible\\" of whichit was not.  Most of the public in the U.S. know very little of this film even existing to this day.  The film itself was to promote the song \\"2 Bad\\" (from \\"HIStory: Past, Present, And Future - BOOK I\\") which was a really good track but never released as a single in any territory on Earth.  The film originally premiered in late 1996 in \\"select theaters\\" in only large cities in the U.S. and shown before Stephen King's full length feature film \\"Thinners\\" which did very poorly at the box office.  Little to no attention was shown by the press mere less explaining anything about \\"Ghosts\\".  It would later be released in theaters worldwide in mid 1997 (but this time not in the U.S.) with two new songs (\\"Ghosts\\" and \\"Is It Scary\\") added to it.  Released worldwide on music home video (both on VHS video tape and VCD/CDV unto itself as well as a limited edition box set with other contents) in late 1997 EXCEPT in the U.S. of which it has so far seen no release date of any format.

B008SVFX96|5.0|Anyone that likes Bon Jovi and Richie Samtora will love the music on this CD.  Love it and looking forward to more.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I just loved this story.  I read it before I saw the movie.  It was a bit gruesome at times and towards the end, I didn't want Pi to endure anymore hardships.  Great ending.
B00338QENI|4.0|Very thought provoking, interesting, and sad all at the same time.  The story was not told in chronological order so I got confused several times which is why I rated it four stars.  I understand from others that she had done the research and did not meet the family until much later.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I enjoyed all of Mitch Albom's other books, especially Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and \\"The 5 people you meet in Heaven\\".  Time travel is one of my favorite genres, but this one missed the mark. This story had potential, but never got there.  I really didn't care about the main characters or where the story wound up.  Thankfully it was a short book and didn't waste too much of my time.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is one of my favorites... Bought this to catch up with the show. Watched on my laptop! Love it!
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Since I've been collecting Megadeth stuff since decade ago, this is a must buy for me for the live cd and poster alone. They did a good job on remastering one,  unlike 2004 remastered which has different snare sound ,this one pretty much retained the same sound like the original release but with notable louder bass volume and slightly thicker guitar tone.<br /><br />The second disc is awesome, it's the classic Megadeth 90's line up playing songs from peace sells, so far, rust in peace, countdown and \\"This was my life\\" and the title track are on the setlist, cant ask for more! I believe those 2 songs has not been played since 1995 until the recent Countdown anniversary tour, off course without the original album line up.<br /><br />While I like the 2004 remastered series for its bonus stuff (unreleased songs and demos), I wish they remaster the album itself the way they did for this Countdown anniversary, just make the sound more \\"in your face\\" but no remixing.<br /><br />_\M/

B005LAII9O|3.0|I began watching \\"Savages\\" predisposed to like it because I got a kick out of the book.<br />  After seeing it, though, I'm not sure what I think.<br />  On one hand, it's very \\"Scarface.\\"  And I don't mean that as a compliment.  Words and phrases like \\"imitative\\" and \\"done before\\" come to mind.  And the violence couldn't be more heavy-handed.  \\"Over-kill\\" if you will.<br />  On the other hand, though, that was what the book was about.  And, up to a point, Oliver Stone was faithful to it.<br />  And yet... I don't know.  The movie left a bad taste in my mouth somehow.  If someone thought this film was lurid, exploitative crap, I'd get their point.<br />  But, I have to admit, I found it riveting and compelling.  Even though just about every character in it was despicable or, at least, morally... um, challenged, and I wasn't able to root for any of them.<br />  Worth seeing, however, are Travolta and  del Toro.  And not, really, for the good acting they do.  Travolta must have been paid extra to appear in the film as he did:  overweight and balding.  And del Toro?  Chubby, bloated and, very oddly, looking  much like Brad Pitt with eight hours of make-up.<br />  I will mention one group, however, that I'm sure loved \\"Savages.\\"  And that would be the Coastal Orange County Chamber of Commerce (if there is such a thing).  Laguna Beach looked like paradise, and even the nearby shopping malls looked liked great places to go.  So, kudos to the cinematographer.  Because I used to live there, and none of that was ever as appealing in reality as it looked in \\"Savages.\\"  If only they had done as good a job with the rest of the film.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I had to drag my family to this movie when it was released.  It ended up being one of my daughters favorites and it is in my top ten list of favorite movies.  Great family movie, other than some of the scences may be too intense for younger children.  If I buy a movie as a gift it is usually this movie, because alot of people have not seen it, but when they do they usually love it.
1558908323|5.0|Watched this movie recentlly after several years and still found it a very creepy, well done horror film.  The effects are great, the acting is great, the bugs are super cool, the atmosphere was definatly there and made me want to see more.  Very happy with Mimic.
B009E3EY38|5.0|For starters: amazing live show. The sound quality is outstanding on both the cd and dvd's contained in this package.  The package is well put together is a very nice qaulity box that houses everything nicely which also contains a booklet with comments from the band about the reunion show which was cool.  The concert itself was very well done and just adds to Zeppelin's amazing legacy.  Jimmy page was right on target, John Paul Jones was spot on, Jason did a great job relacing his father and Robert Plants vocals were the best I have heard since Zeppelin's last live gig.  Very happy with this show and this package.  Highly recommended for Zeppelin fans and rock fans in general if you want to hear how it's supposd to be done.
B000EU1PKK|5.0|Walls Of Jericho os an amazing album on it's own but the bonus disc is worth the asking price all by itself.  The sound quality is great, the songs are amazing as they always have been, the bonus tracks are not to be missed each one solid. Very happy.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|This was an unbelievable book. How these men could endure the harsh climate and miles on foot, I have simply no idea. A true testament to what one can do when they are truly motivated and driven. Freedom is so precious and this book demonstrates what individuals are willing to go through to achieve it.<br />Really enjoyed the way Slavomir told his story. At times it felt a bit emotionless but I think you realize he had to be a bit detached in order to continue moving.<br />This book also gives a good perspective on Poland and Russia during WWII. But you don't need to be a history lover to enjoy this book. The story will pull at your heart and you will feel as though you're walking the miles with Slavomir.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille had me laughing out loud! While there isn't as much action as usual, it's still a great read b/c of the hilarious and witty dialogue. John Corey is at his finest and sharpest in the interesting country of Yemen. I also appreciated the historical facts sprinkled throughout the book. Definitely recommend this book if you're on a long flight or looking to escape the craziness of everyday life.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I have all of the previous soundtracks and like with the rest of them, it took me a little but to get into each one. I have listened to this CD all the way through about 3 times and while it is not the strongest of all the soundtracks, I still think it is great and gives lesser known artists a chance at becoming more popular. I think overall, the soundtracks have made a great addition to my Twilight collection and the Breaking Dawn 2 soundtrack on it's own is a great contribution.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It had several surprizes that caught me off guard. I thought I had it figured out, but I was wrong twice before I got at the very end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i got it for my kid,  and i started playing it  it was just a joke at first but then it was actually addicting
B0067TGSOK|2.0|Purchased this ebook after reading about it in the NY Times business section.  I was very disappointed with the content. Reminded me of the get rich quick programs on late night TV. This ebook should be in the under $3.99 category.
B001M2CBRK|5.0|Its a great movie all around, its not all accurate some things are exagerated about the Marine Core but its still a great movie
B0037MSGH2|5.0|The extras they put in this package make it worth the price. And it's so much fun re-watching the beginning in between waiting for the next Season.
0446580848|1.0|I just loved the John Corey books, but this one - ugh - I'm a little more than halfway through it and it's becoming a challenge to continue. What a disappointment since I did look forward to this. Corey's wisecracks and inner dialog are getting old. The long, plodding descriptions which read almost like a textbook, are not interesting. I keep waiting for something to happen. OK, they were ambushed on the way to one destination, but no good guys died. Keep wondering why Panther, American born, became a jihadist. Maybe it was described earlier and I missed it? I will continue to try and get through this, only because I spent money on it. Way too long, way too boring. Usually, these books are page turners and I can finish them up in a couple of nights. But I am falling asleep while trying to read this one and it's been over a week now. So a lot of what others have written under the \\"one star\\" I agree with. Shorten the book and lighten up with the wisecracks in every sentence.
B000089RVR|4.0|I enjoy this album time and time again.  I think this one takes second place to No Angel, but still a great set of music.
030758836X|5.0|Great book.  It really keeps you guessing until the end.  Unexpected twists and turns.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00000IAU3|5.0|In my opinion, this is Dido's best effort.  All tracks have something to offer, not just those hits you heard on the radio.  I will continue to listen to this one for a long time.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|the characters were awesome, the typical banter back and forth was great, maybe a bit too much, but the book moved along slower than most of his novels and didn't heat up until the last 10%.....I still love the writing style and will always look forward to another demille classic.....this was just not his best.....
B0086DBE62|3.0|I didn't think this was all that great.  Very Disney-esque. It was entertaining, and I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't make any effort to watch it again.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game was fun and engaging, if a little repetitive. The puzzles were not terribly difficult, but it did have a creepy factor which was fun.
B001EO2UKO|4.0|Dido has better albums, but this was a solid effort.  I will keep it in the mix for some time.
B009DJB9HC|3.0|I am a big Joe Bonamassa fan, so I have very much enjoyed his heavy metal forays with this crowd. He seems pretty absent here, as this plays more as a Glenn Hughes band project. Obviously, my favorite song on here is Cry Freedom, where Bonamassa plays a more collaborative part to great results. The other songs, while proficient and craftsman-like just don't really grab me.
0316069434|5.0|The negative:<br />On the second to last page Connelly wrote \\"She would not tell Bosch why she ...\\" did something.  That bothered me.  It was important.  I hope he answers it in the next book.  But I have to wait a year?  I believe the author said he was late finishing this book.  Maybe that's why he left it unexplained.<br /><br />The positive:<br />One of the things he does so well is:  When Harry first starts a case, I'm thinking how can he possibly solve this?  How will he find anything?  What can he do?  Then he finds one small piece of something and follows it.  He gathers a couple more odd pieces of information and I'm still thinking how could he possibly ever solve this?  Even later in the book, I'm still thinking that.  Yes this is a mystery slowly uncovering evidence.  But Connelly does it in a special way which is not predictable and keeps me wondering.  That's a neat talent.  I was immersed all the way through.  I didn't want to stop reading.  At the end the mystery was solved, but I wanted to see what Harry would do next.  I wanted to continue reading about Harry's life which I guess is the next book - next year.  So, it was done before I was ready to be done.  But I suppose that's good.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Story length: 403 pages.  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words, but not often used.

Genre: crime mystery with a little suspense.<br /><br />OTHER BOOKS - FOUR SERIES  (Bosch, McEvoy, McCaleb, Haller):<br />I recommend reading the Harry Bosch books in order, but it would be ok to try \\"The Last Coyote\\" or \\"Lost Light\\" first, just to see if you like the style.  Then go back and read the rest in order.  Following is my recommended reading order.  I've included four series within this list because there is a date flow and the characters interact.

B0073COMUW|3.0|I ordered 30 lightbulbs. Out the 30 there was 5 that did not power up.<br />The bulbs are nice and very bright, I'm unsure if I was unlucky with the shipment or if the brand is just poor quality.<br />I did not have issues with any other lightbulbs yet.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|After all these years and the changes in the group, they can still crank out a great sound.  For a new recording with all new songs they did great.  I enjoyed nearly all of them.
B007RE0SCW|4.0|Daughter plays with it all the time; even with the arm missing that broke off and was lost within the first week.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I ordered this because I am a massive fan of the Jurassic Park series and they did not disappoint at all. Beautiful picture quality, sadly the higher quality does make it a lot easier to figure out when CGI dinosaurs where being used vs mechanical ones. However that isn't the fault of the seller, I wanted high resolution and I got it =-)
B009S8PEHY|3.0|I love the way Rod Stewart used to sing - that raspy voice was so sexy, especially when he sang the ballads.  However, I think he needs to put singing to rest now and do something else.  He just doesn't sound the same - too old I guess.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was a good read but not up to the level of past reads.  Not enough action, too much talking and scheming, not enough of<br />Rapp doing his thing.<br /><br />Still, If you are a Vince Flynn fan, it is worth the time!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|My wife and I were lucky enough to decide to see this film instead of one of the mass market blockbuster movies last weekend, after hearing about the movie on NPR. It is a documentary of a fantastic and uplifting story. A side benefit was being introduced to the previously not widely known (in the US) music of Rodriguez, which is quite my cup of tea.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|A book that gives so much room for interpretation is what we used to call a classic.  An adventure story?  A survival story?  A philosophical test and journey? All of the above, albeit way too long for any of them to be considered successful. I was completely engrossed in the beginning of Pi's life on the boat, and totally charmed by his childhhod in India.  The end had me closing my Kindle cover harder than usual, in disappointment and confusion.  And then I got it. One of the things this book is is a story of how a person survives the unsurvivable. Not the physically unsurvivable, but the philosophically, ethically and emotionally unsurvivable.  Young people returning to safe middleclass lives from war zones, people in genocidal nightmares, survivors of any horror beyond human tolerance, would do well to be as philsophically, and emotionally resourceful as Pi. I say 3 stars, because even though the book made me think and had me talking back to it, as far as writing and story telling goes, it is way too long, too many too-long digressions and unnecessary characters, and doesn't end soon enough to be compelling all the way through.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I didn't think I would use it much when I first downloaded it but now its on my laptop, my phone and my kindle. It makes being organized so much easier.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|We are a Kindle family, from my 82 year old mother and husband with their Kindle keyboards to the rest of us with our Kindle Fires.  We have many different brands and kinds of cases to protect our Kindles.  My husband even used an athletic sock once when he was traveling and didn't have his case.  So there are several things I like in a case.  Quality feel, it must not feel like a cheap product, put together quickly and without care.  As little added weight as possible in light of what the product is going to be doing. A hinge that is strong and will fold both directions without breaking.  A pocket or place to hold notecards or stylus.  An inside that is soft, will protect and will not scratch the surface, no plastic thread used that will scratch.  A way to hold the Kindle that does not interfere with the controls and reading.  The ability to recharge when the cover is closed.  Some way to close or hold the case closed in a bag.  Just fun!<br /><br />This case has many of the items I look for in a case.  It has a quality feel and the inside is soft so that it will protect the screen.  I did not see or feel any threads that could scratch or damage the screen.  It is a light case so it does not add much weight to the Kindle.  It does have a band that will hold the case closed when you drop it into your bag so that the Kindle is protected.<br /><br />It does not appear that the hinge will fold both directions; however this cover will allow the Kindle to stand so I would be willing to compromise in this case.  I find I have been using my Kindle more and more as a quickly available light weight tablet that I always have with me and this cover would make more sense with that orientation.  However, in using my Kindle as a tablet I find that notecards, a pen, and a stylus are nice to have with me.  This cover does not have a pocket for those things.  Still I could just drop those things in my bag and they would be there in case I needed them.<br /><br />How the Kindle is held... it does fit securely, and I wondered about these plastic pieces, but then the elastic bands lose their stretch after a while too so I guess these are no better, no worse.  The most frustrating is that I charge my Kindle at night with the cover closed and this is impossible with this cover.<br /><br />Fun, yes, I love the purple cover of this case.  This case will only fit the Kindle Fire HD.  Overall it is a nice case with most of the things I like to see in a Kindle case and a few faults.  I haven't decided if being able to stand my Kindle up outweighs not being able to charge it with the cover closed, but it certainly cost this case a few stars.ld... it does fit securely, and I wondered about these plastic pieces, but then the elastic bands lose their stretch after a while too so I guess these are no better, no worse.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|Looked at the song listing and turned up my nose. However a friend suggetsed that I listen to it a couple of times. I did and I'm hooked. It's terrific. Love the guitar work and the treatment of the lyrics. Remember singing several of these at primary school and thought they were cute. This treatmet raises takes them to another level. Even like 'God Save the Queen' with all its British Empire overtones.
B00ABD0SW6|5.0|AHS is, by far, the most disturbing show that has ever been aired on cable and the only show I watch religiously. Even though I spend half the time watching through my hands, I absolutely love it and can't get enough! Wickedly AMAZING!

B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Best new comedy series of the year. Great characters and the dialogue is clever and funny. Can watch this over and over.
0307474275|1.0|Many novels are flawed, saddled with implausible plots, boring characters, and poor writing.  In the normal course of things, such books suffer the fate of Natural Selection: given small production runs, little-to-no publicity, and ignored by readers, they soon find their way to the sale tables, to be remaindered at bargain-basement prices, or to be recycled as packing material for more notable efforts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some novels are not merely mediocre; they are painfully, even excruciatingly, bad.  Like George W. Bush and instant mashed potatos, their very existence calls out for attention, some effort to expose their many deficiencies to the harsh light of day, and to inform the public that they have the right to (and ought to demand) better.  Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is one such travesty recently perpetrated on the reading public.  It is living proof that whatever is popular is not necessarily good, and readers who doubt this distinction should invest in a good dictionary.<br /><br />To be fair, the plot of The Da Vinci Code is clever and well-conceived: it is an action thriller aimed at the movie-going public.  The frenetic pace has our intrepid hero, Harvard Professor of &#34;Symbology&#34; Dr. Robert Langdon, accompanied by French police code-breaker (and descendent of Jesus) Sophie Neveu, dashing from Paris to it's outskirts, on to London, then Scotland, and back again to Paris, in search of the Holy Grail, no less -- all in the space of less than twenty-four-hours!  It is, in short a skillful blend of the pace of Mission Impossible with the religious-historical storyline of The Name of the Rose.  Think Umberto Eco Lite.<br /><br />Moreover, the novel is badly overwritten, right from it's opening line: &#34;Renowned curator Jacques Sauni&egrave;re staggered through the vaulted archway...&#34;  Could his fame possibly be postponed until we know a little more about his predicament?  Brown seems addicted to the liberal use of exclamation marks and italicised phrases labouring the obvious, like a ham-actor villain in a silent movie looking directly at the audience and leering in a menacing manner: &#34;This is my fault!&#34;  &#34;Is she out of her mind?&#34;  &#34;If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes&#34;  &#34;I'll just take a fast peek!&#34;  &#34;There must be something here!&#34;  &#34;Could that be it?&#34;  &#34;I'm dreaming.  A dream.  What else could this be?&#34;  And so on.<br /><br />Brown's plot devices range from the merely silly to the outrageous.  In supporting his claims about hidden messages in works of art he ludicrously weaves in a reference to Walt Disney's The Lion King.  More disturbingly, Brown plays fast and loose with history.  A sample: in his preface, Brown claims &#34;all descriptions of artwork...in this novel are accurate.&#34;  Yet in the service of his plot Brown shamelessly reverses the figures of Jesus and St. John the Baptist in Leonardo's painting, Madonna of the Rocks, even though it's obvious who is whom (St. John has his signature staff, and Jesus is blessing him - not the other way around.)  Nor is the archangel Uriel making a slitting-his-throat gesture (as asserted), but is simply pointing at John.  Finally, Brown bases his entire plot on the existence of a secret society called The Priory of Sion, allegedly founded in 1099, whose existence is confirmed by medieval documents deposited in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris.  Described as &#34;fact&#34; at the beginning of the book, the Priory of Sion never actually existed.  Far from having a history that spanned more than a millennium, the Priory was a hoax perpetrated by Pierre Plantard, a con-victed con-man who in 1956 planted the bogus &#34;medieval&#34; documents in the National Library's files.  I have no problem at all with novelists inventing &#34;facts&#34; to lend their stories credence; after all, that's what fiction is.  But it's downright misleading -- and sucks in the uninformed -- to describesuch claims as facts before the novel itself begins.  Brown shamelessly presents fiction as fact in the service of his plot -- and that's what makes The Da Vinci Code so pernicious.<br /><br />To say that The Da Vinci Code is overrated is to abuse the term.  Its outstanding virtue is that it lures readers into bookstores; in the process they may stumble across other, more worthwhile, reads.  Its lesser merit is that its very size (weighing in at nearly 500 pages) makes it easy to throw it away.Brown shamelessly presents fiction as fact in the service of his plot -- and that's what makes The Da Vinci Code so pernicious.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|soooo much fun ;) I love it its amazing!!! My little pony isone of my favorite games and its easy on the kindle
B005CK76ZA|5.0|Great album set with an awesome promotional aspect. Finally viynl is back and better than ever in this limited edition set.
0385536828|1.0|Sweet Tooth is a self-indulgent, patronizing book. The narrator is a female and seems the creation of an English Public School boy who knows women only in his fantasy world. A waste of time for those interested in real women.
B005SZNZAY|3.0|Great voice but I liked his song formula with Soundgarden a lot better. It is worth purchasing if you are a cornell fan.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I am now through book five of the series and I have really enjoyed Erikson's world.  This is an adult fantasy with complex plots, characters, history, magic, etc.  as others noted there are hundreds of characters to keep track along with different races of creatures - thanks to the malazan wiki it is easy to keep track of all of them.  I know this may be a considered heresy for the purest but it works great for me.<br /><br />The books often start slow and, at times, you wonder if it is worth the time and effort to press on but then the story opens up and I get sucked into a fascinating world.  The world seems complete to me - cultures, religions and histories which Erikson reveals slowly through the series.  The books can stand alone but the story s revealed from book to book with common themes.  I particularly like his description/use of ascendents, gods and magic.  There is plenty of violence and brutality but that is not the primary focus<br /><br />I strongly recommend using the malazan wiki to keep track of people, creatures, magic.  Without the wiki I would have given up on a great series.<br /><br />Often I wonder where Erikson comes up with these ideas.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|What if time had never been measured? What if you could see the effect your actions would have... before you took them? Short and rather unique way of looking at time's passage.
B00A2LFXVI|1.0|I thought I ordered the new movie but ended up with a cartoon.  I am sure my son will enjoy it.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I think the CPU does take advantage of you at times so beating it at its highest levels on a consistent basis is more difficult. All that said I still can't stop having a run at it daily when I get a few minutes free. Highly recommend
B0008ENICU|5.0|Love it and like watching it every once in a while for a mindless evening.  If you want to see some of the classic actresses.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Interesting movie,De Niro does a good job. If you like this era in history, check it out. The character development is good, De Niro \\"grows-up\\", a bit depressing in the end however...

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My teenagers and I are HUGE fans of the Percy Jackson series and this, the most recent addition to the series, did not disappoint.  Yes, parts of the storyline are goofy, but it has been a consistent factor in all the books.  They are intended for younger readers after all.  I, however, am an adult and LOVE them.  I have read right along with my kids on them all.  HUGE FANS!!
1400052181|5.0|By far this is on my top 5 books ever read. The contributions of this woman to modern science (thought she had no idea and gave no consent) are beyond imagination All our lives have changed for the better because of her special situation in that time and place..... so that begs the question...... was it right to do? Skloot does a great job with educating you on the topics and complexities involved without loosing your attention. I look forward to more work form her!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I'm not a fan of the more modern mainstream music, but Lindsey - with her violin - really makes something different out of it. Some of this music has even made me want to dance, and it's rare that music does that. As an author of fiction, I'm always looking for different music to inspire me to write different types of scenes. Lindsey Stirling's tracks have now been added to my playlists for &#34;music to write to&#34;! Whether you enjoy modern or more classical music, Lindsey's work will probably hit the right spot for you!
B0061XCZ4E|3.0|I don't know why I consider REM one of my favorite bands. They've made some great songs, sure, and a few are included on this compilation; an album-to-album collection of mostly popular singles, along with three new songs. But they've also made songs that aren't so great. And a lot of those are also included here. There's no \\"garbage\\". That's a joking display of modesty. But compared to personal favorites that aren't included on this consumer-focused set, like Up`s Sad Professor, some of what is emit a rather unpleasant odor.<br /><br />The One I Love is the template for a generic \\"love\\" ballad and Everybody Hurts has always been overrated. But Shiny Happy People is better than bitter angry people say it is and I consider the second half of this chronological set; the era in which REM's music supposedly began to decline; much better than the first. End Of The World, from that first half, is their best song, but the inclusion of Bad Day; their second best; a reworked demo-child of End Of The World; makes for an off-putting clash. They should have chosen one or the other.<br /><br />I like that there's no less than three songs from Collapse Into Now; a decision that serves as a free promotional plug for their last (final) album, released only a few months ago. &Uuml;berlin, despite the stupid stylization of its title; the \\"&Uuml;\\" means \\"thru\\", and \\"berlin\\" is the capital city of Germany; soars. That's thanks partially to the harmonic background vocals of Mike Mills, which also help make Leaving New York the best cut from Around The Sun. The Sidewinder is another major stand-out. And I have nothing but praise for Country Feedback.<br /><br />But Driver 8 is tired. And New Test Leper, which sounds beautiful enough during the verses, falls under the weight of its deadpan chorus. How fitting is it then that the three new songs are also a mixed bag. A Month Of Saturdays is as lazy and unproductive as it sounds, but Hallelujah is comparatively enjoyable. Nicer still is We All Go Back To Where We Belong, which shines like the sun on a warm summer day. It's just a pleasant song; the kind of melodic dream music REM should've focused more on during their twenty-nine years.<br /><br />marcellee.comAll Go Back To Where We Belong, which shines like the sun on a warm summer day.

B000002P2W|1.0|Squeeze Box is a great classic song by The Who but the rest of this album is boring filler and I don't care to listen to a second time.
B00A1AU702|3.0|There are worse situations a person can be in, but being trapped in a broken-down Pinto for several hours with a rabid Saint Bernard trying to kill you every time you try to escape is pretty bad. Having an annoying crying kid with you is even worse. That's the situation Fonna Trenton finds herself in one hot day. And if she doesn't get her son, who's dehydrated and apparently asthmatic, to safety soon enough, he will die. The movie should be mostly that, but it's not. The car doesn't break down, thus the suspense doesn't really begin, until pass the half-way point. Everything before comes across as a prelude; one that involves Donna's irrelevant marriage troubles and goes on for too long.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B009B0L324|2.0|Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need....well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.
B0046B4VXQ|4.0|Naked girls showering after a sweaty game of volleyball grabs your attention in the first few minutes. Carrie is far from the sexiest among them, but she's cute in her own unobtrusive way. The fact that she's constantly mistreated by almost everyone around her, including \\"Mama\\", makes you root for her even more. It's when she's invited to the prom by one of the cutest boys in the school, which she reluntantly accepts, that things start to go really bad.<br /><br />It's a sad story but never to the point of maudlinism, even when Carrie's sadness forces her to tears, because she possesses a power that makes up for her social inadequacies. She can move and physically affect things with her mind, like close windows and break mirrors, if she concentrates hard enough. It's what known as telekinesis, a phenomenon she herself doesn't fully understand. All she knows is that it tends to happen when people make her mad.<br /><br />The final fifteen minutes or so before the ending credits, especially the view-violating epilogue that makes up the final three minutes, are highly unnecessary. From both a narrative and an artistic point of view, the movie should end just after the prom; the obvious climax in the world of a high school student who cares about fitting-in with the popular crowd. Still, the excess isn't enough to ruin what remains an endearing story about a very special girl.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B000002P6R|1.0|You Better You Bet is the only good song I could find on this directionless mess of an album.  That's it, one good song the rest if horrid filler.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|From what I understood, this was going to be the USB used to tranfer items from a computer to the Kindle fire HD.  I would not have paid the $10.00 to order another charger for the Kindle as the one I ordered is brand new.  There is nothing wrong with it.  I feel like I have been misled and spent a little extra money that could have been used on the correct USB.  Am I doing something wrong?  Everything I have read and watched states that once the kindle is plugged in with the USB that it will show on the kindle screen that it is ready to transfer items.  Maybe I do not know exactly what I am doing.  Any help or guidance????? or was this just the wrong cord......would love to have the music and pictures transferred to the kindle before I give it to my mom for Christmas.
B000002OZY|1.0|I could tolerate most WHo albums up until this one which is where the wheels started to come off.  The riffs are not memorible, the songs sounds lost and the album is a whole was very forgettible for me.
B00271SFB6|3.0|Its a little slower than I had expected for a modern Bond movie. See all of them at least once.
B000002OX5|1.0|I can't name one song here I thought was great it was all very generic for that time period.  The commercials in between songs also gets annoying....fast.  Pass on this one, The Who have much better albums.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took a while to get going but once it did, what a story!  The ending totally deflated me, wanted to rewrite it ha ha
B000002OX7|4.0|This is the only Who album you need, it contains their biggest, most important songs that they still play today.  Very good sound quality on the disc and one to be remembered.
1423113497|3.0|I monitore heavily what my kids read and watch, so before discussing the book with them, I read it cover to cover.<br />The first book is so similar to Harry Potter, that my daughter (11) found similarities all over. Both books revolve around a hidden world that exists alongside with our own existence. In both books, the lead character doesn't know who they are until the age of 11. You enter both hidden worlds through a gateway in a major metropolis, IE a doorway to Diagon Alley inside a pub in the middle of London and an elevator in the Empire State building to the new Mount Olympus. There are more, but you get the picture.<br />Still, the book is enjoyable and somewhat entertaining to a child or an adult who just wants to vegetate for a while.<br />The rest of the books in the series are generally better as the characters get older and the storyline progresses.
B000002P2V|2.0|The two stars are for \\"who are you\\" and \\"Twist of the light\\" the rest of the album is not that great in my opinion.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift, and it appears to be in excellent condition. I only hope that the quality of the CD's are as good as they look!
B000002OX3|1.0|\\"This album is terrible. It really stinks. I'm not sure about the Who. They are certainly overrated. I don't think they are in the top ten bands of all time. \\"Who's Next\\" is a good album but this mess is another in a long line of dreadful albums put out by the pretentious Pete Townshend. I really tried to get into this CD and listened to it 3 or 4 times hoping it would grow on me. It didn't. Last I saw, my dog had gotten ahold of it and tore it to shreds. \\"Good boy!! Watch out for glass shards...Don't cut your mouth chewing that CD case to bits\\"...\\"<br /><br />^^^^^^^^^^^<br />Agreed 100%  You stole my thoughts.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Do not buy this product and support this company with your money. It does an absolute horrendous job with picking up debris from wooden floor, and especially carpeted floors. Hardly ever picks up hair or cotton fluff at all. Annoying to clean out because the strands that it does pick up end up getting tangled throughout the black spin fibers. The garbage collector is so tiny, it's positively worthless; you might as well be pushing dirt around the floor in circles with a stick. Construction of the product is so flimsy, it's ridiculous. It's like they used cardboard.<br />Battery dies within almost one use. It doesn't help that the charger is barbarically sized and takes up an entire double outlet. Plus the inside of my battery decided to melt a little, which is just fantastic.<br />Never buy this, ever. In fact, never buy anything from those \\"As Seen On TV\\" annoying ads. They're all liars.
B003KIMOIK|5.0|Clint Eastwood's spoof of his Dirty Harry character is perfect.  I don't even remember Burt Reynolds' character.  I think Clint E. had a lot of fun with this one.
1419705849|5.0|Bought this for my 9yo who doesn't like to read.  He read the whole book in one day!  He just loves all of the Wimpy Kid books.
B007HACDLK|5.0|You'll love it.  It is exciting and has all the aspects that make him a great author.  I liked the rest of his books and this was no different.
0517543052|5.0|When the author awoke he was in a distant land {and dimension} read and realize the moment now-not yesterday not tomorrow-is the most important.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|i just started running a couple years ago with my fist marathon and i knew i wanted to do more so i was hoping for inspiration in this book - and that's what i found. love the story of the Tarahumara and their iskiate! I drink that stuff almost daily now.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another excellent read that only Vince Flynn can write! I hope to be reading another new Mitch Rapp book very soon.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because it does exactly what it claims- It allows you to dock your iPhone4s without removing an Otterbox Defender case from it. It fits directly into the port. No jamming or forcing it to fit. No more removing of the heavy duty case. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's pretty clunky and requires a lot of space in order to work.<br />I bought this specific version because, for a little more cash (there's another version that costs less, is smaller and has less features) it will allow your iPhone to be charged with a micro USB charger AND will allow old school Docks that don't charge idevices to provide a charge. It's contains an electronic converter of sorts.<br /><br />Well... The old school dock that I bought it for won't accept it because the dock adapter creates a height clearance issue. This is a perfect example of the clunkiness. Another issue is that it makes your dock and iPhone susceptible to unnecessary damage. It extends the \\"neck\\" of the dock-to-iPhone connection and makes it flimsy.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I purchased it. It does what it claims. I wish it were less obtrusive but, I guess that's the compromise you make when something is made as a one-size-fits-all solution.
B006H5120E|5.0|The whole family really enjoyed watching this movie in 3D. It must be a real challenge to convert a movie that was not filmed in 3D but they did an excellent job.
B00684J49U|3.0|I did not realize I ordered them so far ahead of production, I like the show, I caught up on the show, would order again from this vendor.
0061726834|3.0|Love, the deadliest of all deadly things: It kills you both when you have it and when you don't.<br /><br />Stories like this is not something I would typically be drawn to. A world where love is a disease. However it sounded very compelling and unique. So I decided to give Delirium a-go.<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of our main character Lena, I found that she didn't have many of her own thoughts. Since it is Dystopian, maybe that's what the author meant to come across. However, I do wish she would have come across as her own person. I had the most problem with this because in the beginning all the characters seem to think alike. Which is why I don't usually go for Dystopian books, for this reason. But I did find that Lena did develop as her own, more towards the end.<br /><br />The romance was actually pretty nice. I really liked Alex. He was a wonderful character. Even though the romance was predicable, I didn't mind it at all. I liked how Alex helped Lena come out of her shell. She started thinking more for herself instead of what she was taught was right or wrong.<br /><br />As for Lauren Oliver's writing, it was very poetic and delightful, which was a little on the detracting side as I continued to read Delirium, but it wasn't to over done, I don't think.<br /><br />The main problem I had with this book, which is why it did only get three stars, was because of how s.l.o.w this story started out. I almost kept giving up, because I was so bored, and the concept of love being a disease, is strange to me. But I'm glad I stuck with it. It was a really interesting story, nice character development. And a nice, at times a bit cheesy, but still a lovely romance. With a very nice male character. And best of all no love-triangle.<br /><br />I don't think this story is for everyone, but I do recommend you give Delirium a try, if you're not sure if you want to pick it up or not.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This product works great!  Came in real handy when one of our other controllers went dead.  Would definitely buy this product again.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|Normally I hate generic cases, but this one is great.  It's well constructed.  I could see how it would fit most cameras, storage for charger, and other digital goodies.  It's compact and lightweight.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This novel was fast-paced with great details of Yemen. My only regret is not reading The Lion first, since this book referred to that story a lot.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you don't like gore...don't watch this series.  It was cheaper to buy the dvd than to buy it on my Kindle.  It is well-written, but I would read the review (it has good ones) to see if it is something you would enjoy.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was very well written. It is a nice change from my usual choices. The details were so specific, I felt like I could smell and taste the same as the character. It is rare that after I read a book, I continue to think about it and have questions...this one is in that small category. Can't wait to see the movie. I hope they captured what I had in my head!

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Didn't know what all the fuss was all about but decided to buy it for the long Thanksgiving weekend (don't watch football). Excellent period drama, beautifully crafted and great to watch. Couldn't get enough and can't wait for season 3 (and 4 and 5...).

B003YL4LYI|4.0|The beginning is a continuation of book 4, which is to say, its a lot about character development.  It's not super exciting, but we get to know some of the characters better and their stories are progressed.  The end however, is very exciting, more akin to book 3.

B007ZBWJXI|2.0|Asia's latest is another compressed pop studio piece of pap. There is no prog so let's get that out of the way before we go further. NO PROG. So we have John Wetton, great as ever on vocals and bass, Geoff Downes marvellous on keyboards, Steve Howe eternally brilliant on guitars, and Carl Palmer a living legend on drums. They play nicely and won't trouble any metronome from maintaining a steady 4/4 beat. The metronome swings back and forth happily with this knowledge after years of battering from the complexities of ELP, King Crimson, and Yes.<br /><br />The album is called 'XXX' in commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the album release, but don't dare Google Asia XXX while at work. Roger Dean's artwork is sublime paying homage to the debut album which is a nice touch, the proggiest thing about it as usual. It signifies The Chinese Year of The Water Dragon, 2012.<br /><br />The album boasts some extremely popular radio hits already, I am talking about 'Bury Me In Willow', infectious chorus, steady 4/4 tempo, has a nice melody throughout and sweet vocals. It almost sounds like 80s AOR. It is nice. It did jam into my skull and I was walking around humming the tune; altogether now 'give me no standard, no eulogy, No red, white and blue, no sceptre and no cloak, Just bury me in willow, not in oooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaak.'.<br /><br />'Tomorrow The World' is also popular. Great melody that wraps itself around your cerebral chord and refuses to let you sleep. The catchy chorus is maddeningly viral on your senses, you won't forget it if you listen too much. It is also nice. The synths sound like Europe's 'The Final Countdown' but it's a retro synth sound I agree with. The ending lead break is cool but not long enough, Mr Howe.<br /><br />'No Religion' is even catchier than any of the other songs especially the maddening chorus 'Got no religion, just living hell, If I had some money, I'd drop it all in the wishing well, Stand in the doorway, wait for the man to come, Got no religion, and my life's just begun.' It has a decent keyboard solo and solid structure. Repetitive, sure, but that's radio friendly for you.<br /><br />'Face on the Bridge' is the first single from 'XXX', reaching number 1. This and the first three songs are longer than 6 minutes but still are not as creative as one might desire given the talented skill on hand. Seeing the length of the songs made me wonder would they give us some virtuoso soloing? The answer is a resounding no. I could envisage housewives jumping about humming this while they make the dinner. Even my wife liked me listening to this pap, and she can't stand all that complex prog.<br /><br />'Judas' annoys me lyrically and repetitively, but the worst song is 'Reno', a bonus track best left on the cutting room floor. It is dreadful slush. 'Ghost of a Chance' is also a dreary meandering syrupy ballad. Nice to put the old iphone in the air and sway during a concert, but give me Rush's 'Closer to the Heart' any day. The other bonus track is okay, 'I Know How You Feel', another saccharine lovey dovey ballad, but this has a strong melody that really is endearing.<br /><br />At the end of listening to this AOR album one is left with a warm feeling, strong melodies and a mainstream radio sound does not hurt at all and at least Asia can create music that appeals to a mass audience. They are not particularly a band I would recommend or listen to often, but having stated that, this is still an album with quality production and packaging. All the talent of the prog legends though is buried in girly papsmear pop pith and it is a mediocre album with about 3 great songs. This album epitomises all the reasons I can't abide listening to top 40 radio hits; it is so syrupy the treacle pours out of my speakers. If this were an AOR site I would give it 3 stars, but it is not as good as their debut and I could only give that 2 stars so 2 stars it is again. I'm off to clean my ears out with some decent prog now, where's that King Crimson CD?here's that King Crimson CD?
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I just installed the fan, so I can't speak to long-term reliability or performance, but I have to say I'm pleased.  Well, it's certainly a reputable brand, although it's my first Noctua, personally.<br /><br />It's very quiet.  It moves about the amount of air you'd expect given its size and speed, but I did not find the need to use the enclosed fan speed reducer cable at all.<br /><br />The reason to get this product is the accessories it comes with.  Screws, rubber noise-isolating mounts, an extension cable, a 3 to 2 pin cable converter, a speed reducing cable (it just has a resistor),  and a kit for splicing wires from nonstandard connectors onto a compatible one (for replacing fans in routers, etc.) are all included, and make this fan a better value proposition than the headline price suggests.<br /><br />It's also... cute.  The photo makes it look normal sized, but it's actually really small.  It looks like a play-Noctua fan.<br /><br />I'm using it on an Atom heatsink.  The stock fan from Gigabyte was l-o-u-d.  High frequency, too.  So I installed this one, and put the fan speed reducer on my other system fan.  Now my system is blissfully silent!

B000AMJC2K|2.0|This seems well made but had two problems:<br />1. It requires a lot of clearance under the table so it can be properly clamped.  It will work best with a simple table.  Desks with features below the table top are a problem.<br />2. I could not get it to adjust height.  I think the unit I received was defective, but there were no decent instructions with the unit.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was very excited to read this novel, however, I found it dissappointing, as have been his last several books.  It starts out well, but I get the impression he either wasn't sure how to end it, or simply was tired of writing it.
B00A3VLJCE|4.0|Honestly, its mostly about the scribble option for me. There are other features of course and this is by far the best app you will find for photo editing on a device other than laptop/ computer but.. $10 for an app is slightly outrageous..

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is an excellent game for the phone. It's simple controls aren't convoluted and allow the player to play with one hand. There's plenty of rewards for collecting coins, and lots of challenges to complete. In-app purchasing is not required, and just unlocks coins faster. A well polished game with a lot of humor and thought put in to it.

B009FXIICK|4.0|This is a port of the DS game, and it is a rather decent port. The game itself is a match three game, and plays very well. There are a lack of game modes, but otherwise, the game is pretty fun and can be challenging at advanced levels.
B003DT19F0|4.0|I bought this for my daughter (she's a toddler).  It's got a great story and, as most Disney movies, a good moral message.  As a Disney fan, I thought this was a good story to watch and it held my toddler's attention longer than some of the other movies and shows designed for kids.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Excellent ! Chosen due to the songs recorded. Makes Great Listening after the lights are turned off and I am going to sleep.
B007SXB498|5.0|I've seen both movie versions (US and BBC) and had to read the story in college for a class. That was how I was introduced to the story of Sense and Sensibility. I liked it originally and as time progressed, it has become one of my favorites.  Great story and easy to follow the flow of the story.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|My biggest problem is that the upgrades are to expensive.  There needs to be another way to get the gold coins, other than at random or buying them.  (the free way to get them is ridiculous, I'm not going to sign up for all that crap just to get an upgrade.)
B0087GF8ZG|1.0|and doesn't work particularly well.  The motion sensor on mine stopped working in less than 30 minutes.  I sent it back the same day it arrived.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is one of the easiest games to figure out. Good insructions. Wonderful graphics. Settings let you play at almost any skill level.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Not too hard and not too easy. Too much luck required however when the pigs are out of sight and you have to release the birds and hope for the best.
B008J05EL8|1.0|If ths so-called office program was as great as is claimed, then everything would be incudeed at one price. So far, it isn't worth the cost. Don't buy it.
