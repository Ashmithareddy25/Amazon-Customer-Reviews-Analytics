B00APUYWYA|5.0|My wife and I thought this was going to be a real dog, but boy was I wrong. We liked it so much we watched it twice. Of course we both loved Sister Act as well.
0547884591|4.0|The receiver of the gift was reading excerpts from the book on Christmas morning and was really enjoying it--Thanks much
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I've only seen a few other movies in my 40 years that were worse than this one. Save you money. This thing will never give you back your hour and a half that it takes to swallow this movie.
B008LP8QE8|1.0|'Harrison's principles of internal medicine' itself is the best book for understanding and refering internal medicine.<br />But, Kindle edition is the only PDF version. It is difficult to say this book kindle edition.<br />I think this book was made by scanning of  paper book.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Shia LaBeouf, but he did pretty decent in this move. Not a bad choice for an evening rent.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I have found that the Bushnel V2 laser range finger is a great, easy to us rangefinder.  I have used it for three months and have had no problems with it.  I carry another battery with me but have not had to use it.  I would recommend it to any golfer.  Very easy to use.  I really like it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My wife and I decided to watch this one evening. We were both greatly entertained. I would recommend this to just about anyone.
B008N1V11U|5.0|great game totally worth the money. I wish all games were this good. if you are a fan of batman you should get this game
B006YXTRHY|1.0|This movie wasn't workth the effort it took to push the remote &#34;play&#34; button. I've never seen much worse than this one.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|About the price, but I got it for Christmas and I haven't reverted it. Awesome game play, tons of hours, cute graphics and charcaters, and I love how they change classes. I'm not even close to beating it and I'm having such fun playing!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie had a great plot with a lot of action. I'm usually not a comic book hero type person, but it was worth the $4 and the evening to watch it.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Iron Man and Robert Downey JR., what isnt to like.  This movie sets up how Iron man came to be.  It is full of action and is okay for kids over 13 (in my humble opinion).
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I waited until this was available on Amazon. I'm not sure if I did the right thing or not. This movie would have been definately cool on IMAX 3d!
B007TS6H9O|5.0|She smiled when she opened it, so it was well worth the purchase.  It came on time and was in good shape.
B009329ZF2|4.0|It's not a socially redeeming flick, but you'll enjoy the simple plot and the graphics. Even the most non-scifi person can follow this movie.
B008HK3TXK|4.0|This case arrived today (earlier than expected), packaged well.<br />PROS: Attractive design, good quality stitching, and rubber grip for hands-free usage holds device in place as promised. Nice, slim design (no bulk).<br />CONS: Velcro enclosure seems a little weak. Not sure if it's a design flaw or poor quality Velcro. Flap stays closed but I'm concerned about its longevity, seems like it might become weak after some use. Also, wish the case itself offered some more padding for additional device protection.<br />Overall, very pleased with this purchase.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely the most intriguing book I have ever read. Aside from all of the adult content, the story of their relationship and how it develops is wonderful, exciting, and addicting. This is a definite must read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book I do have to say is one of the best I have read in too long of a time period. I want to be in this circus, this dream, this spectacular illusion. The characters have become my friends, my adopted family that I never want to give up. I will read this book more than just a few times, and continue to plunge into me dream world that has been realized in the words scripted in the folds of  these pages.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book to comedy lovers it was hilarious Greg should have started with holly hills duh you did try to make her your girlfriend in dog days and you spent the entire summer trying
B000JML90Y|4.0|Interesting to someone that is not very scientific. I learned facts about Darwin I never knew! You should read it.
B009POCG2C|2.0|Well, I'm glad I had a chance to rent this for a buck.<br /><br />I had high hopes for it, but it really falls short, and as many of the other reviews point out, it's predictable.<br /><br />Not only that, the premise that the star player that they are scouting, all of a sudden succumbs to a pitchers curve<br />ball, who never played the game in an organized fashion, is simply too much for me to swallow.<br /><br />Not as intriguing a baseball movie as something like the true \\"Money ball\\".<br /><br />Timberlake is not bad in this.
B008VBYN80|5.0|having a good time playing ths game. it moves at a good pace so I don't get bored. iamenjoying the graphics and have not had any technical difficulties since I downloaded it 3 weeks ago.
B001G7HKZ4|5.0|This is a fun romp of a movie that sneaks in some common sense about what is most important in life. I really don't want to say much more, except that the actors give fantastic performances and the story flows with ease.
B003MC5N28|5.0|A great young adult book in itself, it is a fantastic dystopian novel creating a believable scape and society that reflects a world where choice and memories have been relinquished for safety and sameness. Book ends hopefully.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Excellent, breath taking and exciting, grab a bowl of pop corn and sit back and enjoy.  I would watch again
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I have loved Rod since the 70's and would buy anything he put out.  It's a nice addition to my collection.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book had mystery and excitement i xid read it every spare moment.  the facts were believable until the end. its my favorite book so far.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So very easy to use, I can't imagine that I would ever rate a thing like this but it's worth the time and I highly recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game provides tons of fun. great way to pass time while you are bored. this game has a strategy. find the pipes that can only go 1 way and then work around it. it makes the game that much easier.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I was really looking forward to the new release but had difficulty staying awake to the end. Weak story line.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Pretty good, not as funny as my friends said it woould be, but really good. you reallly believe that Ted is real!!!
B0015AARJI|1.0|It supose to work in a long period of time and it didint last longer than a half a year with out no extense of use..<br /><br />One key does not function<br /><br />I want a controller as a refund... Bye
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This books has some great humanist ideals and philosophy despite the political views of its author. Unfortunately the plot is predictable and you probably won't be blown away, but the idea of having speakers of the dead did give me a lot to think about.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I especially like being able to use my own pics as background and card stack.  I like being able to move cards with a click instead of dragging.  Always love playing this when I have time to kill.  I guess I`m not use to it yet, but getting to the statistics page is difficult.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game is worth the upgrade. its fun and addictive. I couldn't put it down untill I finished. I liked the story line and the scenes. It fun enough without being too hard.
1452111014|5.0|This is the latest in my collection of the Art of books.  This one has a ton of details on the background of the character creations.  Wreck-it Ralph has such a surprising complex story covering serveral locations each one needing it's own style and yet having to all fit together.  Probably one of the most interesting areas of this book is the creation of a real world Sugar Rush with the models used to design the characters.  Brittney Lee's statements adds just to the enjoyment that is put into these movies.<br /><br />The cover art is not the greatest and I don't think does the book justice in the type of content that is there.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I liked this book. It was a little sloow in the middle. I liked the twist in the end that kept me in suspense.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Despite The Avengers generally being considered as the best action hero movie of 2012, The Dark Knight Rises is entirely a different strata. It took me two viewings to really appreciate the movie. Once just does not do it. There is so much detail in this flick that alot is missed on your initial viewing. And despite Christopher Nolan's retirement from The Dark Knight series the cliffhanger ending offers the prospect of upcoming capers within this or a related cinematic creation!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Michael Connellly is a great writer. The Harry Bosch stores are the best. He gets into soooo much trouble but he always gets out.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This is the best movie that I have seen in a long time. It is well written, great actors, and wonderful story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Who doesn't like to play solitaire? This is my third my favorite game to play and now I can play all I want.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Installed it on my brand-new Kindle Fire to use with Google Reader but at first I was never able to get beyond the \\"bind failure\\" error message. The product has been updated to work with the Fire HD and it is super! Not only do my G Reader subscriptions show up wonderfully formatted, so do a world of other articles and information. If you enjoy reading a wide variety AS I do, you will thoroughly appreciate Feedly. Way to go on a super app!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is my all time favorite game. And when I got my Kindle Fire for Xmas my granddaughters made sure this was the first game they put on iuit.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Not sure how many cases he has left in him but this is another classic closer by Harry.  Good job Michael.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My four grandchildren got me into this game. And it was this game that I was playing when my sons informed my that the Kindle Fire I was playing on was mine. LOL
B002EEP3NO|3.0|Since it made my son happier than any other gift he could've received, it's not a total failure. But whatever dimwitted, mentally challenged rookie engineer was in charge of creating the laser assembly should be drummed out of the business and never allowed to work on a blueprint again.<br />Bad enough that it came apart well over 50 times while I was trying to put it together, but now it's been touched during routine play, fallen off, and while trying simply to put the base back on with the usual Lego studs interconnecting, the thing split into 3 parts and is now lying there useless. And the base of the laser STILL didn't snap together!
B0041TM5OU|5.0|The greatest jazz album ever produced. The musicians were all at the height of their careers and had completely locked into one another.  With original pressing selling for upwards of $300 the price for this reissue cannot be beat, and as all audiophiles know vinyl is the way to go!
B0009HLD0K|5.0|I used to bike and loved this movies that helped me not to feel silly in my biking clothes. It's different and fun. The end is so different from what I was thinking was going to happen, great suprise. Loved it
B000003N7F|5.0|One of the greatest jazz albums of ALL time! Coltrane truly at the top of his game, & the warmth of the music is best heard on VINYL.
B0038P59A0|3.0|I guess I'm old school still love the Basil Rathbone Sherlock best. This is good but I collect old movies and not too many new ones. I was disappointed in Holmes but loved the atmosphere of London.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun! Great for a boring rainy day:) The games aren't super hard but the give you a challenge. It would also be a great game to keep kids busy.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Travis Maddox and Abby Abernathy are the most dsyfunctional couple I have read in a very long time. This book is truly a beautiful DISASTER.<br /><br />This couple was trainwreck, and I couldn't stop reading simply to see how it all ended; unfortunately I was disappointed in the ending and some of the writing.<br /><br />The story starts way too fast for me, and at times does not seem to be set up well. I felt as a reader, I was often thrown into scenes too quickly and various characters just popped up without any explanation or 'preview' that they were coming. Maybe it's just me but I like a set-up to my scenes and characters.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong; i enjoyed the book. Hence, why I finished it. There were moments of complete swooning and aww-ing but it was sidetracked by the countless times I had to shake my head in disgust or frustration.<br /><br />I do however, recommend the book. If you're looking for a simplistic love story where 'all the right things happen', this is not the story for you. Abby and Travis's road to happily ever after is rough,complicated and annoyingly frustrating at times, but the author did keep me hooked for most of the ride.
B0047T86G0|5.0|I love this item! Its so easy to use! True, I dont have a KINDLE FIRE, but it works so well!!!!<br />all i have to do to Search is go to the dictionary, type in the word im looking for, and Ta Da! There is the definition!<br />this is a highly advised dictionary from me to the user.
B005SAJJHM|1.0|love Big Bang Theory.  Hate Amazon on line.  This system leave something to be desired.  If you watch before 9:00pm you might be able to watch an entire episode without it stopping and reloading.
076115678X|5.0|Give great ideas on how to keep your curls curly and answers all the questions you will ever think about to manage your curls.
B00130UFY2|1.0|I love The Bourne Sieries.....Rate them a 5  Buy the DVD  Do not watch it via Amazon.<br />Video on Amazon stops and starts unexpectedly.  Worse than commercials
B004HU6YZ4|4.0|Great complex sound and lyrics with the sound you have come to expect from Social Distortion.  First album by them I can share with the next generation.
B000Q79HTC|1.0|Boure Identity - rate it a 5.  Great movie.<br />Watching it on Amazon is the worst experience I have ever had. Having friends over to wnjoy a movie only to have it stop and<br />start over and over again is awful.  The starting and stopping is unexpected and lasts sometime for hours.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Negatives: This is by far the worst Les Miserables I've ever seen.  The singing was terrible and the best singers had the smallest parts.  They cut short all my favorite songs, and also cut many important parts of the character development, making the main character feel more like a side character.<br /><br />The worst was the inspector.  He had one emotion and could not sing!  They had all this money and could have chosen from a plethora of actors and they choose the worst singers, and didn't optimize their background.  Instead they did many close-up shots of the singers and try to erase the background.  They cut short all my favorite songs, and extended all the songs I don't like.<br /><br />Its very hard to see any story being told, and jumps around a lot.  They sing 99% of every line in this film...even lines that would have been better said than sung.  (example: Hugh Jackman reads a letter, and sings it, instead of reads it.  It sounds very choppy.)<br /><br />I also didn't like how they spend close to 20 minus minutes on Jean Valjean's beginning and then spend 35 plus minutes on the whores and the suffering of Fantine.<br /><br />I have not been this disappointed in a movie since Avatar the last Air bender, and transformers.  The 10th and 25th anniversary versions of this musical are still the best versions.  Heck even the Lord of rings/les miserables on youtube is better than this.<br /><br />Positives: I like Hugh Jackman, and he had some good songs, but his voice was beginning to crack after half way through the movie. There was one added on song that I liked.  It's during the scene were Hugh Jackman is in the carriage and has Cosette on his lap and is singing about how he feels for her.  I liked that song, but not the other songs added in.<br /><br /> I don't like Ann Hathaway, but she did a pretty good job singing.<br /><br />I also liked how they showed Jean Valjean escaping the inspector with the little girl.  That scene was done very well.<br /><br />Parents be warned:  Kids get killed in this movie, and man's back is seen and heard being broken, and it's laden with sex.<br /><br />That's all I have to say about it.
B0086700CM|4.0|But gets a little old after awhile, because it is just running that gets faster and more complicated.  Need something to look forward to.  Would be fun to have some slowed down levels where you could search for treasure, or maps, or something
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Great movie to watch for Christmas.  My family is way to much like the Griswolds. Blu ray is always great.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Game is very fun but I would prefer that I didn't have an ad before every game. Because it was free I can't complain too much.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|Got it as a gift. Have no complaints.  Great movie but since it was a gift I can not comment on actual disc / movie quality.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love all of these diary of a wimpy kid books!!! But this one was by far the best. I read it in two days!!!! Love it!! <3333
B002MQYOFW|5.0|couldn't put this book down, on the edge of my seat just like i was for the movie!!!! finished it in 3 days
068817776X|5.0|A triumph of human spirit and determination to survive.  The narrative, matter of fact style reminded me of my mother's recounting of what she experienced in occupied Estonia during WW2.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Very easy to read.  Foer digs into some of the memory techniques like the Memory Palace and the PAO system for memorizing cards.  And if you're a fan of Outliers, he gets into some of the mechanics of what expertise is and how it is developed.  Fascinating.  One of my favorite things about the book is the mentor relationship between with Josh and Ed - it's very entertaining.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I got this book on my kindle. Loved it becuse I could read this book at work without everyone knowing what I was reading. I love the kindle option for books.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I purchased the Rayovac 300lm (SE3DLN) lanterns last year, and I think they're great. But the Lighting EVER was cheaper, so I thought I'd give it a try, despite one reviewer indicating they weren't as bright. I'm glad I did because, IMO, it's every bit as bright as the Rayovac, and just as sturdily made. One tiny difference is that the 100% setting is the first switch setting on the Rayovac, while on the Lighting EVER it is the second. And yes, the Lighting EVER lantern employs one larger LED to the Rayovac's 3 smaller LEDs. But sitting side-by-side, both at their 100% power setting, the only noticeable difference is the diffraction pattern, not the intensity of the light. I think the Rayovac is a fine lantern, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. But I think the Lighting EVER lantern is just as good -- and somewhat less expensive.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I got this book on my kindle. Loved it becuse I could read this book at work without everyone knowing what I was reading. I love the kindle option for books.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was excellent,and it talked about teenage love and a very,very,very weird life of a teenager. What I am trying to say is that it was funny and exciting.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got this book on my kindle. Loved it becuse I could read this book at work without everyone knowing what I was reading. I love the kindle option for books.
B008JFLWLE|2.0|I had seen this app before I downloaded it on another person's Kindle. I thought it looked cool, with the fact that you draw what you want in the calculator and it automatically has it and scribble out what you want to delete, and add that to the fact that I was looking for an app like this already, I got it immediately. However, after about the first 30 seconds that I was using it, it became clear to me just how frustrating it is. It has a maximum amount of numbers that you can have in an equation at one time, sometimes doesn't even insert the number/ symbol that you write, and around 75 percent of the time, when you try to scribble something out, it interprets the scribble as a number. All in all, I suggest that you choose a different calculator app unless you are looking for a bad experience.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|This movie is stupid, however I could see how many could find it entertaining if you are a fan of really dry stupid humor.  I could also imagine the movie could be funny if you are really drunk or under the influence of some other drug, but overall just stupid and hard to watch. I would recommend watching the movie by renting it to save yourself the waste of money to buy it or better yet avoid it all together
B005DOKIYG|5.0|THIS COVER DOES WHAT IT WAS MADE TO DO.COVERS THE KINDLE FIRE AND KEEPS IT SAFE. AMAZON IS THE GREATEST,FAST SHIP ,GREAT TRANSACTION.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING A THIS COVER FOR YOUR KINDLE SO IT IS SAFE.
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|I went into this movie with low expectations but surprisingly enjoyed it. It is a little slow in spots, but picks up at the end. The acting was mostly good. I was very impressed with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, not as much with the love interest. Both people I watched with very impressed. I doubt many kids would be interested in the movie. I would recommend it to people looking for an enjoyable way to spend an evening.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|a collectors item for sure...not to mention the video of the concert.<br />bought as gift for my son...he was fortunate enough to see Michael live during the Bad tour.<br />so this was a bit of nostalgia
B004J64QSI|5.0|More complete than the 10 year although some of the voices not as strong.  Brings back memories of when I saw this in London 22 years ago.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is fun to play.  My only problem is not knowing which of the flower tiles can be used together.  Would be nice if it had instructions.
0761163808|5.0|I bought this as part of my grandson's Christmas gifts and the adults ended up looking through it!  I also bought &#34;Swing&#34; and that was equally fun.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I have never been very good at Pac-Man because it is a difficult game for some people.  Hard to make the man turn the corners.
0151003084|5.0|The book arrived promptly and intact. I loved it!  The &#34;tinies&#34; are among my favorite Gorey characters. This book shows my favorite illustrator at his  very best!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This weather app actually works.  Easy to change to different locations.  The only thing I would like would be hourly forecasts.
B00846REIS|3.0|I liked the book enough to finish it, but it was too much of the same. The same phrases the same sex scenes....it needed a bit more substance. I'm hoping the next one will provide that.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I wish these games would have some kind of instructions with them.  They are sometimes difficult to figure out how to play.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|The Bourne Legacy is a good action flick with a frighteningly realistic, yet cynical view of the power brokers who actually run this country.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This contains a lot of valuable information, much of which would probably not be known by the general public, and to watch it is to learn a lot.  Become a vegetarian or be very aware of the products you buy, if you don't want to die from something strange.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My granddaughters are absorbed into coloring the pages in this book.<br />They like the variety of coloring pages too.<br />Gramma
B006O2QNOU|5.0|This is a great film if you are someone who can appreciate and follow a recreation of the financial meltdown of 2008.  Thought the story was intense and kept my interest going, without getting too drawn out and dry.  Thought it was good, if you like a docudrama type film.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game for challenging your brain.Loads of games included for free. I could play this game for hours at a time!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Right from the start, the 11th Doctor became attached to three of his best-loved Companions, Amy, Rory, and River Song, (who was actually introduced to us earlier) collectively known as the Ponds.  I can't say too much without give away the story, but these are very satisfactory adventures and worth owning.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Loved this story. Based on a true story. I'm sure the producers/director took licence with the amount of death and violence, but great just the same.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was spellbinding.  It is a fast read.  I could not put it down.  I would recommend to anyone.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Saw this film as teenager although i had no understanding of the political aspects of the film i still found it to be thrilling<br />and did not mind the nearly four hour run time. The restored blu-ray might look even better than original. How timely<br />this fifty year old film remains. David Lean was brilliant as the movie informs as well as entertains
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love the Series.  It's good to have the DVD so we can watch it over and over.  Can't wait for Season 3.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Of the three this is my least favorite. It was an entertaining trilogy though. I don't know what I expected from the ending, but that wasn't it.
0545265355|5.0|I have yet to finish reading all the books but I love this set. The box is a strong cardboard and the books are hardcovers. The jackets are cool but I love the books with out them! Each one has a embossed bird that goes with the bird on the jacket. Its a great deal for all three and you will have them for a long time. This would be a great set for anyone wanting to read the books.
B000002O4S|2.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's been one of my favorites ever since I first saw it as a kid.  The film's score by Alan Silvestri--especially the main theme, as well as the killer songs sprinkled throughout REALLY help to sell the wonderful fantasy that this movie is.  The soundtrack, however, is extremely disappointing.  To echo what at least one reviewer mentioned, &#34;Mister Sandman&#34; is missing.  It's one of the catchiest songs from the film, yet it's not included?  The version of &#34;Earth Angel&#34; that Marty McFly plays with the Starlighters is missing the catchy guitar strum from the film (a big part of what made it so enjoyable to me), and the Marty and the Starlighters version of &#34;Johnny B. Goode&#34; is awesome....though it's missing the crazy guitar antics from the film.  From a general listening perspective, I can understand why that is, though fans should know that up front.  The CD also features several songs that I don't even recall hearing in the film (which I could have easily missed).  The Huey Lewis and The News songs are classic 80's goodness, and the orchestra themes are excellent...I just wish they would have put a little more of Alan Silvestri's score on it.<br /><br />All in all, there's some great tunes on here, but I found the entire soundtrack to be incredibly disappointing.  Unless you're an absolute DIE-HARD BttF fan, I'd buy the Huey Lewis songs individually and spend the rest of my money elsewhere.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game. Don't really care for the ads though. I usually play this while my husband is watching one of  his shows.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is definitely five stars! The descriptions of places, events, and people is awesome! You can actually picture the settings. This book would be good for anyone with a sense of adventure and imagination. I highly recommend it!
B007STBUHI|5.0|Always wanted to see the cut footage. Can't wait to check this out and see it. Everyone in the water!!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This movie is so funny and Tom Cruise's performance is over the top!  Julie ann Hough and the male lead are just delicious as the young and in love couple torn apart by a misunderstanding.  Catherine Zeta Jones is amazing as the anti-rock right wing mania.  You can't escape the feeling that Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin are having a riotous good time in their roles.  A very fun movie
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Best I have found so far.<br />Easy to use and great sound qulity.<br />Worth getting this Pro to help support the creator
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Lots of talent in this movie and it is used wisely.  Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow are amazing.  Rebel Wilson is hilarious and I sincerely hope to see her in other vehicles.  The plot is simplistic but fun--the music in the story makes it work.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Decided I better see what all of the hype over the hunger games was about. Glad I read it even if fantasy is not my favorite genre
B0063IH60K|4.0|easy play, good option selection. ad pops up every redeal, sometimes 2 in a row. should have option to buyout ads
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really like how the author built the characters and chemistry. However, I do not think that she needed over half the book to do it. I was beginning to think that the book had no plot. Finally the last half pulled through. It would have been great if she spread out the last half earlier on. There were certain key points in the first portion that really made the book, I like how everything comes together like a puzzle in the end.<br /><br />First half of the book (%55) was long and drawn out. I give it 3 stars.<br />Last half of the book was excellent! I give it 5 stars.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love Bruno Mars so this CD added to my collection of great music. Nice to listen to with good music
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|SO SWEET! A GREAT BOOK WITH ALL THE FUN YOU CAN TAKE PACT IN ONE BOOK. THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I really liked Phillip on Idols and was happy to buy his CD to support him. Nice music to listen to
B00846F1YW|2.0|Don't like the glass puzzle...can't solve it not a very good design tried 4 times and can't solve it help
B009KHCT94|5.0|Everything in the movie had hidden bits of humor and it was hilarious. Best Finnish film I've ever seen! Recommended.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Patti lived a weirdly charmed life, and grew up in very interesting times. She is a very poetic writer, and her prose was bittersweet and engaging...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Dealt with tragedy but was strangely uplifting.  Loved the characters & the way their story was related.  Couldn't put it down.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I couldn't wait so I watched it and then watched it again the next day with the family. I loved it both times. The set up for the Alien movie was good allowing for its evolution.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|Loaded onto a Kindle Fire(not HD). The main graphic on the description page looks pretty lame. The name of the game reinforces a negative image. One reviewer was clearly unimpressed by the game's graphic quality.  I expected this freebie would be quickly removed from device.  Instead, it's 1:00am, and the current level stumps my waning focus.<br /><br />PROS: Clean graphics, easy to understand, easy to play, definitely challenging<br /><br />CONS: The object of the game is to direct mice through a maze, to a spaceship, while avoiding cats.  The characters move pretty fast and some solutions require precise, complex interleaving and timing.  As such, the TATA* solution method creeps in.<br /><br />The gameplay was, in my experience, very unique. Even the guesses require sound logic to quickly find a solution. I felt an odd satisfaction when solving a level, quite unlike other games/puzzles. I think this may come from the order you get to force upon chaos.<br /><br />* Try and Try Again
B009MO57H6|5.0|Great action, the beginning was awesome, it picked up right from the end of the previous. I wasn't sure where they would go with the movie but I wasn't disappointed. I was thrown off by some of the enemy but the bonus material explained what they were doing and it worked.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|whatthe heck it sucks piece of crap. this game sucks like the title. piece of s*** five dollars really it sucks what a ripple off
B00A7CI82I|5.0|A little confusing at first due to the parallels with the other Bourne movie but it soon became clear and the bonus material explained well.  Great action & acting.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|If you don't just love Nanny McPhee you are considered a very old, grumpy person.  Purchased it for my Grandkids, but watch it myself, when I have a minute and want to smile.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I had read all of the books and enjoyed the parallels. I don't remember all of the details from the books but it was a very entertaining movie with great effects.  I liked how they portrayed the Tharks.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Purchased it for my young granddaughter for a Christmas gift, but love watching it myself.  Who could not love the Beast??
B0001I55SS|4.0|While it is not Disney's best, it was entertaining and had very good special effects. Good story but may be a little much for young kids with the deaths and such.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|my son plays this game all day he loves it. His Nabi goes dead before he is done playing and we have to recharge.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I've watched all seasons and they just keep on going strong. I wait to watch the DVDs so I can watch them all together, I can't stand the suspense from episode to episode otherwise. Now I just have to wait for the next season!
B0098WWEH8|5.0|I liked it- it is good! Good vibes! Enjoyed the mellow spirit of this album especially during this time of holiday madness.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I found it very entertaining, a new concept to me, Abe fighting vampires. Good effects and action, loved the end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I must admit I was skeptical when I began the Bared to You-Crossfire Series, mainly due to being a die hard FSOG fan.  I did feel the first novel was loosely based off of Christian and Ana's characters. Even so much as to have both male characters with biblical names-Christian and Gideon and the female one syllable names-Ana and Eva.  Once I got past comparing so much of the book, I was able to see the first and the second book for what it was. A love story that demonstrated unconditional love in so many ways. I loved Reflected in You! It was \\"yar\\" for you 50 fans!! ;) I wish I didn't have to wait for Entwined in You, but the wait is great and something for me to look forward to. Purchase the book, I'm positive you won't regret it (unless you are looking for reasons not to like) its an easy read, and<br />keeps you wanting more of Mr. Dark and Dangerous and Eva!!!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Great acting (Leo, Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson and even Jamie Foxx), writing, directing, music and often funny as hell. This may be my favorite QT flick. Maybe a little long and full of massive violence, but this is a must see if you are a fan of the video store clerk turned famous movie director. Just about everything works and this will be a buy for me on Blu-ray.
0812979702|5.0|This book was quite helpful as I have always struggled with the mind side of this game, and may still but I have more knowledge to better cope.
B001DUGOWY|4.0|Wonderful story!  In being written by John Steinbeck, it would have to be.  Criticism:  too much detail; on and on about one particular thing; very distracting
B0092G1O8A|1.0|This DVD didn't work. The first 25-30 minutes of the movie was fine, but then the DVD started skipping horribly and wouldn't stop. I tried another DVD in the player to ensure it was working properly, which it was. I will be returning this ASAP.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|I was looking for an app and came across this free one and gave it a shot. seems to work very well and was a snap to set up and works perfectly. has a ton of different brands and models of printers so anyone should be able to find the make and model here. if you need or want to print from your tablet I recommend this one. works every time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this was a good fast paced read.  Kept me interested right up to the last page. I enjoyed it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is fun and cool playing with super cute pets<br />As a adult I enjoy this game.  Anyone any age can play and have fun.
0446563048|5.0|This book is very interesting, I think anyone who is interested in business should read it. I'd also like to mention the quality of product, which was supposed to be Very Good, looks absolutely brand new. I'd like to thank the company that sold it to me.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|pretty Lame, too much swearing and could of got the same effect with less swearing, I don't recommend this to anyone.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|Tripod mishap sacrificed previous HB-32, but saved my expensive glass! These hoods serve a greater purpose than just shielding out glare!  Found the original and got it fast from Amazon!!  Get yours!!
B008ASLK8A|3.0|I was a bit bummed about this movie. Not one of Robert Downey Jrs. best roles that he has played.
0756697875|5.0|It made the perfect gift for christmas. All the local stores were sold out but it was the same as in the store but a better price
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I like this movie and it shows how &#34;K&#34; got his start in the company and see how he acted as a young agent.
B004ZWKWQQ|4.0|THE PART MY GRANDSON DISLIKED IS THE BAGS WERE NOT NUMBERED IN ORDER. THEY SORTED EVERYTHING AND THEN WORKED BY THE COLOR. FIRST TIME HE EVER GOT ANY LEGO WHERE IT WASN'T NUMBERED.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|This is a must have for your horror collection!  Re-Animator should be a staple in anyone's horror film collection since it truly is one of the best horror movies of all time.  Not just of the 80's, but OF ALL TIME!  Seeing it in blu-ray quality will make long time fans swoon as well as the many bonus features available.  Between the interviews, commentary, deleted, and extended scenes this really is a treat for any horror fan.  If you haven't thanked Stuart Gordon and Image Entertainment YOU SHOULD!
B00000JXVK|4.0|We saw this many years ago, pretty cool to see how much the mainstream focus  of riding has shifted to mx. When was the last time you saw a dirt flat track motorcycle race on tv?
1419705849|4.0|My son was happy that I bought this book for him. It took him just two days to read. I was glad that he read something while on school break.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the movie too, great, (but mostly not well known at the time), cast, good story lines, and mostly clean language so your kids can watch, some shooting things up are great!
B00263HWM8|4.0|Love this movie. Third installment is still my favorite though (hence four out of five stars). Good quality picture and sound.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Poop<br />It's a dictionary it's about as good as a dictionary is gonna get an f2f plus its extremely hard to find stuff
B00632HWOG|1.0|hate new setup. very difficult.  I want the old Yahoo mail back. can't find where everything is and mail<br />contacts are not listed.
B001JP5JRY|5.0|AWESOME it was a very fun book to read and I would  definitely recommend The Bro Code to other people.
0545265355|5.0|Got these for my grandson,for Christmas. He loved getting them. He says they are really good books. A big hit for most readers.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose this rating because I read it and tells a lot about middle school also because it contributes to the rest.of the books
B0000549B0|5.0|Harvey is soooo funny and Jimmy Stewart is great in it. Good story line and good movie to own. Love it!
B000NOK06W|5.0|Great to have so many of his themes in one set.  His range is wonderful and I like to have so many choices.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I did not like this game at all.  I guess I couldnt figure it out and did not hold my interest at all.
0865479410|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying Burkeman's style and good sense; ordered Help from the UK because I thought it would be fun and thoughtful too.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I love angry birds and now know the true meaning of the game.  I added Star Wars version and its the same concept with different scenes.  I like it just as much.
8866131350|5.0|What can I say, I still use pen or pencil, so my paper pdf is a joy to use and buy every year.
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|Got this for my grandkids for the holidays.  They seem to like it okay but its not a favorite of mine.
0446580848|3.0|A tad disappointed.  The &#34;flipness&#34; dominates rather than the story line -- hadn't read the Leopard -- but so many references to it, not sure I need to now.
B009H442DG|5.0|Love both artist, love even more their singing as a duet. Recommend to all my friends, who enjoy listening to Christmas music. Hope Olivia and John do another album together. Christmas music or any other kind of music, I would buy it.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I cringed a little when I first heard about the elaborate upgrades planned for this project, but seeing the final product has eased my anxiety. While it is true that some of the enhancements step into the realm of what was not available at the time the show was originally produced, the improvements actually do contribute to a better enjoyment of the stories told, now to new generations.  The complete reproduction of the musical score in Dolby 7.1 starting with live musicians is a nice touch. It must have been a surrealistic feeling to hear that score live in the studio after 40 years of sub-par tv sound. And the best part of this set is the inclusion of the non-enhanced original episodes to keep the purists happy, and to allow new generations to get a feel for how far we have come.  Well done.
B008VDJFFY|5.0|This is the second book I have read by Colleen Hoover and I have already come to some sound conclusions.<br /><br />One. Be prepared to be shocked. It is always best going into her books with little knowledge of what is going to happen. The synopsis will give you an idea but you can be sure that there is always going to be plenty of twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />Two. Be prepared to laugh. She beautifully blends in laughter with real life subjects that aren't always laughable.<br /><br />Three. Be prepared to cry. We are not talking the tiny little tears, these are the healthy, giant, sobbing tears. You won't be upset that she has made you cry, strangely you will be silently thanking her as the tears are falling.<br /><br />Four. Be prepared to discover a new favorite author. I mean this in the most sincere way possible... Colleen Hoover, you rock!<br /><br />The irony is not lost me that I can't seem to find the words to express the emotions and feelings that I experienced while I was reading Slammed. Why is it ironic? Because this is a book about words. Words thrown together to express feelings through poetry... slam poetry. But really it is so much more than that. This is not your typical girl meets boy, girl and boy fall in love and the rest is history type of story. Yes there is a girl and a boy, yes they fall in love but that is not even the half of it.<br /><br />\\"Life happens. S*** happens. And it happens a lot. To a lot of people.\\"<br /><br />This story is about life. This story is about death. This story is about living. The good, the bad and the ugly of it all.<br /><br />\\"Three days ago, I was devastated, bitter, and hopeless. Today I woke up feeling happy for the first time in months.\\"<br /><br />Layken (Lake) is one of the strongest female characters I have ever read. She is strong, supportive, mature, stubborn, loyal... the list could go on and on. She finds herself torn from everything she knows in her life quite suddenly. Her father dies unexpectedly, her mother then moves her and her brother from Texas to Michigan. She doesn't want her new life but quickly she finds Will and everything changes.<br /><br />\\"And what's a slam?\\" I ask.<br />\\"It's poetry.\\" He smiles at me. \\"It's what I'm all about.\\"<br /><br />Will is also one of the strongest male characters I have read. Every characteristic I have given to Lake can be given to Will. What he has done with his life in order to care for and support his younger brother is awe-inspiring. To be responsible for another life at such a young age shows courage. He never whines or moans about it. There is never the 'woe is me' or 'what has happened to my life' speeches. He is simply amazing.<br /><br />To be honest there is not a character that is not written well and rounded out beautifully. You will end up caring and loving each and every one of them and you will care about what happens to them. Lake's brother Kel and Will's brother Caulder are adorable. They are so funny and I laughed so many times... I will only say this. The dead snowman. Could not have laughed more. Then we have Lake's new best friend Eddie. I think she is fantastic and could not love her more than I do already. oooOOOooohhh Eddie's boyfriend Gavin. *sigh* He is so sweet and the love he has for Eddie is apparent.<br /><br />So, back to point number one about a Colleen Hoover book. You do not want to know too much about it before you start so this is all you are getting out of me. I do not want to be the person that ruins this beautiful story for anybody who will be reading it. And I truly hope that person who will be reading it will be you if you haven't already. This story will touch you and stay with you for a long time after you have completed it.<br /><br />Now for me I am off to start book two, Point of Retreat. I have only just found out that it is actually told from Will's POV and I am so excited I could burst.<br /><br />\\"And if you've ever grown up with dreams in your head aboutlife, and how one of these days you would pirate your own ship and have your own crew and that all of the mermaids<br /><br />would love<br /><br />only you?<br /><br />Well, you would realize...<br /><br />Like I eventually realized...<br /><br />That all the good things about her?<br /><br />All the beautiful?<br /><br />It's not real.<br /><br />It's fake.<br /><br />So you keep your ocean,<br /><br />I'll take the Lake.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readslove    only you?    Well, you would realize...    Like I eventually realized...    That all the good things about her?    All the beautiful?    It's not real.    It's fake.    So you keep your ocean,    I'll take the Lake.\\"    Christine  Rainy Day Reads
B008MEM24S|4.0|The puzzles are fun, but they are not nearly as challenging as the counterparts in 'where's my water'.  Still, the game is fun...runs well...and has no bizarre permissions.  Solid 4 stars...worth the $0.99.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|WARNING: Minor spoiler alert!<br />  After reading many of the reviews both negative and positive I was on the fence as to renting this movie now or waiting untill Amazon put it on sale (eventually happens with almost all movies). But was so intrigued by all the comments and an especially long thread started by 1 review I simply could not resist. Yes there are flaws in this movie, the biologist behaved like a teenage girl finding a kitten upon discovering an obviously hostile alien, the geologist probably got his degree from a struggling junior college or in prison, as for David the android he had his own somewhat twisted agenda. As for the other characters most played their roles well and were crewmen not scientists. There are other minor inconsistancies and any movie can be dissected ad-nausium if you want to put your mind in \\"attack\\" mode and seek out flaws. Overall I enjoyed this flic very much and am relieved that I did not feel I wasted $5. The special effects were truly fantastic, the story was well written though as indicated in my title flawed in some respects, but certainly not fatally flawed. The ending was a suprise and I will not give it away though in the original Alien movie the pilot of the alien ship was found in the pilots seat with injuries indicating an alien had sprung from his chest (I'm just saying its a bit of a headscratcher). Overall a good movie and given the opportunity too see it again for free somewhere in the future on Amazon Prime or Netflix  I probably would.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is so much fun. Definitely keeps my brain active! I can't seem to put it down! Worth the couple of bucks it cost.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is still a good, fun game to play.  I remember the arcade game and this one is just as good.
0756686970|5.0|Another book about legos that my son loves!  If it gets him using his imagination AND reading at the same time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the action. Love the plot. Science fiction  is one of my favorite kind of reads. Recommend it to everyone
075669812X|5.0|My son likes Ninjago and having the characters in the book and details on the parts and pieces make the lego sets that much more interesting.  Sometimes the parts are so small it is hard to tell what they are and now he gets the most out of his imagination when playing with these.  It is an added bonus that he is reading too!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love that I can look  up more than one location.  Easy to use!!  Nice to keep track of family's weather around the world!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Pros: Fun to build your city.  The graphics are fair to good.  I like the direction it gives you on goals so I know what needs to happen next.  Fulfilling the goals gives me a little satisfaction.  I didn't have to pay for it.  I like the helicopter that puts out the fires...too funny that this city has a building on fire almost constantly.<br /><br />Cons: I HATE the constant reminders to post to Facebook/Twitter.  I don't care to use this for social media and I don't play games on Facebook because it annoys me when others post this crap to my Facebook feed.  It is near impossible to complete some of the goals without more in app purchases.  There are not enough opportunities to accumulate the necessary points/credits to build projects and purchase more land for new buildings.  I have 10 million dollars and I can't buy land because I don't have enough of the other credits required (could easily be solved by PAYING real money to buy more with the in app purchase)!  The top and sides of the screen are cluttered with items that should be in an option menu or at least be able to hide these for game play.  These icons block the pop ups from the buildings in that area when I need to upgrade or determine what building it is.<br /><br />Normally, I love the G5 games.  They are well made with very few glitches.  I would give this a 5* if they would get rid of forcing the social media and make it possible to acquire MORE points to build with each goal completed.  I would actually PAY for a game that did what this one does with better ways to acquire credits and stop the social media barrage.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I don't often read teen books, but enjoyed this one and will probably read the next one. Good characters and plot.
B007V5CF5K|2.0|was really enjoying this until all the glitches started.  every few minutes it freezes and kicks back to restarting.  also, i too have become stuck at the clock part.  no solutions i have found online work, even tried restarting from the beginning but had the same result.  will have to delete since i will not be able to move any further in the game.  playing on kindle hd fire.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|it works better than i thought it would simple direct design and well built i recommend this sharpener for your knife

1451695195|4.0|i have yet to finish reading it but i like it so far. it is simple and descriptive and i recommend you give this book a read
B0076DELIG|5.0|The storylines get better with each book. Every time I read a new book, I learn more about Harry. Can't wait for the next one!!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Haven't been able to download! each time I select Amazon apps Appstore I get The application Apstore (process.com.amazon.zenezia) has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again. I've tried powering down my tablet and nothing works.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved the way this book kept me on the edge of my seat and i felt emotionally attached to the characters!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Great book. Opens up a completely different paradigm of living and can contribute to better understanding of life without any judgements
1591795230|4.0|Personally I really enjoyed this audio book. It gave me several wonderful insights. Brian Lipton does take his analogy of receptors being perception to a greater depth than I would. It helps if the listener / reader has some biological science background to fully appreciate it.
0805028846|2.0|The information in this book is like speaking another language-- you better be prepared to put in the time and energy to understand it and you still might fall on your face. Oh my goodness, this book hurt my head because it is completely foreign to anything I have ever done in card making. However, it did expand my knowledge and skills but I am still at a very low level as far as production; I have only mastered about half the book and I’ve had it for a while. Be prepared to use a lot of scrap paper in learning; my house is covered in lots of tiny folded pieces of paper and I’m eating more and more Chinese food these days ;) (this folding stuff is an Asian thing for sure, their brains just work this way!)
B008N1V11U|3.0|The controlls are glitchy there is no free roam and the spiderman app is better. to me just because there is an free roam
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book A little sad but very entertaining and realistic  if on all little girls like this got out early as well .
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book and funny .Great job Jeff Kinney<br />You always make me laugh :) Michael Guerin !!!!<br />_call me at 508 _350_0236
1609611543|5.0|Its amazing about all the stuff you shouldn't be eating. A must read for anyone who wants to loose weight.
B004QBWU02|5.0|Loved that movie since it first came out.  Only had a VHS version, so wanted the DVD.  It's one of my favorites
B009MF56GC|4.0|love, like first one lot of action, good actors in it, lots of actions, over all good flix, like it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well done. Totally consuming! The storyline never dulls and keeps your interests peeked. I will definitively be checking her other titles.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|I purchased this album in an effort to satiate my Elliott-withdrawals. A worthy purchase. I want to listen to every song on this set over and over again. I highly recommend this to Elliott Smith fans!
B000002UTY|4.0|I have been getting into some of the early bands I listened to and this is such a great album.I probably haven't listened to it in 30 years. Don't get me wrong I didn't turn into one of those classic commercial rock, and bad commercial rock.And I been listening to some fairly recent bands that have embraced psychedelia and got me to go back and revisit some of the early music I listened to and I always loved.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story line continued for the two main characters, but wow what exciting twists to the lives of they lead!
0812982622|2.0|the first half is a compelling read. In the second half I found the caricatures a little too Pavlovian, not merely telling me more about American sentimental self-perceptions than anything about Korea - North or South, real or imagined -  but demanding I respond on cue. It's simply too one-dimensional,and is itself a form of regime propaganda for US ideology, much in the same way that the Kite Runner was transformed into a manipulative exercise in US war propaganda . Yes, North Korea is a bizarre dystopia. But I don't think Adam Johnson has or will ever have access to the self-understanding of either the people or the elites, so I think I will wait for someone who does. [To compare and contrast: try an example of how an American successfully enterred into the mindset of his ideological opponents - Chuck Pfarrer's thriller 'Killing Che']<br /><br />Still if there's nothing better to read, then give it a try and judge for yourself - as a page turner- thriller of the beach/airport variety it's ok.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book not only has a great story line, it also excites your libido. The details about the interludes these two have puts you right into the scene! I loved it!
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game my kids have a ball playing this.. Was very easy to download on amazon and works very well!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story line still keeps you captivated, and the twists still kept changing. It kept me on the edge of my seat!
B002OQT928|5.0|i gave this a high rating because its so funny & cute and my grandchildren & i enjoy watching it..i would recommend Amazon for your purchases because their prices a very good and the items or dilvered in a good timely manner.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I recommend this game to all my friends.  Especially the younger ones.  Requires a lot of time with the dragons
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is an absolute joy to play. It is well worth the two dollars. This is by far my favorite app!<br /><br />pros<br />great classic looking arcade graphics<br />good storyline<br />the penalty for dying isn't too harsh or too leniant if you're looking for high scores<br /><br />cons<br />I haven't found any yet
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so addicting!! And I absolutely can not wait to read the other two!! The outcome of the story is killing me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical to jump on the hunger games bandwagon because I tried to jump on the twilight one and it backfired (not a fan), however this book is amazing!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Wish I could get Season 2 on amazon instant video!  Great show!  I will definitely be looking for the second season.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Much has been said about the plot holes and logic jumps in the last installment of The Dark Knight saga but I can't help but get caught up in some very good moments in this film. Bale's Batman showed us a deep and tortured soul. Hathaway was by far the best Catwoman ever. And the torch has been passed on, hopefully so we can get a Justice League movie at somepoint.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie, all the important superhero elements are here.  The fight against good and evil.  The team collapsing, and coming back together, the triumph!  Oh and it's very funny at times too!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Easy way to take notes on things and keep them organized. I also like that I can use the keyboard or actually write it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is such a wonderful show that I will enjoy watching for many years.  The cast of characters couldn't have been better picked.  Can't wait for the new season to start.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this a great game the campaign isnt anything new but the multiplayer is completly outstanding the gun cutomization is amazing this game is worth the $6.99 I definitely recomemd it
B002SSUQFG|4.0|For the past few months, my husband has been searching for the ideal automatic watch--one that doesn't require even occasional self-winding. This Seiko (my second attempt at finding him the perfect watch) is a definite winner. He likes the size, the styling, the weight, the attention to detail and, above all, the fact that it's a true automatic watch. As advertised. He hasn't had to wind it once since Christmas morning. And as the gift-giver, I appreciate the fact that it was a remarkable bargain.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really good book. I read it in 2 days.  I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Fantastic album - it really reminds me of the earlier albums (Love Gun, Rock And Roll Over). And, no rapping. +1 star right there.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Do not waste your time on this one.  Very weak sequel.  Weak, weak, weak. Worst of all the Resident Evil's.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Loved that we own all the Harry Potter movies in one collection now. And, the price was excellent! Can't wait to start our marathon!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I was told by others that this Movie would have me LMAO but it was LOL funny. There are also a lot of racial slurs so if you're sensitive to that then this will not be funny.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|We saw this movie in the theaters and knew we had to have it in our collection. We already owned the first two, so this completes it.
B001706I5I|4.0|I grew up watching the original cartoon so it took while for this to grow on me but it has and now I appreciate it for what it is.  A nice Christmas movie that has become part of our Christmas time standard.
B00797MB0O|4.0|This movie brings to life a story that many 30 somethings live. Charlize plays her role very well as a delusional ex popular girl who realizes that she can no longer have everything she wants. There should have been a bit more drama or conflict between the characters but overall very well played by all actors.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Usually, I have trouble reading and staying focused. But, this was truly a pleasure to read. This book drew me in from the start. It's a book that is as unpredictable as it is wonderful. I saw the movie first but it just enhanced the book for me.
145210655X|5.0|A fun gift to give. It was well received and a whole room of people had a good laugh at some of the parts that were shared.
B005NNVPOO|5.0|Discovered that I didn't have this in my collection and it wasn't available on Spotify. Price was right so I went for it though I usually don't buy much in this era of streaming.
1452110581|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a cat lover but must confess that i read part of it before I wrapped it. I did laugh out loud.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|It is so refreshing to learn about successful stories!  I'm looking forward to seeing where Temple is in her life now and how her designs are working.
0761169431|4.0|I have a relative that is an origami expert and a star wars fan too so this made a fun addition to her christmas gift. She loved it
B005OCFGTO|5.0|great family fun viewing for the whole family, even my young boys who are in grades first and third grade.
0618154043|5.0|The person who received this book was very pleased with it. He was missing it from his collection and he said the liked the cover art too.
B009VB97EY|1.0|OMG this movie started pretty good a bit of class then it was like someone got an amateur crew and just whisked something together . The film lost anything professional about it, no plot, acting sucked, camera and cut was awful. I don't know how anyone could like this movie. The ending wasn't an ending ha-ha. We forwarded to the end because we rented it and wanted to see if they could make it any worse. They did. Don't see it not worth it at all.Personally I think they all went on a bender and just didn't give a hoot.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Not much to say but that it's good and. Looks pretty to those of us who care about that stuff.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|one of my favs.  definetly give it a try. if you like samurai or zombies its awesome. if they make a sequel I will get
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Seen the preview for the movie. My sis told me it was a book, so of course I had to read it. Loved it definitely has some good twist in the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished Wool Omnibus in a frenzy of reading that took place in just three nights. I was intrigued almost immediately, but when I reached the end of book 1 I just sat there stunned. I've never been so happy that I could just \\"turn\\" the page and keep reading to find out what happened next. Just logging onto Amazon and buying Wool 2 with One-click would have taken too long!<br /><br />I was fascinated by the world Hugh Howey created and the mystery of how it came to be and what would happen within the walls of the silo. Every time I thought I had a sense of where the plot was going I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong.<br /><br />I knew ahead of time that Wool 1 was written as a stand alone short story and at first there were no plans to write more. I loved book 1 and thought it was great but I'm so glad he continued the story. Now I hear the movie rights have been bought and that Ridley Scott might direct. Not sure how much truth there is to this but this book is right up Ridley Scott's alley!
B006LSZECO|5.0|How refreshing! I know that's a weird way to start off discussing a book with such a dark storyline, but it is always refreshing to read a book that truly catches me off guard in a good way. Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn does just that.<br /><br />This is a story about a man named Nick (a not-so-perfect husband) whose wife, Amy, goes missing. The media (and everyone else) is infatuated with the story because Nick and Amy are both great looking New Yorkers who moved to Nick's hometown in Missouri to take care of his dying mother and elderly father. Amy, for her part, is the inspiration for a three-decade popular book series named Amazing Amy that an entire generation grew up with. Like their story, this book is something that you latch onto and take off running with once you catch a whiff of the the first few pages.<br /><br />Of course, all signs point to Nick (it's on the jacket, so I can say that), and the book fluctuates from his narration to that of Amy's. Sounds predictable, right? Right. But then comes Part Two. Now, I won't go into any details here, but I will say, WHOA! I really thought I had it all figured out. I'm usually pretty adept at unravelling a story about halfway through (I'm not sure whether that means I'm great with clues or that the authors are not...) but I was completely wrong. Even the bits that I had predicted correctly didn't play out the way that I had expected.<br /><br />This book is full of twists and turns that you can actually follow and doesn't leave any loose ends, which is becoming harder and harder to find in a book nowadays. So many books in recent years leave wide open gaps where a storyline should be and it was refreshing (like I said, it was an appropriate word). I don't generally give star ratings because I think people, for the most part, ignore them, but this one deserves 5!
0316223239|4.0|I listened to Room by Emma Donoghue on Audiobook. 9 disks from Hachette Audio. Read by  Michal Friedman, Ellen Archer, Suzanne Toren, and Robert Petkoff. Then I also took out the hardcover to make sure I didn't miss anything - I didn't.<br /><br />I read this book as a suggestion by a book club. I didn't know much about it, except that \\"it's about a child who grew up in one room.\\", well that doesn't say much. So, I pretty much went in blind.<br /><br />At the start of the book, it was devastatingly sad. Heartachingly sad. So unbelievably sad. Is there a strong word then SAD? Because I need it! Everything that this poor little boy does not know in the world and all he has to suffer through. Part of the reason it's SOOO AWFUL is because he doesn't REALIZE just how AWFUL it is!<br /><br />Slightly less then half of the book is the mom, \\"Ma\\", and her son \\"Jack\\" being stuck in a 11' by 11' garden shed, transformed into a prison with no escape, no windows. They're \\"lucky\\" to have electricity, heat, skylight, and a TV. But they're completely disconnected from the outside world by \\"Old Nick\\" who kidnapped \\"ma\\" 7 years prior, to use as his sex slave in this room. Their only connection to the outside is Old Nick, who brings groceries, takes out the trash and gives them \\"sunday treat\\" (when they need extra things). But they have NO HUMAN interaction with the outside world. And in fact, Jack doesn't even know there is an outside, until he turns 5, and Ma concocts a plan to help them escape.<br /><br />For a 5 year old, Jack is pretty smart. And Ma, despite having to give birth to and raise this baby on her own, does a pretty good job of having things for them to do and learn. But still, this disconnection is killing her. She can't even see a dentist or run ,or anything.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT FROM THIS POINT ON**<br />The second half of the book is what happens after their escape. You see the stark contrast of life in this tiny room to the BIG OUTSIDE WORLD. You see Jack trying to get used to seeing \\"all these persons in REAL LIFE\\". Stuff that we encounter every day, like stairs, are troublesome for the youngster. So many things that we do every day - open doors, toilets, and walking outside in the rain, are strange, new and sometimes scary to little Jack.<br /><br />You also see the crazy media hype that surrounds their Return to Civilization, and of course Ma's return to her own family. She said at one point, as she apologized to Jack, that She's trying to not only teach him the WORLD, but she's also trying to learn who she WAS before she was kidnapped.<br /><br />The writing in this book is Great. Really good story telling. Jack's voice (Michal) and Ma's voice (Ellen) were PERFECT, spot ON. I couldn't have imagined them any better if I could choose the narrators myself! I liked that they used several people in the story to read it - good move! Also, i did notice that in the beginning Jack's voice was a bit high pitched for a child, almost doll-like, but at the end of the story it lowered a little bit. He was still 5 years old, but there was more of an adult tone on there. Don't know if that was done intentionally.<br /><br />I loved the grandparents and how ODD it must be to \\"have their little girl back\\" after all this time, thinking she was dead. I am very happy that the author spent more than HALF of the book concentrating on what happens after they're free, thereby contrasting with their capture. I also love that they DID visit their old room after all! So good to have this circular sort of conclusion.<br /><br />So all in all the book was very well written. I can't say I \\"enjoyed\\" it because it was devastating to hear, but I was certainly worthwhile!!<br /><br />My only gripe with the book - the reason I didn't give it all 5 stars - is because the breastfeeding that Ma does despite Jack's age felt totally unbelievable. Everything was super believable - the room, the kidnap, Jack - except for the breastfeeding. She never did explain WHY she did this even to a 5 year old - perhaps so that she would not get pregnant again (I'm not certain about this fact), but the fact that it was NOT explained, no REASON is what added to it being unbelievable.<br /><br />Other then that, it's a really good story of survival and hope.<br /><br />I recommend it! Just be prepared to put your heart in a blender for this one!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|What an amazing book! Written by a journalist living in South Korea, it follows the lives of six North Korean defectors from childhood to present day. It weaves a story of loyalty, honor and personal conviction while tossing in some rebellion and acceptance. It's not a happy story and at parts can be hard to stomach (reality often is), but it is definitely worth reading.<br /><br />What I liked most about this book is that it tells the story from the point of view of the North Koreans, leaving out judgment, American politics and every preconceived notion one might have going into  the book. It is not a book designed to paint North Korea as anything but what the people involved believe it to be. The reality can be, at times, unnerving, but it is refreshing to read about North Korea without the brackets of international judgment around it.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I have really grown to enjoy all of Sanderson's novels and this is no exception. Very quick read and leaves you wanting more!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|One of the problems with reading mostly \\"literary fiction\\" is that I tend to miss out on some great books simply because they don't show up in my recommendations lists on various websites. Every December, I scour the \\"Top Books of 2012\\" lists and compile a list of top picks that catch my interest and try to play catch up. This year is no different, and so far I have added The Round House, The End of Your Life Book Club and The Fault In Our Stars (feel free to add your recommendations in the comments section below).<br /><br />Upon the recommendation of my sister, I opted to read The Fault In Our Stars by John Green first (apparently he is considered a \\"voice of our generation\\" and has a popular YouTube channel, but I didn't know that until this week). Now, I read a lot of good books, but I don't often stumble across one that captures my attention to the point that I forget about the outside world. This book did just that, and I highly recommend it. Narrated by a terminally ill teenage girl, it tells a poignant story of life, love and loss. It is written in a conversational tone, and the reader rides the ups and downs of cancer and normal teenage problems with the narrator. This book demonstrates a wide range of emotions and I laughed, cried and got mad right along with the main characters.<br /><br />I don't typically read, never mind like, young adult books, but this one was a rare exception. I can understand why it made every \\"Top Books\\" list and recommend it to both teens and adults. Thanks to my sister for vouching for it, because without her I would have skipped over it!<br /><br />For more reviews, visit [...]
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Very well written and super sweet, but a tad too fairy tae-ish for my tastes....no real reason these two shouldn't have fallen in love instantly...but a fun read nevertheless.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton is an intricately woven tale of long-hidden family secrets and the quest to uncover them. Told from the viewpoint of 3 different generations, it is an excellent way to disappear from the world and into the garden!<br /><br />-------------------------<br /><br />When I think of Kate Morton, the words \\"richly woven tale\\" come to mind. Her stories are so intricate and leave no stone unturned. But not in that overly-descriptive way that leaves nothing to the imagination (like White Oleander). Although there are a few hokey sentences like, \\"For to think was to dip the paint-loaded brush of doubt into the clear water of certainty\\", she manages to find a balance between giving you just enough information to create your own image but without being too vague.<br /><br />What I loved about this book (although it took a little time to get my bearings) is that it is told from 3 different perspectives, all of which are relevant. Usually when a story is told in this way it leaves huge empty gaps and either the story is not  fully wrapped up or it is explained in a rush at the end of the book (which for me, ruins the whole book). That was not the case with \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" and is one of the reasons that I love Kate Morton.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|As always, Michael Connelly turned out a quality read. In the last year I have read his entire back list and  enjoyed every one of them. Thanks to Kindle I carry around all his book entire collection and I will be adding to it every time he turns out a New story
B003V1WTMM|3.0|I can't decide if I'm pleased with or disappointed in this book, which is rough because I love Kate Morton. It's a story about a woman (about my age) who discovers Milderhurst Castle and the secrets within it, along with its ties to her own family. The story was great and I enjoyed reading it but I really didn't like the ending, which is probably why I don't know how I feel about this book.<br /><br />I liked the way the story moved forward (mostly fluidly) even though it was told from both the 1940's and currently. I also liked the characters. Despite her ongoing descriptions of all things physical and tendency to go a little long in places, I felt that some of the characters could have used a little more development (Saffy, in particular).
B007MDB548|5.0|It is great and exceeded our expectations.  I was really surprised to get the 3D Movie with the package as well.
B007C8MK2Y|5.0|This has to be his best CD.. Everyone needs to buy this..He has 5 great songs on here..I recommend this to all
0345803485|2.0|I have no idea what all of the fuss is about that makes this a best seller.  It is not well written and not<br />much of a story and why would one bother to take their time to read it?  I didn't finish it because I lost interest.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Very good especially the dogs.  Was glad that it did not contain bad language and violence.  Enjoyed the book and movie.
1419705849|5.0|If you enjoyed the previous Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, you will really enjoy this book says my 12 year old.  He certainly enjoyed it.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I really like most of the presentations , some have to little and then the link doesn't always work.frozen screen is not fun either.seems like the frequent updates mean they still working on it
B000035Z3K|5.0|Classic Dracula!!  Bela Lugosi is excellent as Count Dracula and is famous for this film.  It is true to the book
1452101248|4.0|This book is so gorgeous I could be happy even looking at the pages and not making the recipes. Although some recipes use ingrédients that are hard to find, you can always simplify and the result is brilliant. Great original veg cookbook.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|Disney classic for the grandkids.  The film is true to the stories and the animation is well-done.  I watched this when I was young and enjoyed it.
B000HEZF0O|5.0|Arrived on time and in goos shape, I have a very picky son and he was thrilled with this gift.
B004NEY9EW|5.0|I read all Fleming's books, about 47 years, ago.  The movies, haven't lost their pizazz!  This item, is a must-have.  Craig, is one awesome pick, for playing Bond!
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|Sent swedish version instead of what they claimed to be as shown. David Fincher is a great movie maker, but thats not what i got!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved the characters and their strength. Even with the dark content the author finds a way to keep you coming back for more. A great story that is anything but hopeless.
0300169787|5.0|Having seen the marvelous McQueen show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I knew my granddaughter in California would love this book. She's interested in fashion and what could be more perfect than this book?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was must read on until the end.  I can't wait to read the next book.  I would recommend this to anyone  looking for a book that will keep you on the edge  of your seat.
0061134007|5.0|A terrific book!  Nesbo is the master.  Just as Steig Larsson exploded on the scene, Nesbo is now my leading writer of Scandinavian noir.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched the movie first which kind of spoiled it; but all in all a great read. Can't wait to read the next books
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Downloaded great... it found my (Brother) printer,  but the model number wasn't listed.  If your wireless printer is an older model... it may work.  For me it was &quot;Install and delete, in less than 5 minutes&quot;.
B000YHG72E|4.0|I thought that the film would be a lot more slapstick and just dumb.  My wife and I both enjoyed the film along with another four friend that had seen it prior.
B0037RDPEG|3.0|I struggled to read this one, and if you dislike self centred self absorbed people you will find it hard going. Just once I wanted her to properly acknowledge the feelings of her ex-husband.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is an amazingly fun and challenging game. The graphics add to the peacefulness and mysteriousity of the island. It's longer than Grisly Manor. Definitely worth 99 cents.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I struggled at the start with following the letters which is harder on a kindle but persisted and just loved it when the real book style started. The characters are so nice it is a lovely book and a great read if you want to relax and unwind.
B0010T0OCY|3.0|the plot is NOT compelling. Poor script..Keifer's acting is laughable-a waste of other talented actors. Why is Connoly given such terrible movies to be seen in ???
B003R50F00|5.0|When death is the narrator it probably should have been a bit of a clue that it would not be a book full of happy endings. It took a couple of goes to get into this book but it was well worth the effort and even the embarassment of being in tears on the bus as I finished.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Even Clooney is good in this farce. &#34;man of Constant Sorrow&#34; song steals the show that is tied together quite nicely. ENJOYABLE from start to finish
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Beautifully written story and very engaging tale of Harold Fry.As the story unfolds you learn how Harold has come to this point in his life.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Es una pelicula excelente, esta super divertida, es un tando pesada para el criterio de algunas personas, pero si eres de mente abierta, te la recomiendo muchisimo. Si la compras la disfrutaras.

B00993FEUK|5.0|I know this must be a good movie for young children because it's the first movie our grandson has ever been able to sit completely through in a movie theater. He's excited to have it now to watch at home.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie first and was pleasantly surprised to find all the similarities. The plot isn't overly complex, but it was engaging and had enough extra details left out of the movie that had me unable to put it down.
B003B02PFO|5.0|Enjoyed this and kept thinking I had read it...but instead realized I had seen the TV movie based on it-christmas with the Kranks! With Tim Allen.  Still really enjoyed it!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Love this movie. The characters in this show were top notch and showed how someone can get lost going up the corporate ladder and finding out that morals are more important.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Using a Kindle Fire-onlycomplaint is that there are no goals anymore and that the Team Lava seems to be ignoring my request for answers.  Seems to need an update but none available.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|As the most extensive and awe-inspiring restoration work I've ever seen, I hold the effort to bring TNG into the HD era in very high esteem. This is by far the best the show has ever looked, and with Trexperts like the Okudas onboard as the eyes and ears of the fans in bringing this to life, all of the people working on this restoration should be highly commended. For any Trek fan, this is a must-own.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Currently watching the subtitled films also.  These are great and you need read all 3 to get the full impact!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|Up the moviei love this movie and the streaming worked well. the dogs are the best and ed asner does a great job.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Once I got started reading it, I could not put it down. It was a fantastic story about a man who is asked by a friend to go back in time and prevent the JFK assassination from happening. However, things don't turn out to be quite that easy. Highly recommended!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Good story about family & appreciating others. My daughter really enjoys it. Playing the DVD more often in her room. Only watched Blu-ray twice.

B00A757EFW|3.0|The &#34;free&#34; version is not worth downloading.  I barely got through one screen and part of the 2nd.  Not enough play to make it worth downloading.  If I knew how to delete it, I would have already done that.  My device is new and that's my next goal - to figure out how to delete worthless stuff.

0060786523|5.0|This is a very long book for sure and some have criticized Vikram Seth for having the audacity to take over 1,400 pages to write what in a nutshell is a long Indian soap opera. A soap opera it is, a glorious, vivid, fast paced, juicy one with exciting plots and dramas. I found it very interesting to immerse myself in a slice of post-colonial India, and the book to me was a sheer joy to read. I actually cannot remember when I last read a book that I enjoyed reading so much. I am utterly impressed at Seth's genius in intertwining,then taking apart, and then intertwining again, and again, the multiple stories, characters and plots in this great Indian saga. I gave it five stars because it is to me a work of art, a genius to write a book of this length where you can captivate a reader continuously, and utterly enjoyable. Definitely Vikram Seth's greatest debut.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book! I could not put it down. I am really looking forward to reading the sequel.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|As predicted, it is an easy read with enough imagination and twists from Collins to keep you up at night, chasing the last page.

0525953728|5.0|It is incredible how much work SEALs put in and how much training they go through. Now I know the 'inside' story of how the US got Bin Laden. I highly recommend this well-written book.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This new book has more futures . It has more languages , more definitions than ever before so get it today on your kindles, lab tops , computers , get it at the book store ,or library. So get it now .
B000T433CO|5.0|Great holiday movie ! Snow and all make a great winter movie. And nice pleasant  California weather also. Something for everyone!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family but I would say that it is a good book and I'm glad I read it.  It is a very deep book that is hard to stop reading.
B004JK61K0|2.0|I downloaded the app, entered requested ID and password and was unable to continue. It hung up on Next, and then went to Home.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|what a fun game and addicting! Kids and adults alike should enjoy it.So I give it 5 stars! Very cute.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|The audio CD is a fantastic mixture of many recognizable portions of actual Beatles music. These were expertly<br />blended with George Martin's help. The video DVD shows just the names of the pieces, no images, and is kind of<br />useless. I would buy just the CD, and not the whole package.
0307744434|4.0|I was surprised to enjoy this book -- it was a book club selection.  But, I really did.  The book draws you.  It's a page turner, but a well-written one.  I did get the feeling that the author didn't really know how to end the book, as the ending didn't seem quite as clearly written as the rest of it.  That said, it was worthwhile and enjoyable.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I, like many, was looking for their radio hit Ho Hey, but seeing that the cd was only another $4 I went for it, and I'm so glad I did! While I still love Ho Hey, it isn't my favorite from the album! Most of the songs are awesome, the few others are just great. Buy this! The price is certainly right.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I thought the first two MIBs were a lot better.  Slow in spots, but an enjoyable video none the less :-)
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Works well on my lg Optimus. Clear sound and easy to use interface in the app. Would recommend to others.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Loved it, and the fact it takes place in Boston (where I'm from), makes it even more enjoyable, and worth watching!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|this app is really useful,I can use my kindle fire to do most of the tasks I do . on my laptop... one thing to know is that you have to leave your laptop on for this to work...All in all this is a great app
B0084YAU86|5.0|Both seasons were great! If you like Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and possibly even if you don't, you will love this short, well-done series. I doubted that these old stories could be \\"modernized\\" but oh yes, they could and were. The result was some entertaining detective work, believable characters, and heartfelt relationships.
B004UID2LC|5.0|love using this app to convert my favorite music videos into mp3. it also is great for watching videos. I think everybody should use this app.
B007Y36K46|4.0|This movie came in as one of 2012's biggest flops ?<br />  That's because to many people listen to critics .<br />  What you have here is a GREAT FLICK , Great story ( not the same 'ol ,same 'ol ) great characters ..<br /> A Well done Movie ,very enertaining.<br />  I bought it and have watched it 5 times over the coarse of a month ... and I will surely watch it again .......
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Very happy with the processing and delivery.<br />Was a present for my son-in-law. Although I didn't watch the DVD he was very happy with it.
B004ZGI18S|4.0|We enjoyed this, and probably will watch again to see if we can catch clues early on. It reminded me of the Jason Bourne films.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I was hoping for a super funny movie with this great cast but was let down. I thought the jokes were bad plot was horrible and I kept thinking of family guy with that voice.<br /><br />Wow how creative a movie about a guy who doesn't want to grow up and get married and is loser friend keeps pulling him back to him.  Girl Hates friend and threatens to leave him. Blah blah blah. It's him or me story.<br /><br />It gets better towards the end but the beginning is horrible.  Especially the part with the hookers.
1416955070|5.0|Because it was the most interesting book i ever read.<br />I liked this book because it talked about shadowhunters, which is something new instead of just vampire and warewolfs-<br />i recommend this book for all the teenagers who like advanture and love romance.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Fun game but I don't like the control pad.  It is difficult to use effectively. Otherwise, it is much like the original game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the best game app in the market.  It's very challenging and addicting, it's so good that we bought the full version after we were done with the free version.
B007TK77QE|1.0|I purchased this book, as my husband so enjoyed the Potter books and thought the author talented.  Her literacy skills are superior, but the story line very ordinary.  Too close to the ugly side of life we live now
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very well written book.  Much thought and planning has gone into this series. With the time to read it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The You Version of the bible is a great and easy tool to use. Plus the bible reading plans make it a sure way to stay on track with Bible reading and study!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book kept me entertained - even though I'd stupidly read enough spoilers here not to be too surprised by the plot twist, there was enough intrigue to keep me engaged til the end. Yes, I agree, these are not people you'd want to be friends with, but boy, they certainly deserve each other... So it's true love. Kinda.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Addicting and fun!  Recommend it to anyone with some time to burn. The app is easy to load and easy to play.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|there is finally an official facebook app on the kindle fire!  I love it! works very well and I am pleased with the performance.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is a jewel match game.  The challenge comes by the speed in which you remove the jewels and to remove more than 3 jewels at a time.  Great sound effects with bombs shooting and electic shooting the faster you can go and the more jewels you can remove at a time.  Several levels to keep you going and challenged.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|not the best app in the world. i personaly think it is kinda cool. but still ok.not great ok.not very good service. but ok.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I've purchased 6 of these and they all work great. They hold a charge for a long time, I've watched 3 movies on a single charge. They fit over my glasses just fine. I also love the fact that these have a three position switch: Off - 2D - 3D. 2D lets someone watch the movie in 2D if they have trouble viewing 3D, like getting dizzy, getting nauseous or are prone to seizures. The 3D effects are awesome when viewing with my Sharp LC-70LE745U.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Granddaughter loved it. seemed to work real good. the price was also very reasonable. thank for offering it. will recommend it to other people.
0152164154|5.0|As with all truly great children's literature this wonderful book speaks to readers of all ages.  For children it's a fantastical story for adults a story of love, loss and longing.  I've purchased several copies of this book, both in English and in French, for friends who have experienced loss of a love one.<br /><br />Mais les yeux sont aveugles. Il faut chercher avec le cœur.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am not the most frequent reader and always wish I would read more, but it takes a lot for me to become engaged and finish a book.  I'll often read the first 50-100 pages of a book and not finish it.<br />This book/ story is really engaging and I stayed up almost all night and read it in one night.<br />I think I read all three of the books in the series in a similar time period.<br />The story is very engaging even though some of it seems far fetched.  I'm an adult and found it entertaining, but it really seems more of a book for teens.  Although the concept and story offers food for thought it doesn't seem like it's a realistic jumping point for real moral and political discourse.
B005LAII9O|5.0|I think people that have that fighting spirit will enjoy this movie .maybe david and Goliath .like most good movies it needs a little more tweeking but still very good .they could do a good sequel but will probably screw it up.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I loged on Flow Free Bridges and it said you need your credit card to play this game.<br /><br />Don't like this type of  Amazon free play and I have to pay for it.<br /><br />  I like PAC-MAN-LITE it's a good game and it's fun fun fun !!!  (THANKS)
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Great movie.  My children love the colors and the story. When they see cut down trees they say,<br />\\"The Lorax would be mad.\\". This movie teaches!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Love this movie it was so worth getting it.. (this is stupid with words required) really wow... but i do like this movie
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|James Taylor is at his best, along with his wonderful guests.  All the selections are great and truly put you in the spirit of the season.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have already seen the movie, but the book still held my attention entirely. I really enjoyed reading it, and look forward to reading the next two books in the series.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun game good graphic. Many levels and challenging to move along I use it on a Kindle and works great
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mine craft!! It is so beast! Must buy! worth $6.99.<br />Ps. hope you enjoy this freaking game. Pps. Please rate five stars for this app.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|This book was really good but if you are looking for a book that will last you for a while  or if you are going on a trip and you are looking for a book that will last you for a while I wouldn't recommend this book but other than that you will have a good time reading this book
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|It's a great addition to the larger Helm's deep set. Plus you get a couple more uruk-hais to enlarge your army!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Well written. Kept me engaged right to the end. Don,t care for books that are to be continued. That's all.
8866130109|5.0|The Lego brick on the front is really cool. I do like my Moleskine notebooks as they are perfect to bring around for travelling. It's a good present for a Lego and Moleskin fan!
B004SUDPXW|5.0|If you're already a BB fan, then I don't need to sell you on this or any other season. The Blu Ray discs are set up well with lots of features. It's a bit pricey, but BB makes people do things, so I paid for it.
B005RJI67I|5.0|A must-have for the Harry Potter + Lego fan, this bagged set is perfect as a stocking stuffer. Think prices have risen quite dramatically since I first got these, but well, if you're a HP fan, I don't think you wanna miss out on this!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|If you are new to BB or just want your own set, all four box sets (soon to be five) are excellent, well crafted, and contain many features to please the viewer. It's a bit pricey, but that BB for you.
0062215507|5.0|I love Harry Potter so this review is definitely biased. This is the perfect book for fans of all ages! There are many cool inserts, awesome photos and is extremely easy to read. Perhaps this is why I like it much better compared to the 400 hardcover one...
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is on par with NCIS in my opinion. The acting is very good and the plots interesting.<br />I do hope they keep the show for another season.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|But waaaaay better...........Ted was like an extended x rated episode of family guy so if you dig the fam guy and wanna kick it up a dirty notch than i guarantee Ted will not disappoint
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have to say, I'm very impressed with this book. The 4HWW got me rolling, and this book's information on accelerated learning is invaluable to me. Thanks very much Mr. Ferriss.
B000L212HW|5.0|Great movies and great acting..a tour de force. Fire dragons are great too. What more do you want.  See this movie.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I wore out my DVD copy and upgraded to this blu-ray edition.  A fabulous movie that is a Christmas favorite for me.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|These books are getting better an d better! The climax in each book really escalates! I recommend this series to everyone! Very well written, well done!
B005GRTNXC|5.0|Every single song on this album is an eargasm epic tune with incredible vocals. So worth the money spent on it!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is awesome. you get to go on adventures and get to draw your own character ! ! !
B0064W67IM|3.0|It lost two stars for getting unnecessarily disgusting/disturbing in the middle for no reason. Not even just gory, but really disturbing.
B005EI86JU|4.0|The book is a good read and informative but it can get a little overwhelming too. Try not to read too much at one time. Its not really the books fault either though. The D7000 is a pretty sophisticated camera so there is a lot to learn and master. The thing is loaded with features. I have some experience in the photography field and bought the 7000 because I can't afford to spend $4,000.00 on a D3 or the like right now. I can get around pretty much any camera without too much of an issue but for someone who isn't to that point yet this book will help out you tremendously with mastering your 7000.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|Thomas Hayden Church and his face were really good. The girl who played his daughter was Luanne Platter in the flesh. A pretty good thriller. Don't expect the bongo playing version of Matthew McConnaughey to show up though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started this book one morning, and I finished  it the following night. I couldn't stand not reading it, it had me hooked from the first word. People have been telling me to read since it was published. I couldn't understand why, after reading this book, I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone. I can't wait to read book two.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|Acting was good and the casting was very good, but the special effects is the main reason to watch the movie.  The best effects I've ever seen
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I don't have the stamina to recount the excellent adventures leading up to the First World War. I did, however, learn a great deal about the events leading to the war from three distinct vantage points. The English, The Russians and the Americans all had reasons to enter this horrid war. Most were self serving, as the pretense of war tends to be. Read it, experience it, and learn much about where we came from.
B005DC68NI|4.0|This book was bought as a present and I have not read it,  The recipient is very pleased with it.  Maybe I will get a share of the royalties when he publishes?
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Every time I open it, it just closes back up. I was able to TRY and make a username, but it kept on saying the username was taken, even when I put &quot;jlkirfgtn&quot;. Please fix!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Enjoyed everything about this movie. I thought the story was good and the acting was great. I have yet to watch a Clint Eastwood movie that I didn't enjoy.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|I liked the album but I didn't love it. I fear Dylan may have gotten in a rut. His last couple albums have started to get a certain &#34;old timey&#34; sound to them. I know his voice is rough so it makes it tough for him to shift gears as much as he used to. &#34;Dusquesne Whistle&#34; is certainly the standout song on the album.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|My favorite books are the ones that can make me laugh and cry. This one made me do both. Makes me want to go to Vegas.
B0071T3Q9K|4.0|Odd that one of the world's best songwriters would do an album of standards rather than writing new material and preforming them to sound like standards. He does write a couple new songs for the album and they are probably the most interesting so not sure why he didn't write the whole thing. Still, an enjoyable album.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|great movie for the whole family. recommend everyone take the time to watch it with there kids. We all had some good laughs.
B000OCZD60|5.0|A great copy of the original film in which the HD quality truly shows the grittiness that begat this movie from beginning to end. Although originally recorded in semi-stereo, this DD 5.1 does clean up the audio track quite well and gives quasi-surround effects when called for. For the price (esp. since it was new) was a worthy investment to my collection. As my Toshiba HD-DVD keeps spinning my discs 100%, I'll keep coming back to Amazon to pick up more HD discs. I do have a Blue Ray as well, but now finding out some older movies have only been released in HD format thus far.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|i really like the life prof cases, this is my second one. the only thing i didn't love is the pink is a really vibrant pink. the quality is good.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like that this can act as my idea pad for songs and screenplays. The best thing is that I can access it on any device with the same e-mail!
1455523550|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this read and am looking forward to it's release on the big screen with Julianne Hough playing the part of Katie Feldman and Josh Duhamel, Alex.  The book reads briskly and I could see how many would say they couldn't put this one down.<br /><br />The only negative I would say was that there never was a consummation to Alex and Katie's relationship.  I wish that Sparks had thrown in a R rated love scene between the two of them.  I think the film might be PG-13 so this is a let down.  The ending was great and I won't spoil it for those that haven't picked this one up.  Highly recommended!
1449410243|5.0|Great book! Bought it as a gift for my mom and she found it hysterical. If you have a cat and like cat humor it is a great book.
B005LAII1C|3.0|This movie could have been way better.  I didn't like that the teddy bear comes back to life at the end after being torn to bits.  Also, the fact that it smokes pot throughout the movie seemed strange.  Something was missing.  The movie just wasn't magical like it should have been.  Seth Mcfarlane could have chosen a different personal idol for Mark Wahlberg's character other than Flash Gordan as well.<br /><br />I guess I was hoping for more *class* to this film.  It was too much skewed to the stupid / crude side of things but entertained me nonetheless.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love Grisham and have read all his books.  It kept me in suspense, as all his books do.  Not one of my favorites, but you be the judge.
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|This is a great, inexpensive cover for my I phone since I didn't want to spend a lot of money.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book. Colleen Hoover is a great writer who sucks you in from the first page. Great read!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Easy to learn and LOVE the signpost hints. I'm usually pretty good at these kinds of games, and...I'm already stuck. This one will challenge me for awhile :O)
B0084IG8TM|5.0|We enjoy watching this movie almost every weekend. Friends come over and want to watch it. Great buy for anyone.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is a must-buy! Three movies that defined the blockbuster genre of the 2000's for just 30 bucks? I would pay that price for The Dark Knight alone!!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  The characters were pretty good and the story kept me interested. It's a really entertaining book for fans of lawyer stories.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is so fun. should make a wonder aquarium lol. plz. thxs. this game better then all other zoo game.
1250000971|5.0|Typical Archer. Anxiously awaiting the next book. He always leaves the reader in suspense and the twists and turns keep one wondereing.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use weather channel app morning , noon and night.  What to wear, which route to take and how is the weather forecast for the grandchild's soccer game?
B0007PALZ2|2.0|I felt the movie had potential (especially after reading the reviews) until the director introduces Brad Pitts’ character.  This overly manic character went on for too long for my taste.  It was exhausting and distracting.  From this point through another 30 minutes, 12 Monkeys no longer held my interest and pressed the eject button.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read this book after I finished Ms. Hoover's book Hopeless since I loved that book so much ~ once again I was NOT disappointed. I will now start Point of Retreat since the other two books blew me away. I felt his book was very real & I loved how the poetry came to life along with the words by the Avett Brothers (I had to Google them & listen to them on YouTube). My husband died a year ago & I totally related to the realism of the book, the feelings were so raw & real! I loved all the characters in the story & thought they were all well developed & I felt like I \\"knew\\" them. I highly recommend this book.
B007C3TVNA|3.0|Because a friend told me I needed to see this movie, I ordered it.  I did not enjoy it as my friend had.  I didn't feel that it developed the characters broadly enough, and I hated the flipping back and forth in time.  I would not buy it if I'd have known.
B007R41E8O|4.0|story belongs with a hidden object game and the graphics are pretty good.  Only complaint is I wish they would let me find the hidden objects by myself and not highlight (or not) what exact objects are in view.
B00005LIN0|5.0|Daughter needed this dvd in order to view it and write a paper for her college instructor, all in four days time.  Was able to order and have it delivered the next day, allowing her to get everything done and turned in, and she received full points!  Thank you!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book amazing authour great for young readers and about to be made into a movie I recommend this book to many people
B000JML90Y|4.0|A very well reasoned argument at a time when new thought in this are was very necessary. Vey thorough investigation.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is not his best novel, but is still a real thriller for those of us who love Nelson  DeMille
B004WMKSH2|2.0|The entire family fell asleep through this boring movie.  Some special effects were good.  The story was very hard to follow.  I think the die hard Potter fans will say it is great, but if you are just watching a movie, choose another.  The first few movies in the series were entertaining however.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful sequel to Fall of Giants and cannot wait for the third book in the series.  Classic Follett. A great read with lots of history.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The technicolor is extremely realistic, only the greens seem too bright at night. Otherwise it's just as beautiful as I remember it.
141659521X|5.0|Have read most of Vince Flynn's books and they are always entertaining.  I ordered this one for my grandson for Christmas as I had alreadly read it and I knew he would enjoy it.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|An excellent job done remastering the original Star Trek series. The color looks amazing and the enhanced sound is a must.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Les Miserables is the great story ever written, and to have it put to music on such a grand scale like this is awesome! Huge fan!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|My daughter was extremely surprised and happy with this gift. She couldn't wait to check out all that it offered.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|if you own a kindle fire you may be taking a risk getting this app. within 15 hours the game crashed. it had  a black screen. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it works fine now. its a lot of fun but if you get the free version there will be ads. but those are easy to click out of. this is a good app
B00007GZR5|5.0|This movie was recommended by a christian friend. This is a very good movie.  This movie is more than what meets the eye.  If you are into the spiritual, afterlife experiences with a somewhat answer to it all, this movie can help with developing ideas that can be confirmed by biblical sound scripture.
B00004YX39|4.0|Thus far I liked the method of ordering and business in which Amazon operates. The returns are easy also.I do believe that they should not charge so much for returns for S&H. Especially with CDs as you don't know what the list of songs are and no way to hear or see them until you have and try them. The quality and integrity of the discs are terrific and the same as you would find in any music store. So much easier and the prices for the CDs are good and competitive except .the cost of the return. Thank You Amazon as a great source of music and older music selection(oldies).
1452110581|5.0|If you need a good laugh, read this book. I first bought it at the Art Institute of Chicago as a gift for my son. After glancing through it, I ordered one for myself.
B000000XBC|4.0|Great selecti<br />ons<br /><br />Great selections of music by one of my most favorite groups of all time. I have the entire collection of their songs on albums, 8-track, cassette, and now I'm working on the C D version of the collection. I also have some of John Fogerty outside of CCR. He is a master diverse musician with a load of talent. I was a musician for 13 years and appriciate all kinds of music and lyrics. I can find attributes in just about all of them.The group of CCR is terrific. The quality of sound on C D is fantastic and the C Ds that I purchased through Amazon are no exception. I'm thrilled to have this source for my collection.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Frankie Vali.  This CD has brought me many hours of total enjoyment!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy though they try by the g f f t f ft t f t t t t t t
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|The most delightful new show of the year. If you're looking for a blend of &#34;Friends&#34; and &#34;Seinfeld,&#34; look no further. Also, be prepared to have a fairly large crush on Zooey Deschanel; she's absolutely charming in her role as Jess in this new series.
1451695195|5.0|The existence of God's over-arching Presence in the cosmos is affirmed and emphasized as REALITY to the writer through his experiences while in a deep coma at which time his cortex was not functioning.  In the midst of his 7 day sojourn out of his body and finding his consciousness penetrating Realms beyond the 3rd dimension, he, a neurosurgeon and scientist discovers that God and the Love that penetrates the Universe exists far and away beyond anything that he had ever experienced.  When at last he is propelled back into his body, as a family grieves that he most assuredly cannot survive, he returns as it were &#34;to life&#34; with an full recovery.  A medical wonder and the first of its kind to a survivor of a lenghty and nearly complete physical shutdown.  Dr. Eben Alexander has committed to exploring this experience for the rest of his life.  He says that he experienced LIFE-larger-than-life (as we know it) and will work with others in the scientific community to open the door of our comprehension to the existence and magnitude of the Spiritual Nature of the cosmos.  I loved the book and believe it will help bring together a fusion of our physical and metaphyrical views of Life and God as we explore our experiences with an open mind.  The &#34;spiritual world&#34; has most often been denied through using science as a rationale.  Now I believe we have a beginning way to approach our physical and spiritual natures as &#34;science&#34; takes seriously the experience of men like Dr. Alexander.  It is time that the thousands of individuals down through the  Ages who have visited those realms, have encountered some manifestation of non-physical activity, or had glorious exposure to the Spiritual Foundation of the cosmos (and lived to tell about), it can be revisited with greater appreciation and with a hunger to know more about the Ground of Being that is the Source of all Life Itself.
B004EK926K|5.0|Easily the scariest, funniest rendition, in typical Disney style. The animation allows for the portrayal of the ghosts as spooky, yet not unfriendly apparitions, thereby enhancing the story in a way past renditions never could. Definitely a must-see for any Christmas Carol fan!
0230710077|5.0|Truely an epic that keeps you interested throughout. Great from an historical perspective. I loved the character development and will surely read Follett's next in the series..
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's a fun game but find it can be tedious going back a forth between areas. All in all a fun game
B0050DIWFC|1.0|I have been unable to download this book for a week . Siting an error and to try again layer.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a very fun game, I got it for the kids but now I'm addicted!  Easy enough for a 5 year old but fun enough for adults.
030759565X|5.0|So far I have made 6 recipes from this cookbook and each one has been a resounding success. The Red Wine Velvet Chocolate Cake will blow your socks off.
B009738XXM|4.0|A little on the bubble-gum side for me, but, hey, it is well produced and has that cheerful, youthful sound. My daughters love it and I can listen to it as well.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|if you like 80's rock music at all, and even if you don't, you need to watch this movie. at least for a laugh.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This movie definitely  did not disappoint. It's as funny as you would expect from Seth McFarlane. Throw in Mila Kunis and everybody wins.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Do everything as promised. Web radios working perfectly. Amazing got it for free from amazon store. Thank you very much!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book gives me new thoughts and meaning to where we go after we leave this planet.  I highly recommend it to everyone who is the least bit sceptical about death and dying.
B0020M99LC|4.0|While I am a fan of Bond movies,  I don't think this was the best.  I don't like Daniel Craig as well as Pierce Brosnan.  Now that is good eye candy!
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I love the series and some of the special features on the DVD were great.  BUT  when I tried to play it on my computer, I got the message that it wasn't formatted for my area, something the buyer failed to mention.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Nice album, relaxing music to listen to all day. Great music for my teenagers and for their parents to listen to! :)
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I thought this movie was very charming, without being as over-the-top as some Wes Anderson films are. I thought the acting was great and the story was cute. Definitely see it. My boyfriend liked it more than I did, and he's usually not a big fan of Anderson's movies.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|good game, with good graphics and easy controls.  fun to play even for my five year old. all around worth the 99&cent;.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|silly,silly,stupid nineteen words are not needed to convey how much of a waste it was ,lots of pretty girls should have at least some nudity
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really liked this book because it spelled out what actually took place in the search and destroy of bin laden
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has moved my heart. It has made me think about life in ways I never thought I could. Everyone should read this book.
0793535093|5.0|This book fits great in my Collection I'm very happy with it i will be buying the rest of them as so as I can.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book!  I tried relating it to our country today and can see the big government who is out of touch with the people.  We need some type of revolution, but not as violent.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|All the best parts are in the previews so if you have seen the previews you will only get a few additional laughs.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I Loved it, thank you. it was amazing. so awsome, I love the season I can't wait for the next one to come out
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I wished it was longer, and there isn't much replay value.  I'll probably buy another game from them soon. The pictures are pretty.  It includes a hint guide if you get too stuck.
1419705849|5.0|This book is an amazing book in its series.<br />Author Jeff Kinney came back with such a charming story.<br />I recommend this book to all ages especially to teens.<br />It is an awesome book you can't beat it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Good time killer, can get addictive. Fun to play, a little nerve racking on some levels. over all preety good.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was very OK. I didn't like the fact that Katniss, the \\"girl on fire\\", convenient went with a guy named after bread! AH well, the third final sequel to a book is rarely as good as the others…
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great book. It was written wonderfully, now only if the movie will measure up to it.  Doubtful but we can only hope.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book I was so caught in it that it took three days to read. I can't believe the quality.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is mind blowing, addictive, and just overall just a GREAT book. E L James is a literary genius I can't wait to read the rest of the books of this trilogy.....Christian Grey has stolen my heart!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An amazing book. Needs to be read by all. Collins is an amazing author and this is a hard book to put down.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's better than all the other ones combined. The best one so far.One of the best books I've read all year.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book This book showed what a lot of teenagers go through in their life.  YOU NEED TO READ THIS!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This is an awesome book , I love it, it's super funny too. It's a great book for all ages
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very good book I would recommend it it all comes together at the end it is a mixture of hope and hopeless
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Yeah, the title of my review is cheesy, sorry.  I liked the book, and for the first time in years I read it through in almost a single day.  I saw the movie first, which wasn't bad at all except I could tell I was missing details that could only come from the book.  But the movie was obviously good enough to get me to read the book.  The story has a good pace, and changes direction enough to make Katniss believable in her thoughts.  I'm going to read the other books, for sure.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will have suspense, love, shocks and twists. I honestly doubt anyone will  get bored of this book. Love it so much!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Interesting tale with an interesting ending; MIB4 not needed. The original was the best, MIB2 was a nice continuation, this trilogy is now done, or is it?
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed this little book, although not my favorite. Im not a fan of the anonymous letter format in this case, and the story isnt completely realistic, but those are my only issue s. I would definitely recommend this book, specifically to teenagers, it is extremely relatable.
1615470158|5.0|Rather than a gegurgiating the same listing of functions and examples. This book gets to grips with the real problems faced when implenting a powerpivot solution. The sections on performance was especially worthwhile and the eaxamples meaningfully. Recommended
B005OK725M|5.0|love this movie, its very good action movie, item was brand new! this movie is great! watch it, i would recommend this movie to who ever likes action movies
B0094BB4TW|1.0|amazon needs to fix the bugs, app will not update or refresh feeds. dont bother until they can fix it.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I think this movie does quite well to round out this trilogy and cleverly open the door to what might come next. Definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it to fans of the first two in the series.
B005KMX866|5.0|My review title says what it is.  This is my favorite Christmas gift and will be unless someone gets me a real unicorn....lol.  What a tribute to the songs I was raised with.  This man does not imitate these great singers, he sings like these greats and always has.  I have his cd's because he sounds like himself blended with so many great voices.  His band offers a true infusion of their own unique blend of melody to make these songs fresh.  It felt like they were having a great time and they shared that with anyone who wants to listen.  Do buy this cd.  It is not to replace those wonderful artist songs of old, it is adding to that collection, another great voice that can take you back to the days of carefree, heart throbbing, relationship angst, love, sadness, joy and good times.  It is a tribute album and changing the songs would be unthinkable.  And if you have never heard original rock and roll \\"sorta\\" country style, you just have not lived musically.  Great job, Chris and band.
0312641893|5.0|Cinder, by Marissa Meyer is an enjoyable debut. A dystopian take on a classic fairy tale (actually, a few fairy tales find their way into this novel), it has well developed characters and an entertaining plot.<br /><br />There are a few plot elements that are perhaps not worked out as well as they could be (if the queen holds the power that she does, why doesn't she just take over?) but they will surely be worked out over the course of the 4 part series. The adult reader knows who Cinder is almost from the beginning, but that doesn't spoil the novel at all (and younger readers might not know so soon). In fact it made me anxious, wondering when she would find out and how the author would develop that element.<br /><br />Too many YA novels are turned into series, when one novel would have sufficed. Cinder is fortunately an exception. The pacing was well done, with nothing dragging merely to create a series.<br /><br />I wanted to read the book quickly, yet at the same time I didn't want to finish knowing the second book isn't sitting on my nightstand.<br /><br />I highly recommend Cinder.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Disney really hit a home run on this one! The Avengers is a thrill ride from start to finish. There are parts where I laughed out loud. The interplay between the heroes is just great! I will watch this one again and again.
0786955570|5.0|I grew up playing D&D quite a bit with my friends.  As we got older and made families we just didn't have the time to play anymore.  This board game is great on so many levels.  It is great for people like me who would like to feel like they are playing D&D and need to do it in an hour and a half.  It is great intro for people who are curious about D&D but have never played before.  They won't get very deep into the D&D rule set but will get an introduction to HP, AC, movement, classes and other basic concepts.  It is also great for anyone who just wants to play an adventure game and doesn't care what world it is set in.<br /><br />The game comes with a bunch of highly detailed miniatures that are begging to be painted but are wonderful as they are.  The board pieces are of high quality and they are placed mostly randomly so the layout will never be the same twice.  The characters are well thought out and there really isn't a 'stronger' character in the bunch, they all have their pluses.  There are quite a few adventures to play through and there are more user created adventures online.  If you are feeling creative you can even make your own.<br /><br />The game works very well no matter how many people are playing.  It doesn't feel any harder or easier whether you have two players or five.  Also, you can play this game solo which is very cool.  Being a cooperative game, everyone is in it together.  I have read a lot about how the game is difficult but we have won the adventures probably 80% of the time.  Two games were won literally at the last possible move that we could stay alive.  It is very exciting when that happens and it always seems close no matter what.  The role playing element is very light.  You don't keep anything your character finds from one adventure to the next so you are starting from scratch every time you play.  However, depending on who you are playing with and how &#34;into character&#34; they wish to be, there are still plenty of role playing opportunities for those who wish to take them.<br /><br />This is the first of three games in the set.  I only own this one but will certainly be picking up the other two once we have really played this one out.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game for some and a little advanced for others. I have enjoyed playing and hope for more levels soon.
B007HACDLK|4.0|If you're a fan of Vince and Mitch, you'll like this book. It's another fun read, but does it break any new ground for either character - not really. Pretty much follows the Rapp novel formula.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great app. Even my five year old grandson loves it. Good graphics and levels every one can enjoy. Would recommend it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Another good read. Follett's weaving a big story here, and if you liked Book One of the Century Trilogy, you won't be disappointed.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Nice Game it like Spiderman Three with the same Map same city and more but the thing is that I cant believe Gameloft made this type of Game but keep it up Gameloft your game on Android and Apple are the BEST!!!!!!!!
B00A80SHFM|1.0|The reason I gave it one star was because the score has to have a star. I haven't seen the movie yet. Went on Christmas Day but couldn't get in. Saw the play 2 times and it's one of my favorite Broadway shows. Saw there was a soundtrack cd of the movie. I know it's highlights. Listened to the samples on Amazon. Was quite disappointed. How do you take one of the greatest scores on Broadway and make a Highlights CD of the movie and leave out some of the best songs. I hear the highlights is around 60 minutes. A CD can hold 80 minutes of music. AGain we are cheated. I'm sure they could have taken another few munites and put on Do You Hear The People Sing. One of the highlights of the score. I can't review the soundtrack because I didn't hear the whole CD. I'm not planning on buying the highlights. If a 2 CD soundtrack comes out I will purchase that. Guess I will listen to the original London Cast. That's my favorite.
0880796863|1.0|The cards are lovely, altho not particularly traditional images.  The book has serious issues, including misnumbering Major Arcana.  I bought the deck for my son's first deck, figuring Rider Waite would be a good beginner deck.<br /><br />We're going to have to buy another book for him to learn the meanings of the cards, the celtic cross layout, etc...<br /><br />Not recommended unless you know what you're doing.... And if you do know what you're doing, you still probably want a more traditional Rider-Waite deck.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|We watch this each Christmas Eve with our kids and drink hot chocolate (you'll know why once you've seen the movie). It is very entertaining and full of some excellent messages for kids and adults alike. Our kids are in their teens and one pre-K. Highly recommend Polar Express.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great time burglar!  I can't stop playing it.  And it's free!<br />Simple, but can be challenging at times.  Good for kids and adults.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is a master at his trade! I love Harry Bosch! And anything else he writes is equally good.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many wonderful ideas at your fingertips! Website and app are easy to use, and the app allows you to search for ideas, or find inspiration on the go.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I tried to get into this game for about a day and a half.  My friend also got a Kindle, and she couldn't get into it either.<br />Kindles really lack instructions, and the game selections didn't have any instructions either.<br /><br />I watched the attached video several times, but it didn't tell me how to start the game.<br /><br />Finally my husband played with it a bit, and got it started.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read all far. I love how the author plots the story. When I finished the book I wanted more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Make sure to watch the movie after you read the book to give you a sense of what every thing looks like and to see the beautiful Jennifer Lawrence! ;)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is far the best series I've read so far, can't wait for the third book. I wish I had my own Gideon Cross!!!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent acting and a different kind of story.<br />By this time this movie should have been free on our Amazon prime.
1435122968|5.0|I received \\"H.P. Lovecraft: The Complete Fiction\\" as a gift from my son; it is truly one of those gifts that keeps on giving.<br /><br />My previous exposure to Lovecraft was limited to a short story here or there in a horror anthology, so obviously I am not a hardcore Lovecraft (or horror fiction) aficianado. Whether or not this is truly the 'complete' fiction of Lovecraft (this seems to be a matter of disagreement by fans) I am likewise in no position to judge. However there are some truly stellar aspects of this collection that I would like to share.<br /><br />The brief introduction at the beginning of each piece by editor S.T. Joshi was a nice addition. Generally a short paragraph giving a bit of background on the piece, it helps place the work in the continuum of Lovecraft's writing career. I did not feel that they contained any major 'spoilers', but rather discussions of stylistic forms, date of first publication, and notes of interest such as rejection by a certain publisher. As a novice Lovecraft reader I found them helpful.<br /><br />The book takes you more or less chronologically through Lovecraft's work, rather than grouping the stories by style or subject. I enjoyed being able to see how the author evolved over the course of his apprenticeship into the craftsman he was to become.  You can see how other authors influenced him, and how he truly learned by doing, integrating ideas from his previous works into what became the Cthulu mythos.<br /><br />This is a heavy book, in subject as well as mass, so it's not one to read nonstop in the course of a few days. This has held the place of honor on my nightstand for months, to be tasted in discreet and enjoyable morsels, mulled over and digested, then tasted again. It has certainly brought some interesting color to my dreams.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended!
B000002PCS|5.0|A Christmas gift for a good friend.  The friend had been looking for this soundtrack for some time and had not found it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It great and steamy! :)  Couldn't put it down!! I just love love love love love love love love it!
0762434279|1.0|This book contains a lot of nothing, but the author sure likes to talk about himself.  His message takes up 1% of the book, and his book is 99% filler.  I am a Christian, and I also picked up anti-Christian themes throughout the book.  I would not recommend this book for people who love something other than money.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this story, but it is not a \\"feel good\\" type of book. It's a real life type of book. Great read!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|I ordered this twice because Amazon had a wrong address still in its computers, even though I had changed the address two + years ago.  I ordered this under 3-D.  I didn't get 3-D, which meant that it went back to Amazon twice and I still don't have the correct video.
0345803485|5.0|Oh boy what I book. lol! Be ready ladies! LMAO I liked the story line and the way is written is a very easy read. I couldn't put it down and I have the next 2 in the mail should be here by sunday.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Just watched all three films in a row..This is one of the best box sets in my collection. Every film is great if you don't already own the separate movies then this box set is a must! and the added bonus features are incredibly entertaining.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good read, although very predictable. The entire book was like tug of war.... glad it ended how it did. would recommend to friends.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Product arrived on time and was in great shape, The recipient likes the DVD set. I don't have any thing else to say.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My whole family loved this movie! My 4 year old loved it, and my boyfriend and I walked out wowed. Definitely need to have this one in my collection!
B003RUZKC8|5.0|Great movie lots of action and humor! this is a must have movie its the A team meets the expendables.
B004UID2LC|1.0|well I wanted the app got it,  shortly after my kindle was acting up so I got a virus sector app and it said this app was bad I got rid of it and their are no more problems so unless you want a virus don't get it
B005CRQ2XA|1.0|I liked this book because it has a lot more stuff about his brother (Roddick). In the other stories there is a lot more stuff about Greg(Greg is Roddick brother.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved first season.. loved second season. Looking forward to what they come up with for the next &#34;American Horror Story&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is like temple run people but better than temple run I like the one with Santa chasing you
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I love to watch Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones together in a Movie.  They both are good Actores. I would go and pay to see this movie again.
B0013ND30W|2.0|I was more than thrilled to pay the $70 dollars to own this timeless classic, as it is one of my faves.<br />The reason why I didn't rate my purchase 5 stars are for a few reasons. First it arrived a day later than what I was was predicted. I didn't think too much of it, however, the problem was it arrived with scuffs and scratches on the plastic housing the cover art. The case had a crack on the upper corner of the blu ray case. I was under the impression that I would be receiving something that looks new as it was deemed on the packaging. It was also just the blu ray case with the dvd sleeve taped over the case. Was it not supposed to be in some sort of box-set? Overall, I love this movie but I'm extremely disappointed at the condition the film arrived in. I feel as though I paid more money for something that may not have been as much as I spent. Oh well...
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|. The Story line was similar to the Original with Aronald Schwarzenegger, both are in the future. The both are about a person that wanted to try a new way to relax where they can live out there wildest fantasy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Easy read with a story that makes you care and touches your heart.  Wasn't expecting to live it this much. Only read it in a day. One of my new favorite books
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Both 1 and 2 of this movies are basely about the same things, that is blowing a lt of things up.  Don't get me wrong now I love all the action that is in the movies and i would go and see them both again if they were FREE. But it is hard to believe with so many Bullets flying around that some of the good guys don't get killed also .
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't know what the fuss is all about.  It was written in a rather juvenile style and not all that titillating.  I found it insulting to women and I can't for the life of me figure out why it is so popular.  I liked the ending of the first book, when she leaves him to get on with her life, so gratifying, that I did not bother with the other two.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a quick easy read.  Not the type of book I usually read but I liked the story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a good brain teaser of a game. I like to challenge myself in order to keep my wits! If you are at the airport or waiting in line, this is a good way to amuse yourself!
B009ZTLPJM|4.0|You can put this CD on repeat and not get tired of it.  All the songs are pretty good.  Definitely one of their better albums.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|You won't want to put it down. The amount of truth and real life experience from a modern woman is so refreshing, particularly in her accounts of \\"why not to have children\\" and \\"abortion\\". Every essential part of womanhood is touched on with deep honesty and complete logic on the matter. I laughed out loud many times and highlighted many words of wisdom. Share this book. We all need to know the contents.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|The stereo types were horrible.  The family dysfunctional in the name of comedy.  Not a good example for your children to watch.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|You get Blu-Ray and DVD and Digital Copy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Each version is on different disc.<br />Digital Copy works.<br />It is a wonderful movie.<br />Price!!!<br />Any Blu-Ray movie with dvd or digital copy under $20.00 is a great buy!<br />I got all 3 formats and for $15.00 how could I not buy it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />I recently purchased a 3D television and did not purchase the 3D version.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This is one of the stupidest  movies I have watched in years. It is basically family guy with a teddy bear as Peter.
0385333846|5.0|This book gets better with every read.  It is worth owning if ever a book was.  Enjoy.  I like the paper version best.
0064431789|5.0|This book was a gift for someone. I was pleased with the brand new condition. It was just what I expected.
0930289234|5.0|This book defines the genre.  A must read for graphic novels.  Highly recommend it to all readers young and old.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I've been a Ke$ha fan since she began her career. I love all her CD's but WARRIOR has to be the best. Any Ke$ha fan would love this album. She still puts the D in Dance. All the tracks are catchy and meaningful. This CD is great to dance to and sing along.
B0086700CM|4.0|simple to play,  impossible to master. great focus on gameplay that results in hours of fun. you will not be dissapointed.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|This CD RED, I can't stand it the lyrics are not meaningful and it is too poppy I understand that she might want to try something new but she should really stick to the Country genre. The album seems rushed as if she sat their and said to herself I want to make a CD called RED. That's like making a CD called green or Blue.
1589949811|4.0|This was a really great game for 1 or 2 players. My only complaint is the number of actions you have to tap (exhaust) a character for. If you use a character to quest you cannot use them to defend, if you use them to defend you cannot use them to attack. This last one I have the most problem with, by making attack and defense two different combat actions that both require taping, the game makes it so the only time a hero gets a hit on a monster is if he blind sides him while he is attacking a fellow hero. While this may make sense for lore or spirit based heroes, but there is no way heroes like Gimli, Legolas, or Aragorn are not going to be able to face a monster head on take and do damage.
1582406723|5.0|i thought this was the comic book?but i got it as a present makes me want to get all volumes of them its fun reading it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a must read. Will  be a definite page turner. Can not wait to read the last and final book
B00ARAOBKS|1.0|What a horrible movie.  I was thinking \\"hey, Matthew Mcahey\\" so it must be pretty good right? SOOOOO wrong. What was he thinking?  It is disturbing and should not be watched by anyone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Has all the power stats that you'll ever need, and then some!<br />Wurd to you mom, peace out out out
B008VBYN80|4.0|its a good game. if you are planning to get it you'll want to be able to have friends that will play the game with you because some missions require you go to their villages.you can skip most of those missions though if you use certain items.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was intriguing, interesting, couldn't figure out how it was going to end, but neither could the author.  Dud, let down, tired of writing this book ending.  Awesome to the last chapter, last line yuck
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Movie just did not live up to the hype.  Previous Bourne movies certainly surpass this debacle.  Gave it a 2 star because I like Jeremy Renner.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Very good Batman movie. My favorite of the 3 that star Christian Bale. Wanted to see it in the theater, but the stream over Amazon Prime was good.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has a good story and awesome graphics. I would definitely recommend it. I would like to see more games like this.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This pinball game is fun and works well on my Kindle Fire. The physics of the game are pretty realistic.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|not Jonny's best but up in the top ten. . .<br />Could have used alittle more of the original show. .<br />At my age it was hard to watch when you grew up with the original. .

B005DOKL3E|1.0|I thought it opened all the way and the kindle would remain in the sleeve. Otherwise there was nothing wrong.I returned it and ordered one that met my needs
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!  Good from beginning to end. Read it in 2 days. I would recommend this to a friend :)
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This app is so awesome I am barely off of it . My whole family loves it. I love all the angry bird apps I have all of them downloaded on my tablet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book was not only captivating it was just out of this world!! I Loved sky!! the fact that it wasn't a a typical romance made me fall in love. The book is charged with emotional drama, and everything about it is unexpected. I really enjoyed the book. There were heartbreaking moments, good moments, romantic moments and everything in between. The book teaches us that no matter how hard and horrible things may seem, we are all able to overcome our fears. I learned that by each person digging into the deep dark secrets filled within themselves and facing them head on, they will be able to survive anything because that's when they truly accept who they are.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Have on my phone and now at my desktop, easy to follow, usually pretty accurate also. Just like on TV
0385342063|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has a talent for generating humor by putting characters into ridiculous situations!  The characters draw our sympathies nonetheless - they are normal, flawed human beings that everyone can relate to.  I laughed throughout this novel, and couldn't put it down.  In my opinion, it is Kinsella's best so far.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like to think and concentrate on what I am doing this is confusing, not hard but just real confusing.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I believed it could stand sideways AND on end. I think the description &#34;at any angle&#34; led me to think this.  I liked the cover for my older Kindle better. It had a stand built in so the Kindle stood upright not sideways.<br />The purple color is nice.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very awesome gaming experience. Would recommend to everyone to play. Keeps u entertained. Everyone should give a five star experience.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|enjoyed the action.  not an Oscar contender but a fun to watch movie.  will watch it again, etc etc etc
1603429999|5.0|Covers a large range of topics, ever magic loop. It's a very good book to have for a reference. If you knit on circulars or want to larn dpn's, you must buy this book. Good illustrations. Easy to follow.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A new feelings in every page. A not so classic live story that can never be topped. Simply magnificent read.
8862931921|5.0|I was given this as a gift, and I love it.  Works just like a sketchbook should.  I like the cover, and it's the size I like.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A great read.  Vince Flynn's man Mitch Rapp is as entertaining as he is dangerous.  I look forward to the next thriller.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Grandkids absolutely love it.  Simple to use and choices are amazing.  May have to buy another Kindle Fire so they don't fight.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|This film had a lot going for it. It has great special effects, an interesting story, and some ok actors. For some reason, it didn't impress me. The story is about a mission to a distant solar system. The mission is to make contact with the alien race that supposedly genetically engineered humanity. When the space ship gets there, they discover that the planet was being used to produce living WMDs. The purpose of these weapons was to destroy the Earth. We never learn why this was being researched, or when it was going to happen. We do find out that the experiment went terribly wrong. The destructive organisms get loose and kill almost the entire crew of the research ship.<br /><br />This film seemed kind of out there. It reminded me a little of the Event Horizon movie. I loved Event Horizon, but this isn't even close to that good. It was a good idea, with flawed execution. I don't recommend it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I have seen this movie on tv numerous times and finally decided I needed to just buy it - I love this movie.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This film has a great cast, but suffers from a weak story. The origin of the Star Wars saga should have been a strong story. This film failed to entertain me in the way that I had expected it too. I like the whole idea about the invasion and war on Naboo. The origin of young Skywalker, and Paopatin were pretty interesting. I also liked the character, Darth Maul. The part of this movie that bored me to tears was the silly pod race on the desert planet. It was very unnecessary and boring. The rest of the story is okay though. It's possibly the weakest of the Star Wars movies, but it's a must see for any fan of the series.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Definitely a must read!! This book has become one my favorites! Very beautiful and moving and couldn't be more beautifully written
B005LAIHPY|4.0|This film is about a young man that is about to get kicked out of the Navy. One day an alien race attacks planet Earth and it is up to him and his crew to stop them. Through a crazy turn of events, they commandeer the USS Missouri and defeat the aliens.<br /><br />Battleship had a couple good actors. Liam Neeson, and Alexander Skarsgard (the guy that played Eric Northman in True Blood).<br />It had great special effects, tons of action, and a little comedy. The cinematography was kinda bad though. Most of the filming was really shaky. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I think that just about everybody can find something to like and dislike about this movie. It's probably worth watching once, but I wouldn't want it taking up space on my shelf. So I recommend just renting it.
B000002L9O|4.0|This CD is one of the Richie's drums era, who was a little bit more hardcore than Joey or Johnny.<br /><br />But it is a great album [Which from Ramones, isn't it? Leaving Adios Amigos out of the question]<br /><br />It sound sounds great and it has a couple of great songs
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|this might be a good app but 1126 milibites really I payed 6 99$ for this app and it takes all that space up I'm not even going to download it
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Like Daemon and Freedom, Kill Decision is one of those books where everything that happens sounds real and grounded, because it is.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Great product--fast arrival after pre-order. Will continue to use pre-order system because it saved money and made it very convenient.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|If you're someone who loves books and enjoys wandering through book stores, be sure to spend some time at Mr. Penumbra's.  Interesting and unique story line.  Unexpected twists and turns.  And a mystery unsolvable by modern technology.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I bought both Adele 19 and Adele 21 at the same time.  By far Adele 21 is my favorite.  I play it so often I wake up with that music in my head! Adele 19 took a little longer to warm to but I do love it also.
B008Y2IU12|4.0|The movie has a lot of good special effects Wish they had found a different way to do the movie
B000QE1U9K|4.0|My son and his friends always love a good &#34;Aliens&#34; movie. They watch them over and over again. It keeps them entertained for hours.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I got this as a lightning deal for $8, and it is amazing.  Great movie, and a WONDERFUL price for it!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A big improvement over the two most recent Clancy books.  Characters are well developed and plot lines flow seamlessly thru to the end.  4+ stars for this one.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait for the next one,nail bitting suspense. I have read the first two in the series in a matter of days. Now on to the third.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Taught me a lot about how to be a better boyfriend, brother, and person. I don't think it taught me how to be a better student...too much booze and drugs for that. Seriously, nobody I knew had a freshman year of high school like Charlie's. But that is sort of the point. The best thing Perks does is teach kids how to be active readers without finding themselves in the story...\\"witnessing\\" to a story without living it themselves. I'll just never believe anybody could smoke that much pot and still get straight A's.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Easy read with some good laughs. Would have preferred to rent. 9 more words..... why, Amazon? Four more words. There.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|There are definitely higher quality and brighter upgrades available.  But the LED is a decent upgrade with decent run-time.  The switch is not quite as sturdy as I'd have liked- it is a forward- push type with a momentary on-function but there is no discernible &#34;click&#34;once you push past the momentary phase...
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My husband and I are really enjoying Homeland ! The acting is super and the storyline is very believable. Highly recommend this series.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|The title led me to believe this movie was a continuation of the Boune movies. Not so.<br />Had it not been for the Bonus features I would not have rated it anything.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Will Ferrell is always funny!  Great family movie on Christmas, many different aspects of family ties, and belief in Santa Clause.  I loved it!

B002VX0A40|5.0|Adorabel Lamaze toy. We love this brand and its different toys and this plush toy is so cute and has lots of little extras. Deffinetly would recommend it to friends with babies/ toddlers.
1439153663|4.0|The Kitchen House was historically informative in that it brings indentured servants as well as slaves.  The characters drew me in, made me feel for them, at the same time I wanted to know them, especially the main characters, even more.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I loved this book as a child and found myself over 20 years later, reading this book to my son and rediscovering how great and funny this book is for all kids young at heart. A Sesame Street special.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I must say this game is hours and hours of fun. The game is very addicting. Keeps your mind preoccupied thoroughly.
1439181780|5.0|THIS THE MOST ENCOURAGING BOOK , I LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT I INSISTED THAT EVERYONE I THOUGHT WOULD BE INTERESTED  SHOULD READ IT, HOPEFULLY THEY GET THE SAME INFORMATION I GAIN TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE AND REALIZE THAT LIFE IS MUCH MORE THEN THEY EVER THOUGHT IT COULD BE IF THEY ONLY WOULD APPLY IT
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! It is an absolute must read! Full of suspense, romance and laughter... all in one wonderful story!
0375413405|5.0|Description are written in a fun to read and the recipes are wonderful. The assumption here is, you already know how to do some basic cooking. I have this on the kindle and i flip through it from time to time and friends' during the holiday. I had made the mushroom soup and beef with onion, and they came out great!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|As a major fan of the musical (and owner of the original cast and symphonic editions of the musical soundtrack), I was looking forward to hearing the movie's adaptation of this classic show. This CD gives exactly what it says - highlights from the movie. It has the major sections from the major songs, but it also cuts out sections in some songs that are in the movie version. (e.g. Javert telling Valjean to pick up the flag, which happens in the middle of &#34;Look Down&#34; in the movie, is not in the soundtrack version). Hugh Jackman does a good job as Valjean, though his &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; is rather disappointing. Cosette and Marius's numbers are excellent. Javert's are passable - Russell Crowe doesn't have the tambre of many of the other singers, and his songs tend to lack emotion. This is consistent with Javert's character, but doesn't make for great music. Additionally, note that a large chunk of Javert's Suicide is not included in the movie, and therefore not in this CD as well. Overall, I thought this CD was well worth the $5 I paid for it, but I wouldn't pay much more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it...can't wait till I read part 3!!..Def. one of my favorite books!!! Getting part 3 today...so excited n can't wait to read the last part

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing read. I thought it was going to be just another romance novel and was totally surprised by the outcome. I couldn't put it down!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book I just could not put it down! I love how it was written in letter form. It just gave it a different kind of feel to the book. Well anyways I thought this book was great.
B003MC5AV2|4.0|I have read all Elizabeth's books and I love every one of them. I read her book TAKE A BOW. I enjoyed every moment reading it. About 2 months after that I found her book PROM AND PREJUDICE. Loved that book too. And then this one wad just wonderful I definitely recommend any of her books.

030758836X|1.0|I cannot recall reading a book which dissappointed me more.  There is absolutely nothing to recommend it.  Much of the book was predictable; the rest was inconceivable.  I don't understand the good reviews but I certainly second the bad ones.
B004UID2LC|2.0|The problem with this app is you can't put in what you would like to see. It gives you only two choices, &#34;recent&#34; and &#34;popular&#34;.

B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Our 8 year old daughter wanted nothing for Christmas this year as much as she wanted the 7 Diary of a Wimpy Kid books. She saw the first movie and then this one and is hooked. She is now reading them all and we are thrilled. Great series for I would say 8-12 year olds. After that, you are going to lose them to vampires and wizards. :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got my fire for Christmas. This is one of the first apps I downloaded and I cannot put it down. Love it!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is very easy to use and comes in handy for various uses. I use it to read &quot;real&quot; books and don't want to disturb my wife at night. It is bright and the colors u can choose are great.  I recommend it to anyone needing a light source and have a tablet or phone.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I like the game just fine except for the fact that you seem to need way too many diamonds to purchase a lot of the things you need... and diamonds are hard to get unless you buy them with your REAL money.

0547884591|1.0|The start of the book was promising. I have always been interested in fast learning, so I thought it might be worthy. Well it is not. Let me explain.<br />1. He says he learned N languages, but never defined what is a learned language. For me it is at least B2 level (I've learned 4 foreign languages myself). However, from the writings of Mr. Ferris I understand that his targets are significantly lower. Something like to tell that you have learned Taekwon Do and it fact you have obtained an yellow belt. Yes, you will be hundred times better than the average human, who never entered in a dojang. Having in mind that Taekwon Do penetratation is less than 5% (probably less than 1%) with 3 months of training you are in the top 5% in the World. Great, but at the bottom 1% of those who actually practice. This is far from learned and extremely far from mastered.<br /><br />2. Another thing is the time needed for learning. When he says he needed 3 months to learn German it is a non-sens beacause it doesn't tell (1) The level (certified?) and (2) The time spent. Three months of full time learning is one thing and 3 months of getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning to have 2 hours before your kids wake up is another thing.<br /><br />3. Promote fast learning with a book of 600+ pages, come oooon ... and there is even more - it is for cooking, that millions of people simply do every day. And I ensure you that my wife thinks life is beautiful every time I cook. There is one thing missed. The reason why there are more kebaps and fast-food instead of fine gourmet restaurant is not the skills of the chef. It is the fact that people do need more sandwiches than black caviar.<br /><br />However, I agree for few points:<br /><br />1. Learning the basics of anything you do makes the fun better. Even you have no intention to play frequently bowling, learning the basics is fun and gives you more fun for the occasional games with co-workers or dates. For example, I practice learning the basics of a foreign language whenever I travel to a country, where people speak a language that I don't know. But with basics I mean basics (similar to the 12 sentence practice of Mr. Ferris), and not boasting after that I have learned that language.<br /><br />2. I agree that when you practice something you should not always listen to those with more experience than you. You should try other approaches. But this doesn't guarantee success (as could be assumed from this book). One time it will be a failure, another could be a success. But you don't need to buy the overpriced book of Mr. Ferris to learn this. It is enough to google \\"Siddharta Buddha\\".<br /><br />In a conclusion, a book that tells you how to be average to good in anything (a little more on cooking). But beeing good in many areas is quite easy. To be the best in one is difficult. The length of the book contradicts the idea. With that idea I would say 150 pages is the very maximum.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My nephew loves this game! He asked me to download it lol. He can play for hours! I like it too it helps me get away from the world for a little bit!

B009LDD4V4|5.0|The air might have gone out of this series after forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance \\"Bones\\" Brennan and FBI special agent Seeley Booth finally became a couple with a child last season.  Happily for fans, the show has found new ways to keep things interesting and fun.<br /><br />The end of the seventh season of \\"Bones\\" left Bones on the run with her infant child after being framed for murder by the highly skilled serial killer Christopher Pelant.  The opening of the eighth season finds Booth and her colleagues at the Jeffersonian Institute trying to clear her name.  Fortunately for the series, they succeed, although Pelant eludes justice to pose a future threat.<br /><br />This eighth season continues to feature crime-of-the-week murders for Bones, Booth, and the Jeffersonian lab rats to solve through clever forensics and Booth's old-fashioned police work.  One of the most interesting episodes is told through the eyes of the murder victim, with the assistance of a psychic (a well-cast Cindy Lauper).  Another standout episode involves a group effort to resolve a cold case whose victim turns out to be a forgotten hero of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon.<br /><br />Outside the lab, Bones has an uncomfortable but touching period of readjustment to living with Booth, after her time on the run.  Her changed perspective will lead to some of the most interesting conversations as she and Booth commute to crime scenes.  Just to complicate things, staff psychiatrist Dr. Sweets will temporarily move in with the couple right after he breaks up with girlfriend Daisy, a technician in the lab.  Series regulars Angela and Hodgins will have their own challenges as working parents.  The continuing parade of interns through the Jeffersonian crime lab will feature in several episodes, and one of them will become a surprising emotional complication for Dr. Saroyan.  Christopher Pelant will return to menace the team in a gut-wrenching season finale.<br /><br />Tune in for the fun and crime-solving of the eighth and perhaps final season of Bones; highly recommended to its fans.rime-solving of the eighth and perhaps final season of Bones; highly recommended to its fans.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I actually bought this set as a gift for my son because I got such a great price from Amazon. It's so much better than the set I bought for a higher price a couple of years ago for myself (mine didn't include the book filled with synopses of each episode and the pilot script, although it was supposed to--I didn't get it from Amazon). Now I'm so envious, I almost kept the new set for myself. Those two books are great additions to the set. We get hundreds of cable TV channels, but there are many evenings when there isn't ANYTHING I want to watch on TV. So I watch West Wing episodes in order. It's unbelievable how well these shows hold up--even the political conflicts are basically the same. The writing, the cast, the humor, the drama. Maybe the best TV show ever. Even my lame set was some of the best money I ever spent. The set from Amazon is better and less expensive.

B0098VYKSA|1.0|Poorly written, bad acting, written for teenagers, rested on the special effects. I was really disappointed, the  trailer got my hopes up. Editing was choppy, on the entire script just never flowed.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very good game,must have and its so cool to be a virus or plague that destroys the world and cause chaos and anarchy
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Am hooked on this series. The costumes, story, historical references, setting are phenomenal. I highly recommend to anyone that wants more then tabloid tv, reality tv or Hollywood fluff.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|Marilyn Manson is an artist. Visually as well as poetically. He writes and intrigues while he shocks you with unbelievable stories of sex,drugs, and rock and roll. He brings about valid questions regarding society and the norms \\"we\\"  choose to live by, albeit hypocritical as they may be. He is the product of a genius and a madman, who found his voice in artistic expression. I do not agree with most things he does.....but he makes me think.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app it does what ever I need it to do. it is a perfect app for your Bible life!
0425252868|5.0|Can't comment on the \\"Iron Curtain\\" as my husband hasn't read it yet.  But he sure loves the \\"A Higher Call\\" and he's read a little more than half.  The Japanese will never do good like what the Germans did for the POW's.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Search bar is okay.  I did not expect any more or less with this APP.  Could be a little faster on Kindle Fire.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great app!  Awesome graphics and very responsive on the the Kindle Fire.  Thanks for porting this go Android!  Totally worth the wait.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Not enough options with free play.  Have to buy game to enjoy.  Tease you into making a purchase.  No thanks.
B008XG1X18|2.0|An easy call, if you flag an inappropriate item it disables that control on your account.  I'm not disturbed by the nudes.  They are tasteful and infrequent unless you explore the other items below in the pin. I just have to keep my grandson away from his interest in the red cars.  I'll explore the issue with his mother who is teaching me manners and politeness with my granddaughter's encouragement.  Through the years I have used Neve Campbell's guidance on see-throughs and my Shreveport lady artist friend's view on taste.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Love the fact that you can see any city forecast.  There are no pop-up in the way.  Thank you for being truly FREE.
B000FBJF7I|4.0|I HAVE READ MOST, IF NOT ALL  OF THE SERIES ON BOSWANA ,AND IT HAS BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE OF THE CULTURE OF THE PEOPLE.  I WOULD SUGGEST THAT A NEW READER WOULD READ A FEW OF THE BOOKS WRITTEN BY MCCALL SMITH TO GET INTO FEEL OF THE CULTURE AND PEOPLE.  TO BECOME ONE WITH THE CHARACTERS IN THE NEXT BOOK, ETC.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|the novelty of it a harry potter style remote just a fun thing to have works well with a little practice
B000FBJF78|4.0|EACH NEW BOOK BY MCCALL SMITH TAKES ME BACK TO EARLIER BOOKS HE AS WRITTEN AND I REALLY ENJOY CONTINUING WITH THE NEW ADVENTURES OF THE CHARACTERS I'VE KNOW.  THEY HAVE BECOME &#34;OLD FRIENDS&#34;
B005LAII62|4.0|Paranorman is more morbid than I expected from an animated film. It's a brew of ghost whisperer meets wimpy kid with walking zombies. The message is a good one, though it may come across as preachy for some. The townspeople in the past did something very bad out of fear and Norman is the only one who can fix the curse that resulted from it. I didn't hate it or love it.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|As far as free apps go it was good. I'm just not as good at chess as what I thought I was apparently.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I love every episode and have ordered box sets of the next three seasons. If you love science fiction, mystery, suspense and a little bit of horror you will love this series, for it is a great mix of all of them. The characters have depth and personality. Each story has a great deal of intrigue. I also love the humor in the character Walter Bishop and his interactions with his estranged son. Once you start watching you won't be able to forget the interesting stories or 'fringe science'.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|One of my favorite personal apps.  I usually play this while I'm watching TV because its fun but still easy to play with out giving it my full attention.
B009FXIICK|5.0|This game operates very smoothly.  It is great for passing the time, but may become addictive.  I like the sound effects.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Nice app that is fun but I only got it in case my child wanted to play it.  She has her own on her IPod touch so it doesn't get much play on my Fire now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great sci-fi book destined to be one of the greatest. Howey deserves to have his name on any great authors list.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I would def say I enjoyed this book.  It was a great read and the ending thoroughly shocked me, I had no clue it would end the way that it did.
B0090O07RS|5.0|This is a nice DVD and great to watch.  Anyone who loves the Doors will like this as a present.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love my Bible on my Fire.  I also like how it sends you a daily reminder in case you might forget to read the Bible.  I like that you can choose from several different versions, that is doesn't have to be in the normal King James Version which for some readers can be difficult to understand.
0385344333|1.0|First there was the utterly bewildering choice of Tom Cruise cast as Jack Reacher in the movie. Now we have the latest Jack Reacher novel that lacks pretty much everything fans look for in a Reacher novel. To sum it up, for me at least:<br />1) No physical violence, just slow moving gunplay. Reacher's a tough guy, a well trained brawler. In the past Lee Child has choreographed the fight scenes so well that you can almost watch them in your head.<br />2)Jack Reacher has a penchant for verbal sparring as well, without coming off as some pseudo-intellectual jag-off. Here we get pedantic conversation about tactical planning, inner dialogues that go on and on and long stretches of just plain nothing.<br />3)Reacher does not drive. Though the point that he disdains driving is driven home here, still, Reacher driving is out of character.<br />The point here is that I had a difficult time slooging through this novel. Worst in the series and the ending was far too Hollywood neat & tidy.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Great video to watch in 3D with family.<br />Recoommended for kids of all ages.<br />Love this video with the family
1451627289|5.0|The historical details in this book are just phenomenal and very, very accurate - which is always the case with Mr. King. This book was the perfect combination of mystery and personality development with some humor thrown in from time to time. I have to admit that this is my very first Stephen King read - and I'm very, very pleased to have done so.
B009MO5G90|4.0|Action part was good in this video.<br />Acting could have been better.<br />3D was okay - but would of like more to make me jump out of my skin.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Still, this Ice Age kept the wry humor and heartwarming fun of its predecessors. I can highly recommend it without reserve.
B008518MOW|4.0|I was expecting more from this. The first movie was better. 3D effect was not bad but there could have been more. If there is another one, hope they make it better
1577314808|1.0|I am in total agreement with the other one star reviewers... this book is a sad joke and proof absolute that one can make tons of money in America simply by hiring the right advertising/promotion agency!<br /><br />Eckart Tolle is an absolute fake, phoney, farse and the Premiere Jokster of the American Fadist Public... no wonder the Europeans laugh at us!  He Laughs all the way to the BANK!<br /><br />He is the Leader of the truly unenlightened... unevolved... clueless \\"Sheep\\" minded ... fadists of America!<br /><br />His followers are of the same mentality as those who so blindly followed Jim Jones to their death... right down that perverbial yellow brick road and right off the cliff into the abyss!<br /><br />HELLO anybody HOME???<br /><br />I am an Ordained Christian-Spiritualist Reverend of an Internatinally Accredited Church...<br />I am truly enlightened and connected to the GodHead and do not have to read works by false prophets and capitalistic money mongers like Eckhart Tolle!
B007XF0X6G|4.0|Acting not bad but could be better.<br />3D effect was good but could use more spine chilling effects.<br />This is a good video to see in 3D
1419701533|5.0|I'm very happy because I bought this books for my Kid and he is very excite, at this time I have to said that this is helping to him because he is reading all the time instead play Play Station 3.
B007M45PMU|5.0|after having heard a a couple of songs off this i bought the whole album and am glad i did.  great mix of low key melodies and more upbeat tracks.  perfect for playing while kicking around the house or at the office.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I could read this book over and over without getting tired of it. It's extraordinarily amazing. It's definitely a must read
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't ever write reviews for books and I read a book per day. But, this book took my breath away. Not only is it one of the sweetest, most beautiful and real romances I've ever read, but it is funny yet gut wrenching; relatable but incredibly shocking. Just when I thought I had Sky's story all figured out, the curve ball floored me. Holder is a wonderful and refreshing take on the irresistible hero. In most of the books I've read, the heroine is always slightly annoying, but Sky reacts to everything the way you would expect a real 17 year old to react. This book is so much more than a romance though and contains material that may be too hard for some. I have 2 young daughters myself and my heart was breaking for the little girl Sky. 3 words: READ THIS BOOK!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game is cute and fun, but it takes too long to build your energy, and I certainly<br />shouldn't have to buy it to keep playing. Fix that and it would be perfect.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|He has a specific voice and not everone wil like that, but the music makes you smile. uptempo cheerfull.<br />The music resembles the music of Jack Johnson.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It is a nice compact case.<br />It is light and easy to carry everywhere.<br />Nice protection for my Kindle Fire.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|My coworker recommended this book. I enjoyed reading it. I have recommended it to others that I knew would like it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Although this is marketed for a slightly younger age group, I couldn't seem to stop reading. I kept wanting to read on. Definitely kept me on my toes.
0740748475|5.0|It's Calvin and Hobbes, how could you go wrong?  Great quality, wonderful content, nice binding.  The only issue was the weight when shipping caused a slight dent to the corner of the box and one of the volumes but nothing to take away from the content.
0385536828|5.0|Heard about this title on NPR and it sounded like a good story. Mama likes it so do I too
B0063IH60K|5.0|I LOVE IT! THE AUTO COMPLETE IS A GREAT FEATURE! Play the best game on the planet!<br /> IT is easy and fun what more do u want?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun for children and adults! Our 7 yr old grandson plays this constantly and wins!  Hours of fun for everyone
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Antifragile does something that very few other books can achieve, introduce very thought provoking ideas and concepts in a manner that allows one to \\"contemplate\\" while continuing to read.<br /><br />The core idea from which everything else in the book stems from is antifragility. Everything either gains or loses from volatility; to lose is to be fragile and therefore to gain is to be antifragile. However, to say this summarizes the book would be a horrible mistake.<br /><br />Some reviewers have criticized Taleb for not organizing the book to be \\"more like a textbook\\", but it is the lack of rigid and bland structure that makes this book hard to put down. One does not simply skim the book and fully grasp the central ideas being presented. But in the same sense, because topics are revisited throughout the book, so its easy to see how everything is interconnected.<br /><br />Taleb's tendency to create words or phrases (several in this case) is rather amusing. It highlights his understanding of the topic because it shows he recognizes a deficit in the current understanding. His frequent use of fictional characters to illustrate a point keeps the book fresh. Again, others have complained about this, but these are some defining features that differentiate this book from other, less readable books.<br /><br />Personally, I found the most impressive feat Taleb achieves in Antifragile is demonstrating how the concepts of antifragility, optionality, and via negativa are applicable in multiple disciplines and contexts (domain independence). All nonlinear, and hence complex systems, have similar attributes that can be exploited without even needing to understand the system. I feel this is the point where some might have trouble with this book. For example, for someone with a certain fondness for the medical community might have a tough time swallowing the idea and ramifications of iatrogenics.<br /><br />Overall, Antifragile is a philosophical, insightful book that will not disappoint.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This is a must for any Christmas collection. Very well done and not just another set of cheezy Christmas songs put hastily together. Great sounding duets with Mary J Blige, Michael Buble, Ce Lo Green and Ella Fitsgerarld. Very well produced and arranged by David Foster.  Every song sounds new and fresh and not just a re-do of the Christmas classics. Auld Lang Syne arrangement, is especially smooth and enjoyable with the added bagpipes. If you liked all of his American Songbook classics, you will appreciate this one for sure.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Never read this before but understand why everyone likes it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|Sit back and get ready to feel like you are at a live concert with Paul. Thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. Took a bit to receive this but worth the wait.
B006CHML4I|5.0|This is a great automatic watch that you can wear for pleasure or business.  This is the standard that timex strives to be.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I LIKE THE GAME , I  PLAY TO RELAX AFTER WORK.  HAVE IT ON MY COMPUTER, AND TABLET, AND ON MY PHONE.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Challenging and fun. There were no problems playing the game on the kindle fire.  I even found myself looking up information about Tesla&hellip;in order to know more about him.  Keep building great games.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I can honestly say that this book truly was amazing. It showed the true feelings of a teenager going through tough times, but putting his troubles back to care for others around him. I recommend this book to anyone.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|My 10 year old and 7 year old loved the album. It was a perfect Christmas gift for them. .
B0002F6BRE|5.0|So well written, and directed. Nobody else could play this part except Will Ferrel. His commitment to the character of the Elf is unparalleled. He is spot on perfect at playing a naive, charming elf boy/man. Don't hesitate to rent or buy this one. It's an absolute classic. Five perfect stars for this one!
B003WTE886|5.0|My 9 year old loves this album and I find it nice to listen to. . . . . .
B00942S4OY|5.0|If you love one direction purchase this cd, ask your mom if you're not old enough. But my cd came in perfect condition, thanks to amazon!
B0014I4KH6|5.0|My 10 year old and 7 year old loved the album. It was a perfect Christmas gift for them. .
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I am having a good time with this app.<br />It's nice to be able to edit photos right from  my phone.<br />Thanks.
B009LY72LQ|4.0|Paid $6. So for the price not bad. Like everyone else said the wig falls off. We fixed this issue with a small piece of scotch tape. We wrapped it around the stick on the wig. No problem since. It comes with one wig, but two heads, my girls fixed this by using a sharpie that matched the monster high and colored hair in.  Looks cute and they had fun using their imagination. Which is really why they liked the barbie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a good book and I'm a very picky reader when it comes to these types of books but I love this book and it only took me 30 min
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books.  Love them.  This one was interesting but predictable at the end.  Would recommend to others since the plot was okay.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I really loved this series and am looking forward to the next books! Would like to get the DVDès next.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|I gave this CD as a Christmas gift and the recipient was very pleased since she collects and watches the older movies.
0375703764|5.0|Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves is a lit-lover's dream come true!  This is a story within a story within a story, being narrated by a character narrating another characters narration of another characters narration.  Did that make any sense at all?  It's dizzying, claustrophobic, and not for the faint of heart.  I can't even begin to describe the depths of this book.  All I really know is that in order to get to the end this very long book, you must be a book nerd in the truest sense, and have a lot of time and patience at hand.  But it is beyond worth all of the work that goes into reading this book!  I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, but I think on the first read, I only captured a fraction of the brilliance within this book.  At the end of the book, I was so in awe of what was inside it, that I started to think about what it must have taken to actually write it.  This book is so complex and so incredibly well put together, I imagine for an author it would take an entire lifetime to write it.  Mark Z. Danielewski is probably insane, but he is also probably a genious!  Also, I purchased the special edition, and it was absolutely beautiful, inside and out.  Book Nerds:  READ THIS BOOK!!!  You won't regret it!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I have started the book twice.  Didn't hold my interest at first.  I plan to finish it when I get the opportunity.  It was one that &#34;I could put down.&#34;
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Hey, it's Abercrombie with a western feel. Whats not to love? I had a great time reading this. Gotta keep making words to submit a review.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Wow.  I love this CD.  Did not expect to enjoy it so much.  Like Paul McCartney but not a great fan of his.  I am now.  Hope he puts out another similar CD.  I would definitely buy it and I would recommend this one to others.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I really enjoy this book every time I read it. A Christmas Carol is my favorite book of the season.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have a lot of Amazon mp3s on hard drive, and have been missing them since my laptop started acting crazy.  I wanted to pull them down from the cloud onto my phone but kept putting it off.  The app makes it too easy to keep procrastinating.  You can download or stream and shop for more music and buy with 1-click. The app functions fine on my HTC Incredible 2, no bugs so far.  Recommend it without hesitation.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this is an awesome game. it has amazing graphics, hidden puzzles and a good plot. I loved the free version so much I bought (unlocked)  the full version in the game (it's cheaper that way) . I was completely addicted, highly recommend it and can't. wait for the next installment
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For a quick , very sharp edge on any knife , I carry one with me , very handy .
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Here is the complete collection of Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories in a Kindle ready package. If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes, this a perfect addition to your e-reader. I have a bound edition, but it is not very portable, so the e-reader version fills the bill for travel entertainment.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Ok. The box arrived today (9 days before estimated) and i was glad about it. But the thing is the overall box set looks cheap and not too well thought. If you want the movies with a bit of extras this is right for you. But don't expect a superb package remember you're not paying that much. All in all, a great product and the cheapest way to have the Nolan movies in your collection. I got lucky and my discs were not defective or repeated. Now...off to watch the movies!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|OK - the story line is a bit over the top, but the characters are likeable in the extreme. Plenty of political intrigue and Mary Louise Parker steals the show with just a few lines. A great evening's diversion!
0156012197|5.0|Great gift, especially for adults that need to remember there's more to life than what we can see with our eyes.  A classic!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is the best book ever. the author's description of the circus made me feel like i was really there. the characters are so likable!
B009GEYX5E|5.0|So glad this film is available and at a good price (relatively speaking!)  Go to this company's website ([...]) to read up on the company.  Love the film, the pictures have that &#34;vintage&#34; look to them which is what we were trying to recreate.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle is very convenient. I have kindle on my phone, tablet and computer. I don't buy hard covered books anymore. There's no need. I can read anytime or in any place.
0061122416|5.0|So much has been written about this book, I can't add to all the great reviews other than to say it really is an inspirational book that more people should read.  It reminds us that we all have a personal legend to fulfill, we should step out of our busy lives once in a while to ponder the themes in this book.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This is awesome. I got the dvd set in the mail rather fast and it was in the shape that they said it would be in. Love it.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Good, but not as good as it could have been. Just so so compared to some of the past movies.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I thought my son in law was crazy when he downloaded this for me, as I thought it would be too childish!  Big surprise.  I'm already addicted!  Great freebie!
B000IONJJ2|5.0|Very funny. Cleese is hilarious, Palin couldn't be more adorable, and Jamie Lee Curtis was pleasantly surprising. The cameo of Stephen Fry made it even more worth-while. If you haven't watched it, then you won't regret seeing it. It's brilliant.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is pretty much the game that brought indie games into the limelight.<br /><br />Simple, addictive, funny, casual, some strategic depth, but easy to play for all ages and skill levels would sum this game up in a sentence. I don't want to rehash too much from other reviews.<br /><br />The graphics after years are not showing their age at all. The cartoony feel is still great and modern. The strategy and fun factors have not changed with age either.<br /><br />This game has a metascore from all pro-reviewers of 90% which is superb for an Indie game.<br /><br />The original release was not in 2012.. it's been around on the PC since OCt 13, 2008.<br /><br />Hope that helps!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I thought it was entertaining. Not too much drama, but a good story line. It was a quick watch and well done.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|What a fantastic 1st season! Sgt Brody? Is he a good guy? Is he bad? And Claire Danes, what a great actress! She does crazy so well! But is she crazy? Hmmm.....
B00499QUK2|4.0|We (the family) loved this movie. What I liked about it was that Dr. Watson was not a pushover, he really was a strong character, unlike many portrayals. I like the fact that this is set in the modern day with even more intriguing potential in other episodes.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Price was good and it's a good cover for the price not fancy and it will stand so it's good.
B00003CXBK|4.0|When the kids rented this three times from the library, I knew I had to buy it. They still watch it. Note that it is not meant for young children, because it has a lot of frightening scenes and bit of gore.<br />If you want to know what early China was like, this may help. The scenes and customs looked authentic enough to catch my eye.
B007SGM084|4.0|A story that captures you from the beginning. It made me wanting to come home from work and read the rest of the night. The only thing about the books that I found surprisingly dull was the sexual encounters between Christian & Anastasia after their first encounters. Granted this is the primary reason I was told to read this book, because of the sex, but after a while it became kinda boring. Besides the sex I felt the books contained enough of a story to keep me coming back to find out what was going to happen with Christian & Anastasia.<br />I would recommend these books not because of the sex but because I found myself caring about the characters.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|I had to delete. every time I went to use the flashlight it said unable, the flash was occupied already by another app.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|so the app will now show more than a dozen posts but now if you go to read an article attached to your news feed you cant go back to the app where you left off.  really....how difficult is this?  so i will keep using the desktop or mobile version until this problem is solved.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|not completely compatible with my device. I not able to read any of the options, but still kinda fun to play.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I think the Theodore Boone series is creative and clever. John placed a 13 year old in a court where no matter what case is going on Theo B. is there to get into the thick of things! He always manages to get himself into trouble involving the case! It's pure genius!!!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|It pretty great for a game, very fun. It didn't lag  or glitch out but the ads are annoying but still a fun game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Thai this game is super awesome you should a pit absolutely get this  awesome game people I play the XBOX360 and my game tag is sk8 4 life03! But my friends list is almost full hurry up and add me!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I downloaded this book around lunch time and did not put it down until I finished reading it. I was captivated from the beginning. As I have traveled to may places around the world, I feel that Yann Martel's vivid descriptions of India as seen through the eyes of Piscane were very well written. It took me on an incredible adventure as the book progressed, both spiritually and emotionally. I highly recommend this book to any reader who loves to get lost in a good book.
0760703329|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter for Christmas. The book arrived on time and was packaged very well to protect the book. My grandaughter loved it and started reading it on Christmas Day.
1419705849|5.0|As are all of his books this one is funny and entertaining.good story for all generations, my son reads them first then my teen daughter, then me.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I have 2 son ,I bought this book when I had my second son! In 1991! Gave each  one this book,I don't think they have ever read it! But as a mother ,these 2 are my reason for living! Proud of both of them! My oldest son Bobby is 36 , Albert D. Is 21 !!! I'm 54 ,and have not been the best mother to them! Made to many mistakes and have regrets! But these 2 are not one of them!  Thank you God for my sons!!!! I love this book! It's a small book, but with a powerful meaning! A mother love!!! For her babies!!!!  F.P.R.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|I couldn't down load this app even though it says I did,would love to try to play it If I could
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great book...Author wrote in a way that had me turning the pages till the end! I intend to read the entire quintet and don't have a doubt  in my mind that the last will be just as good as the first!
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Very funny movie, I'd get it. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are great in this action-comedy. This movie does get boring at any part of the film.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved all the action and suspense from start to end. Can't wait to start next book. Didn't see movie loved the book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I think this book is very true to task. As I may not have been a S.E.A.L. I am an Army Gulf War Veteran. The way he wrote and explained the situations were very true to the core. Thank you Chris for sharing this story with us.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so great!! I play it all the time its awesome!! I love it. everyone should be playing it
B009VB9VKY|2.0|This movie was dull and forced.  The only reason to see it is to ogle Channing Tatum and to see familiar sites in Tampa Bay...Glad I used a free credit and didn't have to pay for this drivel
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved the first instalment of the Percy Jackson series and the second didn't let me down! Rick really knows how to breath new life into Greek mythology!
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I liked it a lot<br />Because it told their story by them and they told the story and just because  I love one direction.
B008KFS77U|5.0|I kind of went crazy with whitelists, blacklists, and other settings and managed to get my poor kindle to the point where it was hard to wake it up and enter the pin to \\"log in\\". I reset the software to its default settings and it now seems to work just fine. I use K-9 email and that syncs up as it should to fetch new email during the start of an \\"on\\" period. The simple cycling of the wifi to \\"on\\" for a minute or so every 15 minutes has made a big change in battery consumption. If I were meticulous about switching the wifi to \\"airplane mode\\" when I don't need it, I could get the same battery life benefit for free, but this is much easier.

1451627297|5.0|This novel is one of Stephen King's best. An unusual idea and very well done. Even at over 800 pages, it was over too soon for me. Some say they thought the middle section was boring, but I thought it made the main character and his objective (saving JFK from assassination) all the more important. King makes time travel totally believable. Truly a great book.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Well I really like this dictionary because it helps me when I don't understand something like hard words or math words that most people don't know or understand that's why rated it a five and because I love it a lot
B004WR125O|5.0|A must have if your using your PC as your music library. Thank you Onkyo / Amazon for including it with my Onkyo 616
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book ended up being so much better than I expected-- because of all the hype.  I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and message of the book.  I highly recommend this book.
B001LF347E|4.0|This was bought for a 16 year old who requested it.  I assume he will like it.  It arrived on time.
1454901276|3.0|I'm a bit hesitant in how to explain my reaction to this book, since much depends on how you approach it.  I started it reading it with the assumption it was an atmospheric police procedural that occurred in isles off  the coast of Scotland.  Mystery stories do vary.  Some meander off a bit to provide more indepth history, location ambience, character development, etc.  Nevertheless,  the process of resolving the crime propels the story forward and is the focus. In this case, the mystery is just secondary to telling a rather long, complicated  melodramatic tale.  Relatively little time is spent on the actual process of determining the culprit. The author is capable, but for me an editor might have made the book a little crisper and faster moving, even if you were just reading it as a novel.  And, the melodrama is a bit farfetched, and might be more appropriate for a television soap opera, in which you spread the many catastrophes out over time.<br />From reading other reader reviews, it is clear that for some this story worked quite well. And I understand why-the author writes well.  When writers simply don't engage me, I don't finish the book, and I did finish this one.  And, perhaps if I had understood it was not a true mystery book, I might have approached it with more patience.
B00006CXSS|3.0|CD's in great condition and played no problem, case missing and the picture showed the case I did expect the case to come with the CD
B008AUGEFC|5.0|I enjoyed Cloud Atlas, especially as I got deeply into it. I don't know that the links that the stories share are important, in and of themselves. However, simply by existing they suggest that the stories be considered as a whole having something to say. About halfway through I began to get a vague sense of a whole.  The second half of the book has substantial hints.  I mainly read nonfiction, so I am used to books that have to be read twice. The first time through gives the lay of the land so that the second time the details can be understood in context. Cloud Atlas seems to me to be like that.<br /><br />Engaging to see an artist play with form...
B009HELT3C|4.0|Love the series this one had more special effects and great comedy. its hidden so listen carefully and the little pug is all over the place

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This was the best book of all the 3 books I read. I liked the change of pace from other romance books. However I was not as pleased with the books that followed this one.
B001FW58D6|5.0|I am amazed at the way this show takes the viewers in from the first few minutes and brings us to the edge of our seats.  As we are watching the plot unfold, it is akin to the tick..tick..tick of the rollercoaster as we ascend to the top of the hill.  Special effects and cleverly-written twists are like the loops and jerks of a wild, fantastic ride.<br /><br />I'm hooked!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Whether you've read his other books or not, you're in for some forehead slapping common sense and efficiency techniques you'll regret not learning from any school.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just an absolutely great story that will have you turning every page with bated breath. Great characters, great story, great suspense. Written in a way that produces vivid images in my head, more colorful than any Hollywood movie. Wow.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This woman has the most powerful voice and I never get tired of listening to her sing.  Even play it in my car.
B000QZ1LXO|5.0|The unit worked well in a medium-sized room and could pickup a low volume whisper 15 feet away. Volume control wheel is easy to use. Microphone is sensitive and will pickup a majority of the noise in a crowded room, but the microphone can be aimed toward a sound source. Good value for the price.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Tight plot, well written, twist & turns and good reading. Amazon delivered as promised and easy to order books on line. vertually every book written is available. love my Kindle
B005G4TJI4|5.0|i must say, i loved this one the most. better girl actor than megan fox in this one. this movie has alot of eye candy and alot of action scenes. loved it!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Seriously don't even think about it purchase this now and sit back and enjoy some of the Best Blues you'll ever hear.....  My only disappointment is that there isn't more....
B004EPYZSU|5.0|alot of action and good cinematography. i love the acting too. good storyline. my family enjoyed watching this awesome movie.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I watched the movie years ago but I decided to read the book. Books are often better anyway. It was great!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|a very cool game to play. quick and simple. a no brained. great for a lazy rainy day to play.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi was a great book. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a character driven narrative instead of a plot driven one.
B0084ANCBC|5.0|I got this on kindle for convenience.  Fun to read while waiting around.  Also it is free, so why not.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a fantastic book very inspirational and different. If you are looking for a different read or a book that just makes you keep turning the page and you aren't sure why this is the book. It's very good. The boy goes through many troubles in the end figures out the end meanings of life and why things happen. Really recommend!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have read all her books & she never disappoints. I'm always ready for another one with Kay Scarpetta.Hope she continues to write about her. This series is my favorite. I now enjoy reading on my kindle.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|If you're a big fan of the novel, do not watch. You'll hate how they adapted the novel into movie form and wish they had done it better.
1904994768|5.0|my grandson loved this book even though it is a year ago since buying it didnt realize reviews were still on system
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|We all love this series but we watched it much to fast. eight more words to go so here they are.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long long time. So good i watched it twice. Definitely recommend to adults only.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|All of the Tinker Bell movies are great, but this one in particular hits my heart. Maybe it's the sister thing or the magical wings. Any young child at heart would love this movie. Even adults like myself probably would love this movie. Tinker Bell is just cute, cute, cute.
B005OK81HA|4.0|Was all the great song they made in the past, some must be new, I don't remember ever hearing them all, but it sounds great
B005LAIHZY|5.0|You haven't seen this? Are you a nutter? Get it now! I love the 7.1 sound of the Blu-Ray version. Otherwise I don't have much too add about the format itself.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I brought the CD for one song that I liked, but I found the whole CD to be entertaining and worth the money
B0083SBMBM|3.0|This is another case of over-hype.  When it was out in the theaters and then later when it was released on DVD people were clamoring and slobbering with praise over this thing.  I waited a while before watching it.  What a disappointment for me!<br /><br />Nothing really new here.  A few clever quips, a lot of boring filler dialog, and overkill on the effects and everything else.  I'm glad I saw it, but I was yawning and antsy for the whole mess to end.  Weren't some of the same effects and scenes in other bad movies like TRANSFORMERS: DARK SIDE OF THE MOON?  It all looked familiar.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr carries this film.  The dumb haughty-speaking Asgards, Loki and Thor, were rather annoying.  \\"Shakespeare in the park\\" is what Ironman refers to them as--yes, apt description.<br /><br />Effect-laden, rambling-speeched, blah-blah-blah.  This film could have had an hour or so trimmed from it and it would have been more tolerable.  Sometimes more is not better, it's just more.
B004GCQ2WS|3.0|I brought the CD for two of the songs I heard on the radio. I didn't hate it but a little disappointed
1451688091|5.0|President Lincoln was a remarkable, brilliant man.<br />This is a beautifully written, fascinating book. I could not put it down.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|I was never a big fan but I liked this cd it was worth the money The best cd he made.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project - Pyramid<br /><br />  Pyramid was the 3rd album by the art rock genius of Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson.  This was another album that I grew up with and never stopped listening to and still marvel at it's cleverness and beauty to this day.<br /><br />  No question that the pyramid title and imaging was adopted from Parsons' work as engineer on Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" (also 1973) but sonically these albums really don't have much in common.....although both great IMHO!.<br /><br />  The crazy thing is that Eric Woolfson who had one of the most beautiful voices in all of music history didnt lead sing on any track on this album and only did some backup.  Instead Parsons called on Colin Blunstone (Zombies) , David Patton (Pilot), Lenny Zakatek, Dean Ford (Marmalade) , Ian Bairnson and John Miles (Parsons also produced his first solo album) to handle the lead vocals. The Orchestra on Pyramid was as usual arranged and produced by Andrew Powell who was a key member of the APP.<br /><br />  Pyramid has always been under the shield of envy of 1977's \\"I Robot\\" and really fits into the category of the classic THIRD album syndrome.  Regardless of the critics many APP fans cite Pyramid as one of the best albums they ever released and remains for this fan a prozed album in my collection.

B000021Y7W|5.0|Excellent music.. ONe of the best live band movies ever made. A pleasure to watch all the time. I love this.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Like Madonna but no everything on her CD's, this was everything that I liked to hear but but nothing added.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun and addicting game.  Kept us up late last night. Comes highly recommended.  You'll have to limit your playing time, so as not to spend all your time on it.
B0079R8IYW|2.0|It's OK but too hard to put in the back clip to set it up.  Would like to have two way to set it up.  A little too upright.  Otherwise it Ok case.  Protects good

B009FB3XTA|5.0|This is as good as all the ones before this one. I like how the combine song clips from the othr movies
B005K17RU0|5.0|LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT IT OTHER LOCATIONS BESIDES MY HOME SITE!  I can view the area that I'm going to visit; I can view where my children are for work; it has 15 day review so you can see predictions for actual dates when you want to visit; gives detailed information on wind condition/precipitation/etc. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE!
B005HV6Y84|5.0|This is as good as the other sound tracks and the movies. I guess I'm a twilight junkie! Good listenening
B0086700CM|4.0|I loved the tutorial version because it is slower paced. I like the game but boy is it fast! As a senior citizen I'm struggling to get over 4,000, but I'm not stopping it is fun. The whole family enjoys it too. They thought it was just some simple point and click game, but noooo! You have to run/jump over roots/water/walls and collect money on the way.  It includes various means of dexterity including moving the actual Kindle from side to side and then swish right/left/down the center/jump or CRASH/SPLAT!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Very good album. Rod still has that raspy voice we all love.  He did an excellent job with thuis albun A+
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie was good and can't wait to get Taken 2. Liam Neeson played a bad ass guy in this movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its confusing. I cant get past the second room. it should have easier instruction. too many things to do to get to the next level.
B002VHI8FE|2.0|Read a little like a Conan book, had an unpolished feel to me. If his writing was as mature as the language used, and a little more thought were put into it I would give more stars and be jumping on the next books. As it stands I will be looking elsewhere.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What can I say it's an Adobe product and works like a charm... I can say no more, it is just great to be able to view the PDF files that I use.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|Really very thoughtful, it is hard to present a balanced opinion (even though the author tries) when faced with such common cruelty. A life changing and affirming book.
031603441X|5.0|this is a fabulous and engrossing read.  Richards comes across as thoughtful, informed, incisive, funny, and tender in his observations on music history, human nature, and the Stones.  he's frank about his drug use and laughs easily at his own moron behavior.  the best part for me is the inside stories on the Exile on Main Street days.  this is a true insight into the Stones and why they sound the way they do.  i will likely read this book many times.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|The book is really good.  It was a fantastic historical novel.  It is the story of King Alfred and what happens after he dies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm a freshman in college and this book just brought me to tears. Very touching. I cannot wait to see the movie now!
B000FC1AOI|5.0|I saw the movie with my now-husband on our first date.  After watching the movie, I figured that I would give the book a try, and I'm glad I did! The story of Holly and Gerry is a sweet, yet sad one.  Anyone who needs a sweet love story will enjoy this!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read all the time and have an extensive collection of books I love. This book has made it into my top ten. I loved the story and the way every detail was expressive and well thought out. I think most of the readers fell in love with Will. But the cherry on top for me was all of the Avett Brothers music. It was a truly beautiful story.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Purchased this one for my 3 year old and she's already had a dollars worth of fun with it. No, this is not a super detail oriented app, but it does have some fun options to play with and alot of colors to chose from whether you are using the paint brush, crayons or pencils etc.. People who have given this app a bad review either expected way more adjustable setings as far as brush size etc., or mistakingly downloaded this app and found out it was not compatible with their device. For me, it has humored my daughter and she can easily use it on the Kindle that Santa just brought.<br />P.S. She particularly enjoys the animal sticker section of this app, and the little star and heart stampers.
B00123IAHO|5.0|I can barely remember the movie, but the music on this album is classic.  Curtis Mayfield was a genius in his own time.  He left us some great music to enjoy.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am very disappointed in the facebook app. It only gives you like 10 stories in news feed and cuts you off. You can't scroll down either. I've seen others are also unhappy with this so i'm not alone.... My daughters both have the samsung tablets and their facebook works just like being on a computer. This app needs to be fixed, especially with how popular facebook is.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This whole series was great! I couldn't stop reading them and wanting more. I didn't even want to stop to sleep! I've read them 3 times over. I LOVE Fifty!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was good, it kept me interested and wanting to find out more through most of the book. But, it kind of got absurd towards the end and I, personally, don't like books that leave me guessing about the ending. Just my own foible.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This whole series was great! I couldn't stop reading them and wanting more. I didn't even want to stop to sleep! What's not to love. This was so good!
B00632HWOG|4.0|I really like this app because it is just like yahoo on the computer great job I should of downloaded this sooner

034553154X|5.0|Illustrated by the awesome Marc Simonetti, this calendar features artwork from ALL of the novels that are currently in print. That is how it should be presented and it works well. The imagery is sharp and focused and thrilling at the same time as he gives us his interpretations of George R R Martin's wonderful world of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms. A fantastic purchase for all fans of 'A Song of Ice and Fire'!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Such a sweet story.  I love almost all nicholas sparks books.  I wanted to read this before seeing the movie, and becuase it was so good I'm tempted not to see the movie at all.  Wonderful story, great twists and turns as always.
B009GED3HS|5.0|The show makes you feel nostalgic, and keeps you guessing what is coming next.  Very funny cast.  Great writing.  Can't wait for the next episode

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This little calculator program works great. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a little boost when it comes to basic math functions.
B0037B6QSY|3.0|I read it as an introduction to mindfulness.  It is helpful, but much more comprehensive in scope.  I expect to continue to appreciate it as I progress to more advanced issues.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Loved this movie if you haven't seen it you should. Channing Tatum and all the guys were great. A must see film.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I bought the first few episodes to catch up and am enjoying the series.  I was skeptical that they could keep the story going for an entire series, but have been happily surprised with the evolving script.  Excellent cast.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Easy to attach easy to use great product! Very light weight and stand is easy to use I want to order one for my kindle 8.9
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Very fun and addictive game play. Graphics are incredibly crisp and quite possibly the best looking game on my tablet.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun hidden object game, but the &quot;phenomena&quot; are too much of a money grab. otherwise it is fun. I refuse to pay in game for that kind of thing.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The 1-3 ads popping up at every game are annoying and have adult content.  Not good b/c of that but otherwise the game itself is good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This Season is Fantastic. Awesome Writing. Best Season of Walking Dead So Far.  4 out 5 Zombies Agree... this is the best season of them all so far.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Smiled and cried while reading. Cried a lot actually. Well written in every way.  I highly recommend this awesome book .
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought this book was pretty funny I just wish they would talk more than about the Valentine's dance. bye
0593070631|5.0|She has not put the book down since she got it and I know that she loves it...it was here before Christmas and everything was good to go...
B007MNV5WU|3.0|its outrageous that the &quot;update&quot; deletes your data during the updates download. I mean, I love this game, but I don't play it that much anymore in result.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I had said I would never read another holocaust book, but I read this one. I was horrified, as usual, but I had to keep reading. Ending a bit contrived, but good.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The book was really good.  It kept me reading so I finished reading the book in two days.  I highly recommend the book.
B006O6F932|3.0|The Monster High School Playest is such an amazing idea Mattel created!<br /><br />This set includes no paintjob on the actual school, however several accesories do. The walls are just large stickers covering colered plastic, so they may peel. Both the cafeteria floor and the classroom floor are made of a simple thick paper, and are a bit flimbsy, so I recommend being careful when folding up the playest when it is not being used.<br /><br />I have noticed many complaints on the school set not staying put, and I did not find this true. There is a latter/staircase in which your ghouls can use to get to the second floor, and the bottom of it places into a couple of small holes to keep in place. There are two plastic spiderwebs that fold over and hold the second floor up, and to top that, there is a small latch on the top of the locker area to hook into a slot under the second floor, which makes the entire left side of the school sturdy.<br /><br />The right side of the school, however, is not 100% sturdy,but it doe not fall over or anything, so it should be fine.<br /><br />This set also includes a fair amount of furniture, which can be difficult to assemble.  The blue rolling cart was especially difficult to assemble. Parents should be available to assist in assembly as necessary. There are detailed instructions for assembly.  Make sure you have everything before you start. This was actually missing one of the stands that the gargoyle sits upon.  That was a disappointment.  You can call Mattel support if you don't have everything.<br /><br />I see this set as one in which would be nearly impossible to find complete in the future, so I recommend you keep every peice of furniture and other items in plastic baggies and boxes.<br /><br />A positive thing is that this school does fold up nicely upon itself and it actually can be stored in a small space.  When it isn't folded up it is very large.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to fans who want to have everything they can that is Monster High but for the price tag it's not necessary.  I think this is worth more like $75.00.t is Monster High but for the price tag it's not necessary.  I think this is worth more like $75.00.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|The graphics aren't even that good  it flips up side down half time plus you don't even know where he is at the beginning because of how little you can see.the notes are so easy to find I found 7of them before slender slender  man trapped me in the cabbin with the  tv even t though he had not come  out in the game at all yet .he spawns<br /> rite next to me
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nice calculator to have on youur Kindle.  Not much to say, but know that its a good, basic calculator.  One nice feature is that it keeps a running log of your calculations, like an adding machine tape.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I'm usually not much of a non-fiction reader, but I read this for a book club, and genuinely enjoyed it.  Even though I was not able to relate to the author's amazing irresponsibility, I found it a very well written and compelling read.
0525951652|5.0|Pillars of the Earth is probably my favorite book. I enjoyed this one just about as much. The characters are all real and relatable. I loved how Follet showed the contrast between what was going on in different societies around the world at the same time--during World War I.
B008SVFX96|4.0|This is a really good effort from Richie Sambora; his guitar playing is excellent but yes a bit too electronically processed on some songs. My big problem is with his drummer's choice of cymbal. One of his cymbals seems like it has rivets or something bouncing around on it; maybe it too is somehow processed electronically, but there seems to be a hissing or shushing coming from the cymbal kit that is masking the really clean and pure sound of Richie's guitar and the rest of the band for that matter, it's like a white noise that covers up the nuances of the guitars instead of supporting them. It sounds like a very high frequency metallic noise that cancels some of the low end impact.<br /><br />Anyway, Richie sounds best when it's just him and his guitar like on the opening of \\"I'll Always Walk Beside You\\". I think he should do an unplugged blues album next. Or a power blues trio; bass, drums and guitar a la Cream. Other standout cuts for me are \\"Taking a Chance on The Wind\\" and \\"You Can Only Get So High\\". Nice Work. Recommended.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Best movie I've seen the acting was perfect with all characters and I learned a lot. The perfect movie to watch on Friday nights.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Addicting.  Lots of fun, but doesn't save game if you have to stop midgame.  Like the different levels and games
1451696191|5.0|Upon purchasing \\"Perks of being a wallflower\\", I had expectations of this novel being another stereotypical teen sob story depicting the hardships that any standard coming of age novel would provide. However, I was proven wrong. In fact, I would be as bold to say that this novel was the best I have ever read. Perhaps it was the moving yet at the same time simplistic style in which Chbosky grabbed my attention. After all, the book is written in a diary entry style. The style that Chbosky used to write this novel is unique, but more importantly, it helps one to feel as if the main character, Charlie, is writing or talking to you. All of Charlie's experiences throughout high school are depicted so intricately that the reader feels as if they are experiencing every major event that occurs along with him. The novel pulled every possible emotion out of me, from pure bliss to gut-wrenching heartache. This novel is greater than your average coming of age story, however. Disregarding age, Charlie's personality and thoughts represent what I believe to be the pure honesty and simplicity as well as confusion and fear that comes along with any human who is brought up in this world. He represents the sincerity that many people, regardless of age, spend years trying to cover up. Charlie is far from the \\"perfect\\" character, considering the fact that he is an introvert who can at times overanalyze life as more of an observing bystander than fully participate in it himself. However, his introvert tendencies do attribute to his heightened awareness of the world around him. The cause of Charlie's wallflower tendencies is left unknown until the end of the novel, which was a perfect setup on Chbosky's part, as it left me wondering what was wrong with Charlie in the first place. I had a hard time getting my mind around the fact that there was indeed something \\"wrong\\" with him, because to me he seemed to be a refreshingly thoughtful character. The ending left me in a state of uncertainty in regard to Charlie's future, but I interpreted the ending in a positive light. I think that Charlie has overcome his fear and because of this, he decides to start really \\"participating in life\\". Overall, His perspective and thoughts are intriguing, and left me anxious to turn the page. I can't imagine that any teen or adult wouldn't find at least a bit of themselves through Charlie, because no matter what stage someone is at in their life, they can gain something from this book. While some may be reminded of that period in time where they discovered themselves, I took away from it a deeper understanding for the importance of time, the life we choose to lead, and the importance of at some point, feeling \\"infinite\\". I could go on for hours about this book, but to be completely honest the thought provoking quality of this novel is something indescribable. In order to truly experience this, you have to pick up a copy for yourself.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Life can be interesting if one so chooses!  and life can just be existence¡<br /><br />Life is a journey along a chosen path.  The choice can be mine or I can lead a life chosen by others... but even that is my choice.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Book 5 in the Fever series swoops in with talons unsheathed and takes no prisoners, the reader included in that extensive list of battle-weary captives. You'll fight fang and claw, chewing up the pages just to imbibe the very essence of Barrons, the enigmatic man-beast who's captured Mac's attention.<br /><br />At one point, Mac decides:<br /><br />\\"We are matched. Fascinating. I am his equal. My, what a creature I've become.\\"<br /><br />What creature that is, we may never know. But not knowing won't stop you from swooning.<br /><br />\\"When you know who I am. Let me be your man.\\"<br /><br />Mac may unearth who he is, but may never discern what he is. Does it matter? There are so many possible conclusions and KMM is a master at driving you down every suppositional road, pointing you toward every hypothetical outcome...but the real one!<br /><br />Mac, in all her renditions of self, discovers who she really is without losing her most central part. She demonstrates it best with this reminder:<br /><br />\\"I nodded, lower lip trembling. I could hunt monsters. I could have sex with men who turned into beasts. I could kill in cold blood. And Daddy could still make me cry just by believing in me.\\"<br /><br />The characterization and imagination was out this world till the very last page. It's hard not to give a perfect rating to this larger than life finale, for it is a flight of unfathomable fantasy. It has enough heart-pounding mystery and do-it-or-die-trying attitude to earn itself a place on countless bookshelves. Problem is, it drags at the most needful moments. Even in the eclipse of the climax, the narration feels over-inflated. Or maybe my patience is just under-practiced.<br /><br />Still, this series is a worthy departure from the mass of wham-bam-keep-em-spread urban fantasy romances out there. Mac and Barrons may not ride off into the sunset (perhaps her suggestion that they fly off on Hunters into the moon comes true). No matter how it ends, you'll be at peace with the why and the who.with the why and the who.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is easy to install.  Easy to understand.  I'm not a \\"gamer\\" but this is a great way to unwind!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|it is a fun free game.  you are not forced to buy cramp to move onto different levels.  if your broke like I am you can get hours of entertainment from this game without having to spend real money.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game worked great on my Kindle Fire: no glitches with downloading or play.  The zoom option in the hidden object scenes was great, and the storyline kept me engaged from beginning to end.  Play was logical and intuitive without being too easy.  If you like mystery and hidden object games, you can't go wrong with this one.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This movie is so hilarious and such a joy to watch.  Christopher Walken, Sissy Spacek, Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone are so wonderful to watch in this movie.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Great Gregory romantic historical novel depicting the trials and tribulations of the English royal and nobel families during the Wars of the Roses. Meet Anne, daughter of the Duke of Warwick, the Kingmaker, who tells her story of the highs and lows of life in those days in fifteenth century England, where brother killed brother in order to obtain the ultimate prize, the throne.
B002VECLVO|5.0|A very moving and sensitive movie with superb acting by Colin Firth and Julianne Moore. Highly recommend this movie, 5 stars.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Purchased this TY as a gift for my niece. Great price and great quality TY. It was bigger then i expected. Very cute. Love it!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The folks who are giving it one must have some deep issues. This is a hilarious, laugh out loud movie. I do wish that fewer of the gags had been revealed in the trailer, but even with all that was released, it still had some incredibly funny moments. It is a very heart-warming love story. Not your typical boy meets bear meets girl story, but then what is?  I am not a big fan of owning movies since you can always catch them for rent--- for $1.99 it was worth the price.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />Comfort, the big ear muffs are just so amazing for hours of gaming. The cushy band on the top is still plush and wonderful. I love how the ear muffs will pivot to fit your head perfectly (also great for storage).<br /><br />Longevity, not only can you wear them for hours comfortably but they also last for hours. I still get the full 10 hour capacity on the battery before I need to charge them. And, being able to still use them while they charge is just great.<br /><br />Utility, I love that the boom will silence if it is up or if you press the mute button. I also love the extra buttons that you can keybind for PTT (so great for AFK conversations) and for other stuff like your media player (never had to tab out for that stuff when I had a single monitor). And, the voice morpher is just hilarious.<br /><br />Great sound, this set adds richness to the game environment. When I started using these I suddenly heard  in game sounds that I had NEVER heard before and I heard them so beautifully with the bass they achieve. They are also wonderful for playing your own music, toggle the surround sound to see the difference, I really enjoy the deep bass. The surround sound actually startled me at first, it would literally sound just as good as my surround sound PC speakers - as if I wasn't even wearing a headset  >.><br /><br />Quality, after over a year of use (or abuse) not a single thing on the headset has broken, cracked, peeled, become lose, or fallen off. They still work and look as beautifully as the day I got them.<br /><br />I just love this headset. It is so easy to use and so problem free that I sometimes forget how super awesome they really are. Someone recently asked me for my opinion to help them get a wireless set and after I told them my list of G930 awesomeness, I just had to write a review for it.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I'm never disappointed with these books. I have read all 19  In the series and the 4 inbetweeners and have loved every single one.
B009VLX8FS|2.0|This album has way too much of an indie/pop sound to be considered mainstream country.  Must be a lot of teens buying this.  A big disappointment.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|a very good read.  i don't know how she has kept her sanity.  she seems to have such a positive outlook considering what she has been thru.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|To me, this book was beautiful and relatable and made sense even when it didn't. It was the kind of of book that after I finished it, I just sat and felt.  I love this book, and I'm recommending it to my friends.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Overall ,it is a very good product . It got a bit scratched up after a few months but no particle in this product broke. My son loves it. Overall I highly recommend recieving this product. The price is also quite fair

B005LAIHZY|5.0|The questions is &#34;What is there not to like about this movie&#34;?  My family & I loved this movie and we'll most definitely watch it over and over again.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Everyone knows this is one of the best books ever!!! If you've never read it, you should. You won't be disappointed. At all. Seriously. Read it. Even though it's for kids, anyone at any age will love it. Please buy it, don't ignore me.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|i cant get the hook to attach to the block under the car. It shows I need to click on the rope and hook to attach it but it closes out the box before allowing me to.  Also it does the same at the coffin underneath the picture of the girl who went missing. It wont let me click on the coffin. So Im stuck... any suggestions?
B00APUQT7I|1.0|Did not enjoy this movie as much as i did the others was disappointing. Na na na na na na
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie before buying it, but I really like Natalie Portman and Ashton Kucher so I thought I'd check it out.  It was a really good movie.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Don't buy it. As soon as I tried it on Eve it crashed my vidio camera. I was on the phone with Amazon all that morning tring to fix the problem. They want to reset to factory settings. I have not none that yet due to I need to back up all my personal pictures and vidio to my computor. I was told that if that didn't work I would have to retun My Kindle.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I watched this on regular disc when it came out, but the Blu-Ray has a ton of extra features that add to the Game of Thrones Experience.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Loved the movie. A must see in 3D. Also a must buy for your DVD movie collection. First saw it on the big screen and I knew that I had to own it.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is a fascinating book.  I learned so much about North Korea, and it was an interesting read.  This is one of few non-fiction books that I couldn't put down.  This book really did a good job of describing what it is like to live in North Korean, how it got to be the way it is now, and why propaganda works so well there.  Very thought provoking and sad.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|With the recent series of movies of pre-packaged explosions and guns; this is the real Batman story.  Under the Red Hood provides emotional, consistent glimpses into the Batman, Joker, and Robin (both Dick and Jason).  For true fans, this is compelling as it exposes what it is about these characters we know and love.<br /><br />For those who did not read the comics, this is non-derivative story -and it is a great story that will allow you a glimpse of a deep mythology.  You will see these characters beyond the two dimensional cartoons presented in the movies.<br /><br />Cheers and yes, tears will follow.
B0015AARJI|5.0|is good
1932100660|5.0|This book is fascinating, shedding profound insights on the findings of Dr. Campbell in his pursuit of the causes of obesity and illnesses, and specifically the study of dairy products. This book will make you sit up and take note as to what we put into our mouths (and our children's mouths) while explaining the logistics of his studies. I am not  conspiracy theorist, but so many of the studies I believe are dead-on when it comes to why Americans eats certain foods. Money.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in their diet and how it affects their life.<br /><br />Don Furr, author and business owner.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I thought the movie was very good and the acting was excellent.  The title did not give the plot of the movie away.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Everything came as expected and everything worked fine. The adapter wall charger worked fine with what I needed it for and also the vetch car charger works great
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Skipped whole sections, because it was so much of the same stuff over and over again!  Actually hoped there would be more of a story line.  The sex was okay at first, but soon it was just too much!  I definitely will not read the third book in the series!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|alot of fun...some levels are very challenaging for me. I think I have all versions of the birds..this one has given me alot of fun time
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A very emotional book that made me question if this author is a writer for kids. I mean who writes a book about kids being forced to kill each other, I know I wouldn't! Though I must  admit I enjoyed it. A four star book for sure.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was not a fan of zombies before the Walking Dead.  Watched it on whim and now I can't get enough.  I have even started reading the comics.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very informative.  Honestly think there is a definite correlation to wheat and the way I feel after eating any type of wheat. Of course I too was under the impression whole grains are good for you!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I can't get enough of the Walking Dead.  The show is well written, acted and has great production.  I am hooked
B007SOQBCM|3.0|I love watching Twitch.tv on my PC and I hear the iOS app is pretty well featured but this one doesn't let you sign in so that you can easily view live streams from people that you are following. There is no chat as well which is a bummer too.<br /><br />I have an older Android device as well, and this app plays pretty horribly on that but it is much better on my Kindle Fire and Nexus phone.<br /><br />If they add the ability to sign in to your Twitch.tv account I would raise this to at least a 4 star review.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|This is one of my favorite cds.  The songs are great and a lot of fun.  I listen to it all the time.
B005LAII62|5.0|I love this movie , I bought this movie for my daughter but I think that it is great for all ages

1419705849|5.0|My son is a big fan of these books.  When it arrived it was just as described brand new and in perfect condition.  He started reading it right away and finished it that same night.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Funny movie like all the rest! The 3d is great on this one. You get all the different formats bluray 3d ,bluray,dvd, and the digital copy!
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids love playing this game.  They're always trying to best their previous score and it keeps them occupied when I need them to sit still for a while.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Best movie this year by fall. Shows the real heroism of our soldiers ashore and abroad that people wouldn't see unless otherwise.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a lot of fun to play.  It is one of those games that really keeps your brain sharp.  For me, as an Electrical Engineer, it reminds me of routing traces on circuit boards, whivch can be quite challenging.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Once our 11 year old son put it together he continued to play with it and showed everyone who came over for Christmas.  He was able to follow the directions and put it together pretty easily.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Diana is a great &#34;old fashioned&#34; singer reminescent of the 30-40's style singers.  My husband in in love wth her!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this romantic story! It was a very nice read that progressed very nicley. thank you for writing this book.
0007466064|5.0|George R. R. Martin write exquisitely, using specific examples to support this dungeons and dragons adventure. The Winterfell family group provide exciting action-packed tales of derring-do. Since I do not watch popular TV, I am glad I did not get warning of what would happen since it is gripping.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Book is great never realized how habits run my life. Covers a complex subject in a simple easy to read style.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Uh, this movie was dark, thrilling, and over the top. I don't know how they did some of the special effects in many of the scenes, but everything looked totally real. the music was better in batman begins but the premise is the same. Bane was one scary dude and I am going to have nightmares about him. Didn't love cat woman because she is scrawny and couldn't beat up a pair of socks. Her hair was amazing though. My favorite part was the street fight and the end of the movie.<br /><br />What made this movie great was the realism. We don't struggle with this kind of stuff everyday but tyranny exists in this world. This is the most realistic work of fiction I have ever watched in a movie. Usually its full of magic, creatures, and different worlds. In Batman its the technology that is most unbelievable. The rest only the city of Gotham can hold.<br /><br />Crazy good! Never watching it again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like every step of this book. Sometimes it's mad me laugh, cry, feel \\"pure\\", and erotic!!! I couldn't get enough of this book, great read!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My first book on my kindle. My kids had recommended this book. I am ready to start the next. Keeps your imagination piqued!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put the book down, every scene was as riveting as the next! I would recommend this to anyone
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Suspenseful and romantic! There were times I couldn't put the book down. I will definitely recommend to my friends for a good read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read all three books in one weekend!!  The first book is definitely the best of the trilogy, but that seems to be the case in all trilogies!!  The second one is a little dry, but the third makes a great ending!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me from the very start.  I HAD to keep reading until I finished. I couldn't predict what was going to happen next and that kept me on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend Hopeless!!
B002BWP49C|5.0|love it......love it ...... love it ..... I am a twiight fan so the product was fine. I would recommend the product again.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I come from a huge military family, mostly Navy & Army (that makes the annual army navy game very interesting around here, lol) I served & my husband continues to serve. This movie would have been great even if it had not been made with a real Seal team, the fact that it WAS made with a real Navy SEAL Team makes it outstandingly realistic & honest. There are scenes where live rounds are used instead of blanks, where the seals took over & ran the operation as they would in real life. They played themselves so while many civillians criticize the acting, most military personnel know that teams guys in particular don't get Hollywood dramatic during a mission, they stay calm & press on. The time to fall apart is after the mission, not during it. I found this movie to be full of action, real raw honest emotion & the most honest representation of our brave warriors ever put on the big screen. Every person i know in the military who has seen this movie feels the same, the only critisim I hear comes from civillians whose only exposure to the military comes from Hollywood. The movie starts & ends with the reading of a letter written by a seal based on a famous poem by Tecumseh.<br /><br />The full letter below explains the feeling of the entire movie. Read this & if it makes u feel a sense of honor & strikes a cord within you, this is a movie that u will undoubtably love, if not you are PROBOBLY going to enjoy something else better.<br /><br />Act of Valor letter (FULL)<br /><br /> Before my father died, he said the worst thing about growing old was that other men stop seeing you as dangerous...I've always remember that how being dangerous was sacred, a badge of honor. You live your life by a code. An ethos, every man does. It's your shoreline It's what guides you home and trust me you're always trying to get home. Your father was a reader, Churchill of course but also Faulkner and books about Tecumseh, he loved artists who painted people with bodies that looked like boxes, I'd give him hell about that he just say you gotta look harder, Look harder your father would say, I always knew he wasn't just talking about those boxy abstract paintings. There's threats everywhere in a world that's draped in camouflage. Your fathers grand father gave up his life flying a b24 in world war 2, he kept the liberator aloft just long enough for everyone to jump and then he went down with the plane. That's the blood coursing in your veins, Your father was my boss and I was his chief. What we knew about each others traits and our bond as operators. There's a brotherhood between us and we depended on each other more than a family. Tecumseh said although a single twig may break a bundle of twigs is strong.<br /><br />Our platoon was headed downrange, we had Weimy our sniper he grew up in the middle of the Mojave desert, most excitement he had as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys down the isle at the grocery store.<br /><br />Ray our comms guy, our radio man. He grew up in east LA gangland. He had a silver star for pulling a wounded teammate out of a freight.<br /><br />Sonny he was made of grannet, this guy didn't even do push ups because he was afraid his chest was gonna get too big.<br /><br />Ajay joined the teams late in his 30's he had been a muay thai fighter all his life, before that he grew up dirt poor in Trinidad.<br /><br />Mikey had 20 years in the teams, as humble as he was. You never even know him, he kept a picture of his wife in his helmet and a lock of her hair in his pocket, quiet as the breeze and finally senior chief miller, couldn't really tell you much about him other than I'd rather take a knife to a gun fight than have to be interrogated by him.<br /><br />That last night at home you think about how you coulda been a better dad, a better husband, that bedtime story you shoulda read or that anniversary you forgot. You don't expect your family to understand what your doing, You just hope they accept it. When you get home you hope you can pickup right where you left off.<br /><br />War is a country of will, theres no room for sympathy. If your not willing to give up everything...You've already lost.<br /><br />Your father was a good man, growing up without him is going be hard its going to hurt. You'll feel alone, out to sea with no shore in sight you'll wonder why me, why him. Remember you have warriors blood in your veins, the code that made your father who he was is the same code that'll make you a man he would admire, respect. Put your pain in a box. Lock it down, like those people in the paintings your father liked we are men made up of boxes, chambers of loss, triumph, of hurt and hope and love. No one is stronger or more dangerous than a man who can harness his emotions, his past. Use it as fuel as ammunition as ink to write the most important letter of YOUR life. Before your father died he asked me to give you this poem by Tecumseh, I told him I'd fold it into a paper aeroplane and in a way...I guess that's what I'm doing, sailing it from him to you.<br /><br />So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion;respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.<br /><br />Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none.<br /><br />When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.<br /><br />When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone that I know, it's real and hardcore and it doesn't spare any details where other authors might.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Growing up reading Potter, I'm glad to see this is where the &#34;superpopular YA fiction&#34;. Depending mostly on cliffhangers, it's themes are well portrayed. Pick it up!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Inspiration flows from each page of \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\". It's a honest and fruitful book. As I was reading I connected with Charlie, I became aware of the  people around me as he did. Chbosky does a great job in making the story come to life, I thank him for that.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The free puzzles were stimulating and engaging. Good for any age. The puzzles also have good replay value, trying to get that &quot;perfect&quot; rating.

B007M45PMU|5.0|Love this CD.  Have been playing it a lot since I got it.  Really would like to see this band live.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Several friends have recommended this to me and still I was unprepared for how good it was! I was addicted from the beginning. It has everything: action, comedy, even romance! I gotta get my hands on book 2!
B009VB97EY|2.0|With great shame, I admit to watching this flick. It's pretty lame but if it makes your wife happy, it's worth an extra star. It features the typical over acting by Matthew McConaughey. Olivia Munn is surprisingly good, however, and makes it a more bearable flick. Tatum is Tatum and does a pretty good job. If you liked him in Dear John, you'll probably like this, but it's not as good.  Yes, my wife made me watch that too :)
0811870413|5.0|Ordering experience was pleasure. The book is very useful to follow to, with a lots of stories. The best bread I've ever eat that I baked.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Nolan keeps on roll'n!  The only problem I had with this movie is the far fetched plots but hey it's BATMAN!  Sometimes you have to let go of reality and let the script roll. Great action, Anne Hatheway makes a great cat woman.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|StrengthFinder 2.0 should be read by everyone. The principle of embracing your strengths and developing them is something that society simply does not teach.<br /><br />I found the assessment very accurate, as applied to me. I recognized that many of my habits or 'quirks' are rooted in one of the top 5 strengths the assessment suggested for me. I am excited to apply some of the action plan items and work towards developing my strengths.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter suggested that I read this series, and i'm surprised at how much I really enjoyed reading it. The author really knows how to paint a picture with words. The descriptions are so in depth that I feel like I have seen the place myself.  After reading this, I feel like i actually know Katniss, Peeta, Prim, Gale and all the others.  You can easily relate to each one.  Very good book. I have thanked my daughter for introducing me to this series, and recommend it to everyone I talk to.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love Grisham and anxiously await each new book! This particular one is being placed in my top two faves (The Last Juror being the other) I couldn't put it down because you have to know the ending!
B00632HWOG|1.0|This version hasmany good features, unfortunately it has lost all of my contacts and there is no way to sync them. Looking on the Internet I am not the only person suffering from this.  I really think a Yahoo mail app should be able to find Ny Yahoo contacts.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Great show!! Can't wait for the next season! Easy to purchase, especially with Amazon Prime. Wish it would work with Appletv
B006O6EOII|5.0|me gusto mucho esta  muñeca, a mi sobrina le encanto mucho y a mi también quede fascinada es muy buena
B0018BB20W|5.0|I got an opportunity to see the Moody Blues (what is left of them) in Akron recently.  It rekindled my interest in this group that I had all of their albums (33 RPM).  The recording on CD is of good quality, and the shipping was instantaneous.  Nice.
B008D28HYS|4.0|This was my Christmas present to myself. I knew I would love it because I really enjoyed the non color version. My only complaint is the absence of hints. Sometimes I feel hopefully stuck and wishfor a way to check where I've gone wrong. Otherwise, I love playing this puzzle style game even more than the original, and I also appreciate the new puzzles which are being added constantly. :-)
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Pretty good file manager for android devices. A lot of similarities<br />to windows explorer. Easy to learn and use. Recommended.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|So awesome!!  Fits everything my daughter who is a photographer has when she is on a photo shoot!  We looked everywhere for an affordable camera bag...there are not many options...but when we came upon this, we were thrilled!!!
B005ML9YOU|4.0|Storys hold your interest they are short to a longer one a person can read one and move on to a different task
B009JBZH54|5.0|Best Trilogy I have seen in quite awhile. Got this as a gift over the holidays and we watched all of it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is not the typical love story of a Sparks book. Very intense. I could not put it down.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|I'm happy to say that this movie was in perfect condition when I received it. Thank you very much:)<br /><br />-Barbara
B007FH9GT2|1.0|The underlying violence and dark nature of this film loses me. I rented it for someone else. I do hate such movies.
B008YP272M|5.0|Christopher Hitchens was one of a kind: agent provocateur, bon vivant, a true intellectual and a journalist with integrity. All of these traits can be seen in this short but powerful account of his battle with cancer. He writes without self pity and indeed tackles the question &#34;Why me?&#34; with aplomb. He does not hold back on the bleakness that is &#34;Tumourville&#34;. He admires the medical staff who treat him but is quick to shoot down people who tell him to pray, eat this or that and other esoteric ideas. God plays a large role in a way - this was one of the world's most fervent atheists! So it is not surprising and he holds fast to his non beliefs.<br />An amazing book by an incredible man. I only wish it could have had a happier ending.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I purchased this product as a wishlist gift and I haven't watched it, so personally, I don't have an opinion.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I didn't get very far before I put the book down as a burning piece of crash. I am not one to judge based on the first couple chapters, but this one was just bad and I didn't feel the need to continue. I am very glad that I didn't after finding out about the chapters long rape scenes... and if the book was anything like the movies in any way, that just backs my intuition that the story is stupid and unworthy.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This movie depicts my dream come true: a villa in a rural European setting (I know it's France, though I'd prefer Italy) left to me by a long-loved relative. The movie is well cast.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|I've always loved APU's but this thing is a beast for it's price range, not to mention it is more affordable than intel.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This story has been redone over and over but the orginal is the best of all!  I enjoy it year after year!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|The digital download included played perfectly on my new ipod touch!  The DVD played great as well.  Have yet to try the blue-ray version.
B004ZGI1V0|2.0|I regret renting this movie.  I enjoyed \\"Taken\\" and believed the reviews that said this movie was like that.  I wondered why I never heard of \\"Unknown\\" before...but after watching it I know why...it's a bad movie.  I actually had a hard time figuring out what was going on for most of the film, but that's not because it was some great mystery.  This reminds me of a bad NYU student film.  Or, since it was shot in Berlin, maybe it was a European university and the student filmmaker was Liam's niece or nephew and he starred in this as a favor.<br /><br />This movie reminds me of the old days when there were video stores and I'd get tricked into watching a movie because of the box cover art.  Everything about this was designed to appeal to someone who liked \\"Taken\\"...only the story is nothing like \\"Taken\\".<br /><br />Amnesia is involved in the plot.  The main character is someone else besides who he thinks he is.  There is a twist towards the end that would make M. Night Shyamalan cringe.  Maybe he wrote this movie under a pen name, come to think of it.<br /><br />I actually think I've found a way to tell if a movie is any good besides the \\"If it has a big star in it but you've never heard of it then it's bad\\" canard. In this case, \\"Unknown\\" was priced as a $2.99 rental on Amazon Instant Video but I could have bought the movie in digital form for $5.99.  Typically, movies rent for $3.99 and you can purchase them for $9.99 here on Amazon Instant Video.  I wondered why it was so cheap to just buy it and I thought about spending the extra $3 and just doing that (which would have been a great deal if I ever wanted to see this movie even one more time in the future).  Next time I see something priced like this I am going to take it as a warning sign that the movie is one that not a lot of people are interested in buying...or the price would be higher.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Now I can connect this to my pc or laptop and download directly from those devices in an easier manner.
B00ARAO720|4.0|This is a fun movie.  Joseph Gordon Levitt is adorable in it.  I also liked the actress who plays his girlfriend.  I could watch this movie again...it's one of those kind of movies that if there's nothing else on I can pop this in and enjoy it.<br /><br />I've seen it twice now and I still don't understand what the Bad Guy was up to.  I don't want to spoil anything, but JGL plays a bike messenger and the Bad Guy wants something he is carrying.  I still don't know why the Bad Guy wants that envelope, how he found out about it, etc.  I will have to pay more attention the next time I watch this to see if I can figure that out.  It's just sort of random that this guy is chasing after JGL for this envelope.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love books and had to read this before considering going to the movie.<br />It was enjoyable and will enjoy the rest of the series in the future.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid.....dumb dumb dumb plot... non-existant... this is dumb dumb dumb book. why is this a best seller
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hoover is a master of her craft! The story she crafted is entirely unique and suspenseful. While reading, I experienced a symphony of emotions and finished the book within hours. Purchase this book!
B0041KVXLA|5.0|My 12 year old son loved this gift! He is a huge Beatles fan and we have been searching for records in all the local music stores and pawn shops with have had no success!  He was thrilled and very surprised to open this Christmas morning,
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|This app works quite well, although I have just started to explore with it. The picture quality seems pretty good.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|The item came quickly, in almost perfect shape, and of course, i love the movie! Plays well, no skips or scratches at all.  So glad I bought this movie.
B003NGTYPA|3.0|We would have preferred colorized version for this particular viewing.  Film was great in black-and-white, but we were expecting color based on the picture on the site.
B00006LLOB|5.0|I'd just like to add my opinion that this is definitely no half baked project which shouldn't have happened. In truth it should stand proud in any Wolf collection and in fact some of these versions are arguably better than the originals, when you take into consideration the advanced technology, the excellent production, the fine band and added musical palette - horns, keyboards and guitar in post production. Ok, Wolf's voice is not as intense as in some earlier versions, for example in Who's Been Talking where the original key of Dm is dropped to Am in order to accommodate his range perhaps, but it still has that authority, it still has gravitas, and the band musicianship compensates.<br /><br />Of course, with such a stellar band supporting their hero it had to work - the Stones' engine room plus the sixth Stone, Scotsman Ian Stewart on piano for 4 numbers (and 5 alternate takes), Clapton on guitar with Wolf's Hubert Sumlin on 2nd guitar and rhythm, and Steve Winwood and Layfayette Leake added keyboards later, according to the notes.  A  young Chicago harmonica player called Jeff Carp who had played with Muddy, Earl and John Lee Hooker was brought over to fill in for Wolf. The notes say that he was killed in a bizarre boat accident not long after this recording. A sad loss.<br /><br />The second Cd in the deluxe set is certainly not superfluous, although why they chose the tentative rehearsal of Worried About My Babe to open is curious. At least three tracks are the equal of, if not superior to, the issued tracks - the first What A Woman aka Commit A Crime (there are two versions on Cd2), The Red Rooster, Worried About My Babe (the alt version - not the rehearsal), also Who's Been Talking after the dialogue ends rocks nicely. The extended alternate take of Do The Do is a hypnotic boogie with Charlie's beat up front for almost 6 minutes while Wolf sounds his way forward. Poor Boy and the alternate Rockin' Daddy are both good.<br /><br />Of the three bonus tracks on side 1, Goin' Down Slow is one of those deep blues with great guitar - Hubert Sumlin perhaps, and superb harp from maestro Jeff Carp, and Wolf is living his vocal, painting his inimitable picture. His vocal on the self penned I Want To Have A Word With You is raw and passionate. Killin' Floor, by comparison to the original is, for my taste, tepid.<br /><br />This deluxe edition is a handsome product, the remastering is great, the booklet is informative and well written by Bill Dahl plus photos (including a couple of Jagger with Wolf) and session details. It would complement your Memphis and Chicago Wolf recordings, and while not having the visceral intensity of prime Wolf, it does provide another rockin' side to the man with it's fine band, added horns and keyboards, Jeff Carp's harp fills and top production. It is a testament to producer Norman Dayron that he had the vision, and was able to bring a sometimes testy Wolf together with these young dudes and make music worthy of the legend.

B00881VLCE|5.0|also great for those puzzle fanactics like myself.. only down side is it doesn't save progress if the device shuts down for any reason.. other than that no complaints.. :}
B0087JTAKW|2.0|The book started off with so much potential. With only three characters to develop, a person would respectively expect to feel a presence in each. However, the story went from so much potential to an allogory of the value of life. Only we don't care much for the characters because they are every old wealthy white man and young girl of divorecsd parents. The cliches and transparency of the writing made the novel overly predictable and only led me to keep reading to confirm how truly predictable it was. If you like easy reads that give a false sense of hope this is for you. If you want substance and a book that reflects the potential of humans look to \\"Night Circus\\".
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was definitely a GREAT read.  At first, I could not put this book down.  However, I have to dock a star because of the second half of this book.  While I thought it was creative and not like a lot of contemporary romances I've read, I felt like it was predictable and little too far-fetched.  I loved Holder and his relationship with Sky, but their dialogue just was not believable during the second half.  They are 17 & 18 years old and I found myself rolling my eyes a few times when they were speaking to each other.  This book is still excellent and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys contemporary romance.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|Kevin Costner (at about 22), Danny Glover, Kevin Kline, Scott Glen, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Jeff Goldbloom, John Cleese, Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Fahey, Amanda Wyss; written by Lawrence & Mike Kasdan, and directed by Lawrence Kasdan!  If you like westerns, and you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor -  grab the popcorn and check it out.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Loved the album, of course I've liked just about everything Taylor Swift has done. She has a way of making a point without being really rude.
0385535147|5.0|My dad and I love this author.  I buy him all the books and he reads them and then passes them on to me.  He is almost finished with this one and I just got it for him for Christmas!
B005R32L66|5.0|We did not get Skype through Amazon so I do not know why they asked me to review it here? We love Skype because we can talk & see our friends from locations all over the world. If you have friends or family living in another town, city, state, or country (especially overseas) Skype is a great communication tool.
0920668372|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I buy it for all my friends when they have babies.  I cry everytime I read it but it is so very touching.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Game has a fun little story and lots of levels of match 3 games with varying obstacles like frozen tiles or unbreakable walls. Give it a try.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So addictive! I love this game. Loosing prizes off the sides is annoying. Hours of enjoyment. I have this on my iPhone too.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use this at Church every week.  it is great and very helpful during our weekly services.<br />It is easy to use and handle with my Kindle
B0051XQI84|5.0|Kung Fu Panda is a gem in that it is inspirational, uplifting, deep, and hysterically funny. It also helps that the stars voicing the characters are all amazing actors whose talents add the perfect touch to this well-crafted film.<br /><br />The film follows \\"Po,\\" a bumbling Panda Bear voiced by Jack Black who seeks a different Path than that of his master chef father. Through chance/fate (\\"there are no accidents\\"---quote), Po becomes a novice disciple of a stern, inner-peace-seeking shifu who cannot quite fathom how to turn Po into one of his prodigies. The following \\"training\\" sessions designed to toughen Po (or send him bouncing down the stairs back to his old life) are a combination of slap-stick humor and well-written puns and come-backs.<br /><br />The other martial artists are Tigress, Crane, Monkey, Mantis, and Python. Each is well-versed in their art, each has a different specialization (the speed of python, the power of Tigress). They tolerate Po but feel that his presence is a mistake. Yet, the decision of the elderly Tortoise sage to stand by Po and the legend of the Dragon Scroll makes them both curious about Po and defiant at the same time.<br /><br />There are several scenes that remind of the Tao Te Ching, as translated by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English. The issue of excessive pride reminds me of verse 3, line 1: \\"not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling.\\" The issue of nothingness reminds me of verse 11, lines 3 and 4: \\"shape clay into a vessel; it is the space within that makes it useful.\\" The issue of Po's humiliation reminds of verse 13, line 1: \\"accept disgrace willingly.\\" If one listens to the script of Kung Fu Panda, the lessons are imbedded in the story. Beautiful, deep, articulate.<br /><br />Lastly, the story is uplifting, through humor, story development, and heart. Wisdom is imbedded like so many seeds of Peach trees throughout the soil of the story (film reference to the scene of the Tortoise sage and the shifu).<br /><br />Just a side note, I prefer action movies, dramas, and thrillers. I watch these kid's movies only because my mother loves them. I went into this film fidgeting and sighing about how I had to sit through it, but afterwards, I was grateful and in a good mood.<br /><br />I highly recommend Kung Fu Panda if you have kids or if you do not have kids. It works for everyone. I am smiling right now just remembering the scene where Po finds Monkey's stash of cookies on the top shelf. It will make sense once you see the movie!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It seems every writer is convinced they can pen the great criminal mystery.Few succeed.The man who runs rings around the wannabe mystery writers is Grisham.I am amazed at his productivity at such a sustained level of excellence.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I bought this for my kindle paperwhite. It's a perfect fit and high quality material. The material does not scratch the face of the device. Love it.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|The Blue Ray of the concert is great! The CD's, OK. Not sure what changed from the concert to the audio on the CD's but the DVD is way better!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it! Lol I lost this book at school and I never got it back so I couldn't finish it. It was worth waiting for!
B006XBSAP2|4.0|I thought it had more of the songs on it that I liked, but it was still a great buy and has many wonderful songs!!!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This book not only touches on the biggest issues that our youth face today, it actually glorifies them!  The book disgusted me all the way through it.  At one point, the main character (a sixteen-year-old boy) drives his sister to the abortion clinic.  After her \\"procedure\\" (a nice and politically correct way to say legalized murder) she comes out and scolds him for smoking and then they both start laughing.  It sickens me how people can look at abortion like it's no big deal and actually try to make it seem a normal part of life.  At another point the author describes several homosexual encounters, again in a way that glorifies the acts.  Drugs appear throughout the book and are too encouraged.  As a Christian, this book sickens me, our world sickens me and writers like Chbosky sicken me.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I have been a fan of Kelly Clarkson since she was on American Idol.  I am glad to have lucked out and was able to get her &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; album for Christmas; since it was just released.  It has so many of her greatest songs plus more.  It was an excellent buy at an excellent price.  Would recommend for anyone!!!
B000FC12L4|4.0|While not as good as Sabriel or Abhorsen, Lirael is a good story in itself.  The main complaints I have with it is a somewhat drawn out beginning, and no strong conclusion (fixed by simply reading Abhorsen next.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. I couldn't beat the price. Definitely recommend and it arrived even faster than promised
B000FC13MM|5.0|This novel works quite well as either a stand-alone novel or as the beginning of a trilogy.  The world Nix writes in is quite well developed and the characters are interesting and the story is good.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I got this movie for my daughter for her 21st birthday. She loved this movie when she was younger, and wanted it.
