0064471837|5.0|I've been reading and re-reading this book for years now. Sabriel is one of the most compelling heroines that I have ever encountered and I've loved her since I first picked up a copy of the book. Garth Nix does a wonderful job of immersing you in a beautiful and inventive fantasy world, without hitting you over the head with all of the mechanics of it. I'm actually at a loss for words, because I can't describe how much I love this book. If you're a fan of fantasy, excellent writing, and kick-a** heroines, you must read Sabriel.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|So warm-hearted and enjoyable.  Richard Gere is very good in this movie -- the dog(s) are fantastic in their roles as Hachi!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|My area doesn't have a BBCA station with HD, so the marvelous cinematography is muddied a bit. And I read somewhere that BBC has done some unusual editing while yours are complete. And, ever since watching Tennant as Dr. Who, I'm a complete Tennant fan and want to see every minute they filmed. It's also a joy to hear him in his &#34;real&#34; accent and be amazed by the way he managed to cloak that accent as the Doctor. I'm sure I'll watch this again w/o interruptions once the series is complete.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a very fun game. With just the right level of challenge as you progress to the next room. I enjoyed it very much, as it kept me thinking just outside of the box. It presents challenges which allows the player to be observant, and also use their memory along with their ability to solve puzzles. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
140006922X|5.0|I am a historical Jesus freak..this is excellent..he uses alot of sources that I have studied in the past...including the Jesus Seminar..a collective of Jesus scholars who vote on what they think Jesus actually said..Red = Jesus said it..Grey= sounds like Jesus  black= no way this is Jesus..<br />Fascinating and thought provoking..for an intellectual scholarly look at Jesus..Also Norman Mailer God is Father to the Son..another historical fiction well worth reading..<br />Aslan is a true scholar..so if you’re looking for Bible thumping.do not go here!  this is for the brainiacs...
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|Michael Lewis is incredible. A must read for anyone who wants to understand how we ended up with the latest mess
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|While David Tennant is my favorite Doctor, Eccleston is a close 2nd. His ability to show joy, worry, frustration and plain, old anger is amazing. I started over in the middle this latest time after a reference to &#34;The Doctor Dances&#34; on an NPR commentary, and now I know it's time to start at the beginning and savor them with my large-screen TV. Even if you're not into sci-fi, the acting and writing in the first 4 seasons are simply magnificent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|OMG best app, it's so fun, so easy, and mind blowing. You can create almost everything and its worth the seven bucks definitely!

B000028U0Y|5.0|So over the last five years or so I've become a bigger and bigger fan of the man in black. He has an amazing range of songs and I appreciate his ability to evolve during his career.<br /><br />What really hits me on this album is its concept. I've heard most of these songs many times, but I never really appreciated what the context of the album meant and how much the songs belong in that context. Amazing! His bond with the audience is palpable and his emotional intensity is only stronger than when you hear the songs individually. For instance, his version of John Henry, a song everyone covers at some point in their career, is unmatched when he's singing in front of a bunch of prisoners.<br /><br />In the social context, I also appreciate this album. If you think of the great prison movies and books of the era (Papillon, Cool Hand Luke, Gulag Archipelago, Midnight Express, Discipline and Punishment, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the Great Escape, etc.) Johnny Cash's contribution to the genre is significant.

0064471837|5.0|\\"Who will guard the living when the dead arise?\\" Sabriel, Sabriel by Garth Nix<br /><br />Transport yourself into a world filled with charter magic, necromancy and the Dead, in Sabriel` the first book in Garth Nix's Old Kingdom Trilogy. In Sabriel, Nix cleverly weaves together two countries that couldn't be more different. In the South, there's Ancelstierre, a country that's most like the world we live in, but perhaps from an earlier time. In the North, there's the Old Kingdom, a place filled with magic and the Dead. The Dead include corpses animated by dead spirits (Dead Hands), spirits of the Dead (Shadow Hands), dead necromancers (Greater Dead) and free magic creatures. The two countries are separated only by a wall that's imbued with charter magic, and patrolled around the clock by scouts; all to keep the people of Ancelstierre in, and the Dead out.<br /><br />To keep the Dead under control, the Abhorsen -- a necromancer who has a spelled sword and seven bells used to control the Dead -- puts the Dead back into death. Entering death is no easy feat, though, with nine precincts each filled with more terrifying Dead creatures, and many elements that try to keep you in death.<br /><br />The book follows Sabriel, a young woman about to finish school in Ancelstierre. At the beginning of the book, Sabriel receives the current Abhorsen's (her father's) sword and bells. She learns that her father is missing and crosses the wall to find him, dead or alive. Her journey is fraught with peril, and she faces many powerful Dead creatures along the way. Although, Moggett's sarcastic and snide comments do provide some comical moments along the way. Who is Mogget, you ask? He's a white cat, on the outside at least.<br /><br />The book is deliciously dark, with vivid descriptions of the lesser Dead as having \\"fleshless eyes...rotten, corroded teeth [that] ground and gnashed in skeletal mouths...\\" and the greater Dead as having a \\"body of bog-clay and human blood moulded...by a necromancer...flames were spewing from its mouth...\\" The detail in the descriptions allows the reader to imagine the Dead in their complete and terrifying forms. Nix uses these horrors to show that \\"everyone and everything has a time to die,\\" and as such, death isn't something to be avoided. In fact, the alternative is worse as the Dead bear no resemblance to the people they were in life.<br /><br />Nix also shows the reader that loss can make a person stronger, a message so often lost in typical fantasy novels. When Sabriel experiences loss, she is sad, but she's in the middle of a battle. She pulls herself together, and goes on to face the evil that threatens not only her life, but everyone's. In traditional fantasy novels, the protagonist is usually unable to go on, and needs someone else to step in. Nix breaks those norms and writes a character that is more realistic.<br /><br />While there is romance in the book, Nix does this with a light hand. The focus remains on the fight between good and evil, with romance as a nice sub plot. It's refreshing to read a book where romance isn't the main plot, and good vs. evil is the sub plot. As a result, this book should appeal to men and women.<br /><br />The world created by Nix is so complex and mysterious that it allows the story to continue on and on, and only your imagination is the limit.<br /><br />Final Verdict: Hard to put down--be prepared to give up a couple of days to read this. As soon as you put it down, you'll want to pick it back up again.cromancer...flames were spewing from its mouth...\\" The detail in the descriptions allows the reader to imagine the Dead in their complete and terrifying forms.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|Great movie, top book.  And because I enjoyed them do much, I bought the 1970s TV series staring Alec Guinness - still 5 out of 5, even if not as high quality visually,
B007SOQBCM|2.0|App frezzes streams also freeze theres no chat shows u have no one under following and u do they need to go back to basic and complete overhaul
B000N2HCM4|5.0|This was a beautiful look into the heart and soul of a great man.  It is  not every day that you get to glimpse greatness in an individual.  This book opened up the soul searching for a man who was guided by the love of his family.  Thank you Mr President for allowing me a personal glimpse into your spirit.  Loved this book.  Shirley.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Very violent, some humor, loved the actors in it. Just too much gratuitous violence and not enough story line. All the actors did a great job in the parts.
B008JEJO88|4.0|Considering the fit of the different styles of Crocs, but sure that you order the size you based on the roominess of the design of the shoe you've chosen. That being said, after exchanging this pair for a size smaller (a 10 versus my typical 11), I really enjoyed this pair of shoes.<br /><br />For all of the haters out there that frown on Crocs -- don't knock 'em 'til you've tried them! These are comfortable, durable, and do exactly what I wanted them to do. They work great for doing outside chores -- quick to slip on, easy to clean. The even float for times when I'm at the lake with the dogs.<br /><br />Only drawback is price. For what they are, the price is a little high in my opinion, but I'd still buy another pair. :)
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Another good read by Brown. Another author I love and have read all his books. Can't wait for another one

B0066W1AZK|4.0|I was an outstanding chess player in my day, although that was a long time ago.  This program is too good, I can't beat it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is extremely well done in every aspect....acting, setting, pace and story! It has just enough drama and humor that keeps one 's interest throughout each episode.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|What can I say that I haven't said already. This was different but very exciting. I enjoyed it very much
B00000JMOF|5.0|A classic movie that i'd never seen before until a friend suggested i watch it. Boris Karloff was amazing! Great movie!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I think you need to be really into the zombie craze to get into this book. A bit long, choppy and drawn out for my taste.
B000A2H812|5.0|This album is a plethora of punk sunshine excellence that generously and mightily spreads delicious sound with the beauty of immigrant party spice.
B009MYARIK|4.0|It was a slow start but I couldn't put the book down. I loved it every minute of the book.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|We laugh because the &#34;season&#34; is only 7 episodes! Not like American TV! We love the show and can't wait for the season 4!
B00B2GK4KW|3.0|Serves the purpose, just a little too cumbersome.  The price is good though.  Makes a really good edge once you figure it out.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|Enough padding to protect the Kindle with out being bulky.  Enough inside room extra to carry a pen and paper.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Very well written story. Thrilling and sexy. Jo Nesbo´s charachters are full of life that  we ordinary people live. I do recomend it.
B00CTWPDA4|5.0|We saw this many years ago and were happy to watch it again. Kind of silly but cute. Hd reproduction is good
B007LGPSX0|5.0|I grew up watching Beverly Hills 90201 (or as we called in &#34;9-0&#34;). Being able to watch it from the very beginning is fantastic!
B004UID2LC|5.0|It a asome app i can wach youtube on my kindle with out anny hassle and i can download all the videos i want. Its like a travel buddy i can wach dowlode and take it to go. The only thing is to much adds i start waching a video and then a add just randomly pops up
B00B935SUY|5.0|Great to see how Rock was made in the past, and how it can still be done. Dave Grohl is awesome to have the heart to still make real music.
6305428387|5.0|This is one of my most favoritest movies from my (not very) misguided youth. And now my boyos (8 and 6) quote it almost as much as I do. And now they get a bunch of the things I always say, like &#34;ya dead, man?&#34; and &#34;rise and shine. It's butt-whooping time!&#34; and my personal favorite insult...&#34;how 'bout I draw a line down the middle of your head to make it look like a butt?&#34;
B0036TGSJ4|4.0|Without Emma Stone you might as well not watch this story. She makes total sense of ever aspect of this story. C6
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is awesome and it is just like emoj pop but I think it is better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazon is coming out with cool games
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is beautiful and can really relax you in the worst of situations. Just simply learning how to create the music was fun enough to recommend this to anyone.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|As always, they show the best parts of the movie in the previews.  The movie was alright, it did get a bit boring in some places and I lost interest, but overall it was good.  If you watched the wizard of oz every year as a kid, it has a bit more meaning.  Some people will really like it, others not so much.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Thgis app is always crashing on my kindle fire hd, I think it has to do the the firmware on the kindle itself but non the less it sucks
0425256162|2.0|One of the most boring sf books I have read in a long time. Lots of talk, very little action. I just couldn't work up any interest in the main character's repeated attempts to perform a mind-meld with an elephant. Full of family squabbles, English (as opposed to American) jargon, and unfamiliar terms not found in any of my dictionaries (ching,quangled,for example). I got as far as page 185 (of 565), then gave up and decided to re-read one of my books about the American revolution.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I read it in two days.  Very quick and easy read but very entertaining.  My niece recommended it to me.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is about a true American hero and his family! It wasn't what I expected, but I really enjoyed it. This book proves that freedom isn't free!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A great film about a part of music history, and the process of recording music. Check out the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club during the end credits for sure.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app is awesome.  The new logo is terrible.  What was wrong with the original multi-colored logo?  The new one is overly simple and doesn't represent the multi-functionality of the product.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I love Neil Gaiman's mind.  He takes you places you never could have dreamed of!  I highly suggest this as well as Stardust.
B00CZ632R0|5.0|Great downtempo techno or upbeat ambient record. Definitely will pursue his other work based on this. I like this quite a bit more than Boards of Canada, and they have a good deal of praise, but the style is similar.<br /><br />If you like this record, check out releases from Clark or from Leila, two highly underrated acts that aren't a stretch from this sound and style.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|How unique, to incorporate boxing &amp; monkeys into a game that is actually fun to play. Whether it's the FAOTD or you have to purchase it... I definitely recommend this game.
B00DU74U74|3.0|The movie only very loosely follows the book which is okay, but the end result is the movie jumps from point to point without developing the characters in a more meaningful way. Not bad but it could have been great.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This brings out the inner sci fi dork in me.  I love the entire series.  Have been watching the HBO stuff as well.  Cant get enough!
B002W7H3EA|4.0|Of course this movie shows it's age, but it's a great movie.<br /><br />We watched it with our 9&11 year olds and fortunately all the innuendo went over their heads, which was quite a lot. Was this risque for it's day? I would have thought so.<br /><br />Grant is looking a bit leathery and tanned, but I guess that's part of his star qualities.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|I can't understand why they couldn't have toned the content down just a tad, so that at least<br />older teenagers could watch the show (as it was with Doctor Who), but the story lines are<br />excellent, the dialogue is good, and the actors are quite good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was awesome I was on the edge of my seat and the series was awesome to becouse all.I did was read Suzanne Collins you are awsome
082300659X|5.0|Normally I am not too concerned about buying secondhand books that are in reasonable condition. But for a small squash mark in the bottom of the book, which could even have happened in transit, this book is immaculate and the DVD is as new in its neat pocket inside the back cover page.<br /><br />Thank you<br />Will buy from this seller again
0877180121|5.0|I used this series years ago when I learned to play as a child.  It is quite straight forward and gradual, and easy for both teacher and pupil to learn.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The lessons in it are ageless. I would love to see this book on a summer reading list for many.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I was thrilled when I was able to find this movie for my daughter.<br />She loves all My Little Pony products so I knew immediately she would want this and love it.<br /><br />It arrived quickly, packaging was in excellent shape and the DVD itself is in excellent shape.
B004V73FGE|1.0|The storyline was not compelling. Character development was lacking. Hell, story development was lacking. The whole thing lacking in development and story. Bad. The sole reason I watched this movie is because my husband has a Tron pinball machine he loves. Trust me the pinball machine kills the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was good and challenging and helps me stay relaxed and it was fun more please keep them coming thanks
B008133MDK|5.0|I love almost all things Sherlock, but this show is above and beyond! The casting is perfection and the writing is fantastic. I love the actors! There was only one episode I didn't particularly care for, but I still would never say it was bad, just my least favorite. I recommend this series to everyone. When I worked at Barnes & Noble we couldn't keep the series in stock!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I love this book. Everything about it. The humor. The wit. The clever repartee. Drew is my new favorite alpha-male (move aside Gideon Cross and Kellen Kyle). Reading this story from his POV just \\"made\\" this book. The characters were true to themselves, the relationships Drew has with his friends (a guy's guy), with his sister (spot-on sibling crap), with his niece (sweet), with Kate (swoon)...spectacular, the love scenes (hot!)! I've recommended this book to as many friends as I can. It's just that good. I want to read more by Ms Emma Chase. Her writing is just an amazing example of non-fictional human behavior captured in a fictional story. This story could happen to anyone...well, almost anyone. You won't regret the purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is awesome u need to get it I'm going on a world tour in the game and it is awesome there r hunts and if u get all the things u get a prize
0375869026|5.0|This was required for my sons school for summer reading. I thoroughly enjoyed it as did my son, a lot of lessons learned, loved how she made you look through each of the main characters eyes.
B00006AW2J|4.0|good example of the Stones' basic skills at song writing and producing.  Really good stuff, thought maybe not their most popular album.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I took off twc got to be too much. I just want the weather not all that other stuff .
030758836X|1.0|The writers style is condescending which explains why the characters are so unlikeable.  The book was boring and I had to put it down.  I was reading for a book group but I will have to tell the group, I could not even force myself to read this.  I know it has good reviews which makes me doubt all the hike surrounding a book like this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have this app on my phone as well. Great for passing the time on an commute or just killing time.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I purchased this on a whim, never played it (or the family of games) before. The game is pretty fun, requires creativity, and isn't so difficult you stop wanting to play. I also likes that I can make my avatar god, fun times.
B001M3LG84|3.0|The  performance was good as usual but a lot of repeats in selections-- I thought I had the wrong program on. I think he could do better but I suppose being in a new continent,who would know? Just not up to par!
0143124544|5.0|When I started this book I was unprepared for all the tears. As I read this beautiful story of falling in love bloomed before me. Then the fight for the person loved. I started crying at around page 50 and didn't start until I finished it. There was laughing as well. I loved it. This is a timeless story to touch any life that has loved and lost.
B002RAREAK|5.0|this was after his divorce, and if your an Usher fan your going to be hooked on the lyrics, the ballads are beautiful and sexy like only Usher can deliver. please don't sleep, Usher is a grown man now, and his cd screams that....Favorite songs on this one &#34;Hey daddy&#34; and &#34;okay&#34;...
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's a fun game, but way too slow on my Kindle Fire.  I don't know if it just requires too much memory or what, but I am considering getting rid of it.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great series.  I loved the re-do of Battlestar Galactica (at least the first two seasons).  If you liked that series, you'll like this.<br /><br />Great acting....really good characters, character development, and relationships.<br /><br />Season 2 - also great.<br /><br />Season 3 - also great.<br /><br />Can't wait for season 4......
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|It was hard to put this book down.  I love Dan Brown's books but get a little confused by all the jumping around.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Pretty good flick. Some need twists half way through, and the action was fun. The story was what you would expect from a high priced action movie.
1400082773|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIMES, I HAVE READ IT AT LEAST FOUR TIMES, OBAMA'S LIFE IS SUCH<br />AN INTERESTING STORY ONE CAN HARDLY IMAGINE IT, IT IS CERTAINLY UNIQUE TO SAY THE LEAST.<br />I HAVE ALSO PURCHASED THIS BOOK FOR SEVERAL FRIENDS AS WELL,I WAS TOTALLY MESMERIZED!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I originally wanted to rent the movie because I wasn't sure if it would be worth fifteen dollars. If you are on the fence about it, just get it. It made me laugh and cry, and if you liked the first movie, you will like this one too.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Great actor and actresses.  Don't understand why they would agree to star in this dreadful movie.  Stupid story.  Painful to watch.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Very useful and inspirational guide for anyone. Mr. Kleon makes a powerful argument for &#34;stealing&#34; as an essential tool for self-development and progress!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Keeps your interest and really gets you thinking.  Acting is very good. Can't wait for season two to come out.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|the book was so good and I can not wait to read the third book! I hope they make it into a movie too
B008LXZFH6|1.0|This movie was the poorest excuse for entertainment I have ever suffered through.  It is hard to believe that Hollywood would produce something so disgusting.  Anyone who saw this movie will NOT be seeing the sequel!!
B000ID37RM|5.0|Time less, classic and great performances. Nothing has changed that much, still fighting bigotry and racism under new names, now it's economics.
140191716X|5.0|This book makes a beautiful gift for a friend or someone going through a crisis. I own one and I brought two to give as gifts. Doreen Virtue is a great writer.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Anyone who is a cat lover would enjoy this book. It's an easy read and also a feel good story of the bond between a lost soul and a stray cat. The book shows how important a pet relationship can be to someone. In this case, Bob is the catalyst that helps turn his owners life around.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very entertaining and addicting.  Loved the costumes, architecture, and characters.  The servants stories are as entertaining as the families stories.
B00C061I1M|5.0|This album is stunning. Whether you like delta rock, country, soul or blues - don't sleep on this one.<br />Hands down the best album of the year so far and an incredible, rare talent. They dont make them like this anymore.<br />And yes, the album is co produced by The Black Keys' Dan Auerbach, if you need a reference point to start with.<br />Incredible.
B00006F83Y|5.0|OK OK OK. Josh Homme. Great job. Just keep doing what your're doing! This is what rock should be: unrestrained,intelligent, virtuoso and at the same time sexual,stupid, ass moving and drug influenced. Don't ask me how those contradictions can coexist in a single piece of art. Ask Homme. He's seems to be the only one capable of pulling it off these days.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Movie was alright.  Some of it was a bit predictable.  That being said, there was enough action/drama to keep you interested throughout.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My husband and I play together and LOVE it! A must have app if you love a challenge and puzzles!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this little device.  Use it for casting Netflix and YouTube on the TV with ease.  Better definition that watching Netflix through the Blu-ray. Great buy and recommend it without hesitation.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|The DVDs themselves are packed full of great special features but the real joy comes of course from the episodes themselves. Series 1 of 'New' Doctor Who with Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper is a genuine delight. The first series definitely has it's downsides; not the best special effects but they're still getting their footing because by Series 2 they've worked out all the kinks. Don't let that stop you PLEASE because the real heart of it, the acting and the writing is honestly so compelling you can't stop watching. I've been a genre fan my entire life; sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comic books, manga- I *love* monster make up and visual effects, but none of that matters in the face of truly well rounded storyline and phenomenal chemistry between co-stars.<br /><br />This is hands down my favorite 'season' and I'll always recommend it!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This game was a waste of money it's stupid a lot of words they don't have to type. Don't get it it's a waste.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|It's the best ever and this is coming from someone who is paranoid of getting lost. It has never let me down. Would marry it but I don't swing that way lol.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Writing well done. Story line slightly confusing at first. Started in the middle of the costar's desire for new job she thought was her's. After it was explained the episode was effective. I like that this will be an ongoing story line. Could lead to some deeper and more elaborate mysteries.
1451627297|5.0|This book gets in to the story right away. I loved every page. Stephen King did it again. Definitely a must buy.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love SOA. It is one of the best shows ever. I have water all the seasons twice. Must see!!!!
B002O3Z50G|5.0|We loved it. My son was learning about tornados at his daycare so he was very excited to watch this movie.
B0065RIJ3W|3.0|Limited to the flood and drain technique and the front 25% is &#34;touchy-feely&#34; warm stuff about saving the planet rather than getting on with the title description. Nevertheless, a reasonable text on the subject
B005YPJ62E|5.0|I am limited in how many stars I can give....darn!  It has changed my life!!!  I already knew that stuff, but life happens and stuff gets kind of in the way!  I forgot how easy life can be if you remember about the law of attraction!!!  Really folks it is as easy as the book/cds/audio say!  I bought the cds, have spread them with everyone I can, bought the Audio for my kindle, and am in my car listening to that every time I get behind the wheel, and then in my office, with my door shut!  Really you have to invest in yourself!  It is the best investment you can make!  Seriously, we all waste a lot of money on stuff, this is one of the wisest investments anyone can make!
B0081336FO|5.0|I thought this series was fantastic! My roommate and I picked it when looking to find a show to enjoy together (I think his friend recommended it). It's neither vulgar nor commonplace. Rather it's intriguing, thrilling, innovative, well-acted, a bit quirky and fun! We both felt the biggest problem was that the series was too short; each episode is like a 90 minute movie so there were only three episodes per season). I highly recommend it!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I admit it took me a while to start watching this, and when I did I didn't expect much, but it blew away my expectations and REALLY impressed me.  Now I'm totally hooked!  Is Season 2 here yet?!
B0070YDOT8|5.0|This game has lots of different type of games to play. I really enjoy it I just wish I could when more.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is a wonderful story, but I do have a hard time following and remembering the characters.  The book develops a storyline continuation in new paragraphs, months or years may have passed and you really have to think of who he is talking about, or go back to find it.  This happens especially when I don't read for a few days, and then I have to pick up where I was in the book again.  But overall, Mr. Hosseini proves once more that he is a superb storyteller and I learn something from each book of his that I read, so a big thank you to him.
B00B49GSQQ|5.0|Wow.  Kino actually decides to put a few extras on this disc unlike most of the other Mario Bava releases.  Hopefully they did not screw up the color timing like Black Sabbath.
B001EBYMAI|5.0|Hellblazer is a great comic and this movie is a pretty good adaptation. While not always truthful to the comic book it is a fun movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As a new avid reader, I suggest this book to non-readers to rediscover their new love for reading. I consumed every word of this series.
0307742997|4.0|I enjoy the style of Jo Nesbro and nothing is lost in translation.  It is a book to settle down with over a long, lazy weekend.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Fun and easy to read. I enjoyed the innocence and wonderment explored through the story. I recommend to anyone needing to let their mind play and get away from reality.
B00BPBWYM0|2.0|So disappointed to see a compilation of Francoise Hardy's English language songs and not see \\"Now You Want To Be Loved\\" on the list.  From what I have heard of her, her finest song.  A different version of the song was included in the soundtrack for the movie \\"Live For Life\\" sung by another singer. As far as I know, this song only appeared on a 45, has never been on an album or compilation and still has not been released on CD.  Even the other song on the 45, \\"Tell Them You Are Mine\\" is not included here rendering this compilation as \\"incomplete\\".
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game. Keeps me busy. Love the colors. Played this on my computer all the time. Haven't played this game in so long. Forgot how much I missed this game.
0553385445|5.0|But still very enjoyable. Belfort is a master story teller; I wonder if he has any plans to try his hand at fiction?
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I thought it had a slow start but then it was really good! I would recommend this book just take your time getting through the beginning and you will enjoy it!
140006922X|5.0|Excellent interpretation of Jesus.  Unique look at his life based on understanding the times in which he lived.  Loved the book.
0785153942|3.0|Rather than focus of the birth of mankind saving itself, the story gets sidetracked with dreary melodramas over who's banging who's girlfriend/s.<br /><br />The artists also had no interest in drawing Yeagers, it's as if the artists consider them unwelcome background art easily rushed and noticed by no one.
B0081336FO|4.0|This is great interpretation of the classic - I read the original so often that I remember passages from it !!!  Wish there were more episodes in the series.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I read it without ever really been trap by the story. I guess the plot seemed to linger unnecessarily in some parts without a real reason.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|The series seems to have stopped or something, it is good for what it is do not take more into it.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book was awesome! Definitely keeps you wanting more. I would recommend this series to anyone who wants a good read.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|A really good book, it's a page turner for sure!!! I could reread this book all over again!!! A must read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the best books I`v ever read!!!!! The battle was the best part!!! Can't wait for to read the the books!!!!
B0061S073A|1.0|my grandchild somehow brought this up when misplaying around with my kindle and I could not figure our how to remove it to use my kindle....the web address does not work. My daughter finally fixed the problem. It is not very easy to understand what to do. Conclusion, I have no blooming idea if this is good since it wouldn't let ME do anything with it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is to awesome, John Green really did good in this one<br />I loved it!!!! And i cant wait for the movie to come out
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The COIN DOZER is an easily addictive and fun game that will keep you playing for hours. There are some really effective special coins that show up, such as a red one that summons a giant coin to come and earn you multiple coins, a blue coin that summons a \\"coin shower\\", and even orange gift coins, that award you with special coins. The prizes are also a plus and give you bonus coins. I usually try to sell all of my prizes that I have, especially the whistles (I hate whistles), because I don't want to end up being broke in this game. Also, sometimes a puzzle piece will show up that will eventually earn you \\"dozer dollars\\", which is a really nice feature. Other than the fact that you have to buy coins with actual money instead of with the dozer dollars (I don't know why this game is \\"free\\"), the COIN DOZER is an extremely fun game that I would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
B000XUBC5E|5.0|The plot twists always keep you guessing as to what is happening.<br />The change in point of view as the story unfolds is captivating.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game<br />Addictive<br />I never stop playing with it unless someone yells at me to stop.<br />Ever since I have introduced this game to my mom she has never stopped playing it and won't events me have a turn.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a wonderful little free program that is an easy to use clock and alarm clock. The alarm makes a nice backup to the one on my android phone and has been reliable.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I pre-ordered the Pulse from the Withings website. I have a Withings Scale and Blood Pressure Monitor and couldn't be happier with either of them. The Pulse has nearly all the functionality I wanted in an activity tracker and has great potential. I've worn it daily for just over 6 weeks. It's a good first offering. However, it isn't perfect.<br /><br />The good things:<br /><br />It integrates very well into my Bluetooth phone and the Healthmate application. Setup was painless.<br /><br />The battery life is excellent. I use it 24/7 and it the battery lasts well over two weeks. Recharging is easy and takes very little time. When I sit at my desk to work for a long period of time, I put the Pulse on the charger and in a couple of hours, it's full.<br /><br />It's small, lightweight and unobtrusive. I clip it on my belt during the day and forget its there.<br /><br />It uploads its data throughout the day without intervention.<br /><br />Its firmware upgrades via Bluetooth from the phone app.<br /><br />Now, for the not so good:<br /><br />My first concern is there is no way to calibrate stride. There is absolutely no way for it to accurately measure distance without knowing the average stride of the wearer. The further you walk, the more the error accumulates. If you have a short stride, then your distance will be overstated; a long stride understated. I've addressed this with Withings and asked for a way to calibrate the Pulse, but have received no response to date.<br /><br />Second, the Elevation measurement is suspect. I've actually measured my elevation change and compared it to the Pulse. For several days I kept track of the number of times I climbed the stairs in my home. The elevation change is ~9 feet from top to bottom. Some days, the Pulse did a reasonable job, but most days it underestimated my elevation change by at least 60%. Walking from my car to my office is an elevation change of at least 18' involving a hill and stairs. I've made the trip twice today. I've also climbed the stairwell in my home twice, yet the Pulse only shows a total change of 22'. It's neither consistent nor accurate.<br /><br />Third, the protective coating which covers the soft plastic body is flaking and peeling. This is a bit disturbing considering this device is to be worn during vigorous workouts, can be kept in your pockets and is potentially subject to harsh use. The front of my Pulse is beginning to show surface scratches in the plastic as a result. So far, it is still operating as designed.<br /><br />Fourth, there is no way to clear measurements nor is there a way to take intermediate measurements. For instance, if I wanted to take a walk during lunch and only measure the distance I traveled during this walk, I could not do so. Of course, you can manually display and remember the step count when you begin and check it when you end. An option to force an upload, clear today's measurements and start over today would be acceptable, but it's not available. Currently the software begins measuring your day's activity anew at 12:00 AM. This can't be altered.<br /><br />I am still using my Pulse and will continue to do so until a better product appears or it ceases to function. However, having experience with it now, I probably would have waited until the second generation came to market before purchasing. Withings will undoubtedly continue to update the firmware to increase the functionality and accuracy. There has already been one update and there was a noticeable change in step count and distance. However, until they provide a way to calibrate a person's stride, I'm not sure how accurate it can be made.<br /><br />*** Update 8/20/2013 13:32 ***<br /><br />In all fairness to Withings, their customer service has always been responsive as witnessed by the comment posted below. Long term, I believe the Pulse will become a great asset to those who are electronically monitoring and tracking their health.<br /><br />I'm glad to have learned that there are updates coming for the stride calibration and the elevation issues. This demonstrates to me that Withings is working to make a good product even better. Once these issues are addressed and I've had a chance to use them, I'll revise my review. If the solutions are workable, I'll likely up my rating to four stars.<br /><br />I also should note that I contacted Withings Customer Service for a remedy to the peeling of the outer coating on the Pulse. Without any further inquiry on my part, I was sent an response saying that a replacement is on its way! This is only a few hours after my original contact. This is how customer service should be run! If I could give Withings Customer Service five stars, I would do so without hesitation.<br /><br />Again, I'm not disappointed in the product overall. It does provide me with some very useful information on my activity. Like all new products, there are teething pains and I believe Withings is working to correct the Pulse's shortcomings and deliver a superior product.at there are updates coming for the stride calibration and the elevation issues.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Kerman does an excellent job of portraying the horrible waste our prison system is. There is NO effort to help cons to get skills, a trade or any meaningful means of 're-entering society.

The lyrics have many layers to them, especially depending on what state of mood you are in when you listen and can get a whole new perspective on the album each time. such a great voice too to listen when you are having a slow day
B00B7Y0206|1.0|At first it was great then it started crashing and the when it stopped crashing it would not show the suggestions

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was really awesome and it still is I can't wait till the next update I bet it's gonna be super cool
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was great. It so hard to imagine children who are 6 acting like that, but I began to picture the story. There is some language in it, do younger readers beware. The story was fantastic and well written and took us inside the mind of Ender Wiggin. The ending was perfect, and this is a must read for sci go fans.

B00AZMFJYA|2.0|Okay, I'm going to be straight about what I think of Star Trek Into Darkness, and if people don't like what I have to say that's fine, but don't start leaving personal attacks and insults in the comments.  For one thing, I loathe people who do that kind of thing; for another, it's just plain childish.<br /><br />Having said that, here goes:<br /><br />On one level (as one of the old-guard Trek fans), I despised what was done with this movie.  It started off with a major (and I do mean MAJOR) violation of the Prime Directive that left a primitive species with knowledge that could potentially alter the course of their history and cost Kirk his command (for the moment; Kirk is back on the bridge of the Enterprise within minutes), he turned Khan (quite arguably the movie's worst kept secret; practically everyone I talked to knew that \\"John Harrison\\" was really Khan from the get-go) into a skinny, white British bloke (not that I'm knocking Benedict Cumberbatch; I happen to be a huge fan of his); and he had Chekov working in Engineering for half the movie.  Add to that Spock's street brawl with Khan, a scene where Carol Marcus rather unnecessarily strips down to her bra and panties, and an Engineering section that looks suspiciously like the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Van Nuys that they filmed it in, and this film makes Ed Wood look like James Cameron.<br /><br />To be fair, I can't blame the cast for this film; all the actors are very good, but they were working with a bad script that seemed more concerned with cannibalizing lines and what appeared to be entire plot points from The Wrath of Khan than turning out something with a lot more substance and heft to it.<br /><br />As someone who just plain enjoys a good old popcorn film every now and again, Star Trek Into Darkness was okay, which is why I gave it the rating that I did.  The plot might be chock full of references to the original show and sacrifices of a good script for lots of visual effects and at least one gratuitous scene with Kirk in bed with a couple of ladies (plus the aforementioned, equally gratuitous scene with Carol Marcus in her bra and panties), but it had lots of action and great visual effects (an area where JJ Abrams excels, sometimes at the expense of a good story). If only this film had actually shown that those in charge had actually cared about what they were doing, then it might have been a decent Star Trek film; as it was, it made for an okay popcorn film, and some might even question that, considering that the Enterprise should have been in orbit instead of submerged in a body of water in the opening scene. After all that, I cannot totally condemn this movie, but neither can I wholeheartedly recommend it.uitous scene with Kirk in bed with a couple of ladies (plus the aforementioned, equally gratuitous scene with Carol Marcus in her bra and panties), but it had lots of action and great visual effects (an area where JJ Abrams excels, sometimes at the expense of a good story).

141659521X|5.0|Due to Vince Flynn's untimely death, this is the last novel we will see from this outstanding author.  I have really enjoyed following Mitch Rapp's career, his exploits and adventures.  We will certainly miss Vince Flynn's entertaining writing and the culmination of Mitch Rapp's career.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I think the game is cute and has its fun points but to make anything, like food it costs $7500.00 just for a fork, wow!!  It's hard to earn money because you need to grow food which costs alot so you can never earn enough to buy things. Just wish things didn't cost so much, other than that it's a fun cute game.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Typical  Jack Reacher.  Interesting, exciting, informative, and lots of intrigue.  Great storyteller.  I have enjoyed reading every one!  Even the intimate parts are not bad.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I love Stargate the movie, Stargate SG-1 and the Atlantis spin-off. I have the entire collection of the SG-1 shows as well as both movies. I started to collect the Atlantis seasons after that and so far I have just finished getting the whole set. This is an awesome show and a great must have gift for any Stargate fan. I would recommend it to all ages and at times they may have some mild scary scenes for very young viewers I think it is mild enough that even my youngest daughter has loved the show and not had a problem with it.

140011425X|5.0|I got the audio (legally blind can not read books)as a gift and listened to it on a road trip in the car while on the long drive. It was good and I enjoyed it a lot. I would recommend parents of young children to listen to it before letting their children to know where there is some adult situations that they may want to FF through and not let them listen to the full track for small parts. Though I should say that any part even the occasional mild language and the suggested adult scenes are pretty mild and you see and hear a LOT worse on cable these days. All in all I think it is a real good story and it is a lot like the Castle tv series which I love to watch. The book is kinda like an extra long episode honestly which is fun for fans in an \\"extra bonus\\" sort of way. I enjoyed it, my fiance enjoyed it and my teenagers enjoyed it. So much so that we already have gotten the second one and will be getting the third and fourth when we can.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The Lost Hero is great. I was so excited to see that some of the same characters from the Percy Jackson series are in this book series as well.
1439153663|4.0|It held my interest very closely until, suddenly, a few years passed after the events were on a daily basis.  Then the ending was very not one that made you feel like all of the years of suffering were worth it.  That may have very well been the case for so many back then, but this is a novel and we would love to have seen a little something work out a bit better for sweet, long-suffering Lavinia.
B000NA28IE|4.0|Me and my kids love the books so I got the movie for them. I am disappointed in the fact that they took so much of the story and shoved it all into one movie (felt like it cheated the story really by leaving out so much in order to squish three books into one movie) and then didn't even finish the story after with a second. They elude in the end that they will finish the story but they have not since. As for this movie it is well done otherwise. I think the special effects is very well done too. Despite how they shoved so much into the movie for those who have not read the book it is a movie that I think would be awesome. Also a great way to learn what happens in multiple books all in one short movie. So I do like it just wish they had give more time for it and spread it out over more movies to be able to put more of the story that got cut.

1401326161|5.0|I was given the first book on audio CD as a gift for Christmas this past year. I loved it so much that when I was given an amazon gift card for my birthday I immediately went and got the second audio. It was just as good as the first and I have every intention of getting the third and fourth (when available). I would warn parents of smaller children there is mild language and adult natured material. It is nothing as bad as cable these days but still more than some parents might want children to hear. Not as bad as most romantic novels do not get me wrong it is mostly clean just eludes to some situations that I did not want my younger children to listen to. Otherwise for adults and older teenagers it should be just fine to listen to and enjoy the story.
B00CEF014E|4.0|This is a fast-moving novella with many twists and turns, and many characters who keep leaping into the story as it progresses, which makes it an interesting page-turner.  Dana March, the female protagonist has been released after five days from a mental institution, being told she is not suicidal any more.  Later she is at a motel with her new husband, Jack Harris, who nobody has ever seen and with whom she has not cohabited.  She cannot find her husband after she returns to the motel room from checking in and the story centers around her search for Jack.  During this search, she goes to the commune, which her sister, Zoe and husband, Clive run (Home of the Rainbow Collective.)<br /><br />Physical action builds page by page as she continues to seek her missing husband and various mysterious individuals enter the scenes.  There is evil and horror throughout, which builds page by page...a mystery, and being only a novella there is not the ability to truly build characters.  Definitely Dana, who is at first depicted as being a helpless woman, is anything but and her cat even is an attack cat who is dangerous, along with a mastiff owned by the caretaker.  The only weakness I noticed is that the ending just happens suddenly as if the author didn't know how to end it with the same drama that the rest of the novel contains.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|What can I say.  The story line was powerful, the characters were well-developed, the prose was almost poetic at times.  I actually cried at a couple of points along the way.  I found it difficult to put the book down, and when I finished, I went back to the beginning and started re-reading.  This was the first book I've read by this author, and now I've started his new novel, &#34;And the Mountains Echoed,&#34; which so far promises to be just as good.  I highly recommend A Thousand Splendid Suns.

B00CHMBQ0C|5.0|This film was fascinating.  Seriously, it was \\"Taken\\" with everything fixed.  It's about a spy with a daughter.  Something goes wrong with his work and she gets grabbed.  There is more to the story of course but really everything I thought was horrible in Taken never happened in this movie.  If you want the story this is the good version.  Everything was better. Everything.  The plot, the writing, acting directing even the lighting was better. Not crazy about the poster though.

B008JFUPK8|1.0|How can it be that a lot movies are released faster on DVD and BrdD? Oblivion and Star Trek into Darkness being two examples of this, both of them available on DVD 3 or 4 months after their theatrical release. I mean, we are not back in the 1990´s where you had to wait 6 to 8  months to get a movie on VHS or DVD. and for the looks of it, here on Amazon, everything is ready for a Sept. BrD/DVD release, so the question is...Why not?! Studios need to change with the times, it´s a whole different ball game nowadays.
140006922X|4.0|For most people, and I include myself in this group, there is an inherent difficulty in commenting on Reza Aslan's book: he is the expert in religious history, few of the rest of us are. But his book is not written for only other experts in the field, but for the general reading public which may have a certain amount of Biblical knowledge, incomplete though it may be, and will certainly have a reaction of some sort to the book. And while one has to respect the fact that the author has spent most of his adult life studying and teaching the subject matter he's writing about one doesn't have to take everything written in this book as gospel (pun definitely intended). I found some of his surprising conclusions only superficially convincing. For example, he describes a deep, even virulent rift between Paul and the original disciples, which he bases on specific verses from Paul's Epistles. However, if the rift is obvious to Mr. Aslan (maybe it's clearer in the original Greek which Mr. Aslan can read) it is much less obvious to an English-reader like myself, especially when the verses are read in their context which indicates that passing disagreements are quickly settled, with general harmony reigning over all. In another chapter Mr. Aslan gives a very original interpretation of the famous \\"Render unto Caesar...\\" quote, pitting Jesus as a dangerous enemy to the Roman government. However, at the same time as he paints Jesus as so dangerous that the Romans would want to arrest him quickly before he causes any other trouble, Mr. Aslan also argues that the Roman leadership would have had little time or interest in his fate, as he was just another unimportant, rabble-rousing Jewish peasant. And, if Jesus had really been leading a potentially violent revolution against Rome, which is the book's main thesis, it's curious that none of his followers seemed to have picked up on this after his death and resurrection. Again, as a non-expert, I can't say Mr. Aslan is mistaken, and he may well be right, but some of his arguments try to have it both ways. What one must give Mr. Aslan a great deal of credit for, however, are his long end-notes, which include several citations of scholars who disagree with some of his conclusions. If one feels the need to look up expert arguments against Mr. Aslan, these references are a good starting point.<br />All that being said, and having established that I am not willing to slavishly accept every point made in the book, I did still find it well-written, deeply researched and intelligently, if not always persuasively, argued. Disagreeing with some of it's conclusions doesn't make it a bad book, or even a badly-argued book. It is the nature of argument that there is more than one point of view, and one can certainly respect what one disagrees with without making it a personal attack on the writer's abilities or intellectual honesty.<br />What I found most fascinating was Mr. Aslan's deep respect, maybe even affection, for Jesus the man. He does not in any way belittle his actions or his ministry. In fact, one could conclude from this book that in Mr. Aslan's view Jesus would have been an important, even history-making figure, even if there were no claim of divinity. Where the Bible, for many people, is interested in a higher theological message and not historical facts, Mr. Aslan simply steps around the message to bring us the history. For example when it comes to the Resurrection, he simply states this is a matter if faith, not history, and makes no effort to debunk it or belittle those who believe it. Of course, if someone considers every letter and every comma in the Bible to be part of an absolute truth, then this book could be quite offensive. However, if one takes the position that the over-all message of the Bible is more important than certain historical facts, then this book is actually a great companion piece, allowing the reader a detailed insight into the time and place that Jesus lived, and how hewould have been looked upon by both the Jews and the Romans of that time. I'm pretty sure that was Mr. Aslan's intention, and in that he has succeeded wonderfully.would have been looked upon by both the Jews and the Romans of that time. I'm pretty sure that was Mr. Aslan's intention, and in that he has succeeded wonderfully.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|The first Kick Ass was a bloody romp through a budding superhero's career. This outing follows the titular super hero as he lives in the world that he's changed.<br /><br />This movie is bloodier, funnier, more action packed and packed with heart. A true GRADE A sequel to an incredible film. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Cannot wait for this to come out on Blu-Ray so I can rip through the making of featurettes that are hopefully included.<br /><br />If you want an edge of your seat, bloody and wild ride, then go see this damn movie!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This little package of blog posts is put together neatly in one place - it feels more like a short (but very valuable).  This mini book will really get you thinking - and you'll recoup the tiny price tag when you avoid buying more junk on your next trip to the mall or big box retailer.  An excellent read!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm just sad that season 4 is so far off. Love Downton Abbey! I'm purposely watching it slowly since I don't want to finish it much before the next season is released.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|I liked it and have done it several times now.  It's really helped me think about some things I like about myself.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|If you have read the book you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's very depressing and paints a horrible picture of NYC in the 20's. Of course, for all I know, that's exactly how NYC was back then. Either way, I enjoyed the movie. It made me feel just as terrible after watching the move as I did after reading the book.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|it works good no b.s on time works sorry not good @ this so its a good that i like it
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book, tho a novel,could very well be based on fact.  It gives a poignant view of the slavery era.  It had me in tears several times.  The characters were well-developed and the plot moved along at a good pace.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This move tells the real story of Temple Grandin.  I had a problem with my first DVD; however, it was replaced quickly at no additioanl cost.

B004LROUNG|5.0|I am a fan of John Grisham and devour every one of his books. The plots, tho mostly about the legal profession, are different stories.  This was one of my favorites.
B00E194KGQ|1.0|I love the album, but seriously, it should be marked that it is CENSORED.  As in, half of the album is missing.  Better off looking elsewhere, which is a shame because this version contains the recordings from Mayhem.

B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Ok to rent and watch once, but don't bother wasting your money to buy. Special water effects make this movie believable. Some touching scenes, and good acting.

B0065CCT6U|5.0|Love Love Love Chris Cornell's voice!!!  Must have if you are a fan of his music.  Also listen to it at work since it is mostly all acoustic and very calm.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is a great British drama! The characters are well developed and it takes place during WWII too as well. Each episode leaves you wanting to see the next!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|It was a cool concept and the acting was good. It lacked a lot of depth but it was good enough to entertain for the evening movie.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|This appears to be a great audio-visual history of rock n' roll through the context of a recording studio.  The &#34;f&#34; word spoils the fun for me.  I grew up through the sixties, and I'm not ready to return to the ills the culture brings for the sake of the documentary. The greatness of this story can be told without foul language.  It seems to calm down after the opening portion, though I'm not sure about the later portion, since I left it shortly after the first half-hour.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|My kids and I love this show! Its cute and funny, even for adults! The CD was still in its wrapping and it shipped quickly!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Have been a fan of Diana Gabaldon since Voyager - it is always hard to wait for her new books.  Have ordered the whole series on Kindle Fire to review and for a lighter way to hold and read books of this size.  A long time fan.

B004P7CN7W|4.0|Monstrous aliens Body Snatch the faculty of a small Ohio high school in this clique-y high school throwback filled with before-they-were-famous A-listers.<br /><br />Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk til Dawn, Planet Terror) delivers a fun horror experience in this clique-y high school throwback.  As if pulled from the Breakfast Club's Saturday detention, we find a motley crew of completely dissimilar backgrounds and values who are forced to work together against their common enemy, forces of evil: their teachers!<br /><br />The players include the shallow it-girl Delilah (Jordana Brewster; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Fast Five), the drug-peddling closet intellectual Zeke (Josh Hartnett; 30 Days of Night, Sin City), the bullied quiet kid Casey (Elijah Wood; Maniac), the maybe-lesbian antisocialite Stokely (Clea Duval; Identity, American Horror Strory), the football team captain Stan (Shawn Hatosy) and the southern belle do-gooder Mary Beth (Laura Harris; Dead Like Me, Dead Zone).  Some fellow student cameos include sesident stoner (Danny Masterson) and the token black guy (Usher).<br /><br />That's one Hell of a cast of before-they-were-huge actors!  When I recently saw this movie again, I found the cast to be as enjoyable as \\"the movie.\\"  It's fun seeing a bunch of star power in a movie you saw years ago without knowing they'd one day be a big deal (or, at least, slightly more famous).  But we've only looked at half the cast.<br /><br />Facing off against the students, we have the faculty, including the super mousy English teacher (Famke Janssen; Hemlock Grove, Deep Rising, The House on Haunted Hill), football coach and gym class teacher (Robert Patrick; Terminator 2: Judgment Day), biology teacher Dr. Furlong (Jonathan Stewart), Nurse Harper (Salma Hayek; From Dusk til Dawn, Dogma), Principal Drake (Bebe Neuwirth) and some other teacher who played a famous role (Daniel von Bargen; The Silence of the Lambs, Thinner).<br /><br />After being taken over by alien monsters in this Body Snatchers-Puppet Masters sampler, this high school faculty begins to behave much as the cold, transient high school educators we find today biding their time until moving on to what they think will be more glamorous careers.  Blatant, weird stares, stolid faces and socially awkward over-explanations of simple concepts clarify to the audience who has or hasn't yet been claimed by the alien lifeforms--as if we needed our hands held to understand this.  But, then again...this movie was marketed to high schoolers around the \\"no child left behind\\" days.  Anyway, this hardly begins to explain the weird behavior of the faculty.<br /><br />Mr. Furlong and Casey find some alien, aquatic larva which grows rapidly in water and self clones in seconds.  You've gotta' appreciate all of the movie-referencing in the dialogue (e.g., Aliens, The Puppet Masters, Men in Black, Invasion of the Body Snatchers), when our protagonists emulate the \\"who's one of them\\" test from The Thing and when a teacher's severed head \\"crawls\\" away--again, we'd like to thank The Thing for that idea.<br /><br />The violence and blood are \\"fun.\\"  It doesn't match up to the comically overdone slapstick of Drag Me to Hell, Tucker and Dale vs Evil or Evil Dead.  But it's pretty slimy and gross nonetheless.  There's stop-motion, CGI and classic make-up...even rubber monster suits (but mostly CGI).<br /><br />It's all a good time, but the effects run at a slow pace until the end.  In the meantime this feels a lot like a high school movie with a series of eerie teacher scenes mixed in.  But the last 30 minutes--featuring eye stabbings, aural insemination, tentacle attacks and crawling severed appendages--are well worth the wait if for no other reason than competent and fun special effects surrounding a nostalgic cast including many of today's A-listers.over by alien monsters in this Body Snatchers-Puppet Masters sampler, this high school faculty begins to behave much as the cold, transient high school educators we find today biding their time until moving on to what they think will be more glamorous careers.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|For mothers and fathers who will be kept guessing as they are thrown from one human emotion to another.  The story wraps guilt and innocence up with inherited tendencies, parental love and responsibilities.  I could not put this book down.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Oblivion is, first and foremost, a beautiful film. The visuals are awe inspiring. The acting is exactly what you'd expect. The plot is engaging and entertaining throughout.

B00CO9DY76|2.0|I was hoping to really like this carabiner, but it is way to small to be of any use. I was going to use this to carry my keys, but the gate is so small it is nearly impossible to use daily. I'm not sure what I could use it for. If you are looking for a keychain carabiner, look elsewhere.

0439023521|5.0|It had appeal to adult from the government manipulation of their citizens, connections with all the current reality shows, suspenseful plot, and believeable characters. Great discussion book for adult readers.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abby was one of those shows that I kept hearing my friends talk about, making comments on Facebook about, etc.  So, I decided to find out what the show was all about, and I ended up falling in love with the whole story's premise.  I think that I was able to watch all of the episodes to catch up (3 seasons worth) in a little longer than one weekend.  I was hooked!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend if you grew up watching shows/movies like the Anne of Green Gables series on PBS.  Good story lines can be on television without all the &#34;reality&#34; scripting.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like the game .but I thought their would be more than hidden objects and saying that u have to find the same ones over and over so don't know when or if u can go to something else?????
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I was genuinely surprised by the ending!  And enthralled.  Started reading it and didn't stop until I was finished and I will definitely be reading it again in the future.  Very happy with my purchase on this one.
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|It was just OK for my husband and me. My college-aged daughter left it mid-way through. She was very bored.

B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Little bit predicable but liked the sci-fi, special effects, and overall production. Feels like there is more to the story, seem like more is coming.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love these games! Much more entertaining than you would think initially. Keeps you occupied and entertained. My boyfriend and I love playing!
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|Seemed like a bit of a knock off, but the story was actually fairly unique. Bale always does a good job!
B00338QENI|5.0|I really loved this book.  So much information about this family over generations.  Just wish that one of her descendants had gone into medicine.  I learned a great deal about tissue culture and how it relates to diseases in the human body.
B0091WAWTM|3.0|Classic! Was not sure what to think for the first half, then it really started to heat-up. This needs a follow-up or a remake with current tech/trends.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Jack Reacher in 1977.  The story is not quite the typical Reacher story as in this one he is still active military.  Explains a few things about his life and his departure from the army.  Good read.  Enjoyable.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Slow character drama based in the South. Great acting all around and especially the 2 young actors that play the children. The movie is kind of long but keeps you hooked.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's the best book I ever read. It's all I need in a book. I can't wait to read the second and third book.
1451695195|2.0|I chose this rating because there was no mention of Jesus Christ. There was only mention of a higher being or God.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Worth watching. Story is interesting. Acting is fine. Imagery is very good. It's fun to watch if only to note the various iconic sci-fi themes the producers have chosen to touch upon, most notably 2001, Planet of the Apes (1969) and Star Trek I (1979). There's even a little touch of Atlas Shrugged. Go ahead and check it out. Your mind won't be totally blown, but you'll enjoy it.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This game rocks, pure ridiculousness in the best way great entertainment for down time. Five stars is a under statement. Is the 20 words yet?

B009WUBERW|2.0|I could barely get through the first 20 minutes of this movie and maybe it's just me but this movie only had one character that I enjoyed watching and that was Jet Li.  All the others i.e. Sylvester Stalone, Arnold and others seemed over the hill for an action movie.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie was unlike any other I have ever seen. It was spectacular. The directing, the acting, the interweaving of story lines and lines was stupendous. We have watched it twice and will watch it again. I can't wait to read the book.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This was deleted within ten minutes of downloading.  The first time one of the children played it, it was asking for payment for more bananas within a minute.  It was rated all ages, but it is definitely not for children.  They love the characters, but there is no game unless they can pump money, tokens, or whatever into it.<br /><br />.Great disappointment
B00CATSONE|2.0|It was not exactly what I was expecting. I wished it was more of a biography than a motivational how-to book
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I do enjoy playing this game but it takes a long time to complete.  I have not put it on facebook yet I'll let you know how that works.

B0087EVHVW|5.0|Awesome! very fast cpu, if its your first pc and you are low on cash, this is your i5 cpu
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I started reading this book not really sure of what would happen. I had read a few quotes and had a general idea of what it was about, but I have to say.... no description or review can do this book justice. The story is so so beautiful and rich.<br />DEFINITELY  (and highly) recommend this book!. Fantastic read!

B008PUF3VS|5.0|If you are looking for an ideal book for your 11-13 year old that will tie in with their History classes and is a little more conservative, then this is the perfect book. However I would suggest that reading together would be the best, as then issues and questions can be raised about the narrative, who knows, you might be surprised about the intelligent responses you get as I did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's like having an arcade in your house. I love to play it when I'm bored or whenever. I hope they add more.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a emotional book made for for high school students. In this book it made you feel how the other person was feeling

B00DW5IKJI|5.0|While we await the arrival of Britney Spears' new studio album (set to be released in early December), the music label continues to issue new compilation and remix albums. Fall, 2011 brought \\"B in the Remix, Vol. 2\\", and last Fall we were treated to \\"Playlist: The Very Best of\\" (14 songs for the price of an EP). Now we get this double album. Just a few months from now will mark the 15th anniversary of Britney's first single, so in a way this compilation can be viewed as a celebration of 15 years of Britney.<br /><br />\\"The Essential Britney Spears\\" (2 CDs, 32 songs; 116 min.) is the most complete overview of the `best' of Britney Spears to date. On CD1, we get all of Britney's singles starting with 1998's \\"... Baby One More Time\\" through 2004's \\"Outrageous\\". There are just a couple of singles missing: \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" (which by all means should've been included), \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last to Know\\", and \\"I Love Rock `n' Roll\\" (a big hit outside the US). CD2 picks up with 2004's My Prerogative\\" and runs all the way through this year's \\"Scream & Shout\\" (with will.i.am). Given the timing of this compilation, it would've been fabulous if this had included Britney's latest hit \\"Ooh La La\\" (from \\"Smurfs 2\\"),, but alas. And not to be super-picky but I would've left off the two non-singles that appear on CD2 (\\"Hot As Ice\\" and \\"Out From Under\\") and instead would've included the missing 3 singles I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />Couple of comments: from a pure music perspective, of all the \\"best ofs\\" out there on Britney, this is the best and most complete, and from here on out the only to have if you are a casual Britney fan (assuming there is such a thing). Furthermore, the songs are brought chronologically, which makes for a much better listening experience (compare this to the hodge-podge sequencing on the 2004 \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation). As for the die-hards, there is no new music on here so no compelling reason to buy this, other than for the pleasure of having this in your CD collection. Last, but certainly not least, this 2CD collection is selling at a very, very fan-friendly price (the price of a single CD basically). So what's not to like? \\"The Essential Britney Spears\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />Tracklisting: CD1: 1...Baby One More Time 2.Sometimes 3.You Drive Me Crazy (The Stop Remix) 4.From the Bottom Of My Heart 5.Oops!...I Did It Again 6.Lucky 7.Stronger 8.I'm a Slave 4 U 9.I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman 10.Overprotected (The Dark Child Remix) 11.Boys (The Co-Ed Remix) 12.Me Against The Music 13.Toxic 14.Everytime 15.Outrageous CD2: 1.My Prerogative 2.Do Somethin' 3.Gimme More 4.Piece of Me 5.Radar 6.Break the Ice 7.Hot As Ice 8.Womanzier 9.Circus 10.If U Seek Amy 11.Out From Under 12.3 13.Hold It Against Me 14.Till The World Ends 15.I Wanna Go 16.Criminal 17.Scream & Shout (with will.i.am)this in your CD collection.

B007MDB71O|5.0|We are sad that they didn't continue on with the whole series. We thought they did a decent job staying true to the book, but should've kept the original title, &#34;Princess of Mars.&#34;
B00EO2I6XS|4.0|\\"Hannah Arendt\\" (2012 release from Germany; 109 min.) is NOT a biopic of the German \\"political theorist\\" Hannah Arendt. Instead, it brings us the story surrounding Hannah Arendt (played by Barbara Sukowa) in 1961 when she is hired by the New Yorker Magazine to cover the trial in Jerusalem of ex-Nazi Adolf Eichmann, who was famously abducted by the Israeli secret police in Buenos Aires to stand trial for his crimes/atrocities against the Jews. Arendt soon creates a controversy within her circle of friends, and later, when her articles are published, within the Jewish community at large, with her controversial, yet misunderstood, views on the trial. It was in those articles that Arendt coined the now famous term \\"the banality of evil\\".<br /><br />Several comments: this is another historical drama, say along the lines of the recent \\"Emperor\\" movie. But there are differences. First, there is the amazing performance of Barbara Sukowa in the title role. She is simply outstanding. Second, this is directed by the legendary German director Margarethe von Trotta, now in her 70s if you can believe is. (Sukowa and von Trotta have teamed up before.) Third, the movie makes ample use of historical footage of the actual trial of Eichmann, and it is fascinating stuff to watch. Fourth, while there are a number of flashbacks to Arendt's earlier days as a philosophy student and her involvement with professor/philosopher Martin Heidegger (who eventually joined the Nazi party), there remain much more to be said/shown about Arendt (which of course is not the scope of this movie). Fifth, this being set in 1961, people are smoking cigarettes non-stop in virtually every scene of the movie, it is just beyond belief. Lastly, a weakness in the movie is that there is no enough real drama to be felt, even with all the controversies going on, reason that I rate this \\"only\\" 4 stars, as I still enjoyed the movie quite a bit.<br /><br />I saw \\"Hannah Arendt\\" a few weekends ago at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and the matinee screening I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, tilting heavily towards seniors. Alas, the movie didn't play very long on the big screen (it's already gone). That said, if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, or simply interested in the historical context of this topic, I would readily recommend you seek this out, be it in the theatre or on DVD.heatre here in Cincinnati, and the matinee screening I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, tilting heavily towards seniors.

B00AZMFJYA|1.0|I was really excited to see this new Enterprise crew again, but this was just a tired re-work of an old plot. Yawn.
1250012570|4.0|I read this book after seeing its glowing review in the New York Times Book Review, which described the book as &#34;unique&#34; and a &#34;beautiful, haunting love story.&#34; And I believe this latter comment is probably accurate if you are 15. For grownups, the appeal is more limited.<br /><br />This is the story of the relationship between a reasonably cool half-Asian boy and a poor, zaftig girl who sits next to him on the schoolbus in Omaha, Nebraska in the mid-1980s. We're not really told why they fall for each other, which is OK in this case because they don't really understand it themselves. Sometimes teenagers just fall for each other, as did Romeo and Juliet, and we shouldn't expect any more understanding than that.<br /><br />The first fifty pages of the book, in which the social standing of Park and the politics of the schoolbus are dissected, work very well. Older readers will find themselves thinking back to our own high school experiences and asking ourselves how we would have behaved, and where we would have fit in the world of Eleanor and Park.<br /><br />After that, it's less interesting. The parallels with Romeo and Juliet are quite heavy-handed (perhaps appropriately so for a teenaged reader but as a grownup, I've been to this balcony before). The &#34;big twist&#34; near the end has been so aggressively telegraphed that it would never have ocurred to me that it was intended as a surprise if it weren't referred to as such on the bookjacket. Most importantly, as a grownup, a relationship between a couple of teenages just isn't very interesting. Even Romeo and Juliet evolves pretty quickly into a sort of a thriller (how will they survive now that their clans are fighting?). Absent that, I'm not sure even Shakespeare could have kept people reading for 320 pages.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This is not only a movie about bird watching, it is a movie about people's lives and how serious contests effects their lives.  The movie notes what's important in people's lives.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A really fun book to read. Not kings quintessential work (I still consider this to be \\"the stand\\") it was touching and as in many of his books, appeals in a different way than expected. While I would not recommend this be the first king( or even the second) that someone read, I recommend it to any fan of his work.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I watched the movie over the weekend and was under wowed. Tom and Morgan have both done better. Guess they needed a paycheck.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|The plot was different, but not always believable.  Some of his earlier books have been better.  I am not sure I would try another.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Amazingly gripping story.  I stayed up ridiculously late to finish it.  The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is that the subject matter - murdering families - is so dark that I found it a bit disturbing!
1449433251|5.0|Calvin and Hobbs is beloved humor by my 12-year-old grandson.  I have loved it, especially the snowmen series, for a long time.  I bought the set for myself and as Christmas gifts for others.  Classic American cartoon.  Much better quality than what we typically see today.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|One of the single greatest movies of all time. As a young child in the 90s, this one made me cry at the end...and that takes a lot.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was as usual well written, but not memorable.  I believe that Grisham has written some better book and worse books than this one.  This is not his best.
0425256162|2.0|Loved Chasm City, have retread it twice.  Liked the Revelation Space series.  Enjoyed The Prefect a lot.  Some of the others are at least okay, if not the best.  But I thought House of Suns was unengaging, I passed on the one after that (subject didn't interest me) and this one ... whew!  Sounded interesting, but I've struggled through 156 pages so far, and I'll probably finish it eventually, but these have to be the slowest 156 pages ever written.  Everything drags on.  Extremely long chapters filled with long, boring, unenthusiastic conversations that don't even amount to much.  Heck, even the characters seem bored.  Reynolds can do better ... much better ... than this.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|Every artist shines in this album. Boyd sings his heart out. His voice being stretched further than it ever has been. His lyrics as clever as usual yet so much more in debt and mature. isadore is in it's own league. It is a story thag leaves you wanting more details.  Mike shines in his melodies as well as diversity. Jose shows disipline and restraint which is a great talent for a drummer. Ben is well Ben. Always on fire. Kilmore proves he is not only a great DJ but also an artist.  Over all the album is mature, deep and sexy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The author got me hooked with the first pages.  He gave me an insight into the Afghan tender poetic hearts.<br />May he be deep into another story at this moment.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is fun, nice, ad-free, a place that I can find enjoyable things to entertain, or to do &  that don't offend my views. Facebook used to be like that. Now it so often brings out the worst in people!!!!! Now the ads are overwhelming, always pushing! The groups are negative, biased, agitators of the worst kind of emotions! Due to all of this, users are becoming increasingly escalated against others in their circles with opposing viewpoints! Pinterest, so far, so great! Keep it up!!! :)
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Certain files can only be read using Adobe Reader: Kindle Fire HD does not support Adobe, but ES File Explorer allows the Adobe app to work on Kindle. Allows any file that requires Adobe to operate in Kindle. Good app! Works very well.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|Overall a good movie.  Would loved to have more action scenes, but otherwise a good movie,  Personally I like the first one a little better due to the comedy that came with it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I got hooked on Season 1 -- great story line, amazing costumes and talented actors. Such a great show to watch when there's so much JUNK on TV these days.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys Masterpiece theater, British culture and anything to do with beautiful costumes and characters!
B004MPESSY|5.0|This movie is for the ones who love to watch revenge being served out.  Did not care of the nudity of the woman could be done without that.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Played alot of these..it's not bad but hate paying to get games that aren't great.<br />App of the daybut only get 1st level.
B007HOD2WA|2.0|I got this movie after watching the third one, however ended up deleting it from my kindle due to the amount of nudity.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|I watched it once, then again to understand the dialogue better, then I read a synopsis (after which I understood more about what was going on), then I watched it one more time at a better volume and with more thought, since I found that it is more of an analytical presentation.  Beautiful cinematography, though, beautiful Pattinson as usual, now guess I'll be forced to check out the book at the library to complete the circle.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am very impressed with this game.  The puzzles aren't too difficult and the graphics are outstanding.  I am eagerly awaiting the next Room and will play this again as soon as I am done with this review!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I can always depend on this clock to wake me, and the pleasant tones are nice to wake up to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Suspenseful and sooo much fun unlocking each level!  Each level is equally challenging.  it is a fun game for all ages
B005544TRQ|5.0|The worst part is that now we're caught up to the live shows and have to wait!<br /><br />Its a great show that both men and women can enjoy so you can watch TV with your spouse and not be watching the bachelor ;)
2067002627|5.0|Even more than I expected.<br /><br />Great detail. Will be of great assistance for anyone who is interested in the Normandy invasion.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|On my phone I have the most updated version with three more vehicles the buggy tractor bus etc. When will there be an update available for the kindle fire HD edition<br /> Other than that good game but only 3 stars for that reason
B009EE7NQ2|5.0|The acting in this film is phenomenal, the humor is hilariously quirky, and I loved the ending. It was more than worth the reasonable purchase price! I highly recommend this movie.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I had a very hard time following the story line.  I finally deleted the story from my Kindle after the sister's death.  Too many description errors, dull story characters and the main character, was a mealy-mouthed character to say the least.  Thank goodness it was a free book.  This should be a No Star book.
0470474874|4.0|My assistent likes these software &#34;bibles&#34;.  She says you can pretty much find whatever you need there, and this edition did not dissapoint.
B00ELCXRG2|5.0|We all know that it's a love story. With suspense, emotions, doubts, regrets, ups and downs, complications, bliss, erotica, sun rises and sun sets, laughter and tears, I also discovered that it's about things we hold dear or are keen to understand even a hundred years later... More on [...]
B007A2O3FO|5.0|As usual, Maggie Smith delivers a great movie.<br />The story, the characters, the setting, everything is really good.<br />I do recommend it
0679731725|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read...after the last page was turned, it stayed with me for months after.<br />The authentic feel of the novel was on point as was the period description of life and culture at a \\"great house\\".<br />Although on the surface this may, at first glance, appear to be a book about custom and rigidity, it is in fact, a fantastic portrait of the stifling of natural human passion while striving to blindly serve, of love barely glimpsed and then lost, of hope, both dying and alive...and, finally, it is a portrait of bitter regret.<br />This book is a must read for any true lover of literature who wants to see character development at its finest.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The production is amazing.  Love the setting.<br />Maggie Smith is always a sure thing, and the rest of the cast is incredible.<br />The story is good, and the whole idea is lovely.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Not bad worth the money to avoid the ridiculous ads every other maze. Like the movie theme, more to come?
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is really a masterpiece.  Everything about it is first class.  The performances, the setting, the story, the way everyone behaves, dresses, acts...It is superb!
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Excellent!<br />Very well produced, love ......&#34;someone i used to know&#34;.  I hadn't heard of this group until hearing them on the radio.  Very impressive.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|You can't go wrong when you buy a Selena Gomez CD. She's coming to Phoenix, Arizona in concert November 2, 2013. I can't wait.<br /><br />There are no &#34;bad songs&#34; on this CD.<br /><br />Watch her movie with Ethan Hawke too when it comes out August 30th. Check out the trailers for &#34;GETAWAY&#34; on YouTube! Nice person, too.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you haven't seen it, then I suggest you get it!  This is one of the best UK drama series out there.
0321934962|5.0|I'm really glad I bought this book. I will be referring back to it I'm sure. This was my first DSLR and though I went through the manual thoroughly I found this book a better explanatio
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A great read<br />I could not put it down<br />I was swept away from.my.own reality by this book<br />Going to find more by this author and devour them
0316232955|5.0|I enjoy watching Chris Colfer on Glee, and was thoroughly impressed with the Struck By Lightning film. This novel complements that as the lead character's, Carson's, journal based during the time period of the movie. Colfer really got into the headspace of the snarky teenager he was portraying, with pages upon pages of laugh-out-loud banter and heartfelt insight into the struggles of being an overachieving, under-appreciated kid going through what he was in high school -- blackmailing his peers to gain the credentials to get into the university of his dreams.<br /><br />Also heard in an interview that he wrote this in two weeks. Despite it being a supplement to his film, this novel would stand alone very well. Highly recommended, inspirational, emotional and moving read.
1449320104|5.0|This book contains more than the required amount of information needed to understand C#. This book has helped me to understand the concepts.
B00E193Y36|5.0|If you like FFDP you can't go wrong with this album!  I've been listening to it constantly since I downloaded it from Amazon and it is one of my favorite albums.  Looking forward to Vol. 2 coming out later this year as well.<br /><br />My favorite tracks:<br />Lift Me Up<br />You<br />Watch You Bleed<br />Wrong Side Of Heaven<br />Burn MF<br />Anywhere But Here<br />Dot Your Eyes<br />M.I.N.E. (End This Way)<br /><br />The live stuff on disc 2 is an awesome collection of different live songs and makes picking up the deluxe edition worth it!
1577314808|5.0|An interesting book I enjoyed a great deal. Recommened for those who want a different perspective on Life itself and the Mind.
B007FXLWKW|5.0|My kids have watched this over and over and I find myself watching it too. James Marsden does a great job.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's fun and free! It's a game that makes you think. It kind of reminds me of clue but there are no actual characters (so far). I recommend it.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|Loved the idea in book 1 but became to confusing and lost alot of it's originality. Felt like the plot went in circles.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Fun and exciting little slow in the middle but at about 60% your hooked. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This works exactly as expected, but it's a bit cumbersome if you have to carry it in a pocket like I do. I wish they could come up with a better setup for both the earset and the case.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Can get enough of this game, it is fun and I will continue to keep this one forever, i love
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My kids love this game.  I have yet to purchase the real version because of the price.  The kids play it a lot.  I myself have not played this game.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enough playing this too and tried to play every day, but it is a other one of my favorite.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I didn't watch the show at all since I drive a truck and I'm hardly ever home. Decided to watch it online. Great season. I'm into season 2 and it is just as good so far.
B003UYV08E|3.0|The main characters were wonderful. I loved the scene of Stark in front of the Senate Committee. Paltrow was good; Cheadle also good; Downey was, as usual, terrific. The storyline was well done with the right amount of humor.<br /><br />The ONLY thing that kept this from being a 5 star for me was Micky Rourke. Unfortunately, he was in it too much to give it anything more than a 3 star because he was a major detraction. The biggest difference between this movie and Iron Man and Iron Man 3 is that the villain is too dark, too serious. There is something sinister but still fun about the villains in 1 and 3 but absolutely nothing fun about this villain. If they had gotten an actor who was able to play bad but comic booky (I know, not a word) than this would have been a 5 star movie.
159514188X|5.0|I found myself drawn in despite the uncontrollable sadness. I liked how the author made the main character good, but unable to help or change what happened:)
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I've been looking forward to this coming out on Bluray so I can see it again. Throughout the movie I was up and down as to whether or not I was liking the direction the film was going, but in the end I walked out very satisfied that I had got most of my money's worth (no film is ever really worth the $17 I paid for 3-D Imax).<br /><br />The action was fantastic; Stark's panic attacks make him all the more human, and interesting since it tied in with The Avengers, making it a part of the same world instead of a stand alone; loved the kid and the entire plot in the small town; not certain I liked the end result for Potts but it played well overall.<br /><br />When I can walk out of a movie having thoroughly enjoyed it enough to forget the things I found annoying then it is a win.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|SUCH HIGH GRAPHICS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. SO CUTE I AS PRESIDENT RECOMMEND THIS GAME JK NOT THE PRESIDENT BUT STILL GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Even with a lot of in game purchases, you can still enjoy this game without having to spend a dime!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I was hoping this app would help me navigate email easily as if I were on my laptop. This app doesn't make checking email on my Kindle Fire simple. Good thing the app was free.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|It pains me to no end that Stieg Larsson has past as this series was truly one of the most intelligently written suspense novels I have read in a very long time. Whether it was the depth he went to for character development or the true knowledge and intellect he lent to the discussion on cyber crime, law, psychiatric medicine, and history that his stories dealt with, he penned it seemingly with ease, which made for an altogether enthralling read.<br />Bravo.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a great series!  Would recommend it to if you like the lawyer type banter.  Also the characters are funny and challenges  the mind.  You need to pay attention and follow the script or you will miss something.<br />You don't need to be a lawyer to enjoy this show.
B00340ESIS|5.0|For someone like me who is a novice at screenwriting, this is the ultimate book. After this book, I may actually try to write one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is similar to other &quot;run&quot; games but way more fun because of the craziness of the minions. Must have.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|The book was great, the movie was great.  I thought it followed really closely to the book, although there were some differences. Loved the extras that showed all they did to film this movie. Great job.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I absolutely would recommend this movie to anyone following the Fast and Furious movies.  The action is amazing, the love stories are heartfelt.  I can not say enough about the characters, the storylines and the actors!  These are my FAVORITE movies!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I have mixed emotions about this movie.  I was a little disappointed with it the first time I saw it, but watched it again several hours later and found that I appreciated it more and was able to ignore some of the holes in the plot (and it would be hard to describe them without giving away too much).  The main things are these:  It's handsomely, even spectacularly, made with an interesting premise, a lot of fascinating action between the characters, and a thoroughly satisfying resolution.  And I feel that those who rip this movie apart do so because it wasn't what they expected.  I hate to label it a thinking person's film, but to some degree it is, which is surprising, since it is based on a graphic novel and some of the action scenes seem straight out of a high tech video game.  But that's just a small part of it and most of the film revolves around intriguing characters. The director has created an amazing world here, with very good acting and some spectacular effects.  I went back and watched it a third time and liked it even more and intend to add the Blu-ray to my collection.  This is an excellent movie, and I just don't understand some of the hostility that has been directed towards it.  I think that it's a triumph for director Kosinsky and his wonderful crew.<br /><br />Follow-up: I did indeed buy it here on Blu-ray, and think of it as just short of 5 stars -- and I swear that my eyes fill with tears during the final moments every single time I've watched it! This is sci-fi with a heart, and a triumph for all involved in the making of it. Every time I see it, I like it more than I did the previous time! And I strongly recommend ALL the special features!

B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Folks, I enjoy Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman.  I was pumped up to see this flick.  Words can not describe how disappointed I became.  Bad is hard to describe.  Ugly is in the eyes of the beholder.  This is bad and ugly.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, a little annoying in the beginning as they are telling from 2 separate times, but totally worth it!
B009S33I68|4.0|Most of the people reading this book will probably have seen the Mel Gibson movie.  What is really, really neat is the photographer in the movie joined with Colonel Moore to write this book.  The two men interviewed the Vietnamese generals and officers on the other side of the elephant grass.  Read with the Street of Joy, I believe you'll walk away knowing that we could never hope to &#34;win&#34; this war.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first there were people telling me to READ the books, then others who said porn! It took me a long time but read the series and LOVED IT!

3836538725|5.0|Genesis is one of the best Photography books I have ever read. The effort and planning that was needed to produce a work of this caliber is unbelievable. Apart from having an outstanding understanding of the cultures explored and the world he has seen, Sebastiao Salgado also has the 'eye' of a photographer. As a result his work is presented as an artistic-scientist, and really captures one's imagination and spirit. Each photograph is powerful and tells a story of its own.<br />My only regret is that the large two page images were not done on the fold-out pages, but have the seam of he book in the middle of the images. otherwise, this is a work to enjoy without reserve.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|A cautionary study of a crucial, half-forgotten  stretch of  American history, seen through the eyes of  two complicated,  charismatic  people  (Roosevelt and Lindbergh) with different  visions of America as the country  drifted into World War II. The book is vivid,  as empathetic  as possible and a delight to read.
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|Movie is even better than Neil Gaiman's book!  But do both if you can as the comparison is intriguing and instructive on what gets dropped and what gets expanded in making a screenplay.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Couldn't stop watching until I was finished :-(<br /><br />The actors are some of the best working today.  I wanted to work and live at Downton!
B000002GXJ|4.0|This brings back a great deal of memories.  Melody and singing in popular music, what a concept!  Current music should take note.
B000063V8R|5.0|Im a big star trex fan but had missed a lot of 3rd gen episodes. the 7DVD set was pristine.  I bought it used and am not a bit sorry for that.  Will probly buy 4th gen.
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|Great albums of the 70's.  My only regret is that there should have been a booklet and better liner notes on each disc.
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|The only thing good about this disc is katy perry!. boring songs that will put you to sleep.John Mayer rocks no more.i think he needs to date Joan Jett or Lita Ford ,then maybe he will rock again. this cd is  a little better than the last but I'm not spending any more money on this whimpy stuff,sorry!
B000B589JI|5.0|Very quality construction; looks like it's going to be strong and durable.  Have had it full of lighter fluid for several weeks now with no signs of leakage or evaporation.  Great way to carry spare fuel without toting a can around.  Extremely pleased with this purchase.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Every movie is incredible and an awesome way to educate my little ones about REAL sci-fi! With the exception of the first one. I've got a pretty good attention span and I couldn't make it all the way through. I like the thin cases so it doesn't take up as much room as other big box sets I've got.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST MONITOR I HAVE EVER SEEN!! THERE IS ATLEAST A 10 SECOND DELAY AND THE UNIT IS CONSTANTLY BUFFERING OR DROPPING THE CONNECTION.  I CURRENTLY LIVE IN A 1-BEDROOM APARTMENT, HOW COULD THE CONNECTION DROP WHEN I AM ONLY 5 FEET AWAY AT ANY TIME!!! IF I COULD GIVE THIS A NEGATIVE REVIEW, I WOULD!! I DO NOT USUALLY WRITE REVIEWS, BUT THIS PRODUCT HAS SENT ME OVER THE EDGE, AND IF THIS HELPS JUST ONE PERSON FROM NOT PURCHASING THIS MONITOR, I WILL BE SATISFIED. MY BABY IS ONLY 2 WEEKS OLD - SO IT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF OVER USE.  I HAVE ONLY TRIED TO USE THE PRODUCT MAYBE 5 TIMES, WHICH AFTER EACH USE I AM LEFT MORE AND MORE FRUSTRATED WITH MY RIDICULOUSLY OVER-PRICED AND UNDER SATISFIED PURCHASE. I WANTED SO MUCH TO LIKE THIS PRODUCT BUT CANNOT FIND ONE REDEEMING QUALITY ABOUT IT. AFTER MORE RESEARCH I HAVE NOW DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE SAMSUNG SEW-3037 BABY MONITOR AND AM IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL, MAYBE THEN I CAN HAVE SOME PIECE OF MIND!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Happy ever after doesn't make sense just doesn't feel right somehow--too short of an epilogue I guess--not an easy  flow
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|One of the best series I have seen in a long time!  It is unpredictable, exciting and touches on history!  Few people know what it is like to be an aristocrat, through Downton Abbey we are given a glimpse of the lives of the privileged in 20th century England, but also per into the lives and the drama of the people who serve them!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Sad to think that places like this exist to his very day, yet there is nothing our country can do about it. Am glad this book was written so we can see a glimpse into what it is like in North Korea. The REAL North Korea.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This music is timeless. Sit back, listen, and relax. Let Mr. Gilmour, Mr. Waters, Mr. Wright, and Mr. Mason take you across a timeless dimension.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Sometimes it's good to just sit back, relax, and let one's self be overwhelmed by the sheer awesome power of gigantic alien monsters fighting massive metal robots with the fate of humanity in the balance. Sometimes it's good to watch a film that presents a conflict that is delightfully simple, with stark contrasts. Sometimes it's good to be touched emotionally by the power of human friendship and family even in the midst of overwhelming odds. Sometimes it's good to laugh heartily at the gloriously absurd. Sometimes it's good to have a film simultaneously take itself both completely seriously and in the same breath mercilessly make fun of itself. Sometimes it's good to have a nice, clean film during which you do not have to worry about any content issues or subliminal messages aside from a heavy dose of old fashioned heroism and celebration of the human spirit. And sometimes, very rarely, it's good to have all these things rolled into one movie. Reader, I am happy to announce that Pacific Rim is such a film.<br /><br />The plot of Pacific Rim is astonishingly simple: massive alien monstrosities, known as Kaiju, have invaded Earth through a dimension-bridge deep in the Pacific Ocean, and humanity has set aside it's differences for the greater good, building massive Jaegers, giant mechanized warriors piloted by two mind-melded humans to keep the creatures at bay. These pilots must act in perfect unison, even sharing memories, in order to pilot these massive weapons. I will refrain from detailing the plot further, not because plot details are important or their twists mind-blowing in the slightest, but because the joy of having the story unfold and realizing just how straight up heroic and enjoyable it is is an experience I do not want to rob from you. Suffice to say that the main character, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunman), is a classic cocky yet vulnerable American hero you'll be rooting for in a heartbeat. Marshal Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) proves to be a surprisingly empathetic character (as well as delivering one heck of a pre-battle speech towards the end). Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) is also a pleasant surprise as a heartwarming character, while two scientists played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman almost steal the show with their hilarious and endearing banter and antics.<br /><br />And that is what is so phenomenal about Pacific Rim: it endears itself to you. You feel for the humans, amidst all of the over the top destruction. When the Jaegers suffer setbacks in combat, we genuinely fear and mourn. When they triumph (particularly our main American Jaeger, \\"Gipsy Danger\\") we exult and cheer. Director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro wisely does not use his impressive special effects to bombard his audience into submitting to the peril of the story (as Michael Bay's Transformers films did, relying on cheap humor to fill gaps between destruction). Rather, del Toro focuses primarily on building genuine characters and an engrossing tale so that when cities start getting flattened and our heroes are in peril we actually care who wins and who loses. When Gipsy Danger swaggers into battle to save helpless humans we cannot help but celebrate, because it is truly heroic.<br /><br />Pacific Rim's heroes are offered up to us pure and wholesome, as examples to look up to. Humanity's enemies are portrayed as monstrous and repulsive, evil we genuinely hate. The film is surprisingly colorful, brash and clear in its portrayal of the conflict. It portrays epic amounts of destruction, allowing us to realize the tremendous stakes, but never revels in excessive violence, with a surprisingly low on-screen body count for all the city-leveling. Cinematography-wise, the camera moves slowly and methodically, allowing us to digest the action, instead of being disoriented by it, thus inspiring genuine awe. Pacific Rim is refreshingly simple and optimistic despite its titanic struggles, and is the type of story one would tell to an imaginative youngchild. Or perhaps it should rather be described as a story such a child would dream up, and is certainly the better for it.<br /><br />For more this and more reviews, search for Pulling On The Push Door.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Our family loved this movie and now I am off to buy it! It is clever, has a wonderful storyline and the effects are great!  I wished they showed more of the giants land and how they came to be, but otherwise it was wonderful. Not for young children since there are some eye popping moments that made my 11 year old leave the room a time or two. Five stars and can't wait to see it in my mail box!
B003U6BE8I|3.0|This movie is entertaining and sticks to the main theme of the book. As long as you keep your expectations light, especially about the kids' acting performances, you won't be disappointed.
B004LX0DHC|4.0|From the title I thought this book was about persisting and succeeding in the face of adversity. Which it is. But it's also about knowing when to walk away. Don't just read it once!!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Good use of the mobile platform. Extensive game, consistently enjoyable. Good mix of strategy and chance. Graphics are well done, and controls are ideally suited for Android.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game is fun and addictive.  Each floor is a bit different so it's more challenging.<br />Hard to step away some times.
B0030MM68O|3.0|Kind of chessy, but an okay movie.  Nothing special in the dialoge, a little stereotypical macho representation of the military.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Was wonderful! LOVED the behind the scenes stuff! Have already watched entire 2 seasons and have lent to friends. YAY!
1439190275|4.0|The Atkins diet has FINALLY been the answer to my shedding my 'over 40' belly fat.  Not one other thing has worked.  I feel awesome!  Have loads of energy & recommend the low carb way to all my friends who've been fighting 'the bulge' for years w/ no success.<br /><br />The book helped me understand why & how the Atkins high protein diet works so I bought one for my daughter-in-law as well as the cookbook.  She & I have shed a collective 40lbs in less than 2 months.<br /><br />When I tell people what I'm doing (besides the exercising & having cut my alcohol consumption to just 1, Miller 64 a night), I say, &#34;I'm on the New Atkins.&#34;, explaining then how many more vegetables are involved now.<br /><br />I recommend this book for skeptics about the diet.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wonderful! LOVED this season. I watched it twice and have already lent out to friends. Highly recommend. Great season, woot!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Very well cast and true to the book in every way! I would highly recommend this show.I even have my wife hooked on it.
1401938906|5.0|This book is so helpful & easy. Doing the experiments have helped keep me in the moment & a nice side effect was while focusing on manifesting, some of my fears dropped away!
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Heard some buzz about this game on BGG then watched some video reviews and was intrigued.  How good could a game be with only 16 cards?  Well, pretty darn good as it turns out. Since I bought it about a week ago, my family and I have not stopped playing.  Yes the theme is... well, the theme, but don't let that put you off.  This is a classic example of fun mechanic (a bit like the role selection portion of Citadels) and great game play. Fun for kids and adults alike (I have a 11 y/o son and 9 y/o daughter).  For ~ $10 it is far and away my #1 selection for fun/$.  You really can't go wrong.
B006LSZECO|4.0|starts off w a bang and you are instantly engaged! you definitely can't predict what happens throughout the story, so it's a real page turner!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|used this app for years then updates to new version now it keeps crashing. Very disappointed. Please fix bugs. Have enjoyed this app until update and now will not even install or open
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|This game is probably as good as it could ever get. I'm not a developer and I may be wrong. But from I can see this game is exactly what the developers intended it to be. A light hearted game of boxing monkeys. The graphics are fun, the sound and music are individually adjustable (a must in my opinion for all games) and they don't try to trick you into buying a game with ads, IAP or retarded.amounts of unneeded permissions. You can tell the developers just wanted to make.something fun for people to play.<br /><br />Price: I honestly can't say I would pay the price they're asking for in this game, however, I do believe it is worth the price if it is the type of game you enjoy and could get the game play out if it. I also feel its suitable for kids to play, and again imo this increases the value of the game with its replayabikitlty it does contain cartoon violence and that is up to parents to decide if they think its too much for their kids. Growing up with Looney tunes I can't say this is any different at all, honestly its probably less violent.<br /><br />Gameplay: this game thrives on simplicity and i think it also kind of dies their too. Spam punches, block when youve lost the upperhand to break their attacks and spam again. Now im sure there is a little more strategy than that available but if you can win by spamming its hard to explore other avenues unless they are just that exciting. There are other things that pop up during the fight that essentially give you a chance to knock the opponent out early or the opponent the chance to remove your upperhand.<br /><br />Cosmetics: this is a definite relief for mobile gamers. A game that has cosmetics and doesn't charge you money to get them! Everything in this game.is earned. Some people might be sad about this but I would venture to say most will be pleased. (Also, winning isn't dependant on the size of your wallet!)<br /><br />Overall this game is enjoyable, but its also slightly repetitive. This is a game younger kids would enjoy (tweens?) And others would for a bit, but the repititive nature would no doubt find this game in the trash one it was beat, even with its many achievements.
140006922X|5.0|This book is so well written you cannot possibly lose interest.  Fascinating read from a man who has unquestionable credentials to author such a well researched topic
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|enjoy this game although I suck at it so far.My kids could undoubtedly do much better. But the game is cute..graphics are very good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love downton abbey season 3. Can't wait for the next season. Would never expect to like a period drama , but this is good stuff
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This was a brilliant suspense movie.  i liked the special effects a lot.  The smallest child's movements were terrifying.  i would definitely recommend this movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this app. Even my husband has started to learn how to play this game. My five year old has caught on quickly and is enjoying the easy level. I would recommend this! Especially since its free!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|this was a very fun action movie.  There was a lot of blood and action.  The special effects were also grand.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Not a bad app, only issue i could find was when you try to add text, the text already in the box, is never able to be fully erased. So when you want to enter 'Its a hit!' it comes out as 'Its a hitE....'
0345803485|5.0|Very exciting book. I wish I had ordered the other two in the series. I read through this one much faster that expected. I am looking forward to the others.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|If you are looking at this product, buy it, you will not regret it.  Unless of course your buying it on a credit card you carry a balance on.  Do not use that card until it is paid off.  Living on credit leads to trouble.
B000OVLIQU|4.0|This book was recommended to me by Ken Dashow (DJ at Q104.3FM in NYC).  I started reading this book with the hope of learning what the Beatles songs were about.  I was pleasantly surprised when it detailed more about how the Beatles worked and created their music (and craft).  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any Beatles fan.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|My kids talked about this so much, I just had to try it. It's fun, gritty in unexpected ways, with great characters and a lot of heart. Yep, I'm a fan.
0385349947|5.0|I think this book is so right on.  Every woman should read it, but all women under 30 HAVE to read it.  Regardless of what you decide to do with your career, this is important to read and think about it.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Unexpected plot twists and great characters made this wrap-up of Firefly really enjoyable. Now I'm sorry it was cancelled, too!
0345525558|5.0|What a treat to read a well written, happy-ish ending, but not predictable.  Chose it for my book group.  So far everybody loves it.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Wow!! Imagine the shock and horror of seeing your twin sister fall through a sheet of ice into freezing water. Then, add to that the fact you can do nothing about it. This is the onset of the many dilemmas that Amanda, the main character, faces throughout Jams N. Roses's \\"Finding Her Feet\\". This is an emotional story that seems right out of perhaps HallMark and Lifetime. You can see how one event can literally seek to haunt and subsequently destroy a family. Very few books bring a tear to my eye. This one did.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I love SciFi, and expected more with this cast. Huge disappointment. Hard to finish. Amazon - stop requiring us to write a review in order to rate it.
0770437400|4.0|Most of the tales focused on zombies or the zombie apocalypse focus on a group of characters from various backgrounds and of many different personality types, and the plot of these tales is -for the most part- a linear progression of events in which the reader can also experience the growth of each character.<br /><br />World War Z - An Oral History of the Zombie War is totally different to almost everything that's come before - there is no central cast of characters (except for the character we meet in the beginning), and though there is a progression of events, everything is reported after the fact; the story of World War Z is told through a series of interviews conducted with survivors. Now, that might sound a bit boring, but the thing is World War Z isn't meant to be a `Night of the Living Dead' - it's a History Channel special. So, if you're expecting to be pulled into a particular character's orbit, you'll be disappointed. This is an event-reporting novel and should be read as such.<br /><br />Taking that into consideration, World War Z is damned good - if a zombie apocalypse ever hits civilization, I wouldn't be surprised if world leaders brought this book out and said, \\"Read this and advise me!\\"<br /><br />Max takes a look at so many different aspects of life under the zombie onslaught that it's impossible to mention everything - organ-trafficking, politics, societal structures, wheelchair-bound people, entertainment, etc. There is a diffuse focus on the military reaction and that of the everyman, but these glimpses come from people of many different walks of life, from many different governments. Even South Africa is mentioned and spotlighted, which was a surprise (and I'm not sure if Max got the details wrong or if the narrator couldn't pronounce the words properly, but it doesn't really make a difference).<br /><br />There is no single thread holding the `tale' together - rather there are multiple pathways that lead the reader through World War Z (or Z-War One); so many different ways of explaining events, from how dog / soldier partners worked trained and worked together to find zombies through to how people working underwater dealt with and protected themselves against zombies that had fallen into the sea.<br /><br />And, because of the `reported' and `documented' feel of the book, it's not scary at all. I don't think Max was going for a `scare the hell out of you' with this book, in any case, but the thing is there was no emotional hanging-on point for me - no tension, no threat to the myriad characters. Again, I don't think Max was going for that with this novel, but for most readers it'll probably be difficult to empathize with anyone in the book since there is no central character to `live' the events of the book through. I believe the point of the book is to make it as realistic an exploration of a zombie plague as possible, and in that essence the book is incredible - just don't expect sleepless nights. ;-)<br /><br />And trust me when on this - your experience of the movie will be totally different to the experience of reading this book; I sincerely hope you enjoy (or enjoyed) both!r One); so many different ways of explaining events, from how dog / soldier partners worked trained and worked together to find zombies through to how people working underwater dealt with and protected themselves against zombies that had fallen into the sea.<br /><br />And, because of the `reported' and `documented' feel of the book, it's not scary at all. I don't think Max was going for a `scare the hell out of you' with this book, in any case, but the thing is there was no emotional hanging-on point for me - no tension, no threat to the myriad characters.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|My 5 yr old loves the game.  The new features upgraded from TR1 are good and a fun easy game.
B000000H3W|4.0|Arise, just a greath thrash album that any old-schooler should own if they don't already.  Dead embyronic cells rules all!
0470474874|5.0|I've had this book for a couple weeks now and learned quite a bit already. Excellent content if you need to learn excel really fast.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Well, this is quite q page turner, but the end fell short for me  The state of the world when Jake returned to 2011 was just silly, and kind of cheap compared to the rest of the book.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a whole lot like dictionary. I have had a great time playing this with my granddaughter. We get such a hoot out of trying to figure out what each other has drawn...great way to spend time with her when we are apart!
0307352153|5.0|I liked this book so much that I have recommended it to several people.  Finally gave it to some special friends and now have ordered another for myself as my book club has chosen it for next months read.
B005LAII80|5.0|Yeah that really is the best piece of action cinema created in recent years. Keeps both feet grounded in a gritty, authentic world whislt taking the head on a trippy thrill ride through ultra-violence with formidable characters and great visuals. Awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The characters are fun and interactive however the game is too difficult and does not allow you to get far into it. I am sorry to say it does not measure up to the movie,not fun and quite frustrating.
B00E5BQ9SW|3.0|Just received this Blu Ray and am pretty satisfied with the result. I always enjoy Brian De Palma films and \\"Body Double\\" is one of his best.<br /><br />While this Blu Ray pressing by Twilight Time is much better than the previous DVD version, it is not as good as it could and should have been. Yes, it is the best the film has looked on home video, but it does not appear any restoring was applied, which is a shame because this film deserves it.<br /><br />Fortunately, the majority of the Blu Ray look pretty good, especially in close ups. Mid shots quality varies from clear to sometimes lacking detail. Long shots don't fare as well, but are acceptable. Black levels are nicely done, however some crush is evident in a few secenes. Color saturation is mostly well executed with a few areas that appear a bit washed out.<br /><br />Extras are carried over from the DVD, and there is an isolated score track. There were no new extras created for this pressing (other than the isolated score being present).<br /><br />All in all this Twilight Time limited edition run of 3,000 unit Blu Ray is the best \\"Body Double\\" has ever looked. Pick a copy up if you still can.
1857885082|3.0|I thought this book would be funnier than it is.  The content is good overall, but a bit drier than advertised.  Having some difficulty getting into it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|it makes it allot easier to access my ebay with this app.  Without this app I wasn't able to access my ebay very well.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|Lionsgate Release Review: It contains enough extras to satisfy you and is a great value.  It serves as an excellent starting point for those just delving into The Evil Dead series.  But for those who want tons of extras, or are serious collectors, the Anchor Bay release of the dvd is recommended. As for the movie, the picture and sound are good and it's highly enjoyable, it's classic camp horror with tons of gore and laughs! It boasts an improved budget from the original, and still is full of great camera work. It's highly seminal still to this day! All that being said it's still worth a buy no matter what!
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|always loved checkers and now I can share it with my grandkids. makes them use there mind and think about the moves.
B000WC3864|5.0|This edition includes both Widescreen and Fullscreen editions. This is one of the rare times in which Fullscreen is recommended because of bad transfers.  Some important things are cut off and you don't get the whole picture, no pun intended.  It's also jam packed with extras to satisfy the most serious deadite! If you are a lifelong fan or are just getting into the cult classic I recommend this version! As for the movie it's highly enjoyable, it's classic camp horror with tons of gore and laughs! It did wonders for it's low budget and is full of great camera work. It's highly seminal still to this day!<br /><br />10/10 great product, highly recommended!
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Took several days to watch as the feed pixelated and stopped to many times. Switched over to another paid internet streaming service and had no issues what so ever. So the bad stream was not on my side.
B0024FADDI|5.0|Screwhead Editon review: the sound and picture are great, it has amazing remastering. There extras consist of a making of feature and the alternative ending.  The movie is far more comedic and campy than the previous installments and far more quotable too, I'm looking at you Duke Nukem! To make things short It's just a fun movie. 10/10 great movie, highly recommended!
1452101248|1.0|The pictures are beautiful and the ideas interesting, but unless you have your own restaurant you will probably be able neither to find nor to afford the bizarre spices called for in many of the recipes. In addition, this man doesn't know how to cook. I've tried several of these recipes (dubiously, since the cooking times, styles, and temperatures just looked wrong to me) and they flat-out didn't work. The cover recipe was the worst cooking disaster I've ever had. I'm saying this as someone who is an experienced and commended chef who has successfully followed many a recipe. This book is an expensive and very attractive piece of dross, suitable for a doorstop but not for a cooking reference.
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|The whole premise was silly.  Not a good movie at all.  Do not waste your time with this ridiculous movie.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Excellent . Recommended to family and friends..I ll like it with closed caption in Spanish. For more enjoy of the movie
B008XKSW7M|4.0|For anyone who has had a child, you can identify with parts of this movie.  Funny!  I enjoyed it and recommend it.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This book was  amazing. It is an easy read and.  Page turner I couldn't put  it down thank goodness it is an entire series  I can hardly wait to see what happens next to Zoey an  her friends.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I thought this one was better than the 1st one.  It had alot of funny parts besides the action.  All the ol timers are great!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A wonderful insight into the early history of our country and its founding fathers.  Acting is superb. A must see for history buffs.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|It has closed caption so my daughter can watch it and it is helping her learn to read.  This is a great movie!  Sing and dancing is a hit!
B0039YOHXU|5.0|I received the watch in a very timely manner which made me very happy. I have been hunting for this watch for a few years now but no one had it except for about 3-4 times the price I was lucky to find it for.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the service I got from the seller and of course I cannot say enough good about this wonderful and beautiful watch that I got from them.<br /><br />This watch is perfect. There are many listings showing it as yellow to just about orange. I think it is a 15 on a scale of 10 with its color just in between yellow and orange; you really need to see it to truly appreciate it.<br /><br />I received it packaged perfectly and was thrilled to find the watch contained within their classic round metal container. Another Wow aspect. The watch had its UPC G-Shock tag along with the protective plastic wrap around the dial face. I also received the 'little' Module instruction manual; the mini 'quick' instruction pamphlet; the 'traditional' mini info/instruction folded-up pamphlets (3); and the International Warranty Card. I was very impressed because I never received this assortment of paperwork with a Casio purchase - kudos to the seller.<br /><br />I would definitely buy from this seller again because I can see they endeavor to sell a product that is in good condition with all appropriate parts and necessary paperwork. I was leery because I was ordering from a seller overseas but because I dearly wanted this watch I chanced it and was greatly rewarded. I wish the seller continued good business and want to again state I think this watch is fantastic and I just totally love it. Too bad Casio does not think these older lines are worth having more in stock to sell instead of their newer stock which is really below par.<br /><br />Do not be afraid to buy this watch. It is great to look at and fits great. You cannot go wrong because it is solar which means you do not have to change batteries about twice a year and these Casio's are much more rugged and sturdy. The added plus is it shows lunar and tidal changes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a good series. It keeps a story line , that you don't have to watch every week to stay up todate.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Excellent puzzle game for killing time. Nice progression from small boards to large. Works great on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It is well written, but we have to admit that the main attraction of this book is due to its erotic content.  The author has the ability to describe the erotic scenes with artistry and finesse.  She builds up the action step by step, and carries you along in a way that makes you feel that you are not a simple spectator, but actually taking part in what is going on.  I am sure that many readers have had orgasms, or at least orgasmic fantasies, just from reading the novel.  It is my first experience with the &#34;Fifty Shades Trilogy&#34;, and it will probably be my last.  I enjoyed it, but one book is enough. There is no sense in trying to fantasize about the type of life that only the extremely wealthy, extremely handsome and extremely healthy can carry on.  For me it is back to reality, perhaps a little wiser, to enjoy my life and my partner and be grateful for it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game, I agree, challenging but not impossible . I hope more rooms will follow soon so I can continue on. Very fun!!<br /> Even my 8 year old is addicted.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Quick & Easy Transaction!!!<br /><br />I first watched this movie on Netflix, but after sometime they took it off.  I then came to amazon to buy the dvd, the story is about a boy and a girl, and through the power of love and magic save the day, and start a new adventure.
B003O86FMW|4.0|very easy read (if you have time can finish it in a day)<br />The book was a great continuation from The Hunger Games. Can't wait to read Mocking Jay.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|Bob, stay away from Robert Hunter...he'll do you no good.  Write your own songs, my boy, and you'll go places.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was one of those books that I stayed up super late to make progress with on some nights.  I loved the twists and turns and interesting characters.  I picked it up because I was seeing a lot of buzz about it from my Facebook friends.  Apparently they have great taste.  I wasn't sure I would like it but I obviously loved it!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love it. I play it whenever I get a chance. Sometimes it is a little bit difficult, but it is still fun.
0375869026|5.0|Was recommended reading for my 12 year old this summer before 8th grade.  I started reading and couldn't put it down until finished it, then let him read it.  We both loved it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It can get a little hard,but it's a fun game.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I like the game alot.  Some of the levels are a little harder to figure out.
B001NOQI3U|2.0|I was totally unprepared for there to be a naked man in this movie. The movie was enjoyable to that point I just never recovered from the naked man shock so the rest of the movie fell fairly flat for me. It's still WAY better than pretty much any modern movie.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|WOULDNT PURCHASE AGAIN  MY DAUGHTER HAD FUN WITH IT FOR A WHILE BUT GOT BORING AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF PLAYING
B001KP2J3U|5.0|Likewise of &#34;Murder on the Orient Express&#34; ~ an entertaining movie without bad language or inappropriate scenes. I ordered more!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I am anxiously waiting for the next book.  The book just kept getting better. This is by far my favorite book I read this year
0062073508|5.0|We watched the movie a couple of times just in the 1st couple of weeks of receiving it (family friendly).  My daughter liked it so much she wanted the book but I don't think she's read it yet.  Should of gotten the book 1st! :)  Enjoy.
B001N4TIHI|4.0|Good movie, but there were a few times when the picture quality suffered and it didn't sync up. Easy to download and play.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Went into the movie expecting to like but not loving it. Great movie with a plot that I didn't see coming. Tom Cruise may be crazy but he is a damn good actor. Special effects and supporting cast were excellent.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this sharpener works real well, it can be used on most any type of knife blade and it is really nice that it is small and is easy to put in a tool box, or drawer, to be ready when I want to sharpen a knife
0738737909|3.0|I ordered this because I saw some of the cards on line, and they were beautiful.  Now that I ave them, I'm not sure what to think.  I really love some of the cards....others, not so much.  Some of them are just too darn busy, and it feels very cut and paste, especially on some of the faces.  I love The Hermit and Judgement.  I know a lot of work went into the images..you can see it, but it's almost too much.  I'm not sure what to think.  I don't know if I will keep it.  I think I like the Gilded Tarot better.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Very nice music and good for driving but I much prefer the video. The collection of artists is really good and I have already been looking to buy individual discs for some of them
0307474259|5.0|I have started the sugested way to eat and feel good and healthy, and keep refering back to the book for information, it is so easy to use, don't know how anyone could give this wonderful book up.I'm very happy with the condition of the books, and the amount of time it took to get them to me, Thank you

B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|Toy's Story is a classic. My son loves this movie and is a great way to end the day! Great movie.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|really like this author's style, she keeps me wanting to know what's going to happen.  I think she is really clever having so many characters and keeping them interesting and dynamic all at the same time, I just want to know what happens to all of them - no one is ho hum!  The story is never boring and there are lots of lovely cliff hangers - really enjoyed this book.
B0060CRM6M|5.0|My kid loves this movie. Great soundtrack!!!!<br /><br />From begining to end this movie keeps you glued to the screen. KUDOS

B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is a really great show. It keeps the viewer entertained and intrigued. The show is also dynamic because the relationship between members of the cast are always changing in some way or form. I just started season two and cant wait to see what it brings.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|A very interesting look into the political and legal arena.  The &#34;Good Wife&#34; gives an intimate look into how power corrupts in politics, government, and how impossible it is to get justice in our current legal system.  A very attractive cast who are continually looking for a happy ever after.

You'll be pleased.<br /><br />I tie mostly for gifts and stress relief.<br /><br />Thanks JD!

B004RCUJ9E|3.0|Should have been abke to challenge your friends online... as for the game pretty basic stuff... Does what it says, plays checkers....
B000FS9FC6|5.0|Interesting how artists can disguise political and social commentary in movies. Make no mistake this is a first rate \\"comic book\\" movie on its own. The story is superb as is the acting. This was the quickest 2 hour movie I have ever watched. You can't wait for the next scene. That being said, given the whole \\"spying/phone tapping\\" revelations that have recently captured headlines and exposed very ugly developments in our own country, the message in this movie could not be more relevant. The antidote to a totalitarian state is revealed in this movie. Watch this movie and spread the word!!! 10 Stars!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series because,  while changing channels one night, I watched a little of the end of Season 3 and had to watch it from the beginning. Of course I had heard others talk of it but paid no real attention to it.<br />Now I'm hooked. I love stories of this genre, either in books or film.  Can't wait for season 4.
B00756GKBA|3.0|This one didn't really excite me.  Perhaps 3 songs I find catchy and great.  Purchase at your own risk on this one.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a great app for editing photos.  Its very easy to use and gives good hints when you first start.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Used this to fix up my PlayStation 3 and now it works great. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to fix their console or computer!
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Although it was a bit of a wrangle to set up the Amazon app store, this game was well worth it. I'll be playing it for years to come.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|the twist is cool....great spin off to a children's classic tale..i would watch it again . nice makeup on the witches
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I liked that the author prefaced it saying that some of the things wouldn't apply...I was able to skip over those suggestions.  It's a quick read and I was able to gain some great information in a short period of time.  Yes, some of it is &#34;duh&#34; inducing, but we are all at different stages and have different talents or trials that we are working with and the author gives a little taste of how to better utilize or overcome a few of those.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I thought this would be just another \\"lost in space\\" kind of movie but I was definitely wrong! I am still thinking about all the issues this movie brought up a week later.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|As alarm clocks go, this one is great. You don't have to reset it when you have a power failure, and you don't have to worry about it getting unpluged

B005OL7Z30|4.0|I'm starting my second reading. I learned from Mr Dawkins not to feel too timid to say &#34;I'm an atheist&#34; to the believers. I had Christian friends who now and again try to convert me. From now on I'm gonna tell them straight away I'll never be religious so they can save their breath. As Chinese I hope my country will not fall in the hand of Christianity (not the church anyway) although  the number of believers in china must be growing. And more and more high profile  converted chinese christians can be seen in the public, among them some persecuted dissidents who easily get sympathy from the international community (Wonder why Christianity is always the choice of religion but not Islam).<br /><br />Christianity has never been our tradition. Hardly any chinese is born into the religion. I have a problem with those &#34;converts in crisis&#34; --- people who &#34;find&#34; their religion because they have a problem in life. Many Christians in china are poor farmers who almost certainly don't have much knowledge of what they say they believe, comparable to the &#34;Christian child&#34; in Dawkins's book. By the way, I have to admire the missionary workers in china, who penetrate the borders and all the way to the edge of Tibet. The sort of persistence needed to change the world.<br /><br />Lao Tze says in Tao Te King: heaven and earth are merciless. all beings are regarded as (disposable) grass dog (for sacrifice in a ceremony)One of our great Confucius scholars once said, the Chinese is a mature people. Indeed, the Chinese never look too far beyond  the secular world or his fellow beings for comfort or for the meaning of life. &#34;to die is to extinguish a light&#34;. In my opinion, if we all look death calmly into the eye, god shall leave us alone.
B005OGYH90|3.0|Nice concert, but the only songs I really like listening to are the Guns songs. Myles is a good singer, but his voice gets kind of repetitive after a while. The crowd on this/these cd's sound amazing! *Patience is awesome on here*

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is lots of fun! I only have two complaints, they have many quests that you need to use real money to complete,and there is no way to replenish your energy with anything but real money. If there was a way to trade things in for energy like on Farm Up,this game would be better.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I played the first 3 games in less than two minutes.  Just some great fun for a great price.  What more could you want?
0345803450|4.0|this is a very well done book. extremely interesting characters & very satisfying. I think that fans this offer will not be disappointed. However the only thing I was a little bit strange is the fact that the intelligence and security operation that is the background for this book seemed to be small potAtoes. the situation that The 3 main characters found them selves in just was not very compelling.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I absolutely believe that something happens when people have a &#34;near death&#34; experience.  So when I read this I expected to read at least someone with an ounce of credibility (or a doubt maybe) since the author, a surgeon, is a fact based educated man. (He constantly reminds us of that fact, too). So, this is why we should believe everything he states as gospel.  Really?  What I found was someone who had to be the best in what he does, have  the most perfectly detailed story; someone who had to create an entire universe with all his characters and interpretations in his NDE world in order for you to believe it. So he did. Please.  He was so certain about who everyone was and what they were, seriously, I thought he may have had some brain damage while he was in his coma.  He started to sound like he was on an acid trip, or some drug induced hallucinoogenic acid trip (or writing a script for his future movie).  I'm sorry, but he did not prove anything to anyone else.  Yes, this is HIS experience, but to claim he proved beyond a shadow of a doubt there was an afterlife?  No way! I believe he had an agenda and that was to prove that there is a God.  He just goes on and on about this outlandish story.  Being a neurosurgeon pretty much tells it like it is.  Some  are probably the most arrogant self-absorbed egotists on the planet.  This guy has butterfly tour guide who takes him all over the place and he eventually recognizes her later as a sister he never knew he had.  Really?  I absolutely think things happen in the brain when one is dying.  Neurons, cells, contents of the brain are dying.  So, yes, maybe the white light is a result of an organic physical change.  I don't know...and neither does he.  There.  I said it.  He didn't prove to anyone what happened to him.  But, take his word for it.  He's a neurosurgeon.  He wouldn't make it up.
B000WAXH2Q|5.0|This is one her best albums.  At this stage in her career she was at her best.  She has since become more experimental with fewer standards, which don't showcase her talents.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|This film can be critiqued in many ways. But for me, it is a love high, a great series of intertwining stories, wonderful music, perfect cuts between the ten or so story lines withsome of the finest actors alive: Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, the divine Colin Firth, Leem Neison playing a window five years before his actual wife's death, a boy who is making it huge in films obiously a born actor.<br /><br />So as one who rarely watches kitchy films I sure do watch \\"Love, Actually\\" a lot. As said, since 2003, I've seen it over a hundred times. Do any of the scenes get stale? Yes a few for sure. But the acting is amazing and a must see is the DVD's second side where the boy and Hugh Grant and the Shakeperian rock musician all combine in cuts that add to the interest. Laura Linney and the most famed and gorgeous Brazilian actor too, a class of actors including Billy Bob Thorton, perfectly realized, makes this wonderful because the actors to a person are top notch.<br /><br />Then again, it's the romantic in me that so loves the many happy endings and the few unhappy ones are hard on the heart-- but that is life. I also love the first and last scenes of real people at Heathrow Airport. Everyone I know has a favorite film for a lonely night or a loving night and many choose \\"Pretty Woman\\" but I choose, LOVE, ACTUALLY.\\"<br /><br />The cynics among you should not expect a single cynical note here. And hats off to the director. Richard, for the amazing musical cuts. The other side of this DVD isn't perfect but for we non-British, it turns out the many of the minor roles are filled by major stars not usually seen state side. Thank you for listening. Give it a serious try.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love everything written by Nicholas Sparks. This one has a little more action than some of his others, but it's the story of undying love that kept me captivated.

B007HC3LHS|4.0|Sometimes, you read a book that gets inside of your head and makes you realize how quickly things can turn sour in a relationship.  This is one of those books.<br /><br />The story flips back and forth between the year Catherine meets Lee and 4 years after that year.  Catherine is young, pretty, single and living it up.  She and her friends hit the hottest spots in town to dance and drink.  Lee is working security at one of those spots and they are immediately taken with each other.  They begin dating, though this is hard because Lee has another job about which he is less forthcoming.  He disappears for days at a time.  But the attraction is too much for Catherine to give up.  At first.<br /><br />Four years later, Catherine is no longer the life of the party.  She is crippled by OCD, which finds her checking the locks on her doors and windows over and over again.  She doesn't trust anyone.  She doesn't dress in alluring outfits anymore.  She is basically existing, but not living.<br /><br />How well do you really know anyone?  How many times have we heard the same story over and over where the neighbor says, he seemed really nice and quiet?<br /><br />I found the character of Catherine annoying at first, but then warmed to her.  Her compassion toward one of the people who betrayed her was amazing.  She had been in those shoes and she wasn't going to treat this person badly.  I also thought that her OCD treatment was compelling.  It's so easy to say, well, it's just stupid that you feel as though you need to do that, but that behavior is usually the result of a traumatic situation.  Our minds have to make sense of it in some way and so we develop routines or workarounds to do so.<br /><br />British vernacular is a bit different from ours, and I think that causes some disconnect.  Words that we Americans view as taboo are commonplace there, and that can put you off.  I bought the book for my mom, but I warned her that the language was rough and to just try to skip through the intimate scenes. That's the reason I'm giving it less than 5 stars.<br /><br />But overall, really just blows your mind.  Well done.<br /><br />Highly recommend, though caution for content.rough the intimate scenes.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Still creating monster guitar riffs, Tony Iommi is all over this album sounding like the icon he is and of old but fresh as well. Personally Ozzie can retire as far as I am concerned, but he fits it with his old band mates as the magic once was. The absence of Bill Ward is not cool, and while the music is just damn good, probably would have had more chemistry and punch with Bill playing as he and Geezer formed the framework around Iommi's guitar. Still great album in this age of crap to listen to.

B00CS9987W|4.0|In Alfred Hitchcock's follow-up to \\"Psycho\\" he chose and unknown actress from the ranks of runway models to star in the film.  The film opens with San Francisco socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) entering a pet store filled with caged birds.  She was waiting on a bird she had ordered.  When a handsome Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) enters looking for a pair of love birds, he assumes Melanie is a sales person.  She goes along with it, in an effective flirting scene.  Once Mitch learns she isn't a saleswoman and the store has no love birds, he departs.<br /><br />Melanie, intrigued, orders the birds, with plans to secretly deliver them herself.  She tracks Mitch down at his week-end home at Bodega Bay, some 60 miles north.  She manages to leave the caged birds in Mitch's house after learning they were to be a surprise birthday present for his pubescent sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright).  Mitch sees that Melanie was the culprit, meets with her and of course, one thing leads to another.  We see in this meeting, the first sign that things are all not quite right when a gull attacks Melanie out of the blue.<br /><br />Things start to pick up quickly as various birds, but mostly gulls, crows and sparrows begin to appear in large numbers.  At first sitting on wires, buildings and in trees but eventually on playground equipment and on the ground.  Similar reports come from nearby communities.  Many dismiss the concern but when the birds attack children, including Cathy, as they leave their school, the townsfolk are more alarmed.  Even to the point of suggesting that Melanie's arrival set things off.  Well she did bring the caged love birds.<br /><br />Hitchcock manages to bring a modicum of suspense leading up to the various attacks.  The birds seem to attack without warning then quickly disburse.  Then they just seem to occupy space until the next event.  In the most controversial scene, Melanie, Mitch, Cathy and Mitch's mother (Jessica Tandy) are holed up in Mitch's boarded up house.  Melanie hears a noise upstairs and for some never explained reason, goes up alone to investigate.  Upon opening the door, she is attacked unmercifully for several minutes, leaving her severely wounded both physically and mentally.  Historians have noted that Hitchcock re-shot this scene many times which actually put Hedren in the hospital.  The actress insists it was retaliation for her spurning Hitchcock's sexual advances.  Regardless of the back story, the scene is very gruesome and very effective.<br /><br />\\"The Birds\\" is a serviceable thriller and certainly deserves praise for some of the technical achievements of its day.  Whether it is one of the great director's best, I don't think so.  But that's all a matter of personal opinion, right?<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer in in 1080p video resolution and has a DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (2 channel) audio mix.  Although the high definition improves on previous releases, it is far from perfect.  One of the things it does is highlight some of the special effects elements to the point that they are much too noticeable.  Although I didn't see any wires holding up the birds, some of the shots that are supposed to be outside clearly shot on a sound stage.  Aside from that the transfer can perhaps best be described as uneven.  At times the film looks murky, the next shot may be terrific.  The colors look good as does skin tone.  Just don't expect perfection.  The audio, even with a cleaned up mono is excellent.  The dialog is clear and centered.  It would have been interesting to get all of the birds squawking in a 5.1 surround however.  There are some interesting extras on the disc.

0670026557|5.0|\\"Give and Take\\" - a Review<br />There are far too many useful business and nonfiction books are the market for any one person to read. But Give and Take - A Revolutionary Approach to Success by Adam Grant (Viking) is one I believe is well worth the time. Grant has looked at empirical evidence from many sources and discovered a novel idea: Givers can become wildly successful.<br /><br />Unlike some books about success, this one is not full of hyperbole. And unlike some business books by professors -- Grant is a management professor at Wharton,-- this one does not drone on. In fact, Grant builds his case in an intriguing way, drawing the reader in with stories, surprising the reader with unusual outcomes, then explaining the paradoxical theory and supporting it with academic research. I wanted to keep reading to find out how Grant would turn each story on its head.<br /><br />Give and Take really opened my eyes and got me looking at situations from a new perspective. The more I read the book, the more I recognized types of people I know and started to appreciate the Givers in my life even more. I also saw more opportunities to be helpful to others at random times. Now, I'm inspired to figure out how to start a Reciprocity Ring at my church. (Read the book to find out what a Reciprocity Ring is.)<br /><br />The author does not just dwell on business and management. He uses examples from sports, education, grassroots dot-coms like Freecycle and Craigslist, finance, health care, and nonprofits, and he introduces several really fascinating concepts:<br /><br />1. There are three types of people: Takers, Matchers, and Givers. Within those groups are subgroups. The Givers can wind up on the bottom, never getting ahead, or they can succeed so much that they wind up at the top.<br />2.  Givers who get ahead build loyalty and high-quality teams. Takers can be so self-centered that they drive support away.<br />3. Givers can help others to realize their full potential.<br />4.Givers who succeed use time wisely and do ask for help occasionally. Grant calls this being Otherish.<br />5. Givers who fail don't use their giving time wisely and never ask for help for themselves.<br />5. There's a myth about Giver burnout.<br />6. Takers can be generous.<br /><br />But wait, there's more! Give and Take is worth reading simply to discover how Grant came to all these conclusions and to figure out how you can be more of a giver.<br /><br />Full disclosure, I read this book for many selfish reasons:<br />1. I went to Wharton, and Grant teaches at Wharton (a little alumna loyalty).<br />2. I'm co-writing a business book and want to read other business books to see what will hold my interest and how principles can evolve out of anecdote. I wanted to analyze what made me like(or not like) the writing. (I really liked Grant's writing. Why?)<br />3.  I am on a nonprofit board for At Home in Darien, a nonprofit that helps seniors staying their homes. But seniors don't call us for help, transportation or handyman services. Why? They're all Givers. How can we get them to be Takers? (Adam Grant, if you read this review, please take on this question for further research.)<br />4. I've been on the pledge and the finance committees at my church, and I have often wondered why some people in the congregation give generously, while other don't. What's going on in their minds? How could we change the non-givers into Givers? I was searching for an answer.<br /><br />Not all of my questions were answered. But I came away from Give and Take with enlightenment and inspiration. The book was a complete pleasure to read, even on beautiful summer afternoons.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|My sister in law and I sat and watched the first 3  years of this series while I was recovering from hip surgery and found all of them very good.  We were not happy with the last of season 3 where Michael was killed in a car accident as we felt this poor family had suffered enough.  However, I am looking forward to watching season 4 as soon as it comes out.
1936891026|5.0|If you need a reason to get on with your creative endeavor, this book is for you.  If you don't need a reason, this book is still for you.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|I really love this show and the cd has the complete second season. I recommend this to anyone who likes homeland
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Not what I expected! Pleasantly surprised by the sincere love story! The actors picked where perfect for the parts and made it believable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was surprised with some of the sequel episodes that there seemed to be a disconnect - some missing information.  All in all, I may watch it all over again.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a good app. The LED flashlight works perfectly. There are also some cool colored lights for your screen that are really bright in the dark.
B004GYY714|5.0|Would highly recommend this app. So many stations, nicely laid out. Love the feature to record for the time period I set it for. Then listen to it later. Plus I then record individual songs I like to my phone. Very nice.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Ted Sarandos, the &#34;content officer&#34; at Netflix, said in a recent interview on Marketplace that their data tell them viewers have an &#34;appetite for good drama.&#34;  That would be me, i.e., one of those viewers.  I don't usually take the time to write a review for something I can't in good conscience give 5 stars.  The reason for that in this case is that I never know when I watch another episode whether I will want to watch another one.  For one thing, the kids are a maddening distraction, and I simply don't care about them.  But the whole spectrum of lawyers in their spectrum of roles is irresistible -- and their investigators:  fabulous.  When I get to see these people work, I don't want to miss a single word.  Oddly, Season 1 is better than Season 2 ... but not always.  As I said, I never know whether it's going to feel that it's building, that it's becoming.  One PROFOUNDLY satisfying aspect of &#34;The Good Wife,&#34; though, is that actors from &#34;The Wire&#34; get to do more t.v. work; how very, very good it is to see them again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't know what I would do if I couldn't read my e-books on the go, other than using my kindle. I love using the kindle for android app!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I liked this book a lot.  It's hard not to listen to a man that survived great hardship at the expense of other humans and went on to help many people in his medical practice.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|The product was excellent, my only complaint was that we ordered this product over a week before my daughters birthday and it got here a week after. We didn't realize it was coming from overseas. Great product though
B000JMKQX0|2.0|While at first this appears to be a clever way to tell a story, the author has no ability to create a new character.  All of the people in the book are tired old war veterans straight out of a Sergeant Fury Comic.  Lame...it is lame.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The characterization in this book was phenomenal. Ended up crying my eyes out by the end. Definitely a must read--especially for teenagers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I, liked this game . Easy and fun to play .  a nice time killer. You might need some appear for. Notes to solve. Some problems.
B009GX69RK|5.0|New Girl is a terrific show. Extremely funny and always entertaining to watch. The characters are amazing. I only wish I knew the rules to True American!
1432794426|5.0|A great book to help anyone understand the complicated life of Michael Jackson.  Lots of interesting information written with Love and Respect.
B00881VLCE|5.0|with adjustable number of pieces and option of rotating pieces, this game is very addicting but so much fun. would recommend for any age.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you don&acute;t have this game get it now or else but it's really fun please get it please I don't want to ask again.
B003L0V758|5.0|So I've never written an album review on here before but I felt very motivated to comment on this album.  I am a huge music nerd and lover of pretty much all genres, and Janelle Monae's ArchAndroid is one of the best pieces of work I've ever heard.  I can't believe it took me this long to give it a try - boy have I been missing out! It gives me goosebumps.  I've not been able to stop listening to it since the first time I played it.<br /><br />Janelle Monae is FANTASTIC.  She is incredibly talented, multifaceted, full of soul - and has unbelievable creativity and passion for music.  She has a beautiful voice, LOADS of unique style, and she's freakin adorable.  Plus she's kind of a weirdo.  And that's always a good thing in my books.<br /><br />As for the album itself - it's magic.  It's unique and it seamlessly blurs the line between numerous genres.  The arrangements are beautiful and the production value is high - which I think is a benefit to her music, not a detriment.  Plus, her songs are damn catchy.  I DARE you to try and sit still while this album is playing, especially during the first half.  In fact, good luck getting the songs out of your head whenever you're NOT listening to it :-p<br /><br />Favourite songs at this point (though with further listens, my list is bound to expand):  Dance or Die, Faster, Locked Inside (this one is so infectious I literally CAN'T not sing along), Cold War, Tightrope, Oh Maker, Wondaland.<br /><br />ArchAndroid is one of the best albums I've heard in quite awhile and definitely top five of my life.  And coming from someone with a music obsession, that's saying a lot.  I come across an artist like Janelle Monae and I'm reminded of why I love music so much.  I'm counting the days until the new album is released...
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Absolutely loved this lifesaver. Took it out to the garage while doing repairs and looked up a video right there to help! Awesome!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|easy to use and all the effects are awesome, the only thing i can think of improving is adding search in files library. it is now possible to be a DJ anywhere you go.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|It's more 3.5 stars. I really love the world building and the mention of Downworlders. I really liked that it had many kinds of non-human beings. I was so drawn in and surprised with all the twist and turns there was in this book. It had many parts where there was a lot of action, which to me was the best part in this book, but not so much romance which I was ok with.<br /><br />The characters I loved and enjoyed reading about was Luke, Silent Brothers, Valentine, Hodge, Isabelle & Alec. I did not care so much for the main characters. Jace and Clary were not enticing in this book so I just hope that they get better through the series.<br /><br />I also gave this rating because the ending was not a strong one. It was left to cheesy and non-grabbing. Let's hope the movie adaptation is played out well or even better than the book.
B004LROUNG|2.0|I have read a lot of Grisham books over the years, and decided to return to them after a long break with positive memories of books such as The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Rainmaker, etc.  What those books have that this one doesn't is a sense of suspense, more than one likable main character, and a plot worth turning the page for.  I liked the ending well enough, but it wasn't nearly enough to salvage a thoroughly boring and uneventful story.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's v really amazing and I'm thirteen it is really amazing and there are some challenging ones that really make you think.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is the best yet! Don't usually go for zombie movies, but the characters are memorable and complex. Cannot wait for season 4 in October.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|i read alot of stephen king and this is one of the best! He really knows how to pull you into his stories.
0920668372|5.0|This book was so cute and I cried and cried. Paged and everything looked great over all I am pleased
B004D20JP2|1.0|Boring! The youngest watched for a minute. The others stated they did not pick it so they should get to see something better.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was a real eye opener for me. It left me wanting to know more as well as feeling relieved that my somewhat misspent youth went by without incident.
B00C1N9JWO|3.0|I'll keep this short. No spoilers.<br /><br />The story premise is very unique and interesting.  The author could do a lot with this world she built.  Where it fell short was the emotions that the characters displayed during the numerous events.  understood Psy are suppose to be non-feeling, but doesn't that mean it's all bottled up and should explode at some point?  didn't get that from the story.  I wanted to know what would happen to the characters, but I never got the emotional engagement that such a story should have elicited.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This series had me gripped from the start. If you like panoramic fantasy or other world settings but a gripping host of characters and story lines this is for you. The political intrigue is brilliant and is as human as our life in this world so one feels connected by virtue of this drama alone. The twists and turns are fabulous and keep me reading and guessing ahead but always pleasantly ( or horrifically) surprised! The realms created are as real as any might be and are extremely well crafted and believable. I also began watching the series on TV and that is amazingly close tand true to the characters and even dialogue in the books!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Good movie. ..it got a little slow in the middle but had a good ending.  I would have liked more action as well.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book is amazing! I have never read something like this. It taught me so much and I'm sure it will teach others many lessons as well. Reading this addressed many questions that I have had and helped me understand how important life really is. I highly recommend this amazing master piece to absolutely anyone. :)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Wait til you open this beautiful collection. The book of discs fit perfectly into the box cover. You will appreciate how much time they put into this package.
B005LAJ22Q|1.0|The first season was intriguing, and I understood its analogy of our contemporary mindlessness. It's focus on pure survivalism was attractive for the masses because that animalistic instinct is all our world has left, in general and for consolation; our best solution for nihilism, itself birthed by liberalism, is to stare the devil in the face. That is a bitter pill. The show doesn't ever knowingly approach such insight, it just nicely imitated our mood.<br /><br />Darabont was fired for financial reasons, of course. Not surprisingly, the show then started to really suck. It is now preoccupied with moralizing wish-fulfillment and campy melodrama. The writing and acting we're both mediocre from the beginning, so real profundity should be off-limits. Now Dead is making proclamations about man, death and the Sacred, and its embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />All the characters undergo a developmental downward spiral, Daryl especially. Frankly, I was offended by their contrived innocence. There's all sorts of sudden, anomalous outbursts, many indirectly engineered by the pathetic plot and its impossible discrepancies. Others are resultant of the show's own liberal anxieties about unreconstructed white men. The 'love' between Glenn and the farm girl, which was so calculated, served no purpose besides blatant social-engineering. Yet, so is the character of Shane, who becomes so glaring so as to make the emotive, empathic old man and protagonist so much more purposeful. And so Is the entire situation surrounding and including Herschel, that old-time white man who couldn't possibly eat sushi. I cringed every time he said &#34;the Asian boy&#34;, not for the reason AMC would like me to think but because they were so obviously reaching in my brain under the direction of NPR.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|As always, loved the main characters as well as the support staff, protagonist,  Mickey Haller uses throughout his books. TheTrial and legal dialogue is entertaining throughout, but, I had a prognostication, about what the defendent would do. Nice twist with the park discovery. Did not like the haste in the ending and wished the SOB, would have met his fate differently.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Since the update I can't open the app most of the time on my Kindle Fire.  Love the content when I can though, love the details on the extended forecasts.  Hope they figure out the problem.
B007VPLNGW|1.0|sorry I just couldn't see the point of this one.  You're supposed to slingshot your shark around to eat all the little ducks.  The sharks action is way to random.  I'm sure they were aiming for an  Angry Birds type of game but they missed by a mile.  Deleted this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Since I found pinteres I don't have time for face book are anything...I get started and my husband has to remind me what time it is...lol
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|reading each book in order.  I like to see how Lee Childs grows the Reacher character.  I intend to finish all the Reacher books.
0307730700|5.0|Wonderful book about a true hero! Everyone should read this and thank all service members for their dedication to our country! Adam Brown was a true hero and I am sure there are many others.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Since I'm looking for a job and need access to my resume...this app is awesome and very easy to use
B008P9M614|5.0|It was great! Everything I hoped for and more it fulfilled me as a person. Good job Huge. Made my day.
1401322786|5.0|A must read!  Great story for all ages.  Gives a great perspective about aging and growing up.<br />Buy two, one for you and one to gift.
B000FC11A6|2.0|I have worked with crypto and secure systems for over 40 years, so I was excited to find this book. Unfortunately, it let me down, The many stories span decades, which in itself is fine, but the author gets so far down into the noise with excruciating details that the book becomes tiresome. I'm not one to shun lengthy books; some hold your interest so well that you'd gladly read several thousand pages. But this one just became chatter after a while. Several chapters were well written, but overall it just rambled. I couldn't wait to reach the end, although several times I was ready to just give it up as a bad deal.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|They are better than ever, and glad I now have these CD's to add to my collection for my quiet times.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I hoped this book would be in the same vein as The Hunger Games, but was sorely disappointed. The writer's use of simile was excessive and extremely ineffective, the characters were boring and even annoying, and the use of magic/fantasy was too convoluted.
B000000OU0|5.0|Walking down memory lane, and this is just as good as their 70's stuff as well as their latest offerings.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This collection is really amazing, the qualit is great, the cover is original and without the last alien movie (prometeo) is perfect.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|No spoilers here. I loved the book. I couldnt put it down. I probably fifnished it in a few days and am sad its over. The writting is from the perspective of the main character. I definitely got emotionally attached to the main character. READ IT!!
B008ER9QLK|5.0|The quality of this items is trully HD, the product is more than I expected. I would like to have more products like this.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I liked the music when I saw the movie. I am happy that I can listen to it and sing along when I drive..
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The graphics are gorgeous and interesting, the puzzles are challenging and well thought-out, the sounds are intriguing and enhancing , and the game play is suspenseful, thought intriguing, picturesque, and magical. I honestly don't see what's not to love in this stunning app. A bonus is that, unlike many games of its kind, it cannot be finished in 2 hours.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|all of these reviews are for shakespear. somehow amazon has put shakespear reviews under oscar wildes dorian gray. at least that is the case on my kindle. too bad.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|this was a very nice read. It was a long start but it was there for a reason, just keep reading! Very cute book.
0812973992|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. Beautifully written, this author takes you on a journey, sometimes hard, but always worth it. As of now this is my favorite of all his books, though each and every one is well worth the read, and very different. Amazing how much research must go into each book, as he knows so much about the times and places he has written, the people and history in this country. He makes you feel like you know them too.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Two stories in one correlating 2 different but similar journeys.<br />A sequel is needed to continue the saga.  This will enhance the ride.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this app. Works great and when I a bored I just turn it on and look at the detail of each weapon.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|My son follows this series and really enjoyed watching this. Thanks for having it available on dvd. The price was reasonable.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|A BluRay DVD in the package with James McAvoy as the lead? Honestly, what could be imaginably wrong with this? Absolutely nothing.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This sweet series is the perfect escapist series.  Utterly delightful.  Don't miss it.  The acting is very good, and the characters are, well, characters!
1423136802|5.0|What more could you ask for, five books in a box.  All that could be better would be be a ball in a cup.
B009DH372Y|5.0|I am pleased that it has arrived. Now I can watch my DVD, instead of having to rely on YouTube
B005PK57NU|5.0|It is such a great tv show! I hate that I am playing catch up.  I cannot wait to see what the next season is going to hold for Alicia and the rest of the cast
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun game not to hard not too easy. The graphics are a bit old school and the music is too but that stuff is easy to overlook. I was disappointed when I reached the end at level 10.
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|This is a free app so how can you say anything bad about it. It's checkers not Mortal Kombat. I like checkers.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|My daughter wanted to play this but I refuse to allow her to play apps that require you to connect to the internet since she does know any better and orders items on accident.  We can't play this since it will not let you play with an active internet connection.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|I really like Grumpy Cat things!  This book was very cute and the captions are funny.  Would love to own a cat like this one!  I'm sure she's not grumpy at all.  Want to get some Grumpy Cat things for gifts.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter wanted to play this but I refuse to allow her to play apps that require you to connect to the internet since she does know any better and orders items on accident.  We can't play this since it will not let you play with an active internet connection.
140006922X|5.0|Well referenced, well written. This book has actually taught me things that I should have known but never found out.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Couldn't get through the books (my wife is ripping through them) but the HBO series is fantastic. Highly recommended for lovers of high fantasy and just good television alike.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I really loved this movie. A friend of mine recommended it to me . Glad I bought it very interesting
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Basically you have to watch about 3-5 ads to get the 2 credits to play one game but games are fun, just not worth the wait.
B009O2XY12|5.0|FUNNNN !! But ... it is REALLY hard to level up once you get past like lever 20 . I do like that their is like.. a hard level, and then a easy level, SOMETIMES .<br /><br />WARNING: If you are a parent , and you are reading this , considering this app for your child . I highly suggest putting a parental control on this app. WHY ?: Your child has the opportunities to buy up to $50.00 in &quot;Gems&quot;  Yes , you really can buy this much. (And I think more... not sure . I don't own this app anymore but Amazon app store allows you to write reviews on apps you previously owned  as well as currently owned.) And yes , I think that it is PRETTY DUMB that you can buy &quot;gems&quot; on such a large scale with REAL money.
B002L7O7XG|5.0|These are the complete set of movies - love the DVD graphics and they all played flawlessly - just be sure that your DVD player will play the Region 2 DVD format - most new players will handle with no problem but some older players may not accept them. SBJ
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Does what is says it does. Not a SUPER great app but , HEY. It works , it doesn't crash and the alarm goes off when you schedule it. It is easy to set up alarms and turn them on / off . Hi hope this helped you guys !! :)
B00DQR26EC|5.0|I absolutely love this game already and I'm only about an hour into it!  I hope you make more games!  I'll be looking out for more from you.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Good product.  Focuses well is placed on solid object. Should work like I-phone camera.  Hard to see what you are taking photo of.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Thought it might be boring, but it kept my attention throughout.  Did not look at my watch once!  I may just buy it for my library.
140006922X|4.0|a little dry at times, but a great subject matter.  Obviously Jesus is an interesting topic, but I learned so much about a time in history that was previously unknown to me.
0525478817|5.0|Just bought this book today, decided to start it while eating lunch at Whole Foods which then lasted 6 hours as I could not stop turning the pages. This is a serious must read that caused me to laugh and bawl (at the same time). I do not cry easily, however this really got to me. Unlike the many other books about death and dying that consist of cliches like \\"living each day to the fullest\\" and what not, this book was brutally honest. Will be reading this one again. Advice: read this book when alone, I had to endure many awkward \\"Are you okay..?\\" as I cried my eyes out while eating a cheesecake during the last 50 pages.
B0041D843M|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. As a researcher that's been funded by the govt for most of the past few decades he seems to echo the govt mantra of \\"low fat and high carbs are good for you\\". We've been hearing this for 30+ years and America is getting fatter and sicker. He ignores clinical trials done in the last 15 years that dont support the low fat - high carb approach. Further, since \\"low fat\\" cant be proven to be beneficial in clinical trials he's now expanding the recommendation to \\"low animal products\\".<br /><br />Some of his research has been excellent, but it doesnt always support his conclusions which often smack of bias and reading the results the way you want to. For instance, he discovered that rats fed casein, a milk protein, would develop liver cancer when exposed to a carcinogen, but rats fed soy protein would not. Brilliant. Whats the conclusion? Follow up to determine what's in casein that soy protein lacks? Potentially learn what key element cancer needs that, if we can deprive it, would control cancer growth? No, the conclusion is all animal protein causes cancer and vegetable protein does not. All animal protein, concluded from testing 1, a milk protein from cows milk which is probably foreign to rats.<br /><br />Similarly, comparing the diets of rural chinese farmers who are too poor to eat meat to western diets he demonstrates that the chinese farmers dont get many of the diseases westerns do and concludes it's the lack of animal products. Could it not be increased vegetables, higher fiber, increased exercise, lower levels of gluten, or a myriad of other possibilities? Correlation is not causation, and jumping to conclusions is what got America on the \\"low fat, low cholesterol\\" binge 30 years ago.<br /><br />I found his disparaging remarks toward Dr Atkins and other low-carb researchers unprofessional. You can disagree, and alternative data is welcome in a scientific debate, but dont ignore clinic trials that disagree with you and then insult people personally.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Oscar Wilde has a peculiar flare for telling us the things we didn't want to hear, but after hearing, feel we couldn't be the same without. In the Picture of Dorian Gray, Wilde once again shows us how this high minded way of thinking can either raise us to a better level of living, or spell our demise as we wrap ourselves deeper and deeper in epigrams and maxims we think of as esoteric.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I was a Born Again Christian in the early 1980s, my entire family mostly still are. I remember how the B-A community and the Church used tactics to dissuade anyone from reading or viewing anything and everything that went against the very narrow frame of their form of Christianity. You knew not to openly question their doctrine, you would be labeled quickly as someone who really does not know God and really was not &#34;saved.&#34; They would say something like, if you really question or believe these &#34;lies from the Devil&#34; then you do not know Jesus as the son of God. Even after 30 years, I remember the fear just having doubts about what you were taught. It was not until I no longer attended Church that I slowly started to question what was told to me as their so called truth. I read several books, most notably and influential were two: &#34;Who Wrote the Bible&#34; by Richard Elliot Friedman and The Five Gospels: What did Jesus Really Say?&#34; by the Robert W. Funk. You get to a point where you no longer fear studying a different viewpoint, a viewpoint that is not based on &#34;feeling&#34; or &#34;faith&#34; but on historic facts. I converted to Judaism almost 13 years ago, Zealot provided me additional understanding of the Bible and the ancient practices. Not pretty, but the truth sometimes is not. Ignorance is not a basis of any real faith. I try to go by the &#34;seek and you shall find&#34; in my belief system.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have had this for 2 years without a problem. I recommend using a MP3 player and not using the USB or SD card slot. It will work, but it will not fast forward and will not remember where you left off if you are listening to a pod cast or a long piece of audio.
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|Technically impressive, but as a drama it is wanting. The tsunami effects are incredible and terrifying, but the film quickly wore out its welcome. First of all, I'm no bleeding heart, but even I was shocked that it focuses almost exclusively on the effect the tsunami had on wealthy white Europeans, virtually ignoring the hundreds of thousands of Thai natives who died or were injured, except when body bags are used as props. The live residents of Thailand play one dimensional supporting roles and are never fleshed out. Second, nearly every shot is a close up, and many of those extreme close ups, of the actors' battered faces. The camera almost never backs off to show the performers interacting with one another. Everyone delivers most of their lines in a solitary closeup. Third, the massive response by the U.S. Navy and other international aid is never even alluded to.<br /><br />VAGUE SO AS NOT TO SPOIL: I wondered why everyone else back at the hotel managed to get cleaned up and find some clothes, but one key character stays bloody and half naked until nearly the end of the movie.  The film's climax, supposed to be suspenseful, instead plays like a French bedroom farce, as key characters wander a crowded hospital just missing each other by seconds. Ewan MacGregor seems to be screaming \\"Hey, where's my Oscar?\\" throughout much of the picture.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Sometimes history is hard, but we can learn from The past and make a better future. This book is well worth reading.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I live outside the US so I had to do a workaround to get the Android App installed on my phone and tablet. After that Netflix and Youtube work great.<br />From my Windows 7 laptop it's a different story. Video and navigation are slow, out of sync and have about 1 second lag. Other than that, great device!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I'm really not a fan of musicals but this got such good reviews that we thought we'd watch it.  The acting was very good but with so little story my husband & I really didn't care much for it.
B003L77GGA|5.0|This is a great conclusion to a wonderful series. I definitely reccomend buying this season in Blu ray the HD effects are really well done
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I liked the variety of puzzles provided. It provided a challenge but was interesting. Some instructions needed to be a little clearer.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie was just what the title says LAWLESS, brilliant from start to finish, had a boys night in to watch it & we all loved it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved the book, it was very well written and the narrating adds to the effect of the sadness and is well read
B001HLZMUE|3.0|Poor audio, I could barely hear the audio even with my computer volume all the way up.  You need to resolve the problem.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|very fun don't give up it can get annoying but keep playing and you'll win I recommend byeing blue dimonds
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|it doesn't have very clear directions. it would be nice if you could zoom on the rooms &amp; follow the less than clear instructions. how do you use the tools? I don't know. doesnt say.
B005HSL626|5.0|I don't understand why regular fruit ninja charges 99 cents. This one is so much better and free.  Time killing and simple.
1608871827|5.0|you'll love this book! Loaded with a plethora of sketches, concept art and notes this book expands on the universe established in the movie. A great addition to the kaiju or giant mecha fan in your life!
B008B4K5GQ|5.0|I am not saying there is anything wrong with this original version of the Lorax. However, the cover shown is EXTREMELY misleading. This movie is NOT from the creators of Despicable Me! This is the ORIGINAL movie.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I don't want to build it up too much, create over expectation. It's fun, and a good way to pass some time. Give it a chance!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|As a committed Christian, I like to read everything I come across pertaining to the &#34;human&#34; side of Jesus.  I have been somewhat disappointed both with the content and the writing style of this book.  I think I'd rather see a purely didactic treatment with lots of footnotes than the constant references to historical figures and how they fit into the times and how and what they wrote is historically significant.  It detracts from the work and, to me, it appears that author's opinions are not supported with proper references...meaning it's all mixed up together like the boring but ubiquitous Jell-O salad on the buffet.  That said, the style seems somewhat disjointed and unappealing.  I have had to put the work down on a number of occasions and sort out what I have just read and supplement with my own admittedly inadequate research in order to clarify it in my mind.  I tend to disagree with the reviews accompanying the book...I was not &#34;riveted&#34; and it seemed that there was no &#34;soul&#34; in the presentation of the material.  &#34;Just the facts, Ma'am&#34; is the kind of narrative I'd describe and I really wanted to like this book.  I learned some things I didn't know but it could have been a much more enjoyable read.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Just trying to figure out how I can get my music to wake me up, but love it..nice night light at night..
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is sweetness, true to the show that birthed it. any true brony will be stuck playing this game for hours.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|its nice to see a movie nowdays without  all the  sex , drugs, cussing,  killing and rapes.  just plain simple love!
0446563048|5.0|The book comes as how it is described. It's in a brand new condition. I bought this book as a gift for my friend. He likes it a lot.
B000VXJMYG|5.0|Is as good now as when it first came out.  Unique sound special group.  Enjoyed every song.  Took me back to a time when lyrics mattered
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This isn't Star Wars but overall I really enjoyed it.  Had to watch it twice to catch all that the characters had to give. I liked it better the 2nd time through.  It has a decent story line and enough twists to keep you interested.  It is NOT a 2-hr shoot-em -up  like the typical action films these days. Thanks.
B008M87GJK|5.0|The app has a good layout, divides it nicely between the world, us, tech, etc. just like on their website.  It has some of their top most recent stories and keeps me well informed.
B007C52NY2|5.0|Fascinated how Mr. Larsson developed his character's with full bodied life. Story telling at it's best. Tis a shame we won't get any further adventures from such a skilled writer.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I loved this game so much I bought some of the expansions.  It makes you think, there's different situations, you have to work to unlock stuff, and the expansion has zombies.  It's a lot of fun!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A very different horror show that keeps you wanting more. Dark, edgy, sexy, and not your typical scary show.  Bring on season 3!
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|I can only play this game for about 10 minutes before I get bored.  It's got really pretty graphics and the animations are cute, it just gets dull and there isn't anything to work towards.
B00BWC1UZE|5.0|First, let me say that I've been a Professional DJ for 16 years.  Made my bones in Vegas for 10 Years and the last 6 here in Atlanta.  Gentleman's Clubs exclusively.  If you would of told me that I was going to love the next JT album, I would've thrown you out of my DJ Booth & probably made fun of you over the mic.<br />With that said...JT, Timbaland & Jerome \\"J-Roc\\" Harmon have all come together to produce an amazingly sophisticated, sexy, late night magic maker!<br />I'm not going to lie, when my girlfriend brought over, I only listen to it for obvious reasons...<br />I bought it for my personal collection soon after.  I'VE NEVER DONE THAT!<br />If anybody ever has plans on spending an intimate evening with you special girl (and her best friend if its your birthday) have this CD on deck!
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|An excellent game for when you are on the porcelain throne or you want someone 12-22 to just be quiet for 15-30 minutes.  It's a good strategy game.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was very well written and I loved the plot line of it. It is not a very adult book but it is a very good book for teens.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Full of action and intrigue, this is acted well, and the story is well written and staged. Great for the collector.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played it is so epic if u think this game is horrible that's horrible
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|While I am just as annoyed at the cliffhanger ending as everyone else, I still have to say I love this series.  Gideon is hot, hot, hot!  I can't wait to continue his and Eva's story.  I sincerely hope Day does not keep us waiting too long!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It couldn't put it down. What a great read. I can not wait to start the next book. Loved it!
B0033H7VI6|2.0|This product is made in Taiwan. I try to buy knives and cutting tools from the US, Sweden, Germany, and Norway.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This book really highlights the activities of every person in any position. We're all trying to move someone to our pint of view, to do something, encourage, etc. Great tips and mindset coaching!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read Hesseini's other two books and loved them. His writing is so powerful. This book transcends everything else he's written. No villains in this book. Deeply revealing about family and love relationships - and friends. Wonderful in every way. Couldn't recommend more highly.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Interesting documentary about the legendary Sound City recording studio.  I loved seeing all the greats that recorded there and also liked seeing and learning a little about the recording process.  A very sweet film.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|First, I'm a &#34;purist when it comes to comic book and/or radio super heroes. The beginning was  just &#34;O.K.&#34;, the there was too much war and not enough Red Skull. Personally, I liked the one with Matt Salinger much better. Truer to the comic book version.
B00A27X972|5.0|Interesting tale -well written, light summer read. It's one of those books that are just fun to read and you can't put down.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Not the original Daredevil. Again, the original lived and worked in the WW II era. I miss the characters - like &#34;Iron Jaw&#34;, etc. And, I know most &#34;super heroes&#34; and science fiction emphasize the impossible - but a blind super hero? Phhht!
1439107955|5.0|Is there a family today that hasn't been touched by cancer?  Three members of my extended family have been struck with it.  Breast cancer is frighteningly common among the women in my wife's family.  And even though cancer does not have the stigma that was once attached to it, the word still strikes fear in the heart, and it is difficult to wrap one's mind around the disease.  Fortunately, Siddhartha Mukherjee has put together a volume that, while not necessarily tamping down the fear inspired by cancer, makes it a manageable subject.<br /><br />An oncologist himself, Dr. Mukherjee mixes stories of his own experiences with patients (particularly as an oncology fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2003 - 05) with a detailed history of the disease from the dawn of human records to the present.  He describes our attempts simply to understand cancer to the push at curing and preventing cancer, mainly from the late 19th century on, as people began living long enough for cancer to become a common illness.<br /><br />Though it is Dr. Mukherjee's intention to inform, this is not a book for the faint at heart.  From an Egyptian papyrus from the 26th century BC, where the physician Imhotep notes \\"there is none\\" as the therapy for cancer (the only illness that received such a comment), through slashing surgeries with no anesthetic to the radical surgeries and chemotherapies of the 20th century, the brutality and ignorance can be tough to stomach.  And yet, through it all, there is a trajectory towards a clearer understanding of cancer and small triumphs in saving lives.<br /><br />The modern story takes off with Sydney Farber and the Jimmy Fund in the 1940's.  In the era of cures for once intractable diseases like polio and the discovery of penicillin, serious work begins to find chemical means to cure cancer.  What follows are decades of slow successes with various treatments for certain cancers.  Along the way, the fundamentals of cancer are slowly being unraveled and there is a start to understand and prevents environmental causes of cancer--smoking as a cause of lung cancer being the prime example.  This leads inexorably to where we are today, with very little hope still offered for certain cancers, certain cancers curable to all intents and purposes, and new treatments now coming from a much deeper understanding of the genetic basis of the disease.<br /><br />At one time a diagnosis of cancer was basically a death sentence and there is certainly no doubt that the disease is one that remains horrible.  Even those treatments that succeed are often time consuming, painful, and with many fearful side effects.  But Dr. Mukherjee shows in this excellent, detailed book that we have come a long way in our understanding of cancer even if we still have a long way to go before mastering it.  Anyone who has a reason to learn something about cancer--and that includes everyone--should take the time to read this masterful work.nd there is a start to understand and prevents environmental causes of cancer--smoking as a cause of lung cancer being the prime example.

1603580557|5.0|I wrote a review about this because it was so awesome - [...] - if you have any questions about the world, reading this book could help. It's that fundamental.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It gave me a sense of adventure. Like I was attacatlly in the book with them and it was awesome.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I am enjoying New Girl very much.  It is a refreshing show compared to all the murder and mayhem that is on television these days.  The characters are funny and very likeable.  The stories are outrageous but it is entertaining.  This show is exactly that...entertainment.  After a tough day, it is nice to sit down and laugh out loud (which I do often while watching this show).  If you are expecting a high brow, thought-provoking show, I would suggest turning the channel.  If you are looking to laugh, be entertained and to forget about your troubles with well-acted characters, then stay tuned.  It is fun and there is nothing wrong with just having a little bit of fun now and then.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Just get the app &quot;adaway&quot;. There won't be ads anymore . And then , it's just awesome. Of course you will need root. But it's so easy
B009EHDU7U|5.0|A wonderfully witty book - really from left field!  The book actually makes you laugh out loud. The story is clever in that much political history history and world geography is intermingled with the central character's journey through life and we meet a most diverse group of humans who provide many surprises and entertainment - quite insightful to the human condition.
B000HL09SA|5.0|A heart warming story that I can relate to.  Dogs are humans best friends.  I totally agree that there are so much we can learn from our dogs.
B00486UF52|3.0|Kate Fox is a anthropologist who doesn't want to spend her time in the jungle. Therefor, she decided to study her own species, the English. That gives some interesting insight, like the enormous class differences that even are visible in the language (tea in workers families means the evening diner, in upper class families a hot cup in the afternoon with scones and cookies, for instance), but also seem to proof that she hasn't studied many other people, otherwise she would know that the English certainly are not alone in using the weather as an easy topic to talk about when you meet a casual neighbor in the street. Apart from that, she really has done research, and the book is written as an anthropological case study, more than a tongue in cheek observation with funny anecdotes, so it was a bit more boring than I expected.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is one of my favorite books!  It took me a while to read the entire book.  You feel find yourself hating and/or loving characters.  Tyrion is such a well developed character, and I have already started on the next book.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is yet another captivating story of the Ice Age characters.  My two year old is glued to the set when any Ica Age is playing.  The humor that is adult at times goes right over him, but cracks us up.  It is the best babysitter!  Keep 'em coming.  All the characters are so right in together.  Get IT!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|George R. R. Martin sure knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Don't fall in love with any characters because they may betray your love or die suddenly.
B00130EVSS|5.0|Great movie breaching the norm.<br />Definite must see for the ladies but you will have to wait till the end of the movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE these books!!!! I could not put them down. I can't wait for the rest of the movies to be done
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|I was lucky enough to score the original from a used cd shop many years ago. Awesome box with lots of extras.<br />Didn't hesitate to pick this re-release up, and was hopeful that my previous shipping problems from the Pumpkins would be gone.<br />Though the item came faster than expected, Amazon used tiny plastic bags of air to protect the item in the box. As a result everything is dented.  Not acceptable for a collector.<br /><br />Still waiting for Amazon to contact me about how they plan on rectifying this.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|One of the best love stories told!  Especially good for anyone that has a family member with dementia or Alzheimer's or for someone that could be facing it eventually due to it sometimes big hereditary.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I loved every minute of the HD season. It was something I could hardly put down because I wanted to see what happened next. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Wonderful free game to play, if u want something addicting to play in our free time this is a game.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show is really great.  I have enjoyed every episode so far. I think I am on season 3 now.  Quality.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I started watching Star Trek with the old crew in 1967 after returning from Germany.  Of course it was the real first of the great series about moving through space, but this Star Trek has it all.... action from the beginning to end and as an old Star Trek fan I recongnized the characters from the original series.  It was new creativity and new directors that did a great job.  Took me four years and my children recommending the move before I got serious and saw the movie and loved it.  Of course I remembered &#34;The next Generation&#34; which was lousy, Star Trek Voyager was pretty good until the black character seemed to take over the production, and finally the beginning as Star Trek Enterprise and it was the best of the lot until this film came about.<br />Finally Star Trek is back to where it should be, with groups excitedly awaiting the opening of a new Star Trek.
B00935KWWO|5.0|This is hands down the best Twitter client of them all.  Sadly, it's not available for IPAD though.  Hopefully soon!
B001C08RHA|5.0|I was intrigued with the technical aspect of his Iron Man suit.  The process of designing and manufacturing this item was outstanding.  The movie was action packed and I enjoyed every moment, although the fight with the large suit of his enemy was a little overdone, but it's just a movie.  I have not seen othe Iron Man films
B00571F26Y|5.0|Well, I must say this is a good book.  Makes total sense and has made a big change in my diet and living.<br />Once you get going on the &#34;no wheat&#34; regime, it really is not that hard.
B00AQSN7HE|2.0|As a great fan of James Bond and the books Ian Fleming wrote about, I resisted these latest Craig movies.  He is simply the wrong person for the real fans of the Bond series.  Bond wasn't English, he was Scots, a tall, suave gentleman made him what he was in the stories and movies we saw.  Of course Sean Connery was the greatest, with some of the most beautiful women in the world in those films, but others like the other Englishman, et cetra, were simply not the Bond types.  Especially Casino Royale was previously made several times, and with Sean Connery, was a great movie, but with this current failure, Craig, who spent the first 20 minutes of the movie jumping and leaping through construction sites that probably no one would be able to do even if they wanted to.  It was action with no action....jumping from windows to roofs of other constructions?  I just say, Old man Broccoli (sp) needs someone other than his daughter or whomever to decide what Ian Fleming saw in his Bond character.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I loved this show and I wish there were more like it.  I can't get enough of the behind the scenes of music from the 70's
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I enjoy builder games and this one does not disappoint. Yes ' you CAN spend real money but, really ..with a bit of patience it's not required. I am not finding myself with a shortage of things to do. Beautiful graphics and the game play is smooth. Overall a lovely and engaging builder and combat game. Nice work Gameloft!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|My daughter couldn't get past the first little part and she was frustrated with it. I tried to get past but it kept sending me back to the beginning. We deleted it from our tablet.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|So far so good! Very fun. Be sure and read the tips they help out a lot.  Makes time pass very quickly.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|In short, this is one of the best electronic albums to come out this century.  It's like a time warp back to prime mid 90s era Warp vibes set in the future.  With a healthy dose of interludes that bring Blade Runner to mind, this is an absolutely exquisite work.  Highly recommend to any fan of real electronic music.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Great series with gorgeous cinematorgraphy.  Blu Ray especially makes it come alive.  And of course it's a great educational tool for kids too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|even more difficult for grandmas than for the younger folks...but fun and such a challenge<br />my grandson downloaded it, now I can not put it down
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a great series that I finally gave a chance  - should have tried it earlier!  Strong family theme.  Noah Wyle is terrific
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game!! I cant put it down its so much fun and plus the minions are just as cute as ever!!
0140067477|2.0|I enjoyed the concept and the author's levity, but it is unfortunate how critical Benjamin Hoff is of other philosophies and of the activity of learning. This has been my first dip into Taoism. It has not been favorable, on the whole. The work is amusing and well executed, and very digestible, but perhaps a little too self satisfied. It makes a mess of its representation of Confuscianism, interpreting the love and fun of learning as \\"busy,\\" and portrays Buddhism as a way of escaping the world, when in fact Buddhism is more about learning how to happily enjoy the world while letting go of things that cause us to suffer.<br /><br />One can be an Uncarved Block and still take pleasure in scholarly pursuits. Perhaps the author cannot, which is why I rate this book so lowly, even though it may have many nuggets of truth for curious readers: it is brought down by egoism.<br /><br />There are many paths to happiness. Limiting your view to one, while simple and potentially still pleasurable, means missing out on the wider world around you.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It was well written and a beautiful story about an ugly time in our history.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm looking forward to more levels! The first ones were very entertaining. This is a good app, and the price is right!
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|I would love to give the app a rating, but it says unexpected problem forced closed and wont open.  I have an s4.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|It's ok, but when I install an app on my Kindle Fire, it suggests moving it to the SD card. SD?!? On a Kindle? The app should recognize that there's no SD slot available.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This is an excellent collection of Michael jackson works....I have another fabulous set to add to my collection...Love Michael Jackson
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Crappy animation that's why its is lame. But if you squint your eyes or don't wear your glasses you will not notice...
B005544V6A|5.0|My husband and I both like this show. Good chemisty between the main characters! I absolutley love Donna, she is a hoot. There are always good storylines and I  look forward to future seasons. I have completed this season and currently in the middle of season 2.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Action - Love - Story line. Original in every way. I think my initial impression was it is a transformers movie... but it is not. Totally worth renting or owning.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|a cute story line, and was interesting to see Kate in a supporting actrress role. But having her in that role supported the story line and it was really just a fairy tale ending so if you are in a bad mood or mad at the world. Watch this movie, it will make you feel better!
B002NEFL8W|5.0|It works since it was made for my camera. I like the added grip area and battery compartment. Easy install and easy to remove if you want.
B006LSZECO|1.0|yes, I am well aware this book was in the top 10, but I really struggled. My friend told me once you get thru ~ 30% of the book(kindle speak) it really picks up. First, I shouldnt have to read a 1/3 of any book to start and like it. Secondly, I thought the writing was less than average. I really just could not get into this book.
B00642ZOIG|4.0|Michael Crichton is as entertaining as ever with clever story lining and detail. However, one can detect the change in authors. Richard Preston has done well but the latter part of the story seems a bit 'hurried'.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the show - currently in the middle of this season. Like how they are flushing the characters out, a little at a time. Some good twists. I have season 3 dvr'd but dont want to start watching it until I finish 2!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I don't use this very often, but when I have it's been just the thing. It was free so I'm satisfied.
B00C4QVRAK|4.0|Not only is it a great movie, but having it in HD makes it better.  My only complaint is the price.  It could be a little cheaper since the movie is so old.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|This is one of the best stories I remember from childhood. At the time I had only seen the movie. The book requires a more mature audience, but it was wonderful to go back and read it when I became an adult.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I cannot stress how much I LOVE this movie.  It has been one of my 'go to' movies for years.  Memories of childhood abound.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|It's not a crowd pleaser so much but it is entertainging for scifi types in my opinion.  I enjoyed it very much, even if it does feel like half a movie.  In the end I felt I really needed to see the sequel in order to fully appreciate this one.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|My friend and I watched this movie on a whim because I was too lazy to go downstairs to get a DVD.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Not at all scary...just a bit gory in parts, but definitely enjoyable.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|It freezes and errors out CONSTANTLY on my Kindle.  So annoying.  Worked perfectly on my ipad. I hope OMGPOP gets it together.
B00821OX98|5.0|Was hesitant to watch at first...but am so glad I did!!<br /><br />Entertaining to the last episode...left me willing to get season 2 right away!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Always a good read. nothing to complain about here. Definitely a longer book, but worth the time and more. Recommended.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|a must have for heavy metal rockers, this album has a twinge of early Metallica and is a great buy and a great listen, I could listen to this album over and over
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It  needed a better ending.  At least there was more of a story.  Lots of sex.  The same as The others.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It's a good game for young and old alike... I think a lot of people will enjoy this game no matter what age they are... it's easy to use and gives you instructions along the way...
B00821OX98|5.0|loved this and was surprised how much I did. Not totally into SyiFi but this was about the people and resilience.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|LOVE THE CHARACTERS AND READ THE WHOLE SERIES. REPURCHASED ON KINDLE TO REREAD. IF YOU ANNE RICE, THESE READS ARE UP THERE WITH HER CLASSICS.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It's a great product serving all my knife sharpening needs in a smart & convenient way!! I may order for more of this product in the future.
B00932AA5G|3.0|It has a clever story line and is intense action in many parts. This is not a 'blow stuff up' action movie, but a real world take on action. It keeps you in suspense til the end. Would recommend watching once.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It's just a drama wrapped around Cruise's rather large persona that happens to take place in a distopia of the future. The worst part for me were the lame romances with women half his age who literally were limp dolls just there to romance Cruise and take their clothes off and swim in cool pools.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Of course Matthew McConaughey usually plays great roles. This movie is no exception. This is a good film to watch and is suspenseful until the end. I would recommend it.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Why Rodriguez didn't catch on in the 70's is hard to understand. Had he been more successful, we would have benefited from a much larger body of work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really good. I play this a lot and I like to play this often. I even played this<br />For 6 hours....,....AAAA
B00821OX98|4.0|I streamed this show from amazon Prime and<br />it played without any stutters. I did SD,not HD and it looked pretty good
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This fall me is fun it plays like the original card gag k me I use to play when I was a kid.
B004W1GCQO|3.0|Just has been ok a little over the top not as interesting as Downton Abbey but still its okay so far
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This game is so fun so cute. I would of never gotten it if it wasn't a free app of the day. Now I love it. Everyone should get it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show great acting well written continued enjoyment a must see a shame Crowley is leaving the cast but we still have Maggie Smith
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Seriously this album can compare to twilight of the thunder god everything on this album is amazing this is a very well produced album. My favorite tracks on the album is Father of the Wolf and Hel two really great songs. Just this whole album is really brutal really melodic its ur typical amon amarth that makes all u metal heads bang ur head and want to bash stuff
B00E5C3AJM|3.0|Sometimes it stalls suddenly while your carnival games. The thing I don't like most is that you can't always be on time to collect your job pay and it goes to waste. Still the cloths are neat and there are certainly plenty of options.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great book love how action packed it was. Rick Riordan has made another great book. Love it hope for more.
B00EFNXPFK|1.0|I don't know what all the good review are about, but 'Paradise Valley' (and Born & Raised, for that matter) are not JM that I once loved. Sure Paradise Valley would be a decent album from any old artist, but this is Mayer, and for Mayer it comes off as bland, lazy, commercial and just mediocre. JM is a great artist with the playing abilities on par with the greats- Hendrix, Clapton, SRV- and there's none of that here.<br /><br />Here's a test for you: Go listen to Continuum (or Try! or JMT or Any Given Thursday) and then listen to Paradise Valley. I bet you'll feel the same disappointment.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Watched with my family including my granddaughter.  Nice story.  Held our attention. I am a fan of Dustin Hoffman so that is what drew my attention to this story.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I bought this as a surprise for my husband. We both watched it every night before bed and were sad when it finished. We found out so much about the band that made us even more intrigued in their music. Great Buy!
1400052181|5.0|Prior to reading this book, I had never heard of Henrietta Lacks. After reading it, I am amazed and happy for the contributions she made towards the medical field. Without her cells, it is unknown if the advances that were made in medicine regarding certain vaccines and medications could have been developed. I learned so much from reading this book and know that this is information that I will use and encounter in the future. This book highlighted the difficulties that African Americans faced to receive medical care, which is a basic human need. This book stirs up so many emotions, but overall it was enlightening. I am happy that I bought this book. It was a very good purchase!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far I am enjoying the game I am able to play solo and I haven't had to &quot;buy&quot; anything.  It is a great time filler while playing other games
B001UGB1X8|1.0|I never did get to finish watching the movie, it kept 'locking' up on me while trying to view it.  Thus my review refers to the delivery, not to the content.
0812550706|5.0|One of the better books I have read for a while. A must read for sic-fi fans. Great buy! M
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|I cannot believe that people get away with writing stuff like this!! McKenna spends the entire book casting the most horrible light on the Catholic Church and that is her prerogative. That is her right. However, she casts every single Catholic character as lazy, drunk, dirty, devious or stupid. They neglect their homes, their children and themselves. She has them proclaim how the protestants are so much better, hard-working and good all around people. The stereotyping of her prejudice is disgusting. All of the priests and nuns are murderers, liars, abusers and not one single one of them is a positive character. While terrible things happened in many orphanages and laundry places, her biased depictions only serve to discredit her as someone who rights filled with hatred and prejudice. We should not tolerate prejudice of any kind. Do not reward this woman by paying her money in exchange for her hate.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|This book is well worth reading. It explains everything in simple terms that even I could understand.<br /><br />A certain amount of humour is also included, which makes it a good book to accompany one wherever.<br /><br />You don't need to be a scientist to be able to understand it.<br /><br />Neville Glynn
B009RH973I|5.0|This shell is light but very sturdy.  I can roll the back and stand the kindle up and it fits like a glove.  Very happy with it.
0743496728|5.0|This story has really made me feel that I now know much more about what it was like to be in the concentration ca,ps during WWII.<br />It was a book that is very hard to put down
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|awesome game hard to get the hang of but fun no&ntilde;etheless but it could be better but still fun easy to learn hard to beat always someone better than you plus its free you cant beat that
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|great game  tons of fun. lots of extras. play against live people. little buyables  are makes games more interesting.  download this
B005KDDUVS|5.0|This book starts quite innocent, then becomes increasingly dark and ends beautifully. Its wonderfully written, like ready poetry. I enjoyed every single sentence and it kept me captivated all along. Strongly, strongly recommended!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This show get better every season and this is the best.  Can not wait for season 4 to begin soon.

1400052181|5.0|I learned a lot about medical history in this country as well as the medical care given to African Americans. It is engrossing read.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I been fan of superman since i can remember, and i was very exited when the movie came to theaters. i really have good taste in movies and after i saw Man Of Steel i expected better. Critics where right there was lack of Sentiment, Laugh, and Plot, but the Amazing thing of this movie is that this movie is pack with action, Special effects out of this world's film industry that  even the Avengers would like to have in their next Movie, and the Soundtrack is terrific, Created by Hanz Zimmer. It Changes the whole movie, and you forget about everything else this movie lacked in. It's really worth watching it. (If you are the type of action kind of person) and ( Fan of SUPER MAN)
0060555661|5.0|This is a timeless classic that reads like a contemporary guide to investing.  The Intelligent Investor is not a detailed guide with metrics, numerous charts, and steps to approach investing.  Instead, it is more of a high level guide, with numerous examples but heavier on the concepts.  Extremely well-written, insightful, and packed with information for anyone interested in learning (or continuing to learn) about investing.  There are also some nice philosophical tidbits that can span beyond the markets. The Intelligent Investor deserves all of the accolades--it is truly a classic in the area of investing.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|All I can say is... WOW! Kaleb is definitely something else.. I tell ya, those Psy boys take sexy to a whole new level. Heart of Obsidian was so much more than I expected. It's hardly very often that I read books where I like the heroine, but in this book I really liked her. Sahara is a very strong, independent and loving character. She balances Kaleb. I admit, Kaleb was the last person I expected to have his own story, and now after reading it, only about 12 times.. Haaaaa, he so deserved it. they both did. I wish I had a Kaleb of my own. HIGHLY RECOMEND this book, as well as ALL of Singh's other Psy/Changeling novels. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE each and every one of them!!
630542828X|5.0|John Travolta and the supporting were great. Very well written, each actor made their character come to life. Based on a true event. the film really makes you think about this country's judicial system. Overall, this was an excellent movie!!!!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Need to get it. Love the factors of the game and how it is easy to us. U can always delete it if u don't love it as .much as I do. But u must try it....
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|REALLY fun to play, my kids love it. This is a game for all ages. Recommend for everyone. The graphics are wonderful.
B00BSW29OE|5.0|I liked it. It describes the pain, sorrow, and struggle that the Japanese in Hiroshima had to go through in order to survive.
B008133MDK|5.0|A great modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes series. Superb writing,acting and direction...edge of the seat thriller..brilliant visuals/cinematography..In short, superb entertainment
B00003IPFK|5.0|HAVE READ THE BOOK 3 TIMES AND HAVE PREVIOUSLY VIEWED THE TV MINI-SERIES.<br />IT WAS AS EXPECTED. THE PURCHASE TRANSACTION AND ITEM  DESCRIPTION WERE FINE.
B00499QUK2|5.0|A great modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes series. Superb writing,acting and direction...edge of the seat thriller..brilliant visuals/cinematography..In short, superb entertainment
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It's great to read a book that distills hundreds of sources into one package. The more we can learn about the historical person of Jesus, the better we can explore faith and spirituality in our lives. I might call this &#34;Karen Armstrong Light&#34; for those who appreciate historical view of Christianity and other religions.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was an OK movie. The trailer spoiled many of the movie's best moments. Didn't feel like a total waste of time, but I wouldn't rent it again.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|Schleich toys are all so well made and durable. This Tyrannosaurus Rex is no exception-- it is incredibly detailed and beautifully made and truly the BEST of all the Schleich dinosaurs.<br /><br />The figure is sized perfectly for kiddo hands and the quality is superb. My little one has been playing with this for weeks and not a single scratch. There are so many great details on this-- very helpful in guiding children in disussions about animals and the different parts to identify (ears, eyes, nose, tail, skin etc. are all detailed).<br /><br />Also-- the Schleich animals all stand solidly. No wobbles so little ones can play without frustration. The jaws open and close, which will add lot of fun to kiddo play. Fantastic, educational, and very fun toy!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Went from a 2.10 dual core to a 3 4  quad core Very happy lol my little brother may be getting a i5 but at least my CPU cost about 87 bucks lol. With the money he spent on it I can easily upgrade my power supply and graphics card<br />On my computer is rated as a 6.7  because of gaming graphics. My CPU is good and I am happy with my purchase.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I bought this when the follow-up sequel came out.  I wanted to see if it was as enjoyable as the sequel.  I was not disappointed.  Well worth the couple dollars I spent!
1612680011|5.0|This is the 1st book I read from Robert Kiyosaki.  Totally changed the way I think about money, time.  A must read for everyone looking to get of the rat race and a JOB to lead a more abundant lifestyle.
B00BTLOOAQ|4.0|Listen to the previews of each song. If you like the samples, you'll likely enjoy the album.  Like all art, music is very subjective, but I think Cecile McLorin Salvant has a great voice.  I encourage anyone reading to give her a try.
B00BTYP6QE|1.0|Why the duck would a paid app have ads in it for other apps I already own? Zero stars times infinity
B000FA5STS|5.0|Twists and turns abound. Read this great book-well worth you time. I didn't want it to end and wouldn't put it down til I finished it-
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|This 2CD set proves that Buddy Guy is by far, still the greatest bluesman alive. A must have Buddy Guy
B00499NHLC|5.0|I am a huge fan of both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. The plots are so well written and the dialogue is quite witty and clever. Can't wait to dive into the next season!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I'm giving this book a.do u out of five stars cause most of it was easy to guess but the big mouth opener is at the end. Plus this book is nothing like I thought it would be so very unique.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a great book. It is so good you never want to put it down. It is a great start to one of my favorite series. I would recommend this to everyone. I give this book five stars.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Since we got a Blu-ray machine AND a wireless cable box I have discovered the pleasure of catching up with missed segments of some of my favorite TV series. The quality of the streamed shows has been excellent. The fact that they are free with my PRIME membership is a bonus! Thanks, AMAZON!!
B003XQM2YU|5.0|A very fresh and exciting  look at a great English classic tale. Historically and culturally rich, this story flows well without tedious and pretentious attempts  to be another Robin Hood remake .If you like action, adventure and a little romance, you will surely like this. Veteran actors make the characters of this story come alive in a very believable and interesting way.<br />Great casting!
B0063GORYU|1.0|I ordinarily wouldn't mind an ad or two, but not poorly formatted full page ads on every deal with no way to close them without exiting the spider app.  Uninstalling this, thanks to the recent update.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|Was different than what I was expecting.  I like the writers style.  Will get more of his works.  Can't wait!
B003MXB4FC|4.0|This movie kills me.<br />Even at 40+ I find myself (and my kids, much younger) quoting lines.<br />It's a classic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|me and my niece loved the movie. so when I saw they had a game I just had to download it. its better then what I expected. we can play this game all day.
B00B7FOQCK|2.0|The product that I received looked nothing like the picture.  It came in a square USB hub and the cord is NOT detachable so you cannot switch to a longer cord.  The cord is very short.  When I use it on my PC it hangs in the middle of the desktop so I would need to put tape to hold the hub instead of leaving it hanging.  I then tried it on my Apple Mini and caused constant crash.<br />Useless.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was traveling a lot so I wanted a book to read on my iPad to not take space up. This is a light and funny read, if you like Tina feys sense of humor as in 30 rock, mean girls, etc. it's perfect for you. You'll understand her witty sarcasm and relive her goofy awkward childhood with her.
B008NNA6OG|5.0|One of the best dance movies of all time.  Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are exceptional and sometimes gravity-defying dancers.  I love to watch &#34;Make 'em Laugh&#34; and &#34;Singin' in the Rain&#34;.  The genius of Gene Kelly's choreography shines through in both numbers.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I, like many, grew up watching the MGM version and love it to this day, but the original story is absolutely worth reading to get an idea of what the story was really like.  I enjoyed noting the similarities and the differences between the two, and chalk it up to creative license.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|most addicting fun game ever made for kindle fire get it now you wont regret it! it is a good army game!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It's a good game it just needs more time and a bit more excitement. It's quite hard to play on the kindle though as the screens a bit small.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Had a hard time believing that 6 year old children think as the author depicted them.  But the story line was quite imaginative, and I look forward to the movie and how this story is told on the big screen.
B0089XH38M|3.0|I have been familiar with AVG from years ago on our desktop when Norton and Macafee were the only fee based antivirus around; however, my Kindle Fire has been acting sluggish lately and doing other other odd things, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Nothing has really changed.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Sorry!! I am the only person I know that disliked this book.  It may have been out of my box of the topics that I enjoy reading about.  I even watched the movie.  I didn't like it any better.  Give it a try and perhaps you will enjoy it as much as my friends have.  They still talk about it.
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|\\"It's the last of the V8s\\" on of the best car movies ever made, period. Post apocalypse Ausralia in a supercharged Ford
B007EDYN36|4.0|Enjoyed the book, but enjoyed the first half much more.  Peter holds a lot of anger and pain and really let's it out in the second half.  Can't really fault him as this is how he feels, but as always there are two sides to every story. Interesting insight into the band (from Peter's POV). Be interesting to read some of the other band members take on the events covered in Pete's book. Still recommended to KISS fans.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I Love One Direction! This book is amaZayn! I love this book. I think any directioner would love this book!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I'm a sucker for commentaries, so I was thrilled to see that there is a commentary for almost every episode (and two for Blackwater)! The show, of course, is fantastic. Beautifully acted, perfect costumes and SFX.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's really fun to play. Love that is easy to understand. My niece and nephews love playing on my kindle because of this f2f game
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I enjoy a challenge and this is a good one. I am not happy sometimes when it beats me , but then that is what lit is about right . Why so many words ?
B006S01GH2|1.0|French movies aren't all that good to begin with but  &#34;Amelie&#34; is one of the worst I've seen.  It tries to be original but ends up being ridiculous.  The characters look like creeps and the story is boring.  The French shouldn't  try so hard.  They should stick to simple, straightforward plots like &#34;Jean de Florette&#34; or the hilarious &#34;Bienvenue chez les Chtis&#34; and leave the complex stuff to American or German film makers.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I just saw this personal copy of Michael Jackson's Bad tour, and I loved it. The sound is so crisp and blows my home theater away, and the picture is unfortunately VHS quality. It is actually like watching a VHS, but regardless they capture the concert in great angles. My Playstation 3 is able though, to upscale the picture to look very clean. It is very up close, and you never get to see the stage from way up in the stadium or from the air like modern concerts, but you have to understand that this concerts were recorded basically for MJ's personal use, so it makes it extra special.
B002MFULQO|5.0|I admire Oliver Stone for making such a controversial movie.  I wish everyone in America (and abroad) would watch it.  After seeing it, there is no way anyone can believe in the &#34;lone gunman&#34; theory any longer.  Great acting by Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, and Joe Pesci who was absolutely outstanding.
B00DYWO09I|5.0|my son likes how you control the player and fight the enemies. He likes all the cool moves you can do.
B00A429YF6|5.0|I used to watch this frequently on Netflix until the rat bastards removed it.  So, now I have my own copy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  While it is for young people the story and the events described were very good.  My wife also enjoyed all three volumns very much.  My granddaughter is also looking forward to the coming movie.
B00785P2QC|3.0|cool game, the symbols are a little unclear as to what they do but u get used to it quickly
1609611543|4.0|Worth the read...it is very difficult to get wheat out of your body...but by process of elimination it can be done.  I am trying to do so, and I feel much better...have even given up beer...which I love, but contains wheat!

B005JTAP4S|5.0|'Peter: A Darkened Fairy-tale' by William O'Brien is a fascinating story that allows you to drift into a unique world, much more interesting than the one we live in. As you take this adventurous journey with Peter, a courageous and determined boy, you meet elves, dragons, ghosts, animals, a talking path, fairies and so many creatures and wonders, all of them with unique traits, some with dark ones too. Despite all the challenges and dangers, Peter goes ahead on his path to deliver golden flakes to fairies and to destroy the evil. This one hell of a ride inculcates in him valuable qualities (such as control of mind) and he emerges a true young hero, one you're bound to love. The amazing poems at the end of the story are an added bonus. I'll have to accept I loved them very much!<br />If you've enjoyed 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', you'll enjoy 'Peter: A Darkened Fairy-tale'. This journey will refresh your childhood memories. I'm waiting for the next adventure from the author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft, but I actually haven't been able to play it. Now that I can have  it on my kindle, I can access it anywhere and play. It is a really fun game, and although it isn't like the pc version yet, I know th  updates will come.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, worth every cent.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|facebook change my boredness now I'm on facebook 24/7 I give facebook a 5 star. rate on this nd this how I love facebook
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It is rare that you can get an account of the enemies view from the air war in world war two. This is not only an accurate account of the air war from a German ace, it goes much further describing their fears and feelings. It puts a face to a once faceless enemy. Highly recommended.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|twitter is to good sometimes it be tweaking but i love the people that following me. and the people that I'm following. this how I love twitter
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! I personally use pinterest to find new ideas and patterns for my crochet projects. The kindle app makes it extremely easy to categorize my pins and find them again when I want them.
B00124PXW8|5.0|If you have never seen this before, the opening seems an odd place for the movie but it sets everything up perfectly.<br />This is a classic horror possession movie from the EARLY 70's, so expect to be \\"scarred\\" differently than from today's horror movies. What is probably the most terrifying is how medical science and religion cannot explain or help the possession of a little girl. On top of that, a mother's desperation to understand and save her only daughter.<br />Whether you want to watch this movie for the horror, the possession or for the acting (without CGI) that accomplished some of its nostalgic scenes, it is a must see!
1781162646|4.0|OK, maybe the title of the review is a bit extreme.  It was a good story of a college student coming of age, an amusement park and murderer and a dying kid.  I was really enjoying the book til near the end when King had to go off on one of his irrational political rages.  Unrelated to anything else in the book,he veered off at a tangent and wrote about how angry he is that Dick Cheney has had his life prolonged a few years by means of a partially artificial heart.  It has no relevance to anything else in the story.  That he had to put it in just shows King to be as petty and vindictive as any of his crazed characters.  In my case, it cost him a star.  I read this story to be amused, not to hear an angry, bitter rant from someone whose success should leave him little to be angry and bitter about.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun and addicting great game to pass the time and make you think!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't know what else to say
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I found it very enjoyable.  It is an ideal game for a Kindle Fire.  I  like the way it shows moves.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|this book was a page turner, i read this book in a week i couldn't put it down i recomemd it
B0064W65UM|5.0|It's better than the movie I have to admit. This is my first graphic novel and I wasn't disappointed. Well worth the price too
0765324857|5.0|Get this book if your a fan of Bioshock 1 and 2.  It tells the story leading up to the events of Bioshock 1.  You will also get inside the head of Andrew Ryan the Genius/madman that created rapture.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent story.  It was a bit difficult to follow because of skipping forward or going backward with characters,  but  definitely worth staying with it to the end.
B003SI7OQ4|5.0|The family loved watching it and we plan to watch it again and again  Very special movie for families.  Thankful we heard about it.
B009CGKKXK|5.0|I love the 1st Jurassic park movie so I had to get this one too! Although nothing can top the first one, the second is still pretty good. Both movies are far better than the third in the series.
0425038912|5.0|I bought this book just after the paintings by John Schoenherr were published in Omni Magazine in 1980, but somehow I've lost it in the past 30 years.  A shame considering how rare it is today and that Frank Herbert said (paraphrasing here), \\"It's as if John Schoenherr actually went to Dune.\\" Amazingly beautiful but simple illustrations that plainly influenced both the David Lynch movie and the SciFi Channel's miniseries. It's the way I've always knew a sandworm was or what Stilgar looked like rising out of the rocks to Paul and Jessica.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Actually, this game monopolizes the worst fears and phobias that the \\"understand the shark\\" people on animal planet are trying to bury in the general public. Sharks attacking people for no reason. Pishaw! Untrue. They are hungry, or the diver looked like a seal to the shark...or it was provoked.<br /><br />Hungry Shark Evolution helps me to understand the true nature of sharks. It makes me want to cannibalize other sharks and kill scuba divers for no reason. The screams, oh yes the screams! Mwa ha ha! Swimmers and beachcombers trying desperately not to fall into the gaping maw of my killer shark. I'm hoping to run into a few playful dolphins in later evolution (I'm a tiger shark at the moment, and will graduate to the great-white next). The only downside I've noticed is that it takes a quite a lot of gameplay after you've reached maximum sharkitude (full grown shark), to make the coin to graduate to the next level of sharkdom. My shark was fully grown by the time I reached about 10,000 coins, and I need 35,000<br /><br />(cue Jaws theme)
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I was charmed and delighted and scared.  Well written and well plotted -- but I think I'll have to take a small break before facing Hollow City!
B00C2IGQBA|4.0|One of my favorite movies from the 90s. The steelbook edition isn't anything special and the cover may rust over time so it is just a personal preference.
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|What do you expect? It is Intel! I bought this to build a small lab that would allow me to run Windows 8 with Hyper-V and my lab is running great! I have one Windows 2012 Server, one Ubuntu Server, one Ubuntu desktop, and one CentOS server running in my lab and still able to do a lot of PowerShell and other scripting from my Windows 8 box to the virtuals.
B005CA4SQK|4.0|One of the best shows on amc next to breaking bad. season one has only a couple of episodes so not sure if it worth it on bluray full retail
B00BMQDM10|2.0|This book veres from the Sophie kinsella fare to Madeline Wickham. It was a bit too much smut and too little romantic comedy
B005TBN3EU|4.0|Product came as advertised at a great price. I would still wait till Black Friday to purchase this product. Shipping was great as always.
159463176X|3.0|Too many gratuitous bad things happen to too many superfluous characters, simply for the sake of eliciting an emotional reaction from the reader.
B002M9WW30|4.0|the collection came in good condition and at a great price on black friday. as for the movie restoration these films were too old and dont look like blu ray quality except for rocky balboa.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|As an active college student with a tight budget I am always looking for ways to stay healthy while keeping as much money in my wallet as possible. Bigger, Leaner, Stronger doesn't suggest that you spend tons of money on equipment, supplements, etc. It does suggest that you discipline yourself unlike ever before to achieve the body you desire. Dudes, this book is awesome and the author is inspirational.<br /><br />My dad read this book a few months ago and is currently following Mike's routine. When dad recommended this book and explained it to me I was curious and immediately bought the inexpensive kindle version. After finishing the book in a couple of days I had a sense of motivation that I haven't had for a couple of years (for the first time ever I could actually see myself getting this done). It was a little bit stressful at first figuring how to balance out everything for my diet, supplementation, and lifting schedule) but when I got that out of the way I actually felt a huge sense of relief knowing that everything was planned out almost perfectly. I am currently on day 2 of training, so while this review may be premature I am looking forward to my new lifestyle!<br /><br />Only four stars because I have just started. I am going to leave another review in a couple of months (can't come fast enough).<br /><br />Mr. Matthews encourages his readers to email him with questions, and he responds quickly!<br /><br />Here is the link to his blog: [...]
B002UD56I6|4.0|i bought this for $5 during black friday and it was a deal.  this is more like a documentary rather than a movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore has a crisp design, fast sync feature, and the best options out there, and I can access my notes offline on my Kindle and PC.
B007N3206E|5.0|great movie on blu ray. not sure if i would use the dvd version of this movie but it comes with this package.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very high quality.  Very challenging.  The story line is a little demented, but I really enjoyed this game.  Great graphics.
B00C2IN7CG|4.0|I bought the other Batman steelbook and it is nothing special just a hard case.  Great movie and remastered...it brings back so many memories from the 90s haha.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I chose this version of the game due to other users ratings and I was not disappointed.  Very addictive and fun to play.
B00319ECGU|4.0|Great black friday deal. the movie quality is ok but the films are old so i would say 7/10 as fas an upgrade from dvd to bluray.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|A Denzel Washington movie is always a pleasure to watch: Until I sat through to the end of \\"Flight\\".<br /><br />Here, the director, Robert Zemeckis puts together a great cast, and anti-hero in Denzel's character. You love him but want to close your ears and eyes at his shenanigans and seedy character.<br /><br />In what should be the climax, despite his inebriated state, Denzel manages to save all the passengers and most of the crew on his disabled jetliner.<br /><br />The legal maneuvers that follow make it clear that Denzel, the airline pilot, is a pathological liar supporting his secret habit of sex, drugs, divorced wife and son, and more sex and drugs.<br /><br />Yet, when he is called upon to denigrate the character of the deceased stewardess, he does the honorable thing and \\"falls on his sword\\".<br /><br />We are supposed to buy this ridiculous turn of truth-telling as his redemption from his drug habit, and lying ways. Of course, in the process he loses his job goes to prison and thereby ends the free lunch that his salary provided to his ex-spouse and child.<br /><br />Pity. The end is so utterly an illogical discontinuity of Denzel's character. It is a great piece of acting nevertheless by all involved.<br /><br />Wish you had stayed around to see it through Zemeckis. You ruined a perfectly good film for me.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I enjoy the character development and the relationships between characters on this show. I've always been a fan of Juliana Marguiles, and I haven't been let down on this show, either!
B001UDYI9K|4.0|The opening &#34;Golden Key&#34; and the next several songs are dynamite. some of the others (Train to Wuxi) are duds.<br />Worth the price for the good songs, especially if you are a die-hard APP fan!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The whole series draws the reader deeper and deeper into the fantasy world of the character and the issues that direct and control their lives. It's very easy to melt into the players and their individual personalities and how they develop. There's something with which to identify in all of them.
B00006JIA4|5.0|bought the right cd this time.enjoy it in the car bought it for the song&#34;I'm going slightly mad.&#34;<br />Fast service cd in good shape.no problems
B00127RAJY|5.0|So I was completely unsure about Jillian and this whole system. Not to mention I had never excersised for more than a week in my life.. I tried it on YouTube first and liked it, so bought the dvd. It works, it's simple, I'm sweaty. Definitely encourage people to get it!
B005LJK3AC|1.0|This movie is awful, I didn't even finish watching it.  It's narrated (incredibly annoying in a movie) and the extent of it's 'comedy' is apparently vulgar language.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|An enjoyable read with some good twists but moved a little slowly. Overall it's a decent story and one can't help wanting to know a bit more about Jack Reacher.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|do not waste your time with this. nothing but crap !!!!! bring back old weather channel.  who ever was behind this crap should be fired !!!!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love this cd. I have it on repeat on my ipod because it relaxes me so much. I love all of Josh Groban's music. No complaints.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is the first time I have ever completed this type of puzzle and I find them to be quite interesting.  I have just finished doing the 5x5 and am looking forward to starting the larger size puzzle where I know they will be more challenging. Will most definitely buy more of these.
B00B7FYJ9U|5.0|freaking loved it wish there was more. eventhough im a superman fan. haha he is my second favorite. superman baby.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I waited a long time to read this book. It was a very easy read and it didn't take long at all to get caught up in the story. Impossible to put down, I finished in just two sittings. Great action, characters you can identify with, heroes and villains. All the right ingredients. I recommend highly. Time to read the next one!
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|This game was great! Instead of using money, I could just use the Amazon coins. It makes you feel like you are actually a real doctor! I loved this game, I hope you do too. Thank you for using my review to decide. Bye  :)
0142421715|5.0|\\"Middle\\" books often fall short, but I find this book surpassed the first. The first felt so cookie cutter and familiar in many ways, but this book shed that mold and formula feel and took it's own beautiful, interesting shape. It was a book that stood alone and was new. I also loved the novelty of the story being told from Ky and Cassia (spoiler alert?). I couldn't put it down and if you were so-so on the first, give it a go.
B009JBZH54|5.0|There's a serious lack of Michael Keaton in these movies, but otherwise they are fantastic examples of comic book cinematic brilliance.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this album.  Adele is a very talented young singer and writer.  She has an excellent voice.  Some of her songs are very reflective of her own heartbreak and it gives those of us who have also experienced heartbreak to do the same.  For me it was a healing process that has enabled me to move on. That's her message.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Finally, after looking all over for months, I have found the perfect calendar app. Calengoo has everything I need for a calendar. I definitely recommend it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|watch it, you will not regret it. well done George Martin and those that made the show what it is
B002C6A6N6|5.0|If you're looking for a family friendly tv series this is it! Each episode share great values and are very entertaining stories.
034580404X|5.0|I really love these books, I could not put them down. I look forward to finding more books like this.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Enjoyed watching it from start to end...very intriguing...actually prompted my fourteen year old daughter to get more background information surrounding the events.
B00C49H3WI|5.0|Seriously the best written and acted show I have ever seen. I won't say much because of spoiling the series. But I can say that Maslany deserves a emmy nod for her performance in Orphan black. playing one character is stressful enough for many actors but maslany is able to juggle several....sometimes even in the same scene...not only is that a cinematic feat but also a acting feat as well. each of her characters not only have different styles but also different mannerisms, world views, and even a hint of different voice pitch...for instance sarah- has a lower more edgy tone....while cosima has more of a lighter relaxed tone. it's unbelievable how she keeps each character in line....going as far as one character acting as another....it's believable to the point where at first i wondered if they hired twins to play the characters and gave them each a character that fit them best....it's astounding to think it is one actress...jaw dropping, on the edge of your seat awesomness all the way through. falling in love with characters has never been so exciting and fun. 5 stars for maslanys performance itself....i highly recommend. although some slight nudity scenes so keep away from children, but should be okay for teens i mean...come on?.....they know how to work the internet. seriously.
B004EF65QA|5.0|It is so beautifully done and it shows the historical issues of the industrial age.  The acting by all is superb.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because it is a fast reaction game and when you start it is hard to stop playing it is that fun
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode. The show is well casted and it has a storyline that keeps you guessing. I highly recommend it!
B000006UD8|5.0|I got this item because i love clasic rock, for example i have the beatles colleccion, and like collect several cds about that. i dont like buy cds as &#34;the best of (band´s name&#34;. Because there are a lot of great bands and it would be a lack of respect buying that kind of cds.<br />I remember having read &#34;machine Head&#34; was the best work of purple, and i didnt make a mistake . I think that band´s stage was the better. so you could read several reviews about familiar rock bands as metallica talking about that band , especially that album. so I think i did a great buy and i am so glad to get this album, so i would like to recommend everything like the good rock buying this work, due to it is fantastic
B009P5S11G|5.0|I bought the CD for three songs. It's a pretty good CD, definitely will get alot of use out of it
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Nice story, could have used cabins guests to thicken the plot some, ending was a bit short and simple. But characters were believable and I hope will lend their stories to the rest of the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and challenging. I really like how it feels like your grapes in the room and your trying to find a way out.
B002LFVE4I|3.0|The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't make better use of the inspector and actually solve the case.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Solid album. Varied tempos and dynamics. The Queensryche sound. Todd LaTorre sounds enough like Geoff Tate but not too much (and some Fates Warning singer a litle bit) and not tired like GT. Fresh but not for the sake of it... and classic at the same time. ...and Blows Geoff Tate's QR release out of the water. The Casual to extreme Queensryche fan should buy this.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|lots of action to at least keep your attention but the dialog and story line feels like it was written by a couple of people sitting around scribbling ideas while drinking...
0802473156|5.0|Learning the Five Love Languages really helped my marriage.  We learned by taking a test what really says, \\"I Love You\\" to each other.  For instance, I don't really care about gifts, but get me a cup of hot tea, THEN I know you love me.  Reading this book has helped my husband and I to discover MORE about what \\"makes each other tick\\"!!  Could've avoided a lot of misunderstandings had we read it earlier in our marriage.
B006S086AM|4.0|This  was a pretty fun film to watch.  Kristin Stewart was pretty decent in this one, as were the rest of the cast.  Pretty decent storyline and a good cast - good movie to watch on a rainy weekend day.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Hollywood, got it right, one of the most thrilling stories about super hero's done yet. Not too much back story as they usually do, and humor to boot. bad guy &#34; I have an army&#34; , good guy &#34;We have a Hulk&#34;.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a great game ,nice way to pass time I like the extra suits rather then the four..More fun than the standerd solitaire.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|This is one of my often watched movies and having it on line lets me easily watch it on any of my devices.  A good deal all around.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|The ending surprised me - won't give it away. Odd to watch the series and this book at the same time, they are the same but different in many many ways. Listened to a clip of the Audible version of these books - narrator is all wrong, sounds too old!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I should have purchased the french edition for then I would have an excuse for not reading it.  With the press of other duties and diversions I, sadly, only look at the kindle app and feel an enervating guilt that I don't find anything of interest in this alleged masterpiece.  I have no interest in the movie or the stage adaptations and now, little interest in the original.
B0000700KQ|5.0|This is not everyone's cup of tea by any means, but I have watched Mulholland Drive about a dozen times and will watch it many more. I think it is not only David Lynch's supreme achievement but a truly great movie that puts him in the ranks with Welles, Cocteau and Murnau. As Roger Ebert explains in his review, the picture defies explanation but reveals itself a bit more with every viewing. Like Once Upon a Time in America, it presents a what-happened puzzle that may have no answer.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|she had the most amazing voice, she was a huge part of my youth and I have her vinyl but no player!
B008O037RG|5.0|I was a little worried this album wouldn't live up to their first but it is one of the best albums i've heard. Every song on this album is fantastic. If you like M&S i would highly recommend it.
1423136802|5.0|He read the first volume (a well-work, old second-hand copy) three times while waiting for this gift set. He is now on volume four and enjoying each just as much as he did the first. Surprisingly, it also has sparked his interest in Greek and Roman mythology!
B0010Z32OA|4.0|We enjoy fantasy movies as a family. I love all of the actors and actresses on this film and was excited. The first thing our eleven yr  old son said when the movie ended was \\"it was okay, but it could have been funnier.\\". It's a cute story acted out well, but if you are expecting the comedy of say The Princes Bride or Time Bandits than you may be disappointed a bit.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the graphics and I love the idea of how this game is based on horses. I love it my daughter loves it and I think it's a great game.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Good app. It is easy to use, has the quick search option, make high definition video downloads and standard quality.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|A fantastically written story! Definitely a page turner :) i would put it in the same catogory at the Shawshank redemption movie. Not the sort of book that I would normally read as I'm more of a chick lit kind of reader but after reading this one I'd 100% pick up another Grisham book :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Setup was easy and took less than 5 minutes.  Despite it's looks it still allows room for other hdmi connections.  I had a couple buffering moments but it wasn't on a major site like netflix or hulu and I am in the country with a 3 meg DSL connection.  All said and done this is easily worth $35
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is brilliant and if you have got temple run 1 or 2 it's a bit like that. So it's a great game for kids
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love the diverse, forward thinking, and creative talks.  I have enjoyed viewing subjects that I might have never thought about before Ted Talks were introduced to me by Oprah Magazine.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush I think it is better than temple run. I also love the movie despicable me so this just sums it up
B008JFUO36|5.0|GOOD MOVIE, LOTS OF ACTION (DEFINATE GUY FLICK), PLENTY OF GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS AND BODY PARTS FLYING.<br />GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND FAIR CAST.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|Since I got this CD, I just listen to it over and over. Hope they get back together in the near future.
B008S80OU2|5.0|This us what I was looking for, as a big BOC fan this is it , I didn't have to by them all separate. Sound quality is good and I liked the album cover sleeves good extra.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I enjoy the game. The similarity to Tetrus is good. The visuals are great. I especially like the Zen mode.
B003UESJH4|5.0|High rating is for the 5-star movie; received promptly and in excellent condition. A powerful story, proibably mostly accurate, Academy-Award Winner. Received prompt;y and in excellent condition.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's a cool game but there are annoying controls.I like how it's designed and the missions are somewhat hard<br /><br />.
B00782O7IY|5.0|High rating is for the &#34;Best Picture&#34; winner; Received promptly and in fine condition. A charming story about transitioning from the silents to the sounds in film.
B00C90T4QK|3.0|Buble has a silky smooth voice and easy going manner to draw a diverse audience.  This album follows in the same footsteps as his previous releases; mostly covers with just a handful of original material.  It's odd since it is the original material that has provided his biggest chart success.  I hope he and his record company will have the confidence to increase the amount of original songs on his future albums.  My only concern is he falls victim to being overly confident and records only the songs he writes or cowrites.  Hopefully he'll learn from his peers (Josh Groban is a perfect example) and not make the same mistake.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I was super excited to have pintrest on my kindle... unfortunately it makes me &quot; force close&quot; every time I try to pin something... very frustrating! I have deleted the app and re downloaded multiple times and it still doesn't work properly :( I wish this issue would be fixed!
B00932A4XE|3.0|not really funny.. just ok. If anyone is pregnant, they'll appreciate this movie a bit more than any one else.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Love it so far - f irst four. Episodes. Richardson is superb. Glad we haven 't  got to this stage in our politics YET !
031603438X|5.0|I couldn't put this one down. A great read for folks who like the Stones. I really don't know what Mick was so upset about.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Could play for hours the best game of my day.....senior......have told many to try and we are having  contest of who can get out the room first. Lol all the time with n at each other about who will be in a room the longest....
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|This book is written well enough that even though I haven't yet read the first book I could follow along with the story line and not get lost! Its a wonderful story involving a young woman who, with her friends go on a wonderful adventure to banish Ala from their realm. I loved the story line and reading about the history getting a glimpse into some of the native culture. A very well written book by a fantastic author! A must read for all fantasy fans!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was a very intriguing book that would've been just as goof a read whether or not you read Enders game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked this game. wish there were more levels to keep going with. so levels were challenging and took some real thinking to get past them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This novel is the best yet of its kind! Hard to put down and puts your imagination to work! I highly suggest this series.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Loving this game takes me back to younger days! Getting to show my kids what we used to play and playing the same with them is a blast thank you
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a great season! I truly enjoyed every minute of this show and can't wait for season 4! Loved it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love tempel run i think its one of the best games to play. I love to play it . I could play it all day
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from it's obvious prospective to the obscure references to some of the vid games of the 80's and pop culture I grew up (well maybe not grew up) in.<br />Lot's of fun.  If you remember Pong and Atari and any of those classic arcade games like Centipede and Asteroids, you MUST read this book.
034580404X|1.0|This book was a total waste of time. I wanted to read this because of all the hype about it. So I did. The character is annoying & naïve. I realize she is supposed to be, but the author goes too far. I came to the conclusion the author must be very young, but when I looked her up she is in her 50's.  Really? Throughout the whole book, her inner self is ridiculous. Her comments are even more annoying than the main character. I found the sex scenes repetitive & mediocre @ best. Boring. The male character is described over & over again as \\"wearing nothing except his white shirt & those sexy jeans\\" what else could he wear, shoes & socks? This book is for teenage mentality. So much for being described as \\"Mommy Porn\\". This mommy should have burned it after page 1.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|these women can really sing, I especially bought it for a granddaughter in choir and loves the song You Raised Me Up .  the way these women sing it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was such a good book. One of those books where you just can't put it down. Needless to say you can read the whole thing in like 3 hours if you're really into it. Do NOT read if you've already went to see the movie, it just ruins it. The books are ALWAYS better!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Such a wonderful author!  This was very good - not as good as The Kiterunner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, but definitely worth the read!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were a very good read! After reading the first one I just couldn't stop. I read this whole thing in a matter of 12 hours! Must Read!
B00006I53S|5.0|Bougth it here on Amazon as used Lens. The Autofocus works great! And the sharpnes is just perfect!<br />I really recommend that lens.
B005PMNBNG|3.0|This double album by French electronic band M83 (mostly the work of Anthony Gonzalez) could fit on a single disc, but it's broken into halves...and basically, that sums up my feelings toward it.  \\"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming\\" wants to be bigger and bolder than it really is.  Gonzalez has gone on record saying that The Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" was a major influence on this album, but there's definitely more flash than actual substance here.  Way too many tracks are short, noodling instrumentals, which play fine on the first several listens but don't earn their keep in the long run.<br /><br />Obviously attention-grabbing anthems like \\"Midnight City\\" are easy standouts, as are tracks like \\"Claudia Lewis\\" and \\"Steve McQueen\\".  \\"Reunion\\" is another choice cut and, aside from a corny female voiceover halfway through, easily feels like one of the best moments on an album that occasionally surprises.  But, like the majority of double albums, only about half of this material needs to be here, and even moreso since this whole production could've been packed onto a single CD.  But those who enjoyed albums like \\"Saturdays = Youth\\" should enjoy most of what's on here, and there's still enough interesting stuff here to make it worth a purchase.  I'd advise most new fans to preview it first, and don't expect 22 tracks on the level of \\"Midnight City\\".
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A very amusing story written from the perspective of an &#34;aspie&#34;.  Nice and light to read, but thought provoking for anyone who suspects a friend may have  asbergers syndrome.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I lived this book and hated to find that I was on the last page. You know a book is great when you think about the characters during and after you have read it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Very  suspenseful.a very good read. Keeps you on your toes. It's the first book of Connelly's I have read and I enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We wanted to catch up; we watched the summary and the episodes, it was fun even though we'd watched the season.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is a fun game, easy to play and just the right options so you play it just like a real deck. Just without the shuffling.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I own this in hardcover and kindle edition if that suggests anything.<br /><br />You can get a synopsis elsewhere; the point of my review is to point out that this is a great series that I have read several times because it's just that good.  Seriously, you need to click on the &#34;SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY&#34; button right now.  You will not regret this purchase.<br /><br />There is one thing that I should point out though about this series.  It may cause you to rethink your religions beliefs if you have any.  This is a good thing.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|How a tough cop turns bad. He doesn't start bad but ends badly. Not really a critic but enjoyed watching this season in sequence on Amazon Prime. -And no commercials; doesn't get better.
B004IDYK0G|5.0|I LOVE The Script!! This CD is awesome, through and through. I am planning to get the other 2 CDs also!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you love challenging mind games, then this app will blow your mind! One of the best I have ever seen.  Hours of mind boggling fun!
B009ZQFSRA|5.0|Wilde said...&#34;life imitates art...&#34; this is particularly true of this film.  In spite of it being science fiction it is a poignant reminder of what happens to a society when we allow demigods to force thoughts, beliefs and behavior ...  all in their insatiable quest for power. In the end the answer must always be the same... a single point of light becomes a blinding torch for justice.<br /><br />Also the actors in the film deliver colorful, vivid, unforgettable characters in an otherwise drab setting.  Great entertainment!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My son  never seen them before. So he watched all 8 in a week. He is 9 so thank you.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|An amazing cast of talented actors who know how to bring comic book characters to life without taking themselves too seriously.  An interesting plot that actually spans several contemporary films about the same characters. Tons of opportunity for sequels  without sacrificing the enjoyment and completeness to this offering.  Excellent special effects and sound.  I actually bought this one in 3d.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The crossfire series is do much better than 50 shades! Excellent story line! Love it! Can't wait for the next one!
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Loved the costuming but overall it was so so. Seemed like some of the pages were missing from the scripts, but maybe Seas 2 will be better..?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best app ever!!!!!!!!!! I'd pay for this app. If you like horses get this app. NOW!!!!!!! !<br />Get this app NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW!!!!!!!
B004GTKP3S|5.0|What can I say about a program that is written so well, acted by some of the FINEST British actresses (and actors!) - it is a trip back in time with a sly sense of humor and some cheeky good fun. I wish there were more of it...it's addictive!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|My daughter has watched this movie every single day since we got it. Delivery was on time, product was on the money, no issues at all and the price was great! Thanks so much!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! it is so addicting and fun! I have minion maddness for sure and this game doesn't help my addiction any!
0517548232|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and have only just gotten around to rating it. I recommend this for anybody who wants to understand economics from a libertarian sort of perspective.
B0044RFT8S|4.0|Great condition and arrived quickly but the bottom part of the case where it closes is busted, therefore only the top part can close.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I never actually received this CD because I accidentally had it mailed to my neighbor's house instead of mine. I decided to let them keep it because good music needs to be spread around. I love it.
B00AEFYX4U|3.0|Great Condition, looks like I bought new, but there is no digital copy disc.  It looks weird with only one disc in it and an empty spot where a disc should be.
0345803485|2.0|Book was dog-eared & very roughly used. It looked like 30 other people had read the book before me!<br />Disappointed
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|More of the Coen brothers film making genius.  The Dude abides, what more can I say?  Another white Russian anyone?
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|this is great app definitely fun to play we you bored or don't have anything too do fun for adults and kids
B009PMEEY2|5.0|a great job of keeping me up at work on the night shift...used to play this on a large computer screen but the small screen worked just as well
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Looks promising for the price and many friends have talked only well about it. Lets you connect your laptop, ipad, etc.. screen to the tv screen anywhere there is internet
B008KYOCA2|5.0|as calendars go this help get the job done would recommend it to others that need a simple unit to use
B008HK3XOU|4.0|This case does it job well. It fits properly, protects the Kindle and is easy to find in a bag. It only misses five stars because it is rather plain.

B00COCY67A|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet - this is one of the best things I have ever purchased.  I suggest listening to it with the volume cranked up, and this music just seeps into your soul. Any true Elvis fan will be elated, and it will make new fans out of those who haven't experienced Elvis' magnetism and charisma yet.  Elvis + Stax = I've Got a Feelin' in My Body.<br /><br />BUY IT.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|liked the movie anything with morgan freeman and tom cruise has to be great and it does. with the digital copy i can watch it any time on my computer
030758836X|5.0|I read this book a good while ago. Meant to give it a review but forgot. Did not forget the book, however, and scenes come back to me unexpectedly. That, to me, is a sign of a good book.  Vivid, vibrant, highly entertaining.
B001J29H9I|4.0|The tunes all sound a little bit the same, but they are all excellent. Mix it up in a playlist and they will all be hits.
B004J713JW|5.0|I searched all over for a recent Billy Joel live concert on blu-ray and this one did not disappoint.<br />Contrary to other commens, I found the sound and picture quality very good.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|My only complaint is that this movie should've been 10 hours longer.  I could not get enough of this story.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Great movie. Popcorn in one hand. Kleenex in the other.  Very entertaining.  Probably wont go to an Oceanside resort for awhile though
0399255370|5.0|A brilliant point of view, from the crayons as they each explain why they quit! It encouraged my son to write his own story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging just wish the free version had more than 10 floors. Would recommend this game . Fun finding all the hidden objects.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This app takes ages to update and even when they had the kindle will not receive it and they charge a lot of money
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book, in general, had a nice even amount of suspense. I'd have preferred more detail about the murder investigation and less vulgarity, but the vulgarity also made the boom feel more rough and genuine. I also have th  pleasure of knowing  a contributor, Lt Emmet Helrich, a fine policeman. -KS
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was an interesting book and kept my attention.  Did not like the ending.  Parts of it were completely different that what I expected which is what I enjoyed most about this book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's hard to write good fantasy.  No offence, but often times a story is hindered by cliche names, unimaginative supernatural twists, or simply focuses on very petty human needs.<br /><br />Yeah, Game of Thrones does none of the above.  The atmosphere is deliberate, the mind and strategy games played out between characters is remarkable, and his use of the magical is so light and careful that it builds all the suspense and ADDS to the plot...not the coolness factor.<br /><br />Yay Game of Thrones.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|I had a hard time reading this book for several reasons. The following rules kept swirling in my head, rules that Hemingway obviously didn't care for.<br /><br />Hook the reader with the first line.<br /><br />\\"Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton.\\"<br /><br />What do you think? Were you hooked? I wasn't. What kept me reading was that it was written by Hemingway.<br />Don't introduce too many characters too quickly.<br />There were so many characters introduced at the beginning and with little or no distinguishing characteristics I kept getting them confused. I had to reread passages just to get them straight in my head. My view of many of the male characters was fuzzy at best. Wait, which guy is Brett? Oh that's right, Brett is a female, Lady Brett. Well, then who is Lady Ashley? Oh, Lady Brett Ashley. After my initial confusion she became quite clear in my head, though, which leads me to the next rule.<br /><br />Create characters that are likeable, characters that readers will root for (or at least one, please).<br /><br />Yeah, I know we don't have to like all the characters in a book. The antagonist is one we love to hate but you need at least one character to root for and I tried. I really tried but I found them all to be self-absorbed. The friendships, if you can call them that, were superficial, even two-faced. I hoped for some wonderful character arc, at least for the main character, Jake Barnes, but by the end of the book I was left disappointed.<br />Brett was, for lack of a better word, a \\"ho.\\" She claimed to love Jake but flaunted her relationships with other men in his face, even enlisting his help in \\"hooking up\\" with a bullfighter. She was incredibly vain, and used the poor schmucks around her to feed her own vanity. They were fawning all over her when they should've kicked her to the curb. What was Hemingway saying about the male population? As long as a woman is beautiful and \\"built like the hull of a boat\\" (Hemingway¡¦swords, not mine), then she could be utterly despicable. They'd keep following on her heels like a lovesick puppy.<br /><br />Set the right pace to keep the readers engaged in the story.<br /><br />My mind kept wandering. Was this book ever going to go anywhere? There were points where I lost myself in the story because I was expecting something. I started to get interested around page 112. I remember, because I took note of the page and thought, \\"Here we go. This is where it's going to get good.\\"<br /><br />At this point in the book Jake is going fishing with a buddy and that's all that really happens. Have you ever been<br />fishing? It can be thrilling if the fish are biting or excruciatingly mundane if they aren't. Cast. Wait. Wait some more. Reel it in. Repeat. I might find it relaxing if it weren't for the anticipation of catching a big fish, any fish really. You might start drinking to fight the boredom. And that's precisely what the characters did. They drank...A LOT. Maybe they were bored, too? I imagined them saying, \\"Hemingway, I say ol' chap, give us something interesting to do!\\"<br /><br />So Hemingway broke a few rules, but I suppose he accomplished what he set out to do and that is worth some praise. The theme of the story is the destructive nature of war, and not just that which can be seen by war-torn cities and lost lives but the emotional effects on those that survive. It wasn't meant to be a \\"feel good\\" story. War is often romanticized, portrayed as the ultimate display of masculinity with acts of heroism and bravery. But Hemingway's story reveals it as a lie as he shows that war is emasculating in more ways than one.<br /><br />It's a story about the Lost Generation; those poor souls left to pick up the pieces of a broken life after World<br />War I. Trust, honor, decency, and morality have all been upended. Their aimless wanderings, superficial relationships, and propensity to drink to excess speak volumes about the effects of war. When you'vebeen through something so horrendous how do you find meaning in anything?<br /><br />The following quotes hinted that the characters were aware of the lack of purpose in their lives and left me hopeful for some bright spot at the ending.<br /><br />\\"Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you're not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you've lived nearly half the time you have to live already?\\"<br /><br />\\"Perhaps as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.\\"<br /><br />Maybe Brett would change her ways or Jake would have a Rhett Butler moment and tell Brett where to go. While the ending dialogue is in the context of the relationship between Brett and Jake it hints at a broader range: humanity. The acceptance of the things as they are left me feeling utterly hopeless and I guess that's why it didn't appeal to me. I believe there is always hope.<br /><br />I've been reading the Modern Library's Top 100 Novels to see what I can learn from the masters of literature and this one was on the list. So what did I learn from reading this book?<br /><br />X The masters broke the rules and still managed to create art that is highly praised.<br />X I'm no Hemingway so I should probably stick to the rules if I don't want readers to toss my book after the first sentence.<br />X No matter how well written a book is, not everyone is going to love it.<br />X You can appreciate the literary merits of a book and still not like the story.<br />X I'll probably never drink absinthe. Apparently it tastes like black licorice which is at the top of my list of the most disgusting things I've ever tasted.<br /><br />3 out of 5 stars. Although I liked parts of the book and can appreciate the message I believe Hemingway was trying to convey, it was just okay.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|I was looking for a methodology to bring business ideas into reality, this book is helping me to do it in an ordered and fun way.
1400052181|5.0|What a challenging read.  There were some technical parts that I had to reread but the telling of the biography, the background on her descendants, the medical ethics issues raised, and the history of the medical achievements from then till now kept me focused throughout the book.  It wasn't till after I read it that the Supreme Court came down with its ruling on patenting genes.  So the timing of my reading it couldn't have been better.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This was almost as good as the book which is something I have never said about a movie.  I have seen several different versions of this story, which is one of my favorites and this version was by far the best I have seen!  Nicely done for an ok price.

B000002KHH|5.0|really, what could anyone say that hasnt been said thousands of times before? this is heavy metal 101, literally. this album has stood the test of time and then some, not to mention turning out generation after generation of metalheads. the riff to \\"electric funeral\\" is devilish in itself, while the eerily soothing \\"planet caravan\\" belies the meaning of the lyrics. a musical festival is going on here. if you have never heard these tunes before (hard to imagine that) do yourself a big favor.....start right here.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved this book. It is a nice short read and puts a historical context of Tesla and his inventions that is highly interesting.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|i have a kindle fire and needed office products to open documents and whatnot, this app is great, you can even type and edit things and email from it, i love it!
B005LAII4E|3.0|First part was better...<br /><br />or maybe I watched it on DVD as opposed to Blueray. Bruce Willis is awesome in his 5 mins role. Miss him in a full blown action movie.<br /><br />Rock wasn't impressive. This could've been the best role he ever got.<br /><br />Great action scenes (which is why I saw it really)
1594481717|5.0|excellent book, needed it for school, was way cheaper on here than from my school's bookstore. highly recommend this book!
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I love Monsters, Inc.  One of the best animated movies out there.  But I have to complain about the Amazon HD version I downloaded to my Kindle.  It's missing the outtakes, which have some of my favorite scenes in them.  I wouldn't have minded not having them, IF I hadn't paid so much for it!  Why can't they be included in the downloaded version?  I'm REALLY disappointed.  $19.99 is a lot to pay for a movie and not get everything that's part of the movie.  If I had known this, I would have just bought the DVD instead.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|i needed an alarm clock on my kindle fire when my phone broke and this one worked perfectly, great app!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So good that I was trying to keep reading it any chance I got. I felt like I knew all the characters!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The movie was OK but not what I expected for all the advertising hype. My husband was dying to see it but it didn't hold his interest and the flow didn't always make sense. Tom Cruise & Morgan Freeman are always good actors but the plot didn't hold up for this one.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was hesitant about how she would include the poetry but it was awesome! Made me want to attend a slam. Love the whole story, characters, everything. Couldn't put it down.
B009CF7GRY|1.0|Inane story without any decent acting.  Even Dennis Quaid was kind of lame in this.  I guess I should say that I wasn't a big fan of the original either.
B002ZG9846|5.0|When I first saw the movie on the shelf, I thought, Kids Movie. I saw it on cable and even though they chopped it, I saw that it was a good movie. I ordered it and when it arrived I immediately put it in my Blu-Ray player to watch it. I think that Kick-Ass is a GREAT Movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a great game but I can't get on realms. I watch Youtube minecraft videos online. Xbox version is so differant than kindle version. No portals for nether or ender world. Love this game but please add more things like in the Xbox version.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easily down loaded. Works well. Very Satisfied!<br />It makes my Kindle more user friendly to be able to access the internet<br />via Google searches.
0316223239|5.0|I don't know what else to call this review.  This book truly was, heartwarmingly creepy.  I got the book from the library and read it quickly.  When I was done, I read it again before I returned it.  Part of me was warm and fuzzy about  the way this boy's mother worked so hard to give this child the best life she could, when circumstances were so...awful that most of us would have hidden under the bed and just given up, and part of me was just weirded out that we're seeing a horrible situation from the viewpoint of a young boy who should NOT have had to be part of it.  Not that anyone deserves to be part of it, but especially not a kid. The worst is that he's talking about things as any child would, because HE doesn't understand the situation, and the way he describes things, it doesn't seem all that bad, until you realize what he's living through.<br /><br />I would love to go on and give examples, but I don't want to ruin the book.  I don't want to take the risk of ruining anything about the book. I had read reviews before I borrowed it from the library and I wish I hadn't read some of them, because they gave away things... minor things that shouldn't have made a difference, but they did.  All I can say is that I was hooked by the end of the first two pages.  And I couldn't put it down until I'd read it twice.<br /><br />If I could have one wish regarding this book, it would be that the author does a sequel of what happens to Jack and Ma as Jack gets older and truly realizes what happened to his mother.  How he copes with it.  And how Ma copes with life too.  Because I just would like to know.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I was glued to my set watching this bio. Well worth the money and any boomer should have this to bring back the joy this group provided. so happy to see their return.
B00E8B1358|2.0|one special effect right after another, just not a very good movie. I am a fan of &#34;The Rock&#34; so I hoped for more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game super duper fun. If you haven't tried it yet you should try it now once again this game is so fun!
B001DDBCUK|4.0|As a single thirty something woman, Sex and the City has slowly grown on me. At first I refused to even watch it because of all the hype when the show was on HBO but now i'm hooked. The movie picked up where the finale left off. I laughed, I cried and at the end was happy for all the ladies. Gotta love that Mr. Big!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like this game but can not play for too long as just the things keeps repeating. But its fun swinging in around.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|There is almost no slow blues on this double CD. It is all moving and crying and twisting and dancing with hands in the air.<br />OK, so I like Buddy Guy. This is a great Buddy Guy CD.<br />Be careful if you have on while driving fast down the highway.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun and enjoyable. IT IS ALSO KID friendly . I love this game it is awesome with a capital A !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|An excellent film that is unsettling and very hard to watch at times. Very scary the influence that the food conglomerates have over not only our congress but key government agencies. And so sad that profits are what drive them, with total disregard for the health of the consumer  and of course the well being of our farm animals. Food, inc along with [[ASIN:B005K23S20 Forks Over Knives]] are must see films about the food industry, nutrition, and health.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love minions. They are adorable and hilarious. This game, though, is just a minion-ized version of Temple Run. If you like that game, you'll like this. I don't, so I didn't.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|it is a good movie with Beatiful singing and acting.<br />the 2 main charactors did great job.<br />like it verymuch.
B00DB624GS|5.0|This 1969 legendary classic has finally gotten the treatment it deserves:  beautifully remastered with corrected/restored running order, plus the inclusion of the classic singles \\"Oh, Well (pt. 1&2)\\", \\"The Green Manalashi\\", and \\"World in Harmony.\\" The singles are from same period and perfectly capture the rest of the album's unique ambience.  David Fricke's new liner notes also give much needed context to this confusing period in the history of Fleetwood Mac.<br /><br />It was on this album that Fleetwood Mac accidentally perfected a sound that is best described as atmospheric psychedelic folk blues.  The lineup is Fleetwood, McVie, Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwan and, of course, Peter Green.  Much has been written about Green over the decades, but truly this is his masterpiece.<br /><br />I consider the album to be one of the 25 best albums of all time.  Even if you have one of the earlier editions, don't hesitate to add this to your collection.
B0016YBFZ8|2.0|I would not watch it again.<br />It is very violent and you do not feel good watch it.<br /> Acting was good though.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Beginning belied what was to follow, but was a really good book. I would recommend this book to all who want intrique and romance.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Bought this as a second controller to play coop games offline. When I recieved it I noticed the controller was built with a different material. Not as shiny or reflective as the normal controllers. buttons where slightly unresponsive. Ended up not playing with it for a while till I was going to play multiplayer. Controller was dead and would not take a charge. Repeatedly tried to reset it with no luck. Didnt find out till today that they were counterfit controllers. BE CAREFUL WHICH YOU BUY!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Believable characters, Good acting, mostly credible (and adult...no blood on the TV screen or car chases or gratutious violence) plot lines and writing.  What more TV should be like.
B003IY48PS|5.0|Love the movie, always been my favorite.<br />Picture quality was great for such an old movie.  I do wish that the BR had the extras packed in various DVD copies over the years but knew it didn't before I bought.<br />Shipping through Amazon was fast<br />Price was great
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Had to create a schedule for watching The Good Wife, it's addictive!  If not for the schedule I would have lost days of responsibilities at home!  Love the characters and the twists and turns they creat in this super series!  Same for season 2.

B009GED3HS|5.0|The reason this season is the best is because of NPH's Barney, but the rest of the ensemble is good, and if you want to understand what happens leading up to Ted finding \\"the mother\\" then it's a must watch
0316228532|3.0|Rowling wrote a book that when I finished I said, &#34;An interesting story&#34;.  Very good descriptive writing.<br />I was looking for a beginning and a middle and an end.  What I thought when I had finished was I, somewhere or somehow missed the beginning and the end.<br />My summation - a well written description of a changing rural English community.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Its a very good show. I woould watch it again and can't wait for the next season. I definitely recommend.
0307352153|5.0|The book was a REAL fleshing out of the Myers-Briggs type regarding the Into - extro vert.<br />Being very solid in the introvert column I appreciated the  examples that reached the goal in a direct manner.<br />I had no sense that anyone one type was being highlighted as 'better' or 'superior'.  That types have differences was explained very clearly.
1591844096|5.0|I have a lot of books, and sometimes I read a book with the intention of then passing it on to someone else. That's what I thought I would do with this book--until I read it. I keep only the books that I really love and plan to read again, and this book is a keeper.<br /><br />What I love about Seth Godin is he doesn't just think outside the box. He takes the box apart, gives the pieces to the reader, and then shows them how to use those pieces, plus additional ones, to create new patterns that will serve them, and the world, in a more expansive way.<br /><br />I love Seth's writing style as well--straight forward, no BS. He gives many examples of how a linchpin behaves, and one of my favorites is, \\"She solves problems that people haven't predicted, sees things people haven't seen, and connects people who need to be connected.\\"<br /><br />He also says \\"If you've got experience doing the things that make you a linchpin, a resume hides that fact. A resume gives the employer everything she needs to reject you. Once you send me your resume I can say, \\"Oh, they're missing this or they're missing that,\\" and boom, you're out.\\" I have experienced that, big time, as I try to find a job after having my own business for nine years.  No recent experience working for another company? Boom, you're out.<br /><br />This book will get you thinking, and moving, in a more empowering, and contributory, way.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I first found Feedly when looking for a replacement for Google Reader and I'm sure glad I did. I actually think I like it more now! I have the Google Chrome extension as well as the app on my Kindle Fire and my Samsung Galaxy 3, works great on all platforms.

1452126577|1.0|I cannot find anything positive to say about any author who shleps her sweet kitty to book signings on her multicity book tour.  Grumpy is terrified of crowds and noise.

B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|Actually have not listened to all the album enough to get used to the rest of the music other than the ones he has already released. Bought this album for Boys Round Here song...its the best. Great party song.

B009O07NMA|5.0|I love this whole album! Great party album. I can put the CD in an listen to the whole thing without skipping through any song. Great job guys! Especially love #11. Have pressed repeat on that song a hundred times already.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|A great book I recommend to anyone who would like to know the importance of hard work. Describes in great details why famous personalities are famous.
B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|I absolutely loved Hosseini's previous books so why did I only give this one four stars? I think my only fault with this book is that the stories within seemed to ramble on and were only in part brought to a conclusion at the end. Unlike the two previous books which I could not put down I found I was compelled to read this only to see how it concluded.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|If you are into the old Victorian Era, you will love this movie. Emily Blunt did a great job in this movie and deserved the Oscar she won for this!!!
