B002RI9UBS|1.0|perhaps being made into a movie I thought this book would be more entertaining. I found the narartive to beboring and colorless
B001QWBM62|5.0|Pros:<br />1) records excellent audio through built in mics<br />2) records excellent audio through all the inputs and is very portable and versatile.<br />3) I love the 4 track ability and the effects built in to the device.  I can record multiple things in less time especially when I'm just messing around to get a feel for a song<br />4) comes with a memory card and batteries so it was ready to go out of the box.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) battery life is weak<br />2) built in mics have to be placed very well so not to pick up other noises and only what you want.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book in two days...it kept my attention right to the end.  I highly recommend this book and can't wait to see the movie!

B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is a must have album for those that like rock. 40 years old and it is still better than most anything ever produced in that genre.<br />I have to admit that I cannot hear a significant difference between the remastered and the previous version I have. Maybe younger folks with keener ears can tell the difference.
B009NPA3Y6|4.0|If your a Rolling Stones fan, and not heard their early stuff since CD's were invented, then this is the one for you. Brings back lots of fond memories
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|Any fan of Still's will be pleased with this box set.  Is it as comprehensive as it could've been?  Probably not, but even with four disc's it would be difficult to satisfy everyone.  Personally I would have loved to have seen included in this collection the song's from Manassas 2 \\"Pensamiento\\", Stills 2 \\"Word Game\\", Stills Alone \\"Amazonia\\", the extended version of Buffalo Springfield's \\"Bluebird\\", Havana Jam's unedited \\"Cuba Al Fin\\", Crosby, Stills & Nash's non-album B-side \\"Chuck's Lament\\" off the soundtrack from Amazing Grace And Chuck, Super Session's \\"It Take's A Lot To Laugh...\\", the updated remake of \\"Love The One Your With\\" from the Prefontaine soundtrack, the \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" duet with Jimmy Rodger on Rodger's Blues, Blues, Blues tribute.  Also from the tribute album Love John Lennon Forever the Stills version of \\"Come Together\\", plus  Still's collaboration off Flaco Jimenez's Partners album, the accordion driven version of \\"Change Partner's\\",  from Right By You the cut \\"Stranger\\", and from the Wretches & Jabberers soundtrack \\"Low Barefoot Tolerance\\".  I suppose a fifth disc would've been required to complete this box set and understandably would be cost prohibitive, but one can still wish.  Addressing what is actually on the box set just how good is \\"To A Flame\\", sonically the arrangement and instrumentation sound like the other side of the coin to Brian Wilson's \\"Lets Go Away For Awhile\\", the sheer precociousness of a 17 year old Stills \\"Travelin'\\", and how about \\"Who Ran Away?\\" so reminiscent of the Springfield's \\"Pretty Girl Why\\" and \\"Uno Mundo\\". Plenty here for veteran Still's aficionado's to appreciate and an incredible eye opener to folk's who may not be aware of just how far reaching Stills talent and influence extend.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|It is pricey, but the fact that it takes (8) AA batteries is great. I use rechargable Sanyo's. Light is very bright and with the 8 batteries it runs for a long time. I recommend.
0764169742|5.0|A gorgeous book on botantical drawing with colored pencil.  Full color examples and step by step instructions that are clear and easy to understand.  Very inspirational too I might add!  This book has a prominent spot in my creative library!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book had an interesting topic/plot, but I found it a little difficult to &#34;get into&#34; this book.  It did have some twists and turns to keep my interest, though I disliked the ending.  Overall, it was just okay.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|That game is really fun but I want 1.3. Otherwise this game is fun and addicting can never stop playing until I win
9992142693|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy reading this story. We love the colors and pictures of this book. Very high quality book!
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game is ok for a free game. the most obvious problem is the reliance on friends and diamonds, which increases as you level up. if you are patient and don't care about completing every quest, you can play the game without paying for anything. All that being said,  I'd rather pay a (small) flat fee and play the game without friends and diamonds.
1455523550|5.0|Safe Haven is a lovely book, hard to put down, great love story, easy to read but the movie is dissapointing.

0425263908|5.0|I have never read Sylvia Days books before this one and I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I am now waiting on Reflected by You to arrive. I read this in 3 nights as I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read more of Sylvia's work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's challenges are good and the missions are easy.the limited people are better.Their tours are the best.<br /><br />The game is awesome, fun,and ridiculous.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is the best charger that I have had. It charges my Kindle really fast and the charge lasts all day. I would recamend it to everyone.
B00866H7SS|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel - decidedly erotic if that's what you're going for.<br />The only down side is that I found myself going back to fill gaps I thought I'd missed in the novel.
B009329Y30|3.0|This movie has everything you'd expect from a Nicholas Sparks story; and just like most of his other books made into movies I loved the standard wet passionate scene, running towards each other longingly scene, and general drama.
B004B32500|4.0|The story of a killer's hands grafted onto an innocent's arms originated with Maurice Renard's THE HANDS OF ORLAC, and variations of it have been filmed many, many times.  Chilean-born Alejandro Jodorowsky uses more or less the same idea to remarkably bizarre effect in 1989's SANTA SANGRE.<br /><br />In a sense, the story is somewhat irrelevant, for it exists primarily as a hanger for a series of hypnotic images and set pieces.  It is also somewhat difficult to discuss the plot in any detail, for to do so would damage the story's twists and surprises.  Suffice to say, it concerns a young man who, after being psychologically damaged as a child, is forced to act his vengeful mother's arms and hands when he becomes an adult.  The story falls into two basic parts: the first, when young Fenix (Adan Jodorowsky) lives and works at a circus that his father owns and of which his mother is star; the second, when older Fenix (Axel Jodorowsky) escapes from a mental institution and falls prey to his armless mother.  The circus portion of the film is the most memorable, for it allows the director a wide scope for surrealistic imagery that rivals the likes of Fellini and Bunel.  The second portion of the film has a good many moments, and certainly shows Hitchock's influence, but feels a bit overlong and uneven in comparison to the first.<br /><br />In spite of this uneveness, and some very apparent plot directions, SANTA SANGRE is so completely unexpected that it will keep most viewers watching to the end.  Even so, this is very much an \\"art\\" film, and unless you have a liking for the style you will probably be put off by the overall nature of the film itself, which is by turns magical, mystical, disturbing, and occasionally funny in a very dark sort of way.  There are several DVD/Blue Ray versions of the film, including a two-disk version that offers a ton of bonuses, including a documentary that actually have a running time longer than SANTA SANGRE itself.  All available versions seem to be dubbed rather than subtitled, but the film uses so little dialogue that this is rather beside the point.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />In Memory of Reginald Garrard, Amazon Reviewers seem to be dubbed rather than subtitled, but the film uses so little dialogue that this is rather beside the point.

B009HELT3C|3.0|I haven't seen a MIB movie in years; this was very entertaining, funny and interesting enough story line.  I only gave it 3 stars because this just isn't really my kind of movie, but the movie itself was worth watching if you are in the mood for something light.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I was hoping for something that would light up a small hallway enough to help with cleaning.  It really doesn't provide that kind of light but it's advertised as a night light and it will work for that purpose.
B00BHMF578|5.0|ARGO was well worth all the hype; we loved this movie and were so excited to see it grab Best Picture.  The dialogue is witty and strong; I didn't expect funny from this movie, but some of the one liners had me rolling on the floor.  And the story itself is fascinating, and the way it was shot was dramatic, getting my heart pounding, without being overwhelming in bells and whistles.  Such a powerful movie!
B00005QK5X|4.0|Some very good reviews already posted about this 3-CD set, and about the Wipers and Greg Sage. Truly, the Wipers were one of the most underrated American bands of the 1980s. All I can add is that this is mighty powerful music that is worth the attention of anyone who enjoyed 80s alt-rock in the vein of Husker Du, Replacements, Nirvana, Mudhoney, and groups in that vein. Of course those groups don't all sound alike, and neither do the Wipers exactly sound like those bands either. But they all share a similar rock and roll spirit, and rebellious attitude, and have the ability to pen catchy tunes housed in rough and tumble rock arrangements with a punk sensiblity. Raw and powerful, melodic and uplifiting; this is music that will rock your soul.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I love this movie!  Great for everyone more for older kids and adults<br />7 more words to make this reviw post so so.....
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Very captivating, funny and smart series.  The older children enjoyed it too.  Quick witted and clever humor while honoring the sherlock holmes original stories.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I picked this book by reading the reviews. I have to say this is one of the BEST books I have ever read. It touches on so many things with surprises happening around every corner. They are young but their LOVE is clearly very real.  SKY and HOLDER are great characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best app ever but im warning u DONT get Minecraft Skin Stealer it messes up ur entire app. so never get the skin stealer it doesnt let u play it will say request is unathorarized and u have to uninstall and instal it again but it is still the best game in the history of apps

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was recommended as a fast and good read.  I knew the basic premise. I was quite taken with the viewpoint of Enzo and was surprised at the detail of the racing references.  It was a fast and enjoyable read.  Am recommending for my book club.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game.....it's comfortable to Mario :) thanks for creating this app...it's also very addicting I can stay on here all night
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this simply to put me over the edge for free shipping with Prime, and boy am I glad I did.  I agree with other reviewers, this thing is a gem.  I've used it on every knife in the house from kitchen cutlery to survival blades, and I've been delighted with the results.  This makes it easy for anyone to put a good edge on a blade.  I was even able to repair a few knicks on one of my survival knives with it.<br /><br />I read one review where the sharpening turned out uneven and wavy.  To be honest, I'm not sure how that happened.  Drawing the blade through the sharpener with consistent speed and pressure gives me perfect results every time.  4-6 passes is all it takes.<br /><br />Spend the $8.  You'll be glad you did.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved thus book. I loved the compassion and the determination throughout the book. It was so inspiring to read. The  metaphors of racing compared to life were compelling. I don't think the phrase 'the car goes where the eyes go' will ever leave me.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|At first glance it seems like any of the other hide/seek/puzzle games but I like the twist of adding clues to a board to solve the story.
0739378341|4.0|John Grisham has written a novel that kept me reading until the end, he knows his way around a court room. Well done John
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|Pussywillow? ( a word used in the movie)  and the amount of &#34;shoot'em game&#34; content was sickening...<br />We rented this for our 2.5 yr old... Thankfully he had no interest in it (he loves Toy Story) so I stopped watching too.... The lady character who leads the &#34;shoot'em up&#34; violent scenes was very suggestive, sexually... not necessary for a so called kids movie... I was so very disappointed, but I am glad we didn't take him to the theater to see it!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I would watch it again. I felt like I was part of the movie. Acting was outstanding, they drew into the story (history)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved everything until about the middle of the third book, it didnt make me dislike the story but just not what I expected to happen. Definitely have to read these if you havent already!
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|While I did enjoy Peter Jackson's (rendition which took extensive artistic license) the Lord of the Rings trilogy; The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was so dry, dull, and boring I fell asleep over and over trying to make it through the film.  My mother handed me the Hobbit when I was 8 years old and I devoured the novel without sleeping much at all before finishing it in 3 days that summer....so it's not an attention issue of mine yet the way the film drags on will certainly help you fall asleep at bed time.
B008476HBM|4.0|After getting into it it was a good book to read. It was hard for me to get into it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this version of solitaire.  It is fun and you can skip past the ad's.  The game gives you the freedom to choose the level you want.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app!!! Bright very visible numbers which you can dim and choice of colors too! Wake to your music or choice of installed alarms. I've installed this app on my Kindle that doubles as my alarm clock at my bedside. It's just Great!!!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Clear reception, can be heard throughout the entire car. If your phone has voice recognition, you don't have to take your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Good story, but a \\"moon\\" is the period of time it takes to complete its phases, which equals about a month.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My kids absolutely love this game and it will keep them quiet when I need them too.  They think it is wonderful so I do too.
B00338QENI|5.0|I chose this rating because this book was recommended to me to must read by my daughter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I never knew Henreitta Lacks exited.<br />I have highly recommended my friends even those without kindles to get this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B23O96A|1.0|One of the worst Clapton albums... boring without any inspiration. The music suits best background music in an escalator. A shame!
1612680011|5.0|This an excellent book. The book really inspired me to do better and think different. This is my second time I've read this book. I read this book in 2005 and now again in 2013. I read this book for the second time an couldn't put the book down. It is very rewarding to read the same information and get such excitement. I would recommond this book to any and everyone.!!!
B000NTHT6G|4.0|Delightful and thoughtful piece of fiction. Well executed . Will Ferrell at his best and Maggie Gyllenhall at her most quirky.
B007REV4YI|2.0|If Casino Royale was a step in the right direction of depicting Fleming's Bond, Skyfall jumped off the track completely. If it were James Burns instead of James Bond, I might have appreciated it more, but as far as Bond goes, this one certainly went--astray. From my conversations with people who loved it, many had never seen the earliest films, and none had read any of the books. Seeing this flick, you would think that the writers had never read one either, as they were too busy leafing through Marvel comics. It is clear that profit drove this film, from the million dollar Heineken product placement to the Thomas Newman score. What a waste of a good Aston Martin!
B0094K1JPC|5.0|Great movie, had a very good story line and kept me interested, I didn't even look at my watch for the entire movie
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you ever watch Netflix online their player is GREAT. It loads fast and has very few problems. The player that amazon uses always has captions even when not selected. It often freezes and the browser needs to be reset. I'm always afraid to change the size of the player too because it could freeze any minute forcing me to restart the whole thing. Amazon please get a whole new player the one you're using is junk.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|It's as good as Hayward's and Moody's usual stuff.  Only problem is there is a skip in 1st song.  Will exchange for another.
B00021HBGS|3.0|Got these for my 3 year old son. They don't stick well at all to our tub. But he has had fun playing with them anyway. He puts the road pieces together and it floats on the water. Then he &#34;drives&#34; the vehicles on the road. Fun for any little boy who likes cars and trucks.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book is not about getting high, being a crazy rock star or being famous.  It's about something more real than that. It's about how a little boy (or girl) feels when they turn around and mom and dad are not there anymore and what happens to you when that little child is you! Read it and weep, it's about and for, many of us, maybe even you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicting fun, give it a try...you will love it.  Why do i have to write more words?  enough good bye
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome. The only thing that stinks is that it that it takes a long time to level up.:)
1594203334|4.0|I gave this book for stars, not because I disagree, but because It's important to remember that everyone is different. My only issue is that she lumps all french moms and babies together (often in a way to show how American children are just brought up differently than the rest of the world) but this often adds the humor of her narrative. She also shows that Americans really do stress too much about child-rearing. I took what I saw was helpful from this book (it's definitely not a child-rearing bible) but, as a first time mom, it really helped me relax. Rather than getting worked up with other baby books, it really helps to see how other parents deal with parenthood and babies in other countries. I was fully empowered to raise my baby within our own family culture, rather than worrying about if she is like everyone else's child. Our 4 month old sleeps through the night, for the record :) Life is good when you don't worry so much!
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It's a bit higher priced than some Kindle games, but the product showed the extra work. If you like find it games, this is a good one for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Consistent quality writing leads to engaging entertainment. I hate the requirement to be wordy.  I hate the requirement to be wordy.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|I didn't like this movie at all! It was too long and too boring. It was nice to see some of the old Lord of the Rings cast but otherwise it was nearly unwatchable.
B00270WH3Y|3.0|You know the songs. You like / love the songs. Keep a lookout for a good price and pick up a couple of your fav tunes. Nothing too special. No amazing amount of songs. Just a nice collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Really enjoyed watching it on my kindle .so cool to be able to just touch the screen one time and watch my favorite show .
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Another Classic from Tarantino!  Must see if you like any of Tarantino's other films.  This movie did not disappoint and is on the level with his other great films.  Must see.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I downloaded this book for free and was pleasantly surprised. It dragged toward the end, but it reminded why I loved Harlequin romances as a teen. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a sweet, funny romance novel.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Lots of fast paced fun.  I wish t wasn't a challenge, I don't care for that.  I like relaxing, distraction game...especially with my health issues.  BUT this game is fun, and does challenge me to beat myself and get the special powers to clear rows.  I think everyone will enjoy this game.
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|Installed the VWipod adapter to my stereo unit in my car which gives me an ipod connection, and had hoped this would work so i could instead use my phones 3.5mm out, but sadly the head unit did not recognize anything being connected. Perhaps some fine tuning as i have used a similar product that had the 3.5mm connection break, so i gave this one a shot that looked a bit more sturdy.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch to use when I am at drills and during my military duties, the color matches.  I love the fact that it doesn't need batteries.  It is nice and small so it doesn't get in the way and get banged up on things.  Seiko is a solid watch.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app was introduced to me by a friend and I love it!! I never was very good about organizing blogs and articles that I wanted to read. This app allows me to do this with it any trouble.I have read more articles in the past few days than I have in a year. Love it!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The first book in the series does not disappoint! Cannot wait to get started with the rest of the books.
B00BSBY38A|1.0|I was expecting a much better heart felt movie.  The ending wrecked this movie for me.  Hopefully others will read this and make sure they don't pay more then a dollar to see it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I chose this rating because I thought it was a very brave movie and beautifully acted and directed. There were a few places where I squirmed a bit because I thought the sex was more graphic than was comfortable for me, we each have our own limits,  but the director cuts to another scene usually humorous breaking the tension. Mark is a young man who had polio as a child and lives most of the time in an iron lung. He's a writer and has a life but not a love life. The movie revolves around how he acquires one. I loved the main characters. It was a wonderful movie but NOT FOR CHILDREN!
0062014536|3.0|Loved the tension leading up to the final chapter, but reading on my kindle meant that I had no idea how far from the end I truly was (since there is an except from another book at the end). So here I am, thinking I have 8% left and then BAM! The book ends. How can the story possibly end here? I was expecting to have a resolution, a real denouement, to the trilogy I have spent hours reading, but instead, I am left with a sense of frustration and pseudo-emptiness at the lack of conclusion. Part of me wonders why I spent $10 on this book at all since it didn't accomplish the purpose for which I bought it: an ending to a series.
B001O80G60|5.0|This album KICKS ASS from beginning to end, non-stop metal mayhem, EXCELLENT offering from the Cowboys From Hell!!!  Groove Metal at it's finest.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I saw this movie the day it came out. I rented this movie from amazon just resently because friends that I was with had not seen it. Both times the movie held my interest. I thought it was good the first time and after seeing it twice, I still think it was good and worth seeing. What I do not understand is why some people did not like this movie and for what reason?
B001N8V7KA|4.0|Has a good plot and decent special effects for the time.  Some of the dialogue is a little silly among the Soviets.  Overall though a good story.  Produced and Directed by Clint Eastwood.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|Same old jewel but 80 of them gems gems gems that all ive got to say cmon that's enough ow
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Loved it in the theater, love it at home. I usually HATE musicals, but this story is so moving and captivating, you forget the weirdness of people singing instead of talking (almost no one ever talks - it's not like a musical where otherwise normal human beings burst into song - they are CONSTANTLY in song!). The bonus features are really interesting too - they are actually interesting, not like fluff bonus features most movies come with.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|got this to replace the original cord and it works great. I would recomend this as well as the wall plug to go with it.
B00BF11STU|3.0|2 hours of storyline for 15 minutes of action.  Poor female fighting her male bosses and trying to prove everyone is wrong and she is right is 9/10 of the movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Holy hell!!! I love Travis!! Amazing story just HOT!! I'm speechless!!  Can not wait for the next book I know it's going to be just as good
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Now I don't have to see it. I always like to read the book before I see the movie. Was hard to put down.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Solid and entertaining fantasy novel, deftly plotted. Highlight was the character of Kvothe, one of the extremely rare protagonists in modern literature who is successful, at least to a large degree, because of his cleverness.<br /><br />Author's pacing is superb, it's quite difficult to stop reading this as every chapter ends on a kind of cliff-hanger.<br /><br />The envisioned world where Kvothe lives is deeply detailed and yet has a consistency and reality, almost heft, that very few other authors can match. I'm currently actually reading the second book in the series, and the consistency strengthens the effect even there.<br /><br />Without giving away too much, the plotting is fair and very interesting.<br /><br />The writing is superb at the sort of clause and phrase level. As appropriate for a book about names, the author deploys a rich and beautiful vocabulary of archaic, obscure and nonce words that help bring the world to life all the more. And as I said above, the writing is also superb at the chapter level, with excellent pacing, and complex stories within stories within stories completely clearly narrated.<br /><br />I'm a little bit less enthusiastic about the writing at the sentence level, and perhaps even the paragraph level. The writer is an advocate or practitioner of that modern trend of using short, clear sentences (tied together in fairly short paragraphs). Semicolons and colons, even dashes, are eschewed. I find this style gets irritating and monotonous after a while, although, to be fair, it is certainly much easier to read on a Kindle than one relying on more intricate sentences. Anyway, there are really no contemporary masters of the sentence writing any more - I suppose Ted Chiang with his once-a-decade short stories. Even Chabon seems to have moved away from the exquisite stylizing in say Final Solution (one lyrical fantasy writer is Bishop, in Etched City though).<br /><br />Despite this, the book abounds with memorable phrases, e.g.: \\"the Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts\\" (evoking Gibbon?); \\"tucked away his bowl of stew with the predatory efficiency of a lifetime bachelor\\"; \\"A poet is a musician who can't sing\\"; \\"That's why stories appeal to us. They give us the clarity and simplicity our real lives lack\\"; \\"everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head\\" (not that I am a fan of the modern but still annoying  plural pronoun here); \\"I don't want to find either one of dead or the building on fire\\"; \\"all the more's the tragedy; the second thing to go is a man's memory\\"; \\"there's no good story that doesn't touch the truth\\"; \\"You see light dappling on the water and forget the deep, cold dark beneath\\".<br /><br />Although Kvothe is one of the most interesting protagonists I've read in a long time, his portrayal does have flaws where the author risks making him seem cartoonish:<br /><br />(1) Making Kvothe not just a good musician but a great one, a sort of Mozartean character, was  a bit too much.<br /><br />(2) Making him bad at math - or maybe this comes up in the second book, I'm not sure now - is ridiculous (he can't keep up in the advanced math seminar with one of the other characters). Given his character - his photographic memory, his brilliance at artificing, his musicial skill, his skill in answering the math questions in his interview - he should have been excellent at math. It's a lot more plausible that he would be able to take an advanced math seminar than that he would be one of the great musicians of the area, it seems to me.<br /><br />(3) By far the worst problem in the book, and  the only really serious plot problem, was Kvothe's relationship with Denne and, to some extent, with Fela (although I might be into book 2 here). The portrayal is unrealistic, inconsistent and strained. It  felt like the author shoehorned in a jejune, trite love interest for no reason at all, or more likely to try to make the book more cinematic in the eyes of somestudio executive. The relationship just doesn't jibe with Kvothe's age, studiousness, life experience or character. It's really awful, especially in an otherwise very plausibly plotted and characterized book. We're supposed to believe in Kvothe, to see him as a real person of his age, and throwing around this cliche and improbable relationship, and at great length and verbosity, is too much. By contrast the relationship with Auri is much more credible and interesting.<br /><br />I was also put off by Kvothe's - even the older Kote's - self-justifying stance toward his behavior towards Ambrose and Hemme. Kvothe created his problems with Ambrose - really they were entirely of his own making there. Kvothe barged in and started mocking Ambrose while he was trying to impress his girlfriend, for absolutely no reason other than some imagined  self-righteousness and busybodyness (not really realistic for someone coming from Tarbean anyway). Even the author seems somewhat unaware of how inappropriate Kvothe's treatment of Ambrose was in that key library scene. I'm not supporting Ambrose's reaction, but Ambrose was absolutely the one wronged initially, and Ambrose was understandable in wanting revenge. Similarly, Kvothe's behavior towards Hemme was just wrong, although Hemme too was wrong in his reaction. Maybe the younger Kvothe couldn't see this, but the older one should have seen things as crystal clear.<br /><br />That said, the book is nonetheless thought-provoking, fun to read, and virtually impossible to stop reading once started.
0525423842|1.0|Compre este libro para regalarlo y a la persona que lo obsequie no le gusto espero un final diferente .
0812993292|3.0|I chose this book based on it's comparison to Major Pettigrew, which I loved. I unfortunately did not find this to be the case at all.  I found the book to be quite boring and pointless. I'm still trying to figure out what other reviewers saw in this book to give it such rave reviews. Take a pass unless you are looking for a book to use as a sedative.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|Ordered the MP3 version and after a quick/browse listen, I am convinced they have NEVER sounded better:)  So glad I stuck around these 20 plus years!  THIS fab five just gets better with age!
B0087EACJK|4.0|this seems like a really cool game so far, except that i'm only at level 4 and already i'm completely stuck, cannot figure out how to move the tiles so they connect properly. is there something i'm missing here? i can only keep moving the tiles in a circular manner and they always come out the same. so i can't pass the level. if anyone can tell me what i'm missing, please comment on this review! i really want to be able to continue this game. as other reviewers have stated, it's very &quot;fluid&quot;. the controls are good, and it's fun moving the stickman around. although i generally hate being on a timer, i like that you can re-play levels until you beat the standard allowed time. but i am stuck. waaah.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I invited my neighbor over to watch it.  It's a wonderful story and a real tear-jerker!  We really went through the tissues!  We had a dog at home that was so much like Hatchi.  Her name was Kiska and she acted just like Hatchi.  They are &#34;jumping&#34; dogs and it's really difficult to make them stop.  They have minds of their own!  Good movie.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is better than I expected. The best part about the game is that if you mess up, you don't have to  go all the way back to the beginning.  It's fun and my son and I both like playing.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I suppose there isn't much to be said about this movie that hasn't already been said, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne and Christopher Nolan directed a movie that made me care about comic book movies again.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Faith building is a continuous process and Alexander's story and explanations were just what I needed to read/know.  I notice someone has written a &#34;Christian rebuttal&#34;, which seems crazy, to rebut a person's experience because it doesn't fit another person's perception of Christian theology.  It fits mine just fine.  I recommend this book as very important for individuals who are hungry for more eyewitness accounts of heaven.  Next you can read &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34; and &#34;90 Minutes in Heaven&#34;, and go back to the &#34;Life After Life&#34;.
B00B2166BS|4.0|I am only nit picking when giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating, as I wish the pogo cable was two or four feet longer.<br /><br />Other than that the pogo cable was:<br />1) Delivered on time according to Amazon's estimates<br />2) Works as advertised changing faster than the Nexus 10's included microUSB charger cable<br />3) Unlike the microUSB charging cable the pogo plug does not cause any background hum/static when listening to audio with earplugs. That is very important to me.<br />4) The quick attach/detach magnetic connections of the pogo plug are both convenient and saves on microUSB port wear and tear.<br />5) I should be able to charge the Nexus 10 at the same time as using the microUSB port with an OTG cable and USB device (e.g. SD card reader). When I wrote this pogo plug review my OTG cable had not arrived so I have not tested this feature.<br /><br />I am a very satisfied custom and the price worth the features and convenience.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book is blunt and to the point.  Many moments made me laugh, they were so true!  A new perspective, validation, and butt kicking courage.  Such a fast read, this book will not disappoint!
B00846TRHY|4.0|I do not know how accurate the situation in Sudan was portrayed, but the movie seems to be a good vehicle to expose it. I liked it for that, beside the fact I enjoy watching Mr. Butler!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book brought me to an amazing new world with all its challenges.  Sometimes the story seemed to borrow plot from Blade Runner but the writing was good enough to carry me along anyway.
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed reading this trilogy thoroughly. I can't wait for the movie series! I wouldn't mind a few spin-off from the other couples in the series like Elliott meeting Ms. Kavanaugh & their trip to Europe.
B0017R5UA0|5.0|Along with the self titled vinyl, also included are the Sun Giant EP (with songs like Mykonos and English House) and a digital download for both! Beyond happy with the quality of the record too.
0307352153|4.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking (ISBN: 978-0-307-35215-6) was written by Susan Cain. In the book, Cain refutes the Extrovert Ideal which has come to dominate modern society and argues that introverts, can not only be valuable resources of knowledge, but are also better suited for leadership than extroverts in some situations. Throughout the book, Cain uses various scientific and academic studies, as well as, anecdotal evidence from famous introverts to support her claims.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|The characters enticed the reader to love and cheer for them each & every step of the way. No helpless, hopeless women in this well-paced drama!  It's the wealthy duke who shows vulnerability as well. Well played Ms. Milan!  I've enjoyed the first two immensely. Now... onto the third!
B000ZLFALS|5.0|It's worthy of the music it plays. I was afraid that it would be a cheap cash in on the songs but it does them well and tells a pretty good love story too.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie with Denzel Washington is another must see. He is a great actor. Not for all ages but really good.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Love every Harry Potter movie, although this was one of the darker movies. But I am a fan and watched and re watched every one of them :))
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is so good for new recipes, crafts or most anything your looking for. Men or Women enjoy this program.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Ive seen all of the Harry Potter movies and love them all! My roommate and I were in the middle of a Harry Potter marathon when I realized I did not own either of the Deathly Hallows movies. I then obviously had to order them. And we continued our marathon and loved every minute of them.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Awesome movie, it's not good for all ages to see but a great movie. The people in the movie are really good.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My daughter loves horses so I got her this game and she loves it. I wish you could buy more with coins and not just the gems. Also, it would be nice to interact more with the horse.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This has always been a fun game, at any age. It is a good game when you are bored with everything else.
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|I simply love Helen Hunt and I think the movie is something people needed to see!  And I can watch it anytime on my movie library were it will never get lost!
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I played this on a 2nd generation Kindle Fire.  It took a while to download, like many of these games, but not what I would consider excessive for the length of the game.  I paid a total of 99 cents for the entire game, including the bonus level, and it was well worth it.<br /><br />The hidden object scenes, which are a feature of most adventure games that I do NOT like, in this game weren't too bad.  Yes, there were too many, but it was easy to find the objects, which I like.  The puzzles were pretty good, not too hard or too easy, and they were fair.  There were clues to be found as to what to do.  At times, the game did lead you by the hand a little too much, maybe.  But it was a fun game that I thoroughly enjoyed playing.  The graphics were good, and I thought the game had enough content for the price I paid.<br /><br />About glitches:  There were none that I noticed in the main game.  However, I had two issues in the bonus level.  One puzzle loaded incorrectly (the leaves in the leaf puzzle to open the gate to a higher level weren't there to be moved into place).  I exited to the main menu and went back, and it was okay the second time I tried.  The other glitch was a bit more persistent.  It involved a paper and pencil.  Every time I tried to use the pencil, the scene locked.  It took several tries of exiting out of the game before it worked.  I was about to give up and, bingo!<br /><br />This was one of my more favorite point and click adventures.
B005LAII80|5.0|Forget the Stallone travesty, THIS is the disc to own!  Karl Urban and cast knock this one out of the park.  The 3D is great and the story is fantastic.  This is one of the 3D Blu Rays that makes me happy to have gotten a 3D LED!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Love this CD.  Great songs.  Beyonce at her best.  And its  different than her music from her music from a few years ago.  Her music has matured....I guess since everyone does.  Beyonce is all grown up... And it shows.  She has he er been better!
B003LAH7MU|4.0|Only thing that I didn't realize was that the CD was in a paper sleeve.  However, all arrived ok, played well, and very satisfied.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely love this book, and the trilogy I'm general, everything EL James... can't wait for the next.<br /><br />Anxiously waiting
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I actually thought the movie might be good, but the playback of the movie was so choppy that I couldn't really follow it. It was like a million commercials interrupting it. Finally I gave up and went to bed. I usually have better results from Amazon so this was very disappointing.<br /><br />Update:<br />I watched this movie again because Amazon gives you 30 days to finish it. The playback was flawless.<br />I loved this movie! The acting was terrific, the storyline was unique with lots of unexpected twists, and, as a woman, I would watch Matthew McConaughey in anything.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|This dvd was not as it was described in the description...however I do love this movie! super adorable, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are right on and was shipped and arrived quickly!
B007SGM084|4.0|Really like these books.Glad that I could get the whole series as one book. Really a good read for women.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|The case was very broken, would not even stay shut! the DVD itself was scratched and damaged.<br />Yes quick shipping, but it was not as it was described in the listing.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Wonderful combination for a crew - wonderful ideas for the series - Captain Janeway is an intelligent woman, strong but compassionate leader.  This is making me a Trekky!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great game. ya its a copy of temple run but.... MUCH BETTER daily challenges mystery boxes u name it they got it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Arrived on time and was great.  We saw this in 3 D in the theater but found it easier to see in this version, not as hard on the eyes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started reading this and did not like it at all.  I thought it was emotional and physical abuse. I picked it up two months later with more of an opened mind. As I read I could not stop, thinking that Ana will be able to help Christian. It is good and I will read book two to see how things go.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|item works fine. just a hair slower than my wireless,but still good. would buy another if i ever need one.
B0022W6L6G|4.0|This is an incredible collection of  Fleetwood Mac's music. This album is well worth the price that I paid and I highly recommend it.

0307887960|2.0|I sure would like to lose this extra weight from these anti-rejection medicines that I have to take to keep my kidney from rejecting. They blow you up like a balloon. So I was excited at first about this diet, but I could not endure the regimen as directed and found myself getting sick at the stomach before I could go on to the other phases of the diet. This diet did not work for me. Dieting is not the answer for me, just have to watch what I am eating, portion sizes, and try and exercise as much as possible.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like this game but I like the original temple run better. I say if you want it get it if you don't want it don't get it.
1592407889|5.0|This was a couldn't put down book for me.  While not even close to a Mommie Dearest read, she was nonetheless honest about her mother and more or less presented her as the cranky, self-possessed, selfish oddball that we all know her to be anyway.  One item about MacLaine's view of who her ex-husband really was still has me scratching my head.  Parker's life was interesting without her mother and truth be told, that was the bulk of her life.  Good job.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You totally have to get this game. You can build, play multiplayer, and explore. GET THIS GAME. It is a must get game. It is worth every penny
0312330537|5.0|One of the best contemporary redemption novels ever written. Engrossing, engaging. Roberts has a singular talent rare in fictional works of this magnitude. Written from experience in tough jail settings and present day Indian. You will appreciate Robert's ability for language.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I don't understand why you have to have a Facebook for this. I have not been able to play so don't know if it is good
1594745692|5.0|Now they can. The Zombie Tarot gives voice to them in a unique and exciting way. Join the traditional tarot Fool as he enters an apocalyptic world controlled by zombies. The familiar format -- Major Arcana and Lesser Arcana with its four suits -- offers some comfort to travelers through this eerie world.<br /><br />For brave souls who are willing to risk the journey, the rewards are potentially great. Written tongue-in-cheek, with an odd mixing of the morbid with the profound, this is a serious tarot deck which delivers insight and direction with the best of them. Reading about scraping zombie goo off our shoes and the odor of the pile of corpses in the backyard has the effect of making advice like \\"take a deep breath before you open the door\\" resonant at a deeper level (as you chuckle to yourself). Who can ignore being told to make a decision when it's driven home with \\"You're starting to mold!\\"<br /><br />This is a deck every serious tarot student will want to own. Zombie lovers will find that the clever illustrations on the cards are well-worth the price of the deck. It's a win-win for everybody -- living or dead!<br /><br />(TarotWise.com received a free review copy of this deck.)
B005VT42BS|4.0|Good utility for scanning networks, when troubleshooting things out.  Also use it to see if anytime is browsing my guest network that should not be.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is the best game on earth. I love this game. I got 5 gems in 1 round. my favorite game is temple run.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I have this installed on my Kindle Fire. Before, all I was able to check on my Facebook app was my main page, but now every page I manage is at my fingertips. Great app!
0375869026|5.0|All parents and kids should read this book. It would help with the problems we have when it comes to bullying.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This story was both nteresting and haunting, it kept my interest until the end and I wasn't disappointed with the ending either.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS FANTASTIC...NOT ONE BAD TRACK ON THE ENTIRE LIST! I LISTEN FROM BEGINNING TO END AND THEN GO RIGHT BACK TO THE BEGINNING TO LISTEN TO IT ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I like Matthew McConaughey. This is a medium budget film with an interesting comment on justice. I enjoyed watching the movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved the innocence and creativity portrayed in the movie, with a message 'reading between the lines'... An innovative story line and Great animation as would expect from Disney. Not legendary but good fun! 5 stars.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|So what if they will release another &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34; right before the two film. I couldn't wait to buy this movie and I am very happy that I did. Had a big movie night at my house with friends and family and everyone loved it. Great comedy and the perfect entertainment for a big group of people!
B004GYY714|5.0|Can access to streaming of local radio stations on smart phones.  No antenna or tuner required.  Need data plan though.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I would totally recommend this soundtrack for the ultimate The Hobbit fans! Hours of music! Great music to listen to anywhere!
B000WFBC6E|1.0|Like others, we were hugely disappointed to find that this clock only looks like the original in design but does not have the proper movement. In fact, it just has a basic (made in Germany) plastic clock mechanism in the back.<br /><br />It's actually stopped working after 5 or so years too. Hopefully we can simply replace the mechanisms since it seems stock standard.
B005HSL626|3.0|ok for me. It's not to hard for me but it is ok fun. It challenges me a some.ok challenge for all.
B00BUL0XYG|3.0|This is an uneven, but worthwhile addition to The Strokes cannon even though it feels as much of a solo project than a group effort.
B00A757EFW|5.0|fun for me. It's hard for me but it is great fun. It challenges me a lot. Great challenge for all.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|This book gives a very interesting view on death and how you live life.  It makes you think alot but it is not my favorite book by Hitch.  Check out some of his other books
B00B2V66VS|5.0|ok for me. It's.  to hard for me but it is very fun. It challenges me a lot . challenge for all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just started watching Season 1 of Downton Abbey and am already in Episode 7.  I love it.  Full of drama and suspense.  I love the characters.  Maggie Smith is superb as all the others are.  They make their roles believable.  Can't wait to get to Season 2 and 3.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|ok for me. It's not to hard for me but it is ok fun. It challenges me a some.ok challenge for all.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great story line, great acting. Loved last season and again love this season. The show is well written and keeps you from thinking about anything else for the entire hour.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The constant ads will make you want to throw your kindle. Made my kids complain constantly. Well worth a couple bucks for the ad free version.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It reminds me of a dementional mahjong game.  I find myself playing it a lot.  Glad I decided to check it out.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I had to uninstall this game, too many ads. Liked the hint feature, but was making me crazy with the constant ads. Please just pay for the ad free version. I did.
1608955702|5.0|I follow Neil van Niekerk's blog and decided to get this book.<br />It is for me an excellent read and the photographs in the book are very compelling. His writing is easy to understand.<br />The book has helped me improve my portrait photography.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Same typical problem as many other free games. My kids were always complaining about the load times due to the constant ads. I paid the couple dollars for the ad free. Well worth it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I have carpal tunnel and this seemingly kid's game is one way for me to test my hand/eye coordination skills! KUDOS to the developers!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King is my favorite author, and he did not disappoint. A bit of variation with King, Not his typical horror, but nice twists at the end. I am a history buff, and liked that aspect of the novel too. Would recommend.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|If this movie had just a little bit better movie script could have been a 4 1/2 star. But worth watching ends kinda lame you would like to see them get finicial better before it ends.  Leslie Mann is the main actor she cuts like high pitched chainsaw with her voice but has really good face expressions.  Oldest daughter looks like somebody barging in a door and reading a movie script all the time I can't hardly get into her character
B004SBX112|5.0|Well worth the couple dollar price. Much faster without waiting for the ads. Kids enjoy on kindle free time. Recommend you buy.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|The game is fun and addictive..I find myself constantly trying to get a higher score than my friends. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Kids love it!! It's on my kindle. My kids are 10 and 6, boy and girl. They both play it.
B0007MAJBQ|5.0|Very pleased to obtain this product, because it is becoming  harder to find, and is the original maker's brand.<br />I have been using earlier versions of the product with the maker's deck for about 12 years without problems or failures, and still regard the minidisc system as superior in several ways to CD audio.<br /><br />I am sorry to hear that manufacture of minidisc equipment has now ceased.
B002361MLA|5.0|Overall a positive read which has something of impact for everyone. I didn't find that it helped with my spirituality, but I definitely gained some awareness and understanding for people around me. The book was easy to follow and Eckhart Tolle simplified many abstract spiritual ideas so that all readers can connect more on the message being conveyed. I have recommended this book to many friends and they all say that this book helped them to question their morality, which ultimately allowed their true voice to speak loudly. Sounds like a wonderful read to me!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Yes I have been inducted into those crazy bird games and I really like it a lot. It keeps you wanting to be better at getting those pigs no matter what. It's a fun game for all ages and can be played with your kids.
B005HSL626|4.0|At first I was like how in the world will slicing fruit keep a person's interest?! But it turned out to be just as addicting as Angry Birds! I love the challenge of slicing the fruit without hitting the bombs and beating the high score. Plus it makes me hungry for some fruit!
1619491486|5.0|My Book discussion group loved this book and included comparisons to the Shades of Grey series as a counterpoint between the past and current book trends.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The thing I love most about this book is that it was really able to capture the whole of Steve Job's life and make it into a compelling story. Steve Job's passing away came as a big blow to the technology industry, but when he died, I did not cry. After reading the book, however, I was about to.<br />Credits to the author who was able to structure the story really well, and organize the story really well. The story got more interesting though, through the humor that appeared in several places.<br />I do plan in reading Walter Isaacson's Einstien next, and if that is as good as this one was, Benjamin Franklin is next.<br />Great book
0385535147|3.0|After reading this Grisham book and having read most all the rest, I would give it an OK.<br />A little too much on the unbelievable side in the characters.<br />But right after this, I read a previous book - CALICO JOE.<br />HIS BEST!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book from start to finish. Keeps you hooked until the very last page. Would definitely recommend to anyone that likes being hooked to a book.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I am stunned by the quality of this restoration. Yes, there are one or two brief shots that seem to have been grainy but over all this is a wonderful treat.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|great plot, moral issues addressed.<br /><br />This new way of watching films on-demand is fantastic! Easy to use with my existing Amazon account.<br /><br />though my cable provider/company symbolically cleared their throats when my usage doubled in month
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was actually using this app before Google announced it was shutting down Google Reader, but now it is my go-to reading app. It is beautiful, syncs to all of my devices, and easy-to-use. TEN STARS!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie, Javier Bardem is one scary dude!<br /><br />did have an issue with the digital copy; download/redeeming only for my iPad not my MAC desktop.
B00AAKZPUK|5.0|Robert Redford in one of his best works ever and in my opinion the best collaboration between Redford and Sydney Pollack.. second only to Jeremiah Johnson.
0385363133|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker in my opinion was the best of the three.I won't give anything away except it's  A MUST read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My younger son saw his older brother playing this game and just had to have it.  I couldnt afford the full version for his computer so I got it for his kindle fire.  He can't get enough.  He does his homework and chores early so he can play it.  Well worth the money.
B002WYJHBA|4.0|I've watched this film with several people and I have to say, it is not a film to look at simply at face value. The people who I have watched it with who have did not enjoy it but the people who really took in everything enjoyed it.<br /><br />It's all the subtleties and symbolism that is what really draws me into this film. It's funny, eye opening, witty. It was definitely an instant classic with me and will have a place on my media center for years to come.<br /><br />I found the acting convincing, the storyline is wonderful. It's certainly a film that makes you think.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|I thought I would like this game, but graphics pulsated or jumped around and it was not pleasant to play with all that going on.
1849904251|4.0|I've been a very dedicated fan of the Sherlock series for a while and I purchased The Casebook. I can sincerely say that it's a great buy.<br /><br />It goes over the first two series. In each chapter there's a scrapbook like section in character which are typically quite amusing. And there is extensive input from the writers of the show on their thoughts, what inspired them and what they took from the real stories and how they turned it into what you have in the BBC Series.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it. Flip through it now and then. There's a lot of insight and little things and facts fans might be interested in knowing.
0062082353|5.0|The book was Amazing!. Loved the way he told it like it was! Unfortunately, we know the sad ending to Chris Kyle's life. God Bless his family!

B00985E3UG|5.0|this book is my favorite read ever shocking and amazing i learned more from this book than any other book i have ever read! a five star read.
0062502174|5.0|I found this book to be very light hearted but also very thought provoking. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Every bit as good as 'Presumed Innocent', Defending Jacob is a very well written mystery and, just when you think you have solved it, the bottom falls out. This is a must read! I am now a  bonifide fan of William Landay.
B005K17RU0|1.0|the new update is not User friendly.  I liked the previous version bettter. I would go back if I could. I am looking for a different app. complicated is not better.  who ever  idea it was to change this app should be fired!<br />I like accuweather. this app stinks!
B00BR9XFNM|5.0|I lost sleep last night to finish reading \\"The 100-year-old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared,\\" a brilliant, ridiculous, amusing, fabulous read. No wonder it's a best-seller worldwide!
159102594X|5.0|I wasn´t sure about buying this book because of all the reviews saying that it was dark, twisted, and violent. But I have to say I enjoyed it! I have already bought the 6 next ones! I hope they are as good. You get to care for the characters as they have layers and depth. There is no romance here if someone is wondering (maybe in the next ones?). It is original (no elves, dragons or the like and even though there are wizards and knights they are not your usual ones). Every character is imperfect. They have good and bad, just as normal people do. It is a hell of a ride, you will enjoy it. Give it time to get you hooked in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I cant get enough of the game.. i play as much as i can..i love this game more then going on to my facebook..
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry is great game for age 6 and above.  Probably some 5 yr. old could play this game.  It is really insteresting to see how many matches you can make before turning it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so great. I can go on and on about the game. This game is like addicting, but it's an awesome game and I think people really like it.I mean look at the comments before you get the game. I really like when you get to slice fruit and I feel so powerful,like a ninja. Fruit ninjas is the best and I can't wait to play with my family.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|I don't like this game.  It just does not interest me.  I would like to return it.  I'm sure there are others who would like it.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|This is a distinct jazzy tangent from his normal style, but it's impossible to not love Bonobo and all of his work, so you're never off when you buy this. Black Sands is definitely the best work so far, with Days to Come coming in at a close second, but this is definitely not to be shrugged off either. Cirrus, Antenna, Ten Tigers and Transists would be the songs to start off with if you are still on the fence.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|As a die hard LOTR fan, I can only say that this movie shouldn't be compared to the others. Slightly disappointed. I highly anticipated this movie with hopes it would be as great as everyone hyped it to be. I wouldn't go as far as saying do not watch it because it has the potential to catch the interest of those who like a good adventure film.
1609611543|5.0|I heard about Wheat Belly from a friend that had read Dr. Davis's book and was very enthusiastic about the health benefits of removing wheat from your diet.  I was curious enough because some of the ailments my friend had mentioned affected me, especially acid reflux.  I suffered from acid reflux regularly and would take ant-acid medications daily, and most nights would be wakened with severe acid reflux problems.  This alone was motivation enough for me so I went ahead and purchased a copy on my Kindle.  I finished the book in about a week.  I was very surprised with how much I could relate to many of the maladies, symptoms and health issues cited in the book as being attributable to wheat consumption.  So, I went ahead and eliminated wheat from my diet.  I'm about two months into a wheat-free diet at this point.  My acid reflux problems went away from day one, and I no longer take any ant-acid medications.  I addition, I feel better in general and more alert mentally.  I used to also suffer from a lot of joint pain mostly in my knees and hips, and this is completely gone now as well.  I plan to stay away from wheat for good, I don't miss it.  Finally, I'd like to thank Dr. Davis for all his research and for writing this life changing book.
B00991TCOG|5.0|If you haven't heard Lindsey look her up on you tube, download her, just find her and listen. This girl is gonna change the world. Lindsey is simply amazing she is creative, quirky, and extremely talent. This Girl will take the world by storm she has proven that if you believe in yourself and dont give up you can do anything. Americas got talent doesn't know s***, this girl has nothing but talent!  I was testing out soundbars at best buy one day and bluetooth connected my phone to them had Lindsey Stirling blasting through the store people stopped to listen I was amazed. I think I actually helped sell a couple of soundbars that day. Just go out and buy this album buy it now right here stop reading this review and press add to cart it's worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am reading the book and had to get the movie.  Now on book 3. Waiting for the second movie.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|REALLY what else is there to say the seasons just keep getting better and better. I'm sick of hearing how there isn't enough action etc etc. If your a true zombie lover your love all these seasons. I love the comics I love the show and if you love the original zombie movies there is no way you can't love this show. The first season may seem a little slow but that how it goes when your introducing characters and a new story. Buy it ..it won't disappoint
B00BMEF6IO|2.0|Oye, what have they done????  This is not real BMTH, this is some very soft crap from them.  Olie, you are heavily disappointing me man, what the hell happened here?  Dude, you have lost it, please come back, don't subject yourselves to this nonsense.  Suicide Season was their only good album, this is atrocious!!!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My son who is 22 and a college student really enjoyed this movie because it had drama, suspense and humor.  It is a pleasure to find an animated movie that appeals to all ages.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Okay, first of all, I do enjoy really good hip hop and I love a hard beat and some genius lyrical flowing.  However, I want talented flowing, not some words jumbled together that rhyme and make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  I mean seriously, how on this green earth is this pathetic worm so popular.  His words don't even make sense.  He just puts random words together that rhyme.  I am only the third song in and my ears are already screaming at me to show some mercy for the love of all that is sane.  Not to mention, he goes graphic with sex waaaaay too much as if he knows nothing else.  Oh wait, that's because he doesn't know anything but ego and sex.  I would rather listen to Justin Bieber and Nsync than this garbage, and I'm an avid obsessive heavy metal freak.
B00BF11STU|5.0|loved it, was really good, would recommend it and definitely watch it again. good action and drama, keeps you interested
B00947N6UG|5.0|I ordered this as a gift and received it in time for their road trip! I Loved the movie... They loved the movie<br />Totally satisfied!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have become a huge fan of G5.  Some of their games are just okay and some I really enjoy.  This one is pretty easy which I don't usually like but it has kept my interest enough that I haven't been able to put it down.  Not sure what the complaints are about.  Runs great on both my kindle and my galaxy 3.  If you just want to kick back and relax after too much brain work at the job, then this will do the trick.  And I love da monkey!  Thanks G5 for another great game!!
0446580848|2.0|I like John Corey books. They always make me chuckle...even laugh out loud at times...but this book is non stop wise cracks. I really believe there is not a page that doesn't have at least two. Some are not even spoken but in his head. Which means he really is this way and not using wisecracks to dummy down as stated. I found myself skimming....then I realized I just wanted to finish the book and move on. Sad.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Standard thermal compound is ok, but for a higher end processor like mine (Intel i5-3570K), I needed something that would have better heat transfer. I looked around and a number of people suggested that this was a great buy for people who wanted to overclock and play graphic intensive games.
B005QBKXSC|5.0|Bought these to rev up for a concert where he opened for 3 Doors Down.  OMG!!! he was the sh_t!!  I mean to me he stole the show even though they were good.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I was considering between this one and the i7, but went with this one because it was cheaper and performance differences between the i5 and i7 would have been negligible. I have played battlefield 3 and a few other games and it handled them with ease.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Bought these to reve up for a concert he was playing with 3 Doors Down.  OMG!  I think he stole the show even though they were good too.
B001EC3JME|5.0|this is a great holster because it hold any flashlight from a AAA light to a D cell and goes right back to size with out wearing out
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Eric Church is the man! Love his music new and old.  Worthwhile purchase for lifelong enjoyment! Open your ears to &#34;The Cheif&#34;.
1932735410|5.0|This was a great prep book.  I studied for about 2 months.  Took the PMPprepcast course and read this book once (never read the PMBok).  I finished the 4 hour test with over an hour to go.  Concepts were presented well and easy to understand.  Exercises really help with understanding rather than just memorization.  Highly recommended.  This is for the test that follows the 4th edition PMBok.  I believe the PMP test will be updated in August 2013 to reflect the 5th edition PMBok so not sure if the changes will make this book obsolete (doubt it).
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|The movie seemed true to the story with little hollywood embellishments.  James Franco did a great job in his portrayal of Aron.  Having survived a near death experience in the wilderness, Aron's experience resonated and was a great reminder of the power both of surrendering to the circumstance and paying attention to what your spirit is telling you when your future calls.  When it's time it's time, when it's not - get creative and do what it takes to survive!
B00APUTZYC|5.0|I became addicted to Gossip Girl when I started to watch it on Netflix, the show is brilliantly cast and perfectly acted.  I became so connected to these characters I never wanted it to end!  The series finale had the best twist that I never figured out throughout the entire 6 seasons. I'm so sad it's over.. BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT!!!
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Yes she had a privileged childhood and a scary one indifferent parents and quite crazy, her mother was more preoccupied with aliens and crazy sex doctors, and her father was a manipulative jerk that only used her.
B009H441G4|4.0|I have never heard of these UK  grind guys before....Found out about them in the newer issue of Metal Hammer magazine and had to hear them for myself! Hard to listen to on repeat for days in a row but it is still a brilliant record...I believe this is their 7th studio album and I am excited to hear what comes in their future from these grind-black-industrial masters!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved, loved it!! I could not put it down! Love how Anastasia is so strong and doesn't take any crap from Mrs. Robinson!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This was a great movie that my entire family enjoyed.  I love movies that entertain and teach a lesson too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed it so much! I was so sad to be finished with this book! So, I just started reading them again!
B008I43DYU|4.0|I like to fool around with calculators.  They provide answers you can't get on ordinary calculators.  For example, you might want to convert a &#34;light year&#34; to miles.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|so far so good....I love this case. It seems substantial. I liked the color choices...I chose red and the strap<br /> keeps it securely closed so my Kindle stays asleep until wanted.
B007IJDXFK|2.0|This was the first time I had listened to this band. I thought this album had me at the 1st song. The music sounded great and the vocals were okay. I really wish Amazon would preview more than 30 seconds, because they were extremely misleading. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known I wasn't purchasing an acoustic album, with the exception of 2 songs.<br />As I said before, the vocals were just okay for me. Most of the time, the male vocalist sounds great, and then I feel like he ruins it. With the exception of 1 song, I can't stand the female vocalist at all. I can see how this band could be likeable by people, but it just really wasn't for me.<br /><br />If this album would have been instrumental, I probably would have loved it. The music is fantastic, but I just can't get past the vocals.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|We just used this on a trip to Disney.  It charged 2 phones really quick and worked for 3 days.  Highly recommend at a great price.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|great game. wish though that you could play as the zombies like in the first one. but still a great game. plus its free.
111846446X|5.0|great intro to Unix for a beginner, good read about the pi for everyone else.  I highly recommend this book.
B004SIP8JI|1.0|Buy this product from another user.  The 'package' smelled like toilet cleaner.  Filthy.  DUCT TAPE.  Receipt-less. The DVD itself, however, was spotless.
B00BF123WG|4.0|The movie was good, but got very detailed and technical about interrogation methods and how intelligence agencies track terrorists, almost too detailed.  Most people will lose track of who is who with all the middle eastern names and their roles within the various cells, etc.  I'm sure this movie was pretty much true to the facts, but became dull in parts trying to connect the dots.  There were good parts that catch you off guard and the end when they get Osama (oops, hope I didn't give away the ending), but be prepared to have your noggin tested.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|Was exactly what I wanted and was shipped really fast and was no trouble at all. Product was what it should be.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|Deep Space Nine give us the real understanding of the Star Trek Culture. Gene Roddenberry was a great in his creation of this great scifi adventure.  Its too bad he died before he could realize its success.  Deep Space Nine has great commander Sisko great character!! Odo is a new and strong security officer. I'm impressed with the writing and casting in Deep Space Nine!!!
B0023S50DO|4.0|This movie isnt perfect, but its an okay movie. i kinda liked it, i liked the huge tsunami clip. Thanks
B001MSMULG|1.0|This thing was a real disappointment.  Gabriel Allon is a skilled and interesting art restorer but a boring and incompetent assassin--that seems backwards.  I was still trying to love this novel when Silva has a very famous super model who pines for dull Gabriel go undercover--uh, no.  No.  No.  No.  After that, the plot is all over the place, just an exercise to produce enough words to equal a book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can forgive most plot problems for a good character, but Allon never comes to life or takes charge of this book that's supposed to be about him.  I did finish The Kill Artist but it was a chore, I was relieved when it was over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was a very good book! I would totally read it again! Please read it will be worth your time! :)
B005LAIII0|2.0|This is essentially a very long fairy tale with very nice special effects as well as frank religious overtones. It treats the characters in a worshipful/spiritual way and, quite frankly, I really didn't care for this film. Although its cinematography is perhaps worth viewing. As with most movies, your reaction will depend on your personal outlook and interests.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This book is really good it was a good idea to create this game for kids this is why people should get this it's such an amazing game
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was always one that had to read the book before seeing the movie.  So you can understand why I had to read this before getting into the show.  Best decision I ever made.<br />The character development should act as a model for books of any genre.  The plot picks up immediately, it lags at times but when it advances, you won't  want to put it down.
B0087EACJK|1.0|I refused to install it after I saw what access it wanted. There's absolutely no reason that a game needs to know so much about what I do.
B001F6TXME|4.0|This cord is great for activating the shutter when you're behind or to the side of the camera, rather than being in front of it. It's a good choice for macro photography and other situations when you don't want to jostle the camera when you take a shot.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the second book for the trilogy. The characters are more developed which gets you in more deeply than the first book. I can't hardly wait for the 3rd.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|It was difficult to read for me as a non English native speaker but I got sucked in eventually. I should reread the beginning now, see what I missed! Really vivid world-building narrative and interesting addition to the ongoing conversation about artificial intelligence and climate eschatology.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Having come of age in the 60's, I'm a big time Moody Blues fan. The classic albums are burned in my mind but have been put on the shelf. I did not realize how much I missed that sound.<br /><br />This album brought back that feeling with a freshness that felt like a cool breeze.  I've got tickets to see Justin Hayward in August and I count the days.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great price and the movie turned out to be quite good.  A little slow in the middle but worth it for the story development.
B00000ITOY|5.0|I love this toy!  It is one of our favorites.  Well made, no plastic packaging, colorful!  My kids love playing with this.  We sort by colors, or shapes, or they carry it around singing the &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; song, pretending it is a cake!  We have purchased this for many birthday parties for friends!
B007SGM084|3.0|&#34;Mom,&#34; my daughter said, &#34;you gotta read this!&#34;  She handed me &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34;. Being a masochist, I almost always do what my children say.  But I have this thing about starting a book and then having to finish it,  even though, halfway through, it starts to drag.  So this time I was reluctant to obey.<br />&#34;Oh, Honey, why?  What's so great about it?&#34;<br />&#34;God, Mom, it's drenched with sex!&#34;  I had to read the whole thing with one hand!&#34;<br />&#34;But, Dear,&#34; I said, &#34;I'm too old for that.  Besides, I have arthritis in my you-know finger.&#34;<br />She squinted.  &#34;Oh, Mom, you're such a stick-in-the-mud.&#34;<br />&#34;Now, don't you go talking dirty to me, young lady!  Remember your manners and go to your room!&#34;<br />&#34;But Mom, I've already finished the book. Don't make me go to my room, please.  I don't have anything else to read except that old work-out manual you gave me.&#34;<br />&#34;You mean 'Deltoids of Venus'?  You still haven't finished that?  Oh, all right, go out and play in the traffic, then.&#34;<br />She ran out the door, and I was left with the damn thing.  As if I didn't have enough grey already.  Oh, what the hell, I said to myself.  I curled up on the loveseat and started reading.<br />Three weeks later I came up for air.  &#34;Well, what did you think?&#34; my daughter asked.<br />&#34;About what?&#34; I replied.<br />&#34;The book, the book!  What did you think?&#34;<br />&#34;Not enough sex in it.&#34;<br />&#34;WHAT!!??&#34;<br />&#34;Sweetie, when you've done it as much as I have, it takes more than a few dirty words to get an old pro like me steamed up.&#34;<br />&#34;Is that why Dad had his heart attack?&#34;<br />&#34;Let's not talk about your father, Dear.  That wasn't my fault, anyway.  Policemen are supposed to like wearing handcuffs.  Besides, he was good while he lasted.&#34;<br />&#34;Yeah, that's what Sis said.&#34;
B00846REIS|5.0|If you like funny and romance mixed with intrigue, this is the book for you. I read this book in 2 sessions. LOVED it! Can't wait to start the next one in this trilogy.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I just love this show.We have watched all 5 seasons and really wish that there was going to be a 6th season.

Take home stations with you or discover new worlds to explore.  It's all there for you with TuneIn Radio Pro.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Tired from a long day, I couldn't fall asleep after getting sucked into the plot a few minutes in. The final 30 minutes left me in awe and horror of the sad truths our military personnel go through to keep our country safe.
B0035Q4AFC|4.0|Very good movie about the life of one of the most legendary silent film icons. Downey almost made you believe he somehow summoned the spirit of Chaplin. A very insightful movie showing the tragedies and loves of his life. Also illustrated how much influence he had in the early motion picture industry.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|and I love Amazon's Cloud feature. I have a Kindle and I have access to ALL of the music I have ever ordered from Amazon so not only did I get a great CD but it was automatically downloaded to my computer and Kindle too!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|It's IVY bridge so it's a hot CPU.<br /><br />Pro<br />-Runs great<br /><br />Cons<br />-Got unlucky and heat issues don't allow me to get passed 4.2 GHz on an OC<br /><br />Pretty simple, despite my con I love this processor. You can get a heat unfriendly processor from any batch.
030758836X|2.0|I am surprised at all of the glowing reviews for this book.  The first half was horrible, and I did not like the main characters at all.  The second half was better and I will admit that there were some places where I wanted to keep reading to see what happens next.  However, I did not like how the book ended for Nick or Amy.  Their characters were both totally unlikable.
B009A87X80|3.0|This artist was recommended to me, but is just not my taste.  I thought it was sort of boring.  After one listen I gave it away.
B002EXADG2|5.0|(Spoiler) That last scene had me scouring the web for the answer! I watched this twice. The first time I was engrossed in the budding love between the two main characters. It's straightforward, it's real, and in small parts tragic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey in a mere ten days while recovering from surgery. I was mesmerized by the characters, the story line, and in getting a new perspective on English aristocracy. This is a timely and sophisticated series that encompasses both human suffering and joy, and the ever evolving human spirit. BUT be prepared, it is very tragic at the end. And yet it just keeps going; just like life.
B0060MYK7G|4.0|While I enjoy the show, there is a problem with the discs, there are white lines above the border on the top of the letterbox. Need to return it and hopefully get a copy without the problem.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|Liked the book - well written and held my interest.  However, the end is very disappointing after reading with a great deal of hope in mind..
0307476073|5.0|Wild is a singular, unforgettable memoir, but readers may first feel its connections to kindred stories. To Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods, certainly, because both are accounts of time spent on trails, Bryson's the Appalachian, and Cheryl Strayed's the Pacific Crest (Bryson's trek less harrowing than humorous), but also Jon Krakauer's account of another naïve young American challenging the wilderness in Into the Wild. Readers may be reminded of other memoirs of growing up in poor, painful circumstances--Jeanette Walls' The Glass Castle, perhaps, or Rick Bragg's All Over but the Shoutin'. Probably the strongest links though are to Terry Tempest Williams' Refuge, because both are about pilgrimages through personal loss in a challenging and intimate natural setting.<br /><br />But the comparisons pale when readers confront the raw emotional power of Cheryl Strayed's story. She's lost her mother to lung cancer, her husband to her own immaturity and divorce, and she is on a 3-month hike to free herself of her grief and find some essential self that remains, but she is woefully unprepared for what she will face along the trail. Readers root for her, feel the pain in her heart, and in her feet, and laugh at her foolishness at the same time as they recognize how much her life and journey are like their own. What strikes us immediately is how open she is about her fears and faults, her frailties and failings, and her honesty draws us into her story at once. And her writing strips away all the excess and embellishment from her experiences, both outer and inner: the alternating heat and ice on the trail, the vulnerability and pain within. Cheryl Strayed is a remarkable writer, and Wild is an account of a journey readers will not soon forget.
0446572985|1.0|Guess I'm just used to reading stories written by people who know how to write. The Innocent reads like it was written by a teenager for a teenager. In short, I kept wondering why I was reading this book. I refused to give up, considering how popular the author is. In the end, I felt as though I'd slogged through an endless field of poor grammar and mindless, blathering dialog.  I kept hoping someone would save me from myself. Alas, no one did.  This author? Never again.
B007SGM084|4.0|Is it worth the money? Not really! Is it worth the hype? A little. Was it a good and enjoyable book: sure

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a game that has Daily Challenges, different characters, and it is on a world tour where you can get special players at that place. Awesome.
0980876702|5.0|This book is very detailed in the instructions.  It had very explicit diagrams of the more unusual stitches. It was easy to follow the progression of the assembly.  The project itself could be intimidating because of the length of time it takes to make each piece, but very satisfying. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a moderate proficiency in intermediate embroidery stitches and assembly of craft projects.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|The story is boring and repetitious (although I did enjoy the friends in the parking lot, and the counselor). The writing isnt great.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I wish this app would work. Every time I try to sign in it says that there is a network error and to connect to the internet even though i already am. I have a Galaxy S II.
B0060D11OU|5.0|I never thought that she would love this movie as much as she does. The only problem is she wants to watch it so much, I have to tell her no.
B003DZX44I|1.0|I bought this last year but never opened it until now.  I was so excited to to watch it with my little one and then towards the beginning of the movie it started skipping and then stopped playing.  My husband and I looked at the blu-ray and long behold there was a HUGE scratch mark! It was a shocking and I was VERY disappointed and very upset!!!!!!! I'd like to get an exchange on the blu-ray but don't know how, can anyone direct me?
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We watched this in the theater last Christmas and really enjoyed it. There was a good story line and the plots were written well. The voices and animation were excellent.
B009TO99TG|5.0|If you like Coldplay and don't have any or most of these CD's then get it! The price can't be beat.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I got this game because the first game was a fun game to play and something when your bored.When I bought the game it installed perfectly. When I played it the view I have of my avatar is constantly adjusting and it messes up my game. Therefore I am deleting this it is a waste of space
B001JRB16U|5.0|We are collecting all of the Disney films!  Our daughter loves them all!  Glad to be able to find them on Amazon instead of searching all the stores!  So much easier!

B000002GB2|4.0|There are two of the eight songs on this album one can find of 'Styx Greatest Hits' album; namely 'Lorelei' and 'Sweet Madam Blue' and one that might should be there, 'Light Up'. The more casual Styx fans may want to go with that album, maybe, because they can get most of what they want that way. Otherwise,...There really isn't much I can say about 'Mother Dear'' because it really doesn't sound too much like what the casual Styx fan would associate with most of what they're use to hearing.  The fourth song on the album, is kinda sorta likewise, too.  But 'Midnight Ride' kicks it into high gear with great keys and Tommy Shaw's powerful lead guitar.  'Born For Adventure' keeps the pace rolling, veering off in a direction more akin to 'Grand Illusion', so one can see more of the ProgRock direction J.Y. Young is trying to take with his songwriting. 'Prelude 12' and the following 'Sweet Madam Blue' are aa terrific pair of songs to cap off the album, filled with soulful angst and a good dose of social protest.<br />All in all, a pretty good album for the casual Styx fan who wants to perhaps dig a little deeper into an all-American classic rock  band.

B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I saw this movie mentioned in a review of great movies done wrong by box office success, and since I'm a huge Alan Tudyk fan, I figured I'd give it a shot. Loved it! It's a very funny movie with an interesting plot. I couldn't believe a gory comedy slasher flick could've even been mentioned as a go see flick for a critic, then I learned why. Watch it, it's funny. I will give no details in giving away its genius. Tudyk is brilliant as always. Very pleased.
0767802470|1.0|Nothing but every kind of gross use of body fluids & disgusting behavior & sickening comments throughout entire movie. Quite literally peeing on each other, puking, flicking gross nose contents at each other with constant sickening comments about toe jam, poop & everything else gross & filthy imaginable filling every moment of the first entire hour. It is bad enough to make the audience retch. I am not exaggerating in the least. This disgusting behavior & gross dialogue is nonstop for at least 1.5 hour of the first side of the movie with only 10 minutes of shaking, rattling & spraying water onto this sty. Then you discover there is nearly another 1.5 hour of movie remaining on the other side.<br /><br />I have never in my entire life heard or saw such a disgusting display. Even Ren & Stimpy aren't this bad. Close; but this movie is worse. It makes you hope for an early sinking to stop the audiences suffering. I've managed outside plant cable crews; some of the raunchiest you've ever met... but they couldn't hold a candle to the gross, disgusting behavior & dialogue on this movie which is nonstop from the very onset.<br /><br />After a brief moment of deep diving, they returned to their previous disgusting, putrid behavior. Including naked short arm inspections with crawling crabs (rear view only), drinking soured milk, eating hairy meat, flinging gross body debris, etc. Puking, sharing bunks & complaining about the nasty details of body sweat, feet & oils from their bunkmate (& I'm not close to using the dialogue on this film which is nonstop nauseating to purposely make you ill). Things so sickening, nonstop throughout the entire movie; too awful to list on here.<br /><br />Then we have a redheaded actor with constant filthy, idiotic comments, obviously British descent who clearly belongs on Monty Python. Can't act & talks like a moronic swishy feminine throughout (this is a behavior description, not a sex preference issue); in any language you choose to watch. He clearly looks & sounds like a joke on a German U-boat. A Harpo Marx (Lucille Ball) type. Constantly talking about passing gas in public. Animal House was better behaved than this tripe.<br /><br />This is beyond wanting your money back. The audience should sue for pain & suffering the indignities. This movie made every effort to make the audience retch. I can't think of bad enough things to say about it. It is quite literally the worst movie ever made.<br /><br />At 2/3rds through the movie, you are convinced the movie could only improve by sinking the sub & ending the movie.<br /><br />The music is even worse like some Lone Ranger episode or spaghetti western. Cheap & corny.  Only 10 minutes of the first 1.5 hours on side one give you a break from the filthy behavior & dialogue with shaking & rattling at the end of side one. Then to your horror, you discover there is nearly another 1.5 hours on side 2.<br /><br />You might be better off to skip side one entirely. I can't believe any studio actually approved money for this script. Side one is a complete disgusting waste with no redeemable footages.<br /><br />Side 2 starts off with crew insanity & even more violent shaking for 10 minutes; wasting a torpedo on a burning wreck; stranding survivors; guilt & depression; back to filthy behavior again; a ridiculous feast & pompous over actors at port; dragging slowly through every scene uneventfully until 45 minutes into side 2; Blood & Sub damage until they gloriously hit the bottom. But even then, we are not spared further misery as it sits on the bottom where it should have imploded. We are forced to endure 30 minutes of watching them flounder aimlessly in depression waiting to die on the bottom until the last 15 minutes of the movie when it finally rises to the surface. Then we are back to loud parties & a deteriorating officer; arriving at base to pompous band ceremonies & a surprise air assault.<br /><br />At long last, most of the filthy crew is battered, raving &wiped out on the docks as the sub sinks from the Bombings. It is the only highlight after being subjected to such a horrible 3 hours.<br /><br />I cannot imagine how anyone could enjoy this movie. Truly, the only way to watch it would be to skip side one entirely, read the overview online for character reference then watch side 2 with the fast forward & chapter skip buttons. Out of 3 hours, there are only 30 minutes of watchable footage which is all on side 2. But even that is a crawling waste of time. The director & writer should be banned for life.<br /><br />Do Not let children or teenagers watch this movie. Also not recommended for those easily offended by smut.<br /><br />If you still insist... Rent. Don't buy. But if you can't tolerate Ren & Stimpy, you will not be able to tolerate this movie.wiped out on the docks as the sub sinks from the Bombings.

B00BWJARHO|3.0|After reading many negative reviews I wasn't expecting much.  The movie is not as grand as LOTR, but is visually interesting. I enjoyed it but unlike the previous trilogy, I have no inclination to ever watch it again.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This is a great example of why you buy the paid app instead of the free version. The ability to create custom mixes is worth the price. You can customize them further by changing the relative volume and balance of each sound in the mix with tap and hold. I had to find that by experimenting with it. A better intro tutorial would've gotten that fifth star.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best of both worlds: great affects & gore, as well as, a great storyline with evolving characters. But don't get too attached to any of them!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Its okay - everything is sung, and only two &#34;catchy&#34; songs.  Very long story, was okay to watch once but wouldn't want to see it over and over again.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Pendergast is getting more and more unlikeable.  Some of the events and action sequences are also implausible.  Regarding Ms. Swanson and Ms. Greene, there were no plot tie-ins, just some dubious connections by happenstance.  I was a little disappointed.  Not up to typical Preston-Child standards.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Having used a mouse less than half this size, I'm probably biased against larger mice, but this one is just enormous. It's uncomfortable and won't work with any of the mousepads I have, so I drag my pinkie across the desk or have it awkwardly positioned towards the mouse. The manual might as well not exist. It basically tells you the title of each page of the settings and that's it. If you know everything there is to know about DPI, Hz, acceleration, and mouse point speed, you'll be fine but otherwise it will make little sense. The macro only clicks, and doesn't support movement which makes it nearly useless. The manual doesn't even show you how to turn off the macro once it initiates. I've been tweaking the settings for hours and trying to get used to it for days. If you set it to where it requires little movement, there is virtually no precision and you'll misclick far too often. If you set it to lower DPI you have to move the mouse around far too much for such a huge mouse. I've used laser and optical, gaming and standard, wired and wireless, and this mouse just isn't working for me.<br /><br />If you have gorilla hands this mouse might just be perfect for you, otherwise get something else.<br /><br />Also one thing I forgot to mention, there was scum on the side of the mouse. It was so difficult to get off I almost think something had melted onto it. Aside from the worthless guide which could easily be rectified, the size is the only problem that cannot be fixed. I'm going to look into returning it but I'm not sure if I will having heard such terrible things about returning products to Amazon.<br /><br />Final decision: A good mouse for most but it's downright misery to use this if you used a small mouse before. Expand on the manual and it's a 4/5. More features for the macro would make it a 5/5 in terms of quality to value rating. I'm assuming the only use for a click only macro is quickscoping, which I've never done so I'm not even sure if it could do that. The macro feature would be better off completely removed or expanded on, but shouldn't stay as it is. Also the glides over any surface comment is deceiving. It wouldn't hardly budge on my brand new mousepad that worked perfectly for my previous mouse.

B003VANOFY|5.0|Are these audiophile quality? No but then again, they don't cost $1000.00. They are excellent for what they are... a very reasonably priced, comfortable, wireless headset with really good sound. I do not use them for gaming but use them for video chat. In fact, I use them literally every night for at least an hour and have not had a single complaint on either side! I love them the only thing that would make them more ideal would be if they were bluetooth connected as opposed to a wireless dongle as it is kinda large. But you take your tradeoffs. Larger dongle, larger antenna, better reception and therefore better quality of sound and end user happiness with the product. All in all 5 stars for value, design and this end user's happiness with the product.

B0010X745K|5.0|It is a rare thing, a horror movie that not only frightens but truly surprises. And that is why The Mist is one of my favorite movies of the last decade. Based on one of Stephen King's best and most Lovecraftian stories, The Mist tells the story of the aftermath of a particularly bad storm on a small town in Maine. The town supports a military instillation, one that apparently is engaged in some top secret research. The storm unleashes something from behind, and whatever it is, it hides in the mist.<br /><br />The main characters are trapped in a supermarket, with the mist surrounding them. And as the tension builds inside the building, the people inside become as dangerous as whatever is hiding in the shadows. The movie is loyal to the book, and this is yet another instance of Stephen King taking a simple but brilliant idea and crafting it into a stunningly horrifying masterpiece.<br /><br />It's rare that I worry too much about spoilers in a review. After all, it comes with the territory. But I don't want to say too much about The Mist. It shouldn't be ruined. There's simply too much to enjoy.<br /><br />The Mist is one of Frank Darabont's greatest works, and many of the actors in the film went on to star in The Walking Dead. He is an uncompromising talent, as The Mist reveals in soul-crushing grandeur.<br /><br />5 Stars
B005F3XV62|5.0|My 9 year old daughter is very set on being a Zookeeper when she grows up and this movie fits her perfectly! Fun, silly, and full of energy, she watches this movie over and over! We love this movie!!

B009NH6AOQ|2.0|Getting into mid-flight, then crashing again. That was season 3.<br /><br />So after the fascinatingly terrible second season we kick off the third season with a bang, the doofi haven't come up with a plan or anything but they're wandering aimlessly getting by when they find the prison and plan to make that their home due to it's impenetrable walls. The first half of season 3 is, actually pretty damn enjoyable! Rick's team scrambling to get their s*** together was pretty entertaining while Andrea's encounter with the Governor was pretty interesting. Unlike the second season where the actors sat around a farm and waited for their knuckle-dragging fanboys to shower them with money and praise, this season interesting things actually happen and the 7th Heaven conversations are vastly minimized to bare necessity.<br /><br />Rick's group was the most entertaining part of the show. A few major characters are unexpectedly killed off in gruesome ways and after one problem is dealt with another pops up. I guess it's because we're familiar with these people now that they all have a place in the situation instead of sitting around bored. The acting is still hammy and forced, especially by Rick who does the worst American accent I've seen in awhile. Apparently American's grunt all the time. His descent into madness though was nicely done. Carl also steps his game up this season, instead of annoying his parents and me, he has hardened into the situation and his actor doesn't play it cutesy or whatever. Short Round also steps his game up when he sees Rick going crazy, so it was nice seeing some development with these characters, lord knows it was long overdue but at least it's finally here.<br /><br />Then we got the other storyline with the Governor, and it was pretty interesting when you're first introduced to Woodbury. However a few episodes in this supposed badass Governor seemed to enjoy nothing more then sitting around drinking with Andrea and discussing their feelings, I wouldn't be too surprised if there's a scene they left on the cutting floor with both of them reading Cosmopolitan too. His arc is slow and boring, which was a bad call considering the producers want him to be a memorable villain. Basically after his eye's taken out he becomes a surly douche who is hellbent on destroying Rick and his gang for flimsy reasons, then the last scene you see him in he finally snaps into what we've been hinted at for an entire season.<br /><br />Andrea is also boring with her token black friend, I got little to no impression that they're friends, instead they seemed more like survivor acquaintances who at the first sign of shelter start snapping and b***hing at each other like rabid hyenas. Her arc was interesting regarding that she's one of the main characters in the comic who's still around. In the show, she goes to Woodbury, sleeps with the governor, wonders if he has some screws loose when she finds his human heads collection, tries to resolve the tensions between groups, then gets killed. Wow. I mean, half the season was dedicated to this sole character who slowly pieces together for 12 episodes \\"governor... BAD!\\", and then abruptly dies. I mean the surprise was nice but what a waste of time that ends up being watching this expendable character sit around, drink, and wonder if something's wrong.<br /><br />Michonne, like a malignant tumor, grew on me. At first she just glared at everyone/everything and clutch onto her unbreakable katana afraid everyone will take it. However once I got endless vapid dialogue with the other characters comparing periods her silence became welcoming to me, and I ended up liking her by the end of the season. Merle also comes back this season, but he basically just plays governor's lackey until he's betrayed, then turns into angsty jerk that no one likes. Like Michonne however, he was pretty straight-forward and not too talky which worked fine for me, also Michael Rooker is a great actor so he brought some dimension to Merle's character.<br /><br />So after the midseason finale when the governor's pissed off and Rick's going crazier, the show kind of just stops. They could've excluded the last couple of episodes and still worked. Instead we got many filler episodes, such as Rick running into the black dude from the first episode, and Andrea getting chased by the governor for an entire episode. Why did they even do that? Why did they bloat out a solid first half into more nothing? Why do the Walking Dead writers hold so much contempt for their fans? Why not end this season 12 episodes in or something, keep it lean and solid, or go the extra mile and give the season a clear resolution with the governor/rick's conflict, and make season 3 a knock-out? Oh yeah, because AMC doesn't care about quality.<br /><br />So season 3 definitely picks up from the soggy turd that was season 2 (really though there was no where to go but up), but flails and crashes after the halfway mark into another bafflingly mishandled season of the walking dead. It looks like the production team blew their entire budget on the first half then slapped a few filler episodes together centered around one character, and called it a day. So instead of this being a solid good season, it's a few good episodes, followed by nothing, followed by a giant middle finger, followed by credits. Really though, they promised for the finale 27 deaths, then it turns out that almost all of them were unimportant stock characters shot off screen. I'll give the writers this, they're intune with their fans pleads for mercy. They hated Lori, she died. They hated Andrea, she died.<br /><br />So all in all it concludes into a mildly diverting tv show, but it's never really scary, exciting, or engaging. The zombie apocalypse is still poorly shown and instead of a grittier more realistic survivalism story we still see characters sit around not doing too much. The gun handling in this is still laughably bad and the pacing gets progressively more sluggish as the season shambles along. Really though I've long given up higher expectations for this show, the fact that thousands of fans showered this season with praise before they even finished it (finale date - 3/31/13) shows that TWD fans are, still, gullible morons who see nothing wrong with paying $40 for another half assed season.<br /><br />P.S. Nice 5 star reviews that are 2 vague sentences of praise written by many people who have only reviewed The Walking Dead Season 3. F***ing viral marketing, how does that work?mension to Merle's character.<br /><br />So after the midseason finale when the governor's pissed off and Rick's going crazier, the show kind of just stops.

B008ODZNLG|5.0|I was really prepared to be bored by this film despite the reviews.  However I was pulled in by the story.  It is a testimony to the human spirit and to the rewards of discipline and the pursuit of perfection.

Yes at times it's just dumb but it's also funny and I think thats what makes it fun... also having two of my favorite funny people in it just adds to the fun.

0470876417|4.0|I purchased this book after seeing its Business Model Canvas (BMC) used very effectively in team entrepreneurship competition.  I read it and used the BMC very effectively when restructuring a national business development division, but I felt that I was using my own knowledge and knowledge from other sources to complete the canvases more than the information in this book.  While this is a lovely book and is beautifully designed, it simply seemed to lack the no-nonsense information to maximize its potential.<br /><br />Recently, while completing my MBA, I took an entrepreneurship class in which the professor used this book and the BMC but paired it with _The Startup Owner's Manual_ (Blank & Dorf).  Having another volume to fill in the blanks completely changed my view on this book and allowed me to dramatically improve my BMC's.  I am currently using this book's canvasses as the blueprint for 2 new ventures and will continue to use it as an intrapreneurial tool to drive innovation in larger companies and divisions.<br /><br />Overall, the Business Model Canvas is brilliant - even game-changing - and deserves 5 stars.  The rest of the book, while pretty, is really a 3-star book.  Averaging the two, I give this book 4 starts.<br /><br />Verdict: this book is a must-have for entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs but requires an additional text to maximize initial use.

This demands a versatile shoe.<br /><br />the shoes seem to be true to size.<br /><br />they are nice enough to that they don't look ridiculous with khaki's, but rugged enough to stand up to the elements.<br /><br />the soles seem flexible, but strong and these shoes are absolutely waterproof.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Have really enjoyed playing this game from the minute I downloaded it.  You will too, if you like the match 3 type of games.  It was a good one to add to my collection!
0307960471|3.0|Honestly, while I love Scandinavian mysteries..something about the cold, bleak setting is so good along with a murder ...this has never been my favorite series. And this is perhaps my least favorite in the series. I think part of the problem is that the books are not being published in order in English, and Hole's checked past maybe needs to be uncovered logically. I have never felt that I have really gotten to know Harry, and in this one even less than usual.<br /><br />I found this plot particularly confusing and Harry particularly unlikable.<br />Great ending, I will give it that, which maybe accounts for the three stars.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Despite its all to short life, I consider Firefly to be one of the best TV series I have ever seen. The depth of the characters and masterful acting really pull you into the world. Firefly also has a perfect mix of lighthearted humor and seriousness that keeps you watching. Admittedly, the &#34;space western&#34; theme is strange at first, but It is done so well that you will be craving more.
0385349947|1.0|There has to be something cynical on the part of the publisher in its decision to promote this book.  The core irony of a woman who used elite institutions, money, and social connections to make a quick rise to the super-rich telling middle-class women to rely on risk-taking, determination and chutzpah to get to the top could not possibly escape any decently intelligent, literary individual.<br /><br />The publisher's decision to ignore that base hypocrisy and promote this book as a legitimate guide for women to follow reflects its, and Sandberg's, true belief about feminism: that it is a concept merely to be exploited for profit and personal gain when the opportunity presents itself.
B00023B1LC|3.0|This movie can solidly stand on it's own legs for fans of the Action & Adventure cinematic genre.<br />Although they never (originally) intended to launch a franchise with this film, it lays a solid foundation for the the 21st Century Cinematic Bourne Franchise - which gets better as it goes, and creates its own distinct universe separate from the Ludlum novels.<br /><br />However - Literary fans of the Espionage/Spy Thriller genre, or passionate devotees of Ludlum's intricately detailed, masterfully woven novel may be \\"left flat\\" in this screenplay & adaptation. While the 1980 novel and this 2002 film bear the same name, that is about all they share in common. Much like Jason C. Bourne and \\"Jason C. Bourne\\" (after Tam Quan: 3-25-68), that is where the similarities in character and conduct end. If the original 1980 novel is a three-dimensional cube, pyramid or well-rounded sphere, this theatrical version is a flat square, triangle or circle, The novel gets your adrenaline racing and on the edge of your seat through literary gifts of richly detailed, nuanced prose with characters that you are emotionally invested in. This 2002 film depends upon the gifts of the genre (music, quick cuts, camera angles, the famous car chase) to get the same result, wrapped in Eurostyle type and 21st Century graphics.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />(Medusa Operatives Only Allowed Past This Point)<br /><br />From the minute the protagonist is fished out of the water, the film starts to veer away from the novel.<br />Like it's action sequences, the film moves through the plot at a hyper speed, leaving no time for the details from the novel. Significant mysteries are revealed/solved within the first 15 minutes - effectively degenerating this into an interchangeable \\"chase\\" film with waifish protagonists & incompetent/corrupt CIA ops, rather than a master spy & espionage saga with unique characters. Its goal is to impress its audience with speed, not substance.<br />The literary character of \\"Bourne\\" himself perhaps suffers the most as a result.<br /><br />* There is no anatomical or psychological explanation given as to why \\"Bourne\\" has lost his memory, and the way the character is on screen, we don't really care or feel his pain - just superficial sympathy for him.<br /><br />* From the fact that \\"Bourne\\" has been missing for only two weeks in the movie, to the fact that the CIA is revealed in the first 15 minutes (with Treadstone diminished to a mere subdivision), it sacrifices the espionage-driven depth that made the novel a page turner.<br />By this point, we know who \\"Bourne\\" is, and who he's working for. In the novel, \\"Bourne\\" has people coming at him from EVERY direction of the multi-layered lie that is his life. In the more two-dimensional film,  there is only Treadstone after him. Also in the novel, \\"Bourne\\" was literally \\"one-of-a-kind.\\" Here, his \\"hunters\\" have all the same skills & training, cheapening him into one of many interchangeable assassins.<br /><br />* By the time \\"Bourne\\" makes it to the bank (again, only 15 minutes into the film) we see the first hint of distinction between the film's  \\"Bourne\\" and the literary one. This one is NOT the \\"Master-of-His-Situation,\\" but is in perpetual reaction to everything around him. In the novel, the character maintained self control. even without his identity. Here he looks like a little lost boy that we feel sorry for because he's been out in the cold all night. The way that treasured materials from the safety deposit box are handled is panicked like a burglar - neither elegant or dignified like the character from the novel.<br /><br />* The literary \\"Bourne\\" does everything in his power to stay \\"off the grid\\" and inconspicuous while unraveling the mystery of his past. For this movie showcasing special effects & car chases, that's quickly discarded as Damon's \\"Bourne\\" does everything in his power to create as many \\"scenes\\" as possible. Any talents of \\"Bourne\\"'s from the novel that are incorporated into the film (scaling walls, etc....) lose their impact because they're unfortunately one of many special effects.<br /><br />* The character of Marie also \\"pays a price,\\" as here her loyalties are bought & paid for with some cash, eliminating the conflict between the two characters and the gradual growth of their relationship as seen in the novel.<br /><br />By 1 hour and 22 minutes into the two-hour movie, you're so saturated in the action that you find yourself either forgetting or just not caring that the character has amnesia. By the end of the movie, you really don't CARE about the characters (even \\"Bourne\\"), you're just being entertained by them.<br /><br />The novel leaves a strong lasting impression, this movie is more of a \\"quickie,\\" neither thought about, reflected on, or appreciated (beyond special effects) after it's over.
B008D36INE|2.0|I may not have given this film enough time.. 45 minutes? But the editing was choppy so could not enjoy performances, then finally gave up
B00007KWHG|5.0|I grew up listening to these guys and the songs bring back all the memories from the 60's and 70's.  I saw \\"Jersey Boys\\" and went right out to get this CD.  All the best songs!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|One of the best 007 movies yet - action all over the place and keeps you glued to the screen.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Every song is fantastic.  There are a couple she should release as singles (the one having to do with Love).  Highly recommend this CD.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am new to photography, this bag has lots of compartments, for filters, media cards, cleaning supplies and the lot.  the cushions are sufficient for my camera.  I have room for my three lenses, and camera.  I would need a new bag if I buy a larger lenses.
B005ZUR724|5.0|It's a great mmorpg for the kindle fire and for any handheld devices, I would definitely recommend it to any mmo player
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I am a big lover of New Kids...all the way back to when I had posters on my wall.  This new album is so good!!...I haven't stopped playing it all day.  If you are a big New Kid fan like me...this is a must buy!
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|I'm so happy Michael did this album...GREAT!!!!  Michael's &#34;take&#34; on the Motown sound is incredible...Thanks Michael, great as usual, you at your best!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very entertaining and enjoyable. Kept my attention even with the &quot;The Voice&quot; on! Fun game can't wait for more fun.
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|The item is ok. It works but could be better supported with drivers. I recommend it to anyone that play games
B0044DEAUA|4.0|IIt is one of the best things I've ever purchased hands down. My only reason behind 4 stars rather than 5 is that when set volume to the loudest it doesn't sound as clear; But that aside... AWESOME.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|When I started reading this book, I did not want to put it down!  A story of starting over, suspense, and love.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|the kids are loving it, looks super fun but i haven't actually played it yet. Graphics seem great as well!
B002L5KL5G|5.0|Loved this movie when it came out and loved showing it to our 14 year old son...yes, it may be sappy and a bit unrealistic, but the storyline is moving and sends great messages about the &#34;good and bad&#34; in all people and the power of the choices we make!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a very complex and compelling storyline that takes the reader on quite a journey.  From loving the &#34;gone girl&#34; to seeing her as the monster she really is, this is an exciting and twisted tale of love and obsession in directions you will never suspect!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun game and quit addicting.  Good for all ages and skill levels.  Kepps you playing until the end.
B00BJO5SXK|4.0|Im a fan of Mostly Rock music but probably over a year now ive been listening to various types of musical genres. One day in March of 2011 a friend told me to listen to a group called Odd Future. I did and I immediately liked almost all of the artists in the group. But I gravitated toward Tyler, The Creator , Frank Ocean , and MellowHype. I loved Bastard it was dark and I loved it. Very Raw and filled with Raw Emotions it was great. Since then ive been anticipating Goblin for so long. And when it came out it was a big disappointment it was just bad. It was to immature and childish. A couple good songs came from that album such as Radicals, Goblin,Analog,Sandwitches,Yonkers, and She. So after that I was Worried about this album and Im glad to say it was FANTASTIC. He matured as a artist and a songwriter its the Perfect music for Summer and had a really cool vibe to it. It tells a story of a boy at a camp called Camp Flog Gnaw its the best Tyler album since Bastard. This is a Much buy. Its nearly perfect except for a 2 songs but overall its Fantastic. 9.5/10
B0055SWM08|5.0|My sister showed me this game and I was instantly addicted! I love it! The puzzles are challenging and the graphics are beautiful. The game play has been steady with no glitches or freeze ups! Worth the whole buck!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Works as it should. It holds your laptop up above your desk, and looks good doing it. Extra words to get to 20...
B004HMQ7BI|3.0|Marisa Tomei is such a great actress....so good at portraying the main character as a self-absorbed and silly woman that the movie is at times hard to watch.  Great and attractive performances by Downey Jr, as always, and Bonnie Hunt is the saving grace!
0061906220|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite books. Super cute rhymes and songs.  She knows all the words and often asks to read about Pete.  Highly recommend.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have been trying this app for a month and am uninstalling it. It malfunctioned from day one but I waited to see if it eould get fixed but it never did; it actually got worse. Now it refuses to function in too many different ways to list, 9 out of 10 times. This app really sucks; I just use the regular internet to access Facebook from my Kindle. Doing it this way has its own problems but is nowhere near as bad as the app, which is pretty sad. The only reason I gave it a star is because this review thingy would not let me give it zero.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch ( who will never be type casted with a name like his ) is brilliant in his portrayal of a Young Sherlock Holmes. And only an actor as great as Martin Freeman can stand up to Cumberbatch's Holmes. Not only are the stories great to watch but the chemistry between them and the rest of the cast is marvelous !!!!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A great novel. Exasperating at times but goes perfectly with the theme.  This is especially for those who believe that there is no hope for them and being able to overcome obstacles despite their attempts at self destruction
0553801473|5.0|This is one of those books I regret not picking up years earlier. Reading the entire series back to back is a study in well developed characters, places as well as interweaving plot lines.The violence is brutal, the politics are cutthroat, the magic is understated but no less potent. For those who like the genre, A song of Fire and Ice is an immersion into the realms of fantasy.
B009R5GR1K|4.0|Had used The Free Dictionary by Farlex (basic) for over a year, but found there were often words not included in the dictionary.  Although it cost $3.99 to update to Pro, I'm glad I did because it is more comprehensive.  Worth the 4 bucks!
B00AA0U046|5.0|Beautiful record. I think this record has an awesome sound, very rich from a non experts perspective. I also enjoyed all the included art.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Liked the show but the quality of the streaming was bad. The show was interrupted half a dozen times. Very poor streaming.
B000P0J09M|2.0|DVD packaging and quality were high rated, but DVD stopped playing midway into the movie. Other than that I would've rated the product highly.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|The Griffen PowerJolt Lighting Car Charger is an extremely well made charger. The quality of the cable is greater than that of even the Apple original cable. It also charges the phone extremely rapidly. I am buying the other Griffen cables for my iPhone 5 as they seem to be the only company who makes really high quality Lightnight cables.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The  format is just not to my liking. My Kindle Fire is a new product to me so perhaps I am just not use to the smaller screen.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you love Downton Abby you will love this series! Next to Downton Abby this is best show ever made!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie was excellent to watch.  It was no wonder Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar for this movie.  Wonder if Liam Neeson is kicking himself in the ass for not staying with this film.  The only problem I have with this film, is that when Daniel Day-Lewis acts as Lincoln, you have to literally turn up the volume on your TV.  WHY??  Because Lincoln was supposed to have been soft spoken.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|This series is excellent. The acting is wonderful and the scripts are witty and intelligent. I have been a fan of Stephen Moffat since I saw Coupling. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Outstanding movie.  Very good acting and an amazing deptiction of a great story.  Wonderful for the whole family.  Must see!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider from mobilityware I play it all the time keeps my mind sharp and clear also when I run water for calves while I wait I play the games
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The violence and death were a little much. This book made me cry. I am glad I finished it. The book was good and Suzanne Collins finished the series well. I had to finish reading it because I couldn't stop thinking about how it was going to end. I still recommend this book but keep in mind there is a lot of death.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|The Downton Abbey story is perhaps the best written drama I have ever seen.  We never get tired of watching it.  We also purchased Gosford Park by the same author, which also starred Maggie Smith.  Maggie Smith really carried the Downton Abbey series because she is so perfectly cast as the Dowager Countess.  She's the best.
B00B9LNLTQ|3.0|You would've thought that after reading all the features on The Strokes back around the time of the release of their 2011 album Angles that New York's saviors of rock `n roll were through. All the non-talking. The separate conversations. The Julian Casablancas-bashing. For all intents and purposes this band seemed to be an albatross hanging around the neck of each one of these scruffy New York rockers. I mean, even Angles -as encouraging as it seemed- for the most part was a forced leg push into a pair of skinny jeans that no longer fit the not-so-skinny leg of any one the Strokes dudes. It had its moments of smiling nostalgia and angular coolness. But a track like `Life Is Simple in the Moonlight' reminded us that Casablancas was still very much calling the shots and that the word \\"band\\" is a relative term in the Strokes vernacular. So when `One Way Trigger' hit our earholes a couple months ago in lieu of the release of The Strokes new long player Comedown Machine, it was a surprise to say the least. It's new wave-heavy lean -complete with 80s synth-y goodness, the Casablancas falsetto in full force, and the obvious head nod to A-ha's `Take On Me'- were although not a return to gritty New York gutter rock `n roll, it was a great pop song. `All The Time' followed with more of a classic Strokes sound with some excellent guitar work by the Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond, Jr. So The Strokes are back, right? Well, sorta.<br /><br />Comedown Machine is a great pop album. This should come as no surprise because The Strokes are a great pop band. They've always written pop songs. Sometimes they're disguised as gritty CBGBs-era post punkers. Sometimes they put on their best Cars moves and plunk the synths a bit. Sometimes though, the actual Strokes come through in their songs and in actuality, The Strokes are some pretty strange cats. First Impressions of Earth seems to be that album everyone points to and says that's where everything fell apart. Well, yes and no. Sure, I think that record created a huge divide between the band, but it's also the most honest piece of art those bratty rich kids ever made. It's weird, bloated, out there, and true to the five completely unique individuals that make up this band. Casablancas had his own ideas and spewed them onto the even weirder -and at some points throughout- wonderful Phrazes for the Young. Comedown Machine is five friends getting over themselves and having fun making music again. It's a do-over. Songs like `Tap Out', `One Way Trigger', '80s Comedown Machine', and `Slow Animals' are The Strokes at their poppy and weirdly best. `All The Time', '50/50′, and `Partners In Crime' are The Strokes putting on the leather jackets and chips firmly back on their shoulders and playing some angular and gritty rock `n roll.<br /><br />Comedown Machine won't blow minds. But sometimes all you need are a great batch of tunes. Well here they are.hink that record created a huge divide between the band, but it's also the most honest piece of art those bratty rich kids ever made.

B009BJAPLK|5.0|The series is great. Pretty much what I said about series 2. The video is great quality. There are only 3 episodes but they're about 90 min each. It's definitely worth it.
1475972350|5.0|A few of the reviews mention that this book may be one that fans of the show \\"Criminal Minds\\" may find that they will like, and I would agree with that.  It really does, at times, read almost like an episode of the show.  However, the author is in no way at all even remotely close to being a copy of \\"Criminal Minds\\".  His story is refreshing and uniquely his own, just that if you do watch shows similar to that mentioned, you begin to read the book as if you are read-watching an episode.  It's really very... for lack of a better word, cool.<br /><br />There are times where the story becomes fairly predictable so you sort of know what's going on rather early on and the detectives don't.  You figure out certain things (which I am not telling, go read the book and you will figure out what I'm talking about... go on, go read it) very quickly and kind of put two and two together and can kind of see where things are going, however, this isn't a bad thing!  In some books it would be.  In this book, it's not a bad thing at all because even though you may have figured things out, you still must wait for it all to play out so even if you know something 50 pages before the detectives, guess what?  You still have to wait those 50 pages to find out what will happen when they figure it out and you can't jump in the pages and tell them!  When the end comes, it's a good satisfying ending that leaves you waiting for the next adventure these two detectives will embark upon.<br /><br />This book has some good gory serial killer parts so if you don't like gore, well, you should like it and read this book or you will be missing out!  My one objection and it might be a small spoiler so I will warn just a little bit right here.  This might be a spoiler and you have been warned.  My one problem with the whole things, and I know it wasn't graphic and it had a very good purpose and stuff, but oh not the animals!!  Just kill the people but oh woe is me, leave the animals be!!  Ok, that was all(it was a super quick non-graphic part but I cry easily with animal things, I admit it.  I'm a total sap with the animal things but I don't mind the literary people slashing).  Aside from that tiny little thing, I really enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading more from this author in the future.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have downloaded this game on my iphone and Fire. My 4 year old and I have tons of fun together. I enjoy playing it by myself, as well. It triggers some happy memories of taking care of my horses as a kid.  My only problems with the game are the ads that seemed to start popping up all of the sudden (I would pay to get rid of them!) & more gems for completing the tasks!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great app. Very creative and it is a great boredom-killer. My 11 y/o sister and 7 y/o brother and I are very into this game. It's an enjoyable game! But I rate 4 stars because nobody is perfect! :) thanks for this great app!!

B0042MDAL8|5.0|Another winner from Stephanie Meyer.  The third in a series of 5 movies.  It has everything you could want, love, suspense, thrills, action, and good looking guys with no shirts on.  What more could a girl ask for :)

B00A77II0U|4.0|I thought the Plot was a bit far fetched and not backed up well in the storyline,  but it was fun and it looked really good
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really like it. Reminds me of how I used to play with them when I was little. Super cute!!!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I enjoyed the book. The descriptions of food made me want to be there . The French/English language interplay was a pleasure. The sudden unexpected ending caught me by surprise, but was so logical I should have seen it.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|Usually when you get the soundtrack from the film, its done in a studio or prerecorded but since they did all the music live while filming, this means its pretty much just the audio from the film. Its nice to hear on good tracks like &#34;Look Down&#34;, &#34;The Bishop&#34; &#34;Who Am I&#34; &#34;Master of the House&#34; &#34;Stars&#34; and &#34;Do you Hear the people Sing?&#34; to name a few good tracks, but the rest of the time it sounds kind of bad. I felt that the 1980's version did a better job over all since it was more song and less useless audio (like people walking).
B004EPYZQC|5.0|the gang is back! i luv, luv, luv this movie. all the great characters from the past movies are reunited in fast five. vin diesel is so amazing and thae cars? wow. if you love this franchise, then this is a must for your collection!
B007G51UV0|5.0|The Asus P8Z77-V PRO works as a replacement for my old HP custom computer system.  I like features such as dual intelligent processors, Wi-Fi GO!, Fan Xpert 2, and USB 3.0 Boost.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works perfectly with my Nexus 7. Jellybean 4.2.2.<br /><br />I haven't seen any porn ads. In fact, the ads are barely noticeable. If I did see any I would complain directly to the developer instead of giving a perfectly functioning app a low rating.<br /><br />I suppose they should create an a paid version without ads. I would certainly be willing to pay for this app but the free version works perfectly.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I like match 3 games as they give me a break from daily work. have played several versions of this game. this one is just as much fun and easy.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This app is perfect to keep your motivation going. Seeing every day other people in the world sitting with you and knowing that we are all in this together.<br />I also love all the option for sounds, very beautiful and inspiring.<br />The new groups is also a way to share and get feedback on your practice.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I've never been a huge Bring Me the Horizon fan mostly because I'm not a huge fan of deathcore and the extremely heavy stuff but where there are good riffs and smooth and catchy melodies, I shall appear and take note. This record by BMTH is incredibly produced and overall, the instrumentation is impressive along with vocals that can be understood by the average music listener. I also appreciate Mr. Sykes learning how to sing clean vocals for a couple tracks because it really does sound good and creates a full, dense record with twists and turns rather than a straightforward, head-banging on every track record. I shall now do a song by song review with a few words to summarize my feelings towards the tunes.<br /><br />1. \\"Can You Feel My Heart\\" 8/10 - An incredibly different way of starting a BMTH record, with synths and electronic instrumentation. This song didn't strike me as good at first but it has grown on me and now I can truly appreciate this song for what it is, an introduction to change. The vocals are very good on this track.<br /><br />2. \\"The House of Wolves\\" 8/10 - A classic metalcore tune with harsh vocals and some catchy pieces. The headbanging commences on this song, I really like the lyrics on this track and the guitar riff is very catchy and cleverly simple.<br /><br />3. \\"Empire (Let Them Sing)\\" 10/10 - One of my favorites on the record, the opening guitar riff is just so heavy and catchy, it makes me headbang. Just an overall great track with great vocals and strong instrumentation.<br /><br />4. \\"Sleepwalking\\" 10/10 - Another killer track, I love the chorus, so much emotion within the story of the song, it has inspired me in more ways than one. I love this song, if there is a song just to download onto your ipod, it's this one.<br /><br />5. \\"Go To Hell, For Heaven's Sake\\" 9/10 - A very good track, more of a modern metal piece with a very catchy chorus. I love the drums on this track, great rhythm and beats.<br /><br />6. \\"Shadow Moses\\" 11/10 - My favorite track on the record, I never thought a single would be my favorite song on the record but this one is just incredible. The lyrics are wonderful, it's super heavy and catchy at the same time. Absolutely brilliant piece of music.<br /><br />7. \\"And The Snakes Start to Sing\\" 8/10 - It's a quieter, clean song with clean vocals. I love the lyrics, I love the tone but it's true that this song is a bit uneventful. Fans have been critics about this song and I can see there point of view, I still respect it for what it is but it certainly doesn't stand out as an incredible track.<br /><br />8. \\"Seen it All Before\\" 9/10 - I love this song so very much, the clean vocals are used excellantly on this track, great pace to this song, an overall masterpiece.<br /><br />9. \\"Antivist\\" 8/10 - A lot of swearing but a lot of fun, I really didn't like this song when it came out as a single but it has grown on me and I really enjoy the tone of the song. It's a little vulgar for me in places but I still like it.<br /><br />10. \\"Crooked Young\\" 9/10 - Another great track, sounds a bit like some older song that everyone is complaining about it sounding like but I do enjoy the violins to begin the song. It is very heavy and very well orchestrated.<br /><br />11. \\"Hospital of Souls\\" 6/10 - I really want to love this song but it's uneventful like \\"Snakes\\" and I really can't get into it. Maybe it'll take more time, I don't know. It's not a bad song but it's not as amazing as I want it to be. The lyrics are great but it's a dull song, I guess it really depends on taste.<br /><br />I highly recommend this record, as you can see by my ratings most of the songs are really good and the $9 bucks is worth it, check it out, support the band.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Not ease of movement between activities. Can make mistakes on posting and difficult to maneuver. Very slow to respond to commands. It's better than no App at all.<br /><br />This Amazon survey request also responds and submits painfully slow too!
B002SVBDYQ|4.0|Everyone has different taste and I've never been much for this type of music. Only downloaded it for two songs which were album only. The rest of the songs grew on me. Now it's one of my favorite movie soundtracks.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I won't claim to have tried every keyboard app but of the 4 or so I have, this is head and shoulders above them.<br /><br />I run it on my phone and nexus 7 tablet. Well worth the price.
B004WKI204|5.0|I absolutely love Tina's candid reflections on life, work and family. It's a great read and you'll literally laugh out loud.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love my new Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  I love that I was able to get a bright color like the orange one I got.  Usually when I look for things they are bland neutral colors.  I like that it stands up and I can put it on the table and read while I am eating or drinking coffee without having to hold it.
B00A83075M|1.0|It is sad that every movie I see reinforces people to be ignorant of human behavior and we pay the consequences.  The movie Wreck It Ralph does this with the behavioral repertoire of Ralph where he counters lines like, \\"You can't mess with the program Ralph\\" SO of course Ralph does the opposite of what he is told and all the sheople love it.  The puppets don't see that people behave exactly how they were trained when movies are not involved.  Plus, these sheople actually learn that if they behave differently then what they were told they were not just reinforced differently, they have free will.  URGH!!!!  People should learn the brain works through the contingencies of reinforcement and behavior can be reinforced that espouses propaganda OR behavior is conditioned to be the opposite of what we are told OR behavior is somewhere in between DEPENDING on the circumstances, real world variables NOT mentalism or made up illusions like free will.  If people are reinforced to behave differently then the propaganda they were fed then that is how they were programmed.  Anyone can also see \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\", (what is \\"good\\" for you can be \\"bad\\" for someone else and vice versa), are relative AND the consequences that occur on schedules of reinforcement are what determines behavior, but every human I encounter is reinforced to never understand the evidence. They think \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" are absolutes (LOL).  Therefore, every movie I see is a Wreck It Ralph clone AND we pay the price with pathetic entertainment and pathetic behavior.  People will always ignore The Reluctant Alliance: Behaviorism And Humanism that teaches people to facilitate effective humanism and reinforce trash like Wreck It Ralph to always rule!  SO have fun being a slave that makes movies like Wreck it Ralph to maintain your illusions that you are so free (LOL)!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|What can I say. It's Dexter. Just love the series. Good DVD!!! Quality and condition of movie as advertised on site.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Felt as though I was watching history.  The movie was believable and engaging.  If you enjoy historical movies this is a must see movie.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|All I can say is this one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.Would not recommend.
B008UTV6S8|4.0|The cd's are good - much as expected with all of his better known songs.<br /><br />The dvd had good sound and picture
B00APKIN1I|5.0|All hail to Dave Grohl! It is just so much fun to listen to each track and go through who is playing on each(McCartney, Springfield, Nielson, etc), and feel the intensity and whip smart energy. This thing kicks you in the face, and you ask for more.<br />This has become my early 2013 favorite, and I've had it only a few days.
B004EI2NM2|1.0|There is no chemistry between these two, the storyline bland and the setting is too dark.  I know the description states IN A ROOM, but I thought it would be better all around.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|The plot was not fully developed and left you with questions at the end.  As well there was crazy camera movement that made you dizzy.  Great idea but didn't like the execution.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|it's nice to share one of my childhood favorites with my own children. The sound and picture quality are great all at a great price!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Very easy to use when I need something quick even on my cell phone.. Just like it is reading my mind,. Finds what I am looking for fast
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Typical guy here... I love a good, mindless action fest, and Avengers delivers!<br /><br />So many reviews here I thought I would throw in my 2 cents.<br /><br />MOST of the characters in this movie have had their own movie or series of movies that lead upto the events of this movie... Though 2 of them are pretty pathetic when compared to the rest of the super heros.<br /><br />This is a great movie if you like Marvel super heros and the 2 not so super heros (fans will know who I am talking about). It is fun, lots of fighting and explosions, comic releif, and ten tons of computer graphics.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Get it if you aren't too big on good story plots or twists. Just mindless fun!
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|I have only tried it a couple of times, but I am having some trouble figuring out how to navigate the mouse past walls.  I did not see any instructions included, so I will probably delete this one.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I buy the latest season of Dexter for a friend every year, and then we watch it before New Years.  The only criticism I have is that the whole show is predicated on everyone around Dexter being blind def and dumb.  That gets kind of old after four seasons, but it's still fun to watch when you make an event out of it.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|i was skeptical because the other cd had like 3 or 4 hits that i liked out of the entire cd but this one, all the songs kind of intertwine with each other and like the cd title suggest its a mix of songs that one would consider unorthodox but all the songs work.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Thank you Susan Cain, for sharing your book with the world.  I related to so much in this book as I have been one of the &#34;Quiet&#34; ones my entire life.  After many years living, I have learned to accept and even love myself as I am, (and push out of my comfort zones often) however, had I read this book when I was much younger, it may have prevented some pain.  I recommend this book to young introverts everywhere!
B001AOKA3W|5.0|Good fun movie to watch with friends, I enjoyed myself. Its suspenseful in all the right ways I think, and it wont spare key characters, any one dies. lol
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it! I love zombie movies, and this show is a top-end zombie movie that keeps going! Love the story and each episode leaves you wanting more!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This app is great.  I like it because it is not difficult at all to figure to out and can be played by anyone.  It is a match game with a twist.  I am glad that I gave this one a try.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I actually haven't seen this, but I sent it off to my niece as a gift and she was very happy to get it.  Her parents told me she watched it several times before they finally couldn't take it one more time!
B009KUANWG|5.0|This is one of the best (maybe THE best) of the Bond songs. I love Adele's voice and song style.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game! It looks fantastic, the controls are great and all the sharks are cool to play. I hope there will be more expansion s in the future!
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I have 2 apple aps which do the same thing, and they are World's (and stars) better. The graphics here are poor, the ability to go back between screens is marginal and overall this is a lousy product.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|AI makes some strange choices at times but overall a very fun game to play, especially if you're into backgammon
B00AVL23YE|3.0|I wanted exchange email on my Kindle for work. I like Touchdown, but the free version only last so long then you have to buy it. I can access my work email with this app, but it has very limited options and I can't access my exchange calendar.<br /><br />I look at it as you get what you pay for and this is free. Set up was easy and it's pretty simple to use. I'd give this a better rating if more options were available like Touchdown.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|great app you need to put it on the apple app store for free and you will get tons of people get it because there are only a couple youtibe downloaded apps and they all cost money so get it on the apple app store
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the 'sync to furthest page read' feature. It makes it convenient when switch from Kindle Touch to PC and tablet.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|This book is simply amazing.  This book is a MUST read for everyone.  I can't say enough good things about it.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Th  search on Thu  app I  Great almost Bette  than a  Computer. It work  flawlessly on the fire and android  phone.. it  also great on Windows phone.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game!It's fun and cool to play with your friends on Facebook to see who gets the higher point! Great way to kill time and have fun when your bord!All my siblings and aunts and uncles love this game and toddlers will also enjoy it,too!Amazing game!!! I totally recommend this for anyone who's  looking a for a fun game to play when bord or to kill time!! It's for every one!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such an amazing , keep you on your toes, twisted story. An intriguing read definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a page turner!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I am not one of these guys who will go through each song, even though I could easily do so, not only on this release, but on every other one. I am a Rush fan through & through, & there are only 2 songs (yes, songs, not albums) that don't make me want to turn them up loud & try to sing like Geddy Lee (I can't, not by any stretch!).<br />This album is the hardest rocking album Rush has released since Caress of Steel, & the most musically complicated one they've ever done. The music is so intricate it makes you wonder how they can play it live - but they do! The album tells a story, but at the same time, the individual songs stand on their own, &, once one hears them a couple of times, they become very memorable. The story line, & hence, the music, can seem dark, but Rush speaks out a lot on social & political issues (lately) & have definitely leaned this way over the last couple of releases. That said, the music is easily accessible, much more so than with Snakes & Arrows, which I thought was much darker overall.<br />I would recommend this release to any serious Rush fan, & indeed, any true fan of hard rock - you will not be disappointed!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I loved Tom Cruise in this movie also. A lot of action and worth seeing. Suspense and action all in one movie.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wow great book could hardly put it down. Very well done all the way to the end. I highly recommend.
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie and happened to look it up. It was only $4! Such an amazing peice for a great movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is action packed and a fantasy and a book you have to force yourself to put down. It is a book for fantasy lover and to me this book has no flaws I can think of.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game.  I love playing this game.  Creating a town and making it work and make money is awesome.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've now read The Hunger Games trilogy twice. I'm contemplating reading them again. Every time I find something new or have a different perspective. It's amazing how you can relate the ridiculous scenarios to our current life. Very creative and full of imagery. Third book is quite graphic. I'm curious to see how the movie plays out. But very excited for Catching Fire!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the book.  Not a good review writer and don't care to write a review.  the book was great.  word
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|another wonderful cd by blake! wouldnt expect anything less from him<br /><br />Cant wait until his next cd to come out
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Interesting and well made movie that touches the human spirit. A must see for people of all ages and nations.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|So much fun to introduce my kids to this movie. Yes, it's corny, but also a lot of fun. Lots of action and excitement. There are some parts my kids and I weren't thrilled with, a little too adult oriented, but easily overlooked. Luckily, this movie is old enough that the makers were more interested in telling the story than in shoving nastiness in our faces. The story is fun, boy meets girl, evil scientist kidnaps girl, boy rescues girl. The soundtrack is fun, too. There's no such thing as too much Queen, is there?
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I read the book quite a while ago and thought I would not like a movie version. I was glued to my sofa. It was riveting and stunningly beautiful. I get bored with movies easily and can't sit through them, but not so with this one. Well done!
B00899F0G8|5.0|Thanks for another great season of Pretty Little Liars.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute.  I am a mature lady and I still love it.  Looking forward to next season.  What a shocker in the finality.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Our theme is monkey's so it's perfect that way and it's really cute but it also helps the baby keep the pacifier in and not just spit it out so my baby loves it and so do we.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|love the story it was hot!!!!!!!!!!!!! great writer kept you reading every day i could not put the book down
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love this story for many reasons. The three main ones are the blend of genres, my own obsession with JFK, and the ending. Most people have expressed extreme dislike of the ending but I feel any other wouldn't have worked as well. I love S.K.'s novels and this is probably my favorite.
B008OOYALE|2.0|It's not really a good product, I'm going to delete it and uninstall it from my device. I actually don't know why i installed it for the first place.
1608870081|5.0|my wife has been really a Harry Porter fan since her childhood. She loves this book as anniversary gift. The design of the book is really brilliant.
1405020458|5.0|My granddaughters loved this book!  They always requested I read them the original Gruffalo book over and over as it was a favorite.  Now they have a second favorite!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Good game-especially for a free game. Too much time wasted between moves. Needs a smoother transition from one room to the next.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was certainly not disappointed with this season. I am so hooked on Anna and Bates.......can't wait for it to continue!
B0015AARJI|4.0|A regular ps3 controller. The color was off a bit. Charcoal black instead of the plain black. No big deal.  I wish I didn't have to buy another controller.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|It's a great size, protects the kindle and fits into my purse. I didn't want to be carrying any more than I had to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the horse game. realistic, fun, addicted, enteraining, kills time, build exp, gems, gold to buy equipments and horses.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Some of the games freeze up and I cannot get facebook on my Kindle HD and I would like to be able to play games on it when I am out.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|we enjoyed the movie -- it went a little slow because it is quite intellectual. The acting was wonderful -- loved Sally Field as Mrs Lincoln
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Our poor Matthew.....but whats to follow? Mary will certainly pull thru and go on to pull Downton Abbey out of their crisis.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Excellent can't wait to finish the series or for the<br />City of bones movie to be released in August!! Great job Cassandra!!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Only con is repetitive ,[find the object tasks). Would have enjoyed more variety. Will buy the sequel. Fun way to spend a lazy day. Hatred to put it down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|couldn't stop reading from the first page, read all three books in no time at all. I have recommended it
B00006LJ79|5.0|Love the band, the CD only took a couple of days to get to my house after purchase. And I haven't stop listening to it since.
1608871452|5.0|i absolutely loved this book and all of the extras that came with....a must for any supernatural fan....very happy with my purchase
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's fun to figure out where you need the coins to get the pride to drop!  GREAT GAME - ADDICTIVE!
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|It's good for children to watch because there is no cursing...not much humor and very very slow and long !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good story. Couldn't put it down. Way to go Mir Lyn Kelly...gonna read another one. Jus not enough hours n a day!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|shocking ending with a punch,so not expected but so fitting with the story when you review the body of the  book  more then just a good story.  Read it.
B008VBYN80|1.0|BE successful on this game by buying successful units.  U will grow to hate game growth.  Army is much better because u do not have to buy all the challenges.  This game averages $2 per challenge. And what a waste all of them are......  Good luck!
B00B9EQS98|5.0|We just watched this yesterday.  My son and I saw it in the theater when it came out and he LOVES it!  We could watch it over and over again!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting perspective and enlightening. I've always believed in the NDE and this gave confirmation of my thoughts on the subject
B005H9B44A|5.0|AWESOME!!  Very funny, action packed, not much cursing (if any).... not a dull moment .... clean enough for children to watch ...love some Thor!
B00650SSDU|3.0|A fun movie but nothing you haven't seen before.  JT is a good actor and he shows his range here and of course the uber-hot Mila Kunis is adorable as always.  Mila gets the 'flighty, too cool for school, I could leave you at any point' persona that a lot of young actresses in this types of movies get.  I would imagine it's aimed at making the character feel like she's the ultimate catch and must be pursued by our male protagonist.  Also, giving such young characters six figure salary jobs rips this from reality a bit.  Not saying that doesn't happen in reality, but it doesn't happen enough for this to be a movie for realistic people.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is the relationship JT's character has with his Dad, and the best scene (in my opinion), is the one in the airport.  If you have ever known someone, or known of someone, who has suffered (or is suffering) from Alzheimer's, then this scene should hit you in the feels.<br /><br />As I wrote, all-in-all, a slightly above average take on things we've seen before.  Especially the end; it was just a different twist on a cliche ending.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! It's so addicting and every season keeps getting better and better. Can't wait for season 4!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book captivated me.  Excellent read. Very well written. I didn't want to put the book down. RIP Chris Kyle...
B005HSL626|3.0|My husband really likes this game...It makes me feel a little anxious. I prefer to play the pipeline games. Want more of a brain teaser.
B000S88JTS|5.0|Very Well Done, love the extra footage, came very quik, Great shape, manty,many Thanks.  Our MX reunion will love this one.
B004JHYRP4|4.0|It was a bit hard to follow at times and I never found out what happened to the para-men. It seemed unfinished.
B001UG56ES|2.0|I think you can learn more about Australia from &#34;The Man from Snowy River&#34; or &#34;McLeod's Daughters&#34; vs. this movie...I was sadly shocked at how much we didn't like it...and it was that way for almost 3 hours!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love this product, everyone should have it. This product really does product your kindle and with kids this is important
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I've played alot of HOS games but this one was simply that.  You didn't have to figure out anything.<br />It was all done for you.  As long as you complete the HOS's you basically win the game.  Too simple<br />to believe it came from G5.  I'm not sure I'll even play the sequal if it comes out.  Somewhat dissapointed G5!!!!!
032147404X|5.0|This was a very helpful and fun book. It has so much information that you can use.  it is like having a very knowledgeable friend next to you helping.
B0087EACJK|5.0|well at first i didnt like it but then i got the hang of it it cool to play show your friends and family thogeher
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Really really good movie. Glad I rented it. Brings back memories of all the times I watched his movies and TV stuff.
B000C8STLC|5.0|Wonderful listening especially in a car with a premium stereo system and good bass.  The spaghetti western theme adds an unusual sound for an Enya album, but one which makes the album more interesting.  All said, I wish it had more cuts on it.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Makes you appreciate not only the greats who founded this genre but how much Mick and the rest were influenced and appreciate those great blues-men!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen lately. The characters were very absorbing and the story showed a face to Lincoln that has not been shown before. His sense of humor and storytelling showed a more human side of him. The frustration of his cabinet was also forthright. Loved it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I finished this in a couple days while I was on vacation and it was such an enjoyable read. The characters are so well developed and the storyline is easily relatable, even though my own high school years were ages ago. Highly recommend.
B000VFGSI2|5.0|Glenn Gould was an extraordinary artist. I have long been a fan of his 1980 Bach Goldberg Variations. Living in a small town/rural area, the local record stores have stocked very little classical music and jazz, so opportunities to acquire and hear great recordings like this were few. I was already familiar with these Beethoven sonatas, though, through recordings by Alfred Brendel and Daniel Barenboim, and Gould tops those, particularly Brendel's whose playing strikes me as being so eccentric to be unlistenable. Gould slows the tempo a bit in Pathetique and Moonlight and a lot on the Appassionata, which changes the interpretations in the direction of clarity, while still bringing out the beauty of the harmonic and melodic structures. Gould's overtones are crystal clear, but unlike Brendel's don't overwhelm through pedal tones and excessive speed of playing. Gould does not need to show off what jazzmen call chops, but works his way through the pieces - all three among Beethoven's most famous - and leaves the listener awed by the emotional majesty Gould evokes. Perhaps some of this is due to Gould's mastery of studio techniques, but even with that said, these recordings are outstanding.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Spellbinding novel. Keeps you tied trying to figure out what is coming next. I can't wait to start nook two.
B0091REZMW|3.0|having minor episodes of game freezes and long game play loading times. still giving the game a chance then will decide.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Once again I am thrilled to be reading such a good book. Mr. Larsson continues to make the story of Lisabeth and Mikhail a hard one to down.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|thanks to this app I sleep much better.  I love how you can mix your own sounds and adjust the volume.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I couldn't really get into it and might try again another time. I was pretty disappointed, as I was curious to see JK's ability to create new characters and storyline outside of Hogwarts.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|you can't play it without putting in alot of money to continue the game. sorry i put it in my kindle
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app. Love the graphics very realistic....the kids love it the most. The negative would be the need to have more opportunities to earn gems and energy.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I absolutely love the look of this case.  It's so unique and pretty and I get compliments on it every time I take it out.  I was a little hesitant with the reviews saying it doesn't lay flat, but decided to go with it anyway, and I'm glad I did.  I did have the same problem when it first arrived, but I flipped the cover around the back a few times and after that it was perfect.  It just needs to be a little worn in first.  I always keep it flipped around when I read too.  If you are someone who just keeps it open like a book, you may not be working the binding as well, so give it a try if you have that issue.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series was recommended to me by my 15 year old grandson.  I am enjoying it immensely and hope the author completes the next book before I forget the characters and their relationships, forget where we are in the unusual number of storylines, and before my grandson ages into his 20's.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|This game started out great and then the game just froze. It wouldn't let me do anything. I had to delete it off my Kindle Fire. So be aware that if you get this game you may have to delete it on your 2nd or 3rd race.
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|I liked this movie because it gives us a glimpse into what life might be like if we could predict the future. Its shows the positives and negatives if we did.
030746363X|3.0|This was a great read initially but fizzled out putting theory into practice. Conclusion...great on paper. I dont think he is trying to fool anyone with antics but i do think it takes tid bits from many other lifestyle and fitness programs and makes mush. And there is not a concise program to really follow. All and all a fun read that turned me on to few things that i will be implementing into my life longterm. Paleo & kettlebells.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I bought this since I heard about it in my Gameinformer. Not what I completely expected, but very fun and challenging! Worth $2 for sure! The editors of Gameinformer were right when they said this was the best mobile game of 2012! Looking forward to more games!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I have dreamed about seeing Led Zeppelin since the early 70s. It was incredible to see the heroes of my youth after all these years surpassing all of my expectations. The great Jimmy Page, honestly it cannot be said that there is a better guitar player from any era, some may come close and may even equal (such as Jeff Beck) but there are none better and here he is like a grey haired god performing miracles at will. The musical genius John Paul Jones is still as good as he ever was, exuding the aura of a consummate professional. Robert Plant's voice has mellowed and lowered a bit, perhaps some of the high notes elude, but their is a quality of richness that his voice did not have when he was younger. The greatest Rock and Roll front man of all time, not to detract from the other greats but to emphasize the greatness of Robert Plant when he is with Led Zeppelin. In my estimation John Bonham shared equal status with Keith Moon as \\"Greatest\\" Rock and Roll drummer and only Jason Bonham could have done justice to his father's legacy and at many moments I was amazed at his performance.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Several shocks/surprises.  An even-darker book than previous - well written, awesome imaginative narration with faithfulness to the good, bad and ugly natures of characters.  No one learns the 'lessons' from wars in these histories either.  Amazing series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This books brings out the ugly and beauty in this world. With diseases, family, friends, love, strangers, history..all captive in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone that forgot or don't know how to live.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|How do you describe a volume as huge as this!  The story of a life sacrificed, a life re-born.  Many scenes were similar to the sacrifice of Christ.  How a man was changed through small yet penetrating acts of another.  I loved it!!  Now to be sure, Hugo goes on and on in descriptions of ideas, places, how the mind changes and you have to slug through a lot of that.  Although even those expositions are worthy of the time taken to read.  Enjoy!
B000002AV5|1.0|Do not buy from this seller. The CD was inexpensive but you get what you pay for! The CD will not play in my car and only plays on my computer. Its cheap and home made. Just awful!
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This is a really addictive game! Lets you see what the game company world is like. Needs: More Employees, Office Upgrades, Replay Value.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book gave a good inside look into the training and motivation of these special operations agents which was very interesting.  The actual raid on the compound was fascinating, and illustrated the huge risks these guys take and incredible abilities and training they have.  I didn't like that the author didn't have it vetted before publishing it, and I didn't like the comments he made about his commander in chief.  However, he does emphasize that no secrets were divulged, and the attitudes expressed seem to be a part of that culture.  Over all, I enjoyed the book.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|Excellent movie.  Lee Marvin at his best,  A very interesting story telling the tale of the Old West before the era ended.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a good app for people who love my little pony it doesn't matter if your an adult or kid
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The case isn't anything special but it does the job.  I am pleased with it.  Wish it snaped in instead of the elastic band.  Just a little worried with all the wear if it will continue to hold the kindle in place.
B0002KQNUO|5.0|If angels sang to our mortal ears we would be joyful in the noise. Alegria is a beautifully rendered audio. If you are a fan of le Cirque performances and the music, this is one that you shouldn't pass up. Sample it on Amazon.com if you like. One thing that I particularly liked in the purchase option was to auto-rip this at the time of purchase. I was able to have it available on my cloud-player at the time of purchase, rip it to itunes or windows media player... and have the CD when it arrived in the mail a day or two later. I would certainly recommend buying music on Amazon for these reasons (you get the digital version right away without having to rip in once you get the CD, you get the CD to add to your collection, and you get to stream it via cloud-player to your kindle fire, pc, or other connected device saving room on your device).
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is an amazing book! It really makes you think! I could read this book over and over again! One of my favorite book!
B003NBAJXG|3.0|I recently started a cross fit type gym and bought these to wear at night or the day after a long workout. They are thin so not sure wearing these in public is a great idea.  The waist band is my only area that I felt really could use improvement. It folds over easily and also really do not stay up.
B009G41CG2|4.0|Excellent game and love to play it over and over again. Each game is a challenge and I recommend it.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|The first story was great and I was left wanting more. The second and third stories were not as exciting and left me wondering. I have eliminated this writer from my list and I have moved onward.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Between this game and Fire Emblem i've been in gaming bliss. This game, for me at least, has given me a reason to turn on the Vita and keep it on for long periods of time and i've been addicted to it.<br /><br />Only Fire Emblem tears me away from this game and even then I find time to split the time.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|The gameplay is fine. I really like drawing and can't complain about the gameplay. It's fun.<br /><br />The performance is wonky. Occasionally, my drawings are not captured and I end up having to re-draw something else (often repeating turns to draw). There have been occasions where the letters in the word to guess do not match the word that you are tyring to guess...making it impossible to be successful in guessing the word (unless you can guess a word that is not depicted in the drawing).<br /><br />I did like the game enough to purchase the full version (getting a larger selection of words), but have played through most of those words now as well. I have heard of other platforms offering word packs that you can buy for coins... I'm not sure this functionality is available on kindle version yet...
0385349947|5.0|I am really motivated after reading this book. It talks about real life experiences, work life balance and more for women with families. It's a good read for men and women who want to succeed with a family to balance. Good book Sheryl!
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|As Assistant Music Director & Keyboardist of my church's worship team, I can tell you that this CD is by far the best music investment I've made in three years.  Generally, when I buy CD's to find music for our team, I will find two or three songs on it that just reach out and grab me.  However, on Revealing Jesus, ALL of them have touched me.  Needless to say, we will be learning every song on it.  I encourage every worship leader to purchase this.  In fact, I encourage everyone to purchase this CD.  You will not be disappointed....AT ALL.  :)
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Acting fair,story line not very good. All you see is a small child running back and forth (in the backround) all the time. This film is confusing about the two little boys . Only until the last few minutes of the movie do you ( partially) understand what and why things were happening through-out the movie, and still confusing. Acting fair, but ending is like all the other PNA's.<br />1 and 2 were the best. Don't waste your money.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|On accident, I ordered this in regular and HD, HD is better and I have watched each one several times
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|i was surprised at how good it was, the actors and actresses could sing and act, more movies like this should be seen on the big screen i saw it in a theater four times
B006XBSAP2|3.0|The music is fine and Katy has a nice voice. The songs have a fun and lively beat. And, while the lyrics are not explicitly obnoxious and you'll rarely hear swear words, the content is certainly of an adult nature for a lot of the songs. If you have young children or even young teens, it may be worth searching out the kid bopz version of the songs. It's just not meant for the kiddos. And, that's fine, just wanted to note this on the review.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Yea this is so much fun,to go out side and match it up with the night sky I have two apps
0451528298|5.0|Unlike other fiction I've read before, this story is completely told in the first person from different characters.  It was odd at first because the narative was very detailed but the story flowed from person to person smoothly.  Each segment gave the reader a bit more information and a bit more mystery.  For me the most interesting part was the glimpse of British society at the time.  There definitely was a cast system and everyone knew his or her place in it.  Uppity commoners were not tolerated.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I really like this show. It is very interesting and action packed. It keeps your attention through the whole show.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This was hard to stop watching once I started. The story and ease were great after my kids introduced us to the series.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|love it works great on kindle fire would of gave it five stars but when I first downloaded it it kept freezing my kindle works good after I reinstalled.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  My husband and I speak to our dog all the time and we wonder what he is thinking throughout the day, this was such a fun read and lets us think about how our pets may think.  I have already told many of my friends they should download the book.  Everyone will enjoy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very  big help at night multi sounds great  wish for more noises being a severely night user would like a few more but still amazing selection
B001EN71CW|5.0|The show Firefly never had a chance. Now that people have had a chance to see it. it has become very popular. A Franchise of movies should be made with the same cast if possible. Serinity just scratched the surface and left you wondering. I thought that meant another movie, or more. Disappointed!!!!! NOBODY likes Widescreen!!! Is there a Blu Ray of this that is not widescreen?
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I received my copy of 10 a day early (thank you Amazon!!) and have listened to it several times. I love, love, LOVE that Jon sings a solo on &#34;We Own Tonight&#34;-so proud of him and the song is awesome too. Keep it playing after track 12-there's a hidden track that starts around the 3:48 minute mark that rocks!! All in all a great CD-can't wait for the tour. Love you NKOTB!!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I like it for knifes, but it don't work on one sided things like scissors and hoof knifes. What I would really like to find is something to sharping hoof knifes. But this is great for my pocket knife; and you can carry it in your pocket. Kind of handy to have. It's easy to use also. I got two and gave one to a friend. Great for a gift to a riding or hiking bud.
B00849F82E|5.0|I absolutely loved rekindling the wonderful words of Chesterton from the first reading of my youth.  In this day and age it is so important to renew the beautiful memories of faith you remember from your childhood.  Who better to help you wrap your mind around the arguments for Christianity than G.K. Chesterton.  I recommend this for anyone who would like to bolster their beliefs as followers of Christ; especially in this year of the installation of Pope Francis.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|Although every person interviewed spoke the same way and acted the same way, it was a nice change to read a book written like this. I'd recommend this book, but it's certainly not the best zombie fiction ever written.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|DVDs from Season 1 arrived scratched and were difficult to play.  We used our scratch remover and were able to watch.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This is the first live-action film Zemeckis has directed since \\"Cast Away\\" in 2000. Like that film, it has a huge, edge-of-your-seat plane crash scene then becomes a two-hour character study. The trailer makes you think it's either an action-packed rage-against-the-system flick or a courtroom drama. It's neither, although it has elements of those. It's really more like \\"Lost Weekend\\" or \\"Clean and Sober.\\"<br /><br />The airplane is a metaphor for its pilot, William \\"Whip\\" Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a functional alcoholic who is privately crashing during a time when he is publicly flying high as a national hero. Whip coolly and inventively landed the defective airliner, saving most of the 102 souls aboard. But it's discovered that he was legally drunk when the accident occured. Can he come out of his nose-dive before he loses the one soul aboard his personal flight?<br /><br />Washington's tremendous skill and intense humanity keep you invested in Whip but it's not easy. Whip - as addicts often do - gets increasingly repugnant as the story progresses and the movie dares you to keep caring about him no matter how bad he gets. Kelly Reilly (Dr. Watson's wife in the current Sherlock Holmes movies) also does a terrific, natural job here as a fellow addict/love interest who wants to get sober.<br /><br />The film poses many questions about God's role in tragedy and accidents, his help in self-control, the efficacy of prayer, and predestination. Christian symbols appear throughout the film. Some of the questions are taken very seriously, some not.<br /><br />It also keeps you in a very tense, emotional Catch-22 between definitely wanting Whip to be absolved for this particular crash, for which he was not responsible and in which he acted heroically, and definitely wanting to see him be held accountable for his long history of flying drunk.<br /><br />Some conservative viewers may admire the film's message but may not be able to sit through its very graphic and realistic content.content.
B008J5T4Q4|5.0|Great album.<br />Pink has delivered again.<br />Highly recommend.<br />This is sure to be another hit.<br />'Try' is just a teaser.

0061950726|3.0|I continue to be amazed at the things I learn about the history of this country from reading books. Orphan Train is based in fact; from the mid 19th century through the first quarter of the 20th century there was no system for dealing with orphans or what we would consider foster children today. It was left to churches and charitable organizations. And for those who feel that they are best left to deal with these social issues, I suggest you research the orphan trains because their solution was to take the children into various cities and give them away to anyone who wanted a child. No background checks, no follow up, no nothing. These children were left with people in the hopes that they would be given a good life. Some were, many were nothing more than house slaves. I'll get off the soapbox now.<br /><br />The book juxtaposes two lives - that of young Molly, a foster child of the current generation who lives with a family that is divided as to her presence. The \\"father\\" is pleasant to her and sees the good in Molly but the \\"mother\\" would rather she be gone and in all truth is only doing the foster thing for the money it brings into the household. The second life is that of Vivian - born Niamh, who becomes Dorothy and ultimately Vivian as she is left alone in New York after her family is killed in a fire. She is taken in by Children's Aid and sent West on an Orphan Train to hopefully find a new home. What she finds at first is mistreatment, suspicion and abuse.<br /><br />While on the train she meets some other orphans one of whom will play an important role in her life. Most of the other characters, though fade into the background as the story focuses on Vivian and Molly and how the two of them reconcile their pasts which are not as different as they might think.<br /><br />I sped through the first 2/3rds of this book totally enthralled with Vivian's story. Molly's life was really not as interesting or as fleshed out as Vivian's and I suppose that since the book IS titled Orphan Train it should be focused on Vivian. Once the book hit the point in the story that moved it to the present it was as if all the rich detail that made the first part so compelling went out the window. There was an OMG moment in the book and then everything was rushed and it became, at least to me, a book of what could have been.<br /><br />It was as if the author had only so many pages left and had to fit in more information than allotted space. I felt cheated somehow and very disappointed. The book could have been so much more and I feel the loss of what I know I've missed.<br /><br />Rating:<br />3.5S titled Orphan Train it should be focused on Vivian.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|We are obsessed with this show!  I love that it is available for instant download - but it gets dark a lot.  It kind of goes in and out.  We watched the first 2 seasons with no issues!  Its a shame - it's very distracting and disappointing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a cute game. I love competing and upgrading my gear. beautiful horses make the game stunning. highly recommended.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|This was one album I held off on buying until now. While I may not have enjoyed this album much back when it first came out, it's like a breath of fresh air now that I have listened to Comedown Machine so many times. (As an aside, yes, I do enjoy Comedown Machine and the direction they are taking their music).<br /><br />I will say that the insert booklet is one of the better ones, possibly the best one, in their 5 main albums. Well, maybe the UK Is This It one was most iconic, imho.
B000P6PVLC|1.0|Started bad, was bad in the middle, and ended bad.  nothing good about it.  by the end of it, it didn't care about a single character in the movie.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|loved it
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I really enjoyed this. Only problem was that it was too short. There is a follow-up movie, however, which is also good.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I rented this movie in Standard Definition, and I have to say it looks pretty crappy. Even on an SD TV on my Roku, it was blurry. Sound was bad, and without subtitles, I couldn't understand anyone. Don't tell me it's my internet; It runs at 12mb/s and everything else looks gorgeous. Top that off with the fact that this movie is clearly designed to rob you of every cent you have, by stretching what little content the original story had into three wasteful movies. There was seriously 5 minutes of pipe-smoking with no dialogue. Come on! I know Jackson has a thing with slow motion faces going way too long, but this movie was just a plain waste. Special effects were par for the course. Action was impressive.<br />Even though I was a fan of the original 3 movies, I'm not roped into this crap. Amazon, I want my $4 back please...
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a Time, is such an great series.  I'm looking forward to seeing what happens in season 3.  Hopefully they don't cancel the series mid-season like the did with Jericho.

B009JZTP4Y|4.0|Having seen this a couple times as a kid I wanted to go back and view the HD version of this Star Trek installment. Many of the exterior shots of the ship were cleaner, In a time of model building and not much CGI you can really see the detail. Unfortunately the action scenes in space lack detail but that's the nature of a movie from this era. All of the interior scenes were well improved in HD.<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie it's classic and a good point to start watching this franchise from. My daughter hasn't seen any of these but she's enthused by all of the characters, surprisingly she doesn't thrive on CGI and is more about the story lines and relationships of the crew.<br /><br />If you have seen this movie but it's been a while, check it out in HD. The movie itself is a little average with it's typical plot of an alien entity hurling towards earth on a destructive path. You  don't watch this because it captivating, it's more about the characters and the beginning of a great franchise.

B0060AY6FO|4.0|A good read for mystery fans and Austen devotees.  Elizabeth Bennett Darcy plays a very minor role and does not display her characteristic intelligence and spunk--a disappointment for me.  None of the characterizations from Pride and Prejudice seemed to carry over to this version as well as one would wish.  I found it annoying that the author felt it necessary to explain each motivation and action in the Jane Austen original--rather like taking a college course on the novel.  But, overall, we must take our pleasures as we find them and it is always fun to return to Austen's world.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|I absolutely love Digitally Imported radio! Great selection of digital music...Far better Electronic Dance Music selection than Pandora! I like the social sharing abilities to twitter, facebook and email.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Finished it in 2 days. Didn't get to see the movie and the book was such a page turner! Simply amazing
B002N14GPE|5.0|Viewing was clear and no problems. I had intended to only watch half the movie(it was late), then continue watching it the next day. I wasn't able to. Fuhrman's character Esther kept pulling me in. I can't remember the last time I saw someone so visciously mean on screen like Esther. Maybe Bette Davis as Jane in 'What Ever happened to Baby Jane?'! Other than a couple of flaws in the plot, it was a pretty tight story. I definitely recommend this one.

B005LAII80|4.0|I vaguely remember the Stallone version from when I was a kid.  At the time, it was an enjoyable sci-fi movie.  I'm not sure what I would think of it, today.  In any case, whenever I saw that they were doing another adaption of the character, I was intrigued.  Still, it was only until recently that I got around to checking it out (my first RedBox experience, too).<br /><br />Basically, the movie is a a short, action-packed sci-fi film that aims low and hits surprisingly high.  It's a modest, unpretentious movie that sets out to entertain, and it does. Karl Urban is solemn and stoic as Dredd, but he still emanates a certain icy charisma that never lets the character become boring.  He's the embodiment of an ideal-- or, if it not an ideal, a stereotype-- and despite the character never becoming emotionally relatable as a real human being, there is an undercurrent of humanity to him that can't be entirely disguised by his helmet and body armor.<br /><br />Dredd has a rookie Judge to assess during the mayhem. Judge Anderson, played by Olivia Thirlby, is a mousy, yet capable character that the audience will root for automatically.  This isn't a tear-jerker, though.  Dredd and Anderson do not share heartfelt moments.  They do not bond.  Anderson is not affirmed by Dredd. Instead, Dredd is an observer to Anderson's affirmation of herself as the film progresses.  This was a nice touch from the writers, since I don't think we would want to see Dredd affectionately tousling Judge Anderson's hair and saying \\"nice job, kid,\\" or some other cliche line of that sort.<br /><br />Are there \\"one-liners?\\"  Yes, there are, but they are so well delivered they will not make you cringe.  There's a subtle 80's vibe to the dialogue in Dredd, but its incorporated in such a way that it never becomes campy. It's almost like the writers took a script from an old Schwarzenegger or Van Damme movie and skillfully edited it into something smart and serious.<br /><br />The only thing I disliked about the movie was the villain, Ma-Ma, played by the always watchable Lena Headey (looking quite rough, here, but justifiably). Her character is one-dimensional and uninteresting to me. The character serves only as a finish line for an awesome and exciting race.<br /><br />One of the best action movies in a long time, Dredd finally gives the iconic comic character his due on film.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Great book. It's not just about healing the body, but more about healing the mind. About choices and perseverance and so much more. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for personal growth whether or not they have suffered an illness or not.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|It's fun and challenging! I even talked my husband into how fun it was....after I got to play on my own.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|Tried to find some kind of instruction to this game. Was directed to you tube for a walk through, but didn't know which version of flash drive I could get for my kindle. Really disappointed...not for the price so much as the lack of any kind of story or plot. I rumbled around just tapping, some game objects were collected, but not a clue or hint in sight. Then I see a part of game goes outside...well...I couldn't find a way to get out there. Gee what a waste of time. Don't bother with this one... I will be asking for my money back, but I can't get back my effort or time. Geese Louise with Cheese, Dang it...
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|If you loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you will at the very least really like the Hobbit.  The film's tone and production style seamlessly meshes with that of  the LOTR trilogy, and the returning cast make their characters feel every bit as real and alive as they did before.  The newcomers jump right into the mix without hesitation and succeed at every turn.  Martin Freeman is quaint and enjoyable as Bilbo, although I have to say he made the film seem almost British in a contemporary way at the very beginning of the film, just because of what I'm used to seeing him in.  Richard Armitage as Thorin exudes kingly strength and dignity in a way I have seldom seen from an actor.  I had not seen him in a film before, and I came away very impressed with him. There are so many other dwarves, all with copious facial hair, its hard to choose standouts, but they all seem to have a moment to shine.<br /><br />The special effects are predictably fantastic and amazing.  I've heard much grumbling about the CGI in The Hobbit and I do not understand why.  It's a fantasy movie, made in 2012.  Are you surprised there is CGI in abundance?  People act like they would have preferred the production team to use a horde of Jim Henson puppets or claymation models so the enemies would seem more \\"substantial\\".  I don't think so.  CGI is better than ever. Fantasy and Sci-Fi movies benefit far more from it than not, and the people who deny this most vehemently seem to do so out of an egotistical desire to be seen as insightful and wise, while simultaneously falling into the ideological trap of  \\"traditional is always superior.\\"  Ok, enough polemical rambling.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I read the Hobbit (back in my Middle School days), so I can't really speak to the faithfulness of the adaption; but as an LOTR fan, I loved the Hobbit and was excited to be back in Middle-Earth once again.  Even after the long hiatus on production, and even after the general confusion of the project's long history, somehow The Hobbit came out as good as a film could be under so much creative stress and under all the pressure that hype can bring to bear on such projects.  It's the theatrical equivalent of pulling a rabbit out of a hat.  I can't wait for the next one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it is so fun. I love caring for Beauty.. But some stuff cost a lot $$$$
B00BF11STU|4.0|This movie gives us a glimpse into the clandestine, unsettling world of national intelligence.  I wasn't sure if Jessica Chastain could pull off such a serious role, but she does a great job.  Makes you shudder to think how often bureaucratic ineptitude gets us in trouble overseas, and how much unsavory business our spies conduct to get us out of it.  Good, suspenseful storytelling.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Soo good!! I was kind of resistant to read the second one book because I thought it was have second book syndrome;slow, depressing, dense. But this was nothing of the sort!  Highly recommended
B0086700CM|3.0|i personaly think that this is a game for wyen you are the most board.... i think it could be a little more exciting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is soooo amazing and so are the graphics. Loved it much better then the first one and one monkey
B0055B7K7A|5.0|The first 20 minutes of this film are simply brilliant.  Deeply moving and beautifully conceived.  The rest is still thoughtful and thoroughly enjoyable.  See it!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Like Don, the protagonist of The Rosie Project, I prefer factual books to fiction, but this story really grabbed me and I read it over two days in every spare moment.  I laughed out loud often and sometimes squirmed.  The author has done a brilliant job of portraying one of us 'aspies'.  At first, I did not like the slightly stilted style of writing, but soon realised that it was inevitable and deliberate.  I would put this book on a par with [[ASIN:B008W51KMC Compline. a nun. a Beatle. a life.]], another piece of modern Australian literature which I have read and enjoyed recently.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I don't have regular television at home so tend to miss out on shows that I like. When I found that I could get new episodes every week via amazon downloads I was ecstatic! This is in interrupted high quality viewing of my favorite suspense filled show!
B003XT603Q|5.0|A book about loss and love. Beautiful and engaging throughout a must read. At moments funny and heart wrenching. A testimony to the joys and pains of love. Well done Murakami.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I like the book it taught me thing I never knew. Schooling and dates are more important then I thought.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|COUPLE SONGS WERE REALLY GOOD - BUT THOUGHT HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN BETTER SONGS TO SHOW OFF HIS UNIQUE SOUND.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I really love this app it is really fun and I got all of the ponys so I nailed the game!You should get the game for you or your little one.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|love the movie  disappointed I misunderstood the  2 discs to be Mulan 1 and 2 but it wasn't  anyway love the movie and happy with the purchase  fast delivery nice
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is FUN and addicting. It all started with my daughter playing and she needed help and I took over, haha. I like all the animals and visiting other people's villages.<br />I do not like that when you click on land by accident trying to get the coins you can buy the land not meaning to. I think there should be a yes or no option if u want to buy the land and when buying from the shop. Once in a while it will freeze and I will l have to turn off the kindle so it can reset.  I wish you had a better chance at winning big at the kung fun scat. This game makes you have to buy coins and<br /><br />acorns to do anything big and cool in your village.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|THESE SONGS SHOWED THE RANGE OF HIS TALENT AND VOICE.<br />REALLY LIKED THE ALBUM. PLAY IT ALL THE TIME SINCE I RECEIVED IT.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft so much!Its better than the demo one cuz you have more blocks than the demo so you should get the app!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the sounds of it makes you feel like you're on a farm<br />the trotting<br />the birds in the background everything its just wonderful
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I almost gave it 4 out of 5... only because the writing was not &#34;polished/professional/Vince Flynn-esque&#34;... but in reality, I don't and shouldn't  expect that level of writing. He's a professional fighter, not a professional writer.<br /><br />For all of the conflicting details we've been subjected to via the media - this account, for this proud and grateful American, rings truest.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well done series with fabulous production values and characterizations.  One becomes more and more attached to the Crawley family and their staff as this season unfolds.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its fun but it needs unlimeted world cuz i keep running out of supplies and then havw to start A New world
086571701X|5.0|This is the book you want if you're considering aquaponics. Sylvia has done a fantastic job of explaining (almost) everything you need to know to plan and construct your aquaponic food production system. This book is the best I've seen yet, and it's comprehensive. This is the place to start!<br /><br />The author may not even realize it, but aquaponics is a key technology for decentralized power in an increasingly centralized \\"command economy\\" system. When you grow your own food, you are no longer dependent on the local Wal-Mart grocery, and you can completely avoid all the GMOs, pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals that widely contaminate the conventional food supply.<br /><br />Aquaponics is essentially \\"food freedom\\" in an age when most of the population are really \\"food slaves\\" who couldn't survive a single week without factory-produced foods made readily available on store shelves. Given the rapid rise in food prices due to droughts, floods and extreme weather across the globe, aquaponics also makes economic sense. It allows you to grow thousands of dollars worth of vegetables, herbs and fruits, using no soil, no synthetic chemicals and very little water.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book as a great place to start. You won't be disappointed in it.<br /><br />- Mike Adams, editor, NaturalNews.com
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My son loves legos and minecraft so I thought this would be a great gift for his birthday.  Sadly, I didn't read the reviews or dimensions before I purchased this set.  It is so tiny and not worth $50.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series has hit the sweet spot for many of us who envision end of the world scenarios.Of course since The original carnival of souls and night of the living dead movies there have been many variations of this subject  matter.<br />This is the perfectly updated modern day version with cliff hangers weekly.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love this album. There are only a couple of songs that don't work for me, but the bulk of it is solid gold. I can listen to it all day, over and over.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This set is great, This is one of my favorite movies ever. I am a fan of the aesthetic portrayed in this work. Trent Reznor and Attics Ross do a great job with the soundtrack. If you are a collector , this is a must have,
B005F96URI|4.0|I liked all of the actors in this movie, although some of the acting is so so.  But I do like a good action flick.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's so fun it like the first temple run but it has a lot more features I don't want 2 give 2 much away so all I'll say is it's defiantly worth downloading
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I got this for my wife, and only knew a couple of his songs, and I have to say that I love this guys vibe. He reminds me a bit of Jason Mraz, sort of has a sound that gets into your head. I listen to it all the time, and I swear I never get tired of it.
B004S3MB2U|2.0|For my needs, which was just a basic calculator app, this app was simply too confusing.  I've already uninstalled it.
B0047A72E6|5.0|Buddy Guy is know as a Bluesman - He is also one of IF NOT the best guitar players in the world of rock. This is Mr. Guy at his best!
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I waited a long time before purchasing, now I wish I had gotten this ages ago. Convenient, easy and no more wasting batteries.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing! A must read for anyone! I read it because I thought the movie was amazing but the book is 10 times better!
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|I'm not sure what people actually see in this show. I know it is incredibly popular. The problem is that just about every scene with a woman in it portrays the woman as either a prostitute, or as someone to be used and abused for any kind of gain. I realize it's supposed to have a \\"historical\\" feel, but even with that, you don't have to be this level of sexist. Also, it's a fantasy world. They could have done anything at all.<br /><br />For reference, I am told the situation does not get better in later episodes.<br /><br />I am thankful that the first episode was free from Amazon. Otherwise, I would feel shame in having actually thrown money towards this show.<br /><br />If you prefer not to see images of women being treated badly, abused, used, and otherwise treated like trash, skip this show. Skip it now.
B007X10OLE|5.0|Really unique sound.  I watched the show on TV and I have listened to this album a number of times.
B0020M99LC|5.0|This bond can stay as far as I'm concerned. best representation of the books I think. very expressive without saying much. very nice to look at. I'm looking forward to watching Skyfall.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|i could of kept reading this book, i was a little disappointed when i came to the end of the book.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|like the game but it tends to forceclose and then when I attempt to open it back up it doesn't load, all I get is a blank screen.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This game is thought provoking and fun.  You have to be able to distance yourself from the subject matter, but it's still a good time.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love this game in color.  It is easy to play and lots of fun!  There are a lot of configurations leaving you with a great variety of puzzles
B00846REIS|4.0|The review that stated this book is what 50 shades aspired to be is 100% correct! I care much more about the characters Eva and Gideon, did not laugh at silly dialogue about an \\"inner goddess\\", and I find myself recommending Sylvia Day's writing to my friends who also enjoy a steamy read that has substance. The plot is well crafted and the writing is enjoyable & easy to read.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|This book seemed promising but it was much too short, the plot moved too fast and it and the characters did not have time to develop.
1451696205|4.0|I got this book because a friend said it was like us many moons ago.  Good story.  It was an easy, quick read.
B0083H6AQA|3.0|I love Robert Pattison, but I don't think that this role did  him any good; he's young, strong and smart. I would have preferred to see him rising to the top by working hard instead of relying of these women and their money.
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|We thought that this would be a much more entertaining and funny movie.  Most people fell asleep less than half way through the movie.  Disappointing.
0375869026|5.0|I have recommended this book to everyone I know. From my 12 year old grandson to my. 75 year old mother. Absolutely loved it!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Challenging and fun!! Very addictive! I would recommend this game to everyone!!!! I like everything about the game!!! You will love it!
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|I did not understand this movie, what was the message? I did not like the characther of Robert pattison; he's too beautiful to be potraided as a nut job.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book was great.  Ken Follett is an amazing historian.  You can learn the history of war and actually enjoiy it!!
B000003TA2|5.0|A must for any Sonic Youth fan or if you want to listen to something from SY for the first time.
B0060MYM3S|1.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES & WAITED SO LONG TO GET IT.  BY THE TIME I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO WATCH THE WHOLE THING IT FROZE UP ON THE 8TH CHAPTER OF EPISODE 7 AND SKIPPED PASSED THE BEGINNING OF EPISODE 8. I TRIED IT IN 3 DVD PLAYERS AND IT DID THE SAME THING IN EACH ONE.  I WANT TO EXCHANGE IT BUT AMAZON IS TELLING ME I CAN'T, THE RETURN WINDOW EXPIRED ON 3/31. TODAY IS 4/2.  I JUST WANT TO EXCHANGE IT. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME?<br />I AM SORRY TO DO THIS IN THE REVIEW'S BUT I COULD NOT FIND ANYOTHER WAY TO SEND A MESSAGE.
B008WM4U7W|5.0|I loved the improved story line and how it carried on with where he was in his life. The fight scenes were very well done as well. My wife and I watched it a few more times and kept going back to them (the fight scenes) for our own amusement.
B0043VDIAG|4.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks with wonderful characters that grip you to the end.  A good read which has a satisfactory ending.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Was action packed great storyline i am a fan of Kathryn bigelow love point break loved hurt locker she is a great director I recommend this movie an excellent and entertaining history lesson
0307155102|5.0|My children had this book when they were small, teaching them a lot of words in an interesting format.  the illustrations are wonderful and  extremely detailed.<br />his book is thinner than the original but still a great book for preschoolers
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This movie is without a doubt one of the best I ever seen. I bought this movie because one of my friends told me about it and said it is really good. There is nothing about this movie I didn't like. The story was excellent, The characters were all spot on, and more importantly, The action and fight in Oz was amazing. It kinda reminded me of the Digimon movie where Kai and Matt fought that virus Digmon in the computer world :) This movie i give 5 stars out of 5 Excellent,
B0089LOKHG|3.0|i really loved the 1st 2 books in this triology, but this one was such a disappointment. the relationship and the love that was so much a part of delirium and pandemonium was lost in this story. it ended abruptly and it almost felt like the author just wanted to get the story over with. however, there were some great moments....the friendship with hana was the highlight of the book for me. i just expected more.
0743243153|5.0|I was expecting books that had binding issues and maybe corners folded, with handwritting notes in the columns.  Not a single note in 9 books I ordered for a Sunday school class.  the pages were clean and the books appeared to be new.  I have used used books, slightly worn previously and never experienced a disappointment.  Once again, I am a happy adult Sunday school teacher.  Oh yes, and shipping arrived within six days of my ordering. Awesome.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|A good story line for the batman series.  Clear picture and sound quality.  A must for any fan of the series.
1612191290|1.0|I found the book to be a bit sophomoric. The first few pages set the tone. I got the impression of a college professor trying to prove he is revolutionary, anti establishment and relevant. Mr. Graeber fails miserably in his attempt.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I was completely engrossed in this novel from beginning to end. If you are looking for a quick, light read this is not it. This book will weigh on you as you read. However, if you are interested in psychology and family relationships this might be up your ally. Gillian Flynn's writing is in your face and often unsettling but truly fascinating. There are plenty of surprises throughout the novel that will leave you wanting more. I liked the aspect of mystery throughout and every time I thought I had it figured out, I was wrong.

B00005214X|1.0|I have to say that I don't order much online lately and maybe it's become standard practice for Amazon to use International vendors, but the estimated delivery times need to be adjusted when they do that.<br /><br />I chose the standard shipping which stated 8 to 14 days. I ordered it on 3/11/13. When I got confirmation of the order, it said it would be sent out either 3/12/13 or 3/13/14 with an estimated delivery date between April 5 and April 22. That is a heck of a lot more days then 14 days. Doing the math that is anywhere from 23 days to 40 days for delivery.<br /><br />The item did arrive at the Post Office on 3/30/13, which is 17 or 18 days. Longer then the ordering estimated time. I then noticed it was from Argentina. If Amazon is going to use international mailers, then that needs to be spelled out clearly.<br /><br />I gave the rating a 1 . I know I will love the music so I'm a bit torn giving that rating. I'm just disappointed for the reasons I stated above.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Great game.  I love the vividly imagery .  It's not too hard nor is it so easy a child could play.  I found it a great way to spend waiting for my Dentist appt.  I would buy it again.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Just purchased this book for my son and already had to read it over three times. He loves it and so do I. Great picture book.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Thank you for this copy! It was packaged and appeared to be brand new even though the seller said it might not be. I got more than what I bargained for especially for the price. Thanks so much!
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|Fun game grandson didn't stop playing till he finished all levels with three envelopes only thing wrong with the game there's not enough levels but you can fix that with an upgrade
B001RLP862|4.0|Nice product but pricy, would be better in a 2 deck case. Comparable to either Copaq or Kem in quality.
B004N6369Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was an easy read that kept me interested even without dragons or vampires. The loves of two very well written characters was enough.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for my children to play especially on road trips. especially since my kids love horses or any kind of animals
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I won't go on and write a book but I instantly fell in love with Delta Machine and didn't have to wait for it to \\"grow on me\\". This is the type of Depeche I've grown to love in the first place and I love this even better than the last 2 albums. Playing The Angel and SOTU were cool but they just seemed tired at times. That's not the case here and of course David Gahan's voice is king. I just can't get enough (pun)of \\"Heaven\\", \\"Slow\\", \\"Broken\\", and \\"Should Be Higher\\". The type of album that can be played night or day, rain or shine. If you love 80's and 90's Depeche Mode but you're looking for something new and modern go cop this album.
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books of this trilogy, especially the first (\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). Lisbeth Salander was such a unique and interesting character. She, of the dragon tattoo, perked the reader's interest with her immensely quirky personality and dark hostility which disguised a brilliant mind. As a reader, I also found that she struck a sympathetic chord--thoroughly engaging.<br /><br />Salander's character accelerated the pace of the first two books and made them quite readable. Not so with the third book...since Salander was, for some reason, removed from most of the story. What a crusher!  As a result, this book just sinks under the weight of its own excessive wordiness.<br /><br />The chapters are cumbersome, plodding, boring, and repetitive. The pages are filled with a rambling narrative (oft repeated) concerning a convoluted and senseless plot-of-sorts, superimposed upon other plots and supplemented with a few tacked-on subplots (none very engaging - especially the totally dumb \\"stalker\\" of Berger when the reader is not really interested in Berger). And for long stretches, the readers get the opportunity to learn all about the governmental legal structure of Sweden in ponderous detail.This is a painfully boring book!<br /><br />Still, I endured and I read on, wading through hundreds of pages. I admit: I was very anxious to know the outcome of the relationship between  Salander & Blomkvist. But the book's ending left me feeling cheated.<br /><br />What a shame. The series, which started two books ago as mystery sadly shifted its focus; I suppose this 3rd entry could fall under the genre of \\"espionage thriller\\" minus the thrills. I wondered if all those extra characters were necessary? It seemed like the author couldn't figure out what to do, so instead, he'd plunk-in a few more people to the mix. Every chapter seemed to add several new names. Were they good guys or bad guys? At one point, I realized I didn't really care.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers & admit that the VERY end of the book was needed to sum up the loose ends of the trilogy, but this was a very small microscopic bit of this huge tome. (That old expression \\"Too little, too late\\" comes to mind.)<br /><br />I usually do not write books to warn people away from reading a book for themselves. In this case, I had to make an exception. Salander's character deserved better and could have elevated this book to the level of its predecessors and given this work some purpose. How strange that the author removed her and instead, gave us hundreds of pages of burdensome reading which almost sours the whole experience of the trilogy.h other reviewers & admit that the VERY end of the book was needed to sum up the loose ends of the trilogy, but this was a very small microscopic bit of this huge tome.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I spent my entire weekend nose in the book, I just couldn't put it down.  very enjoyable, I see why they made it a movie
B00BLGZDYA|1.0|Perhaps if I did some serious drugs, I might have enjoyed it, but then what's the point...sore of what I kept asking myself thought as much of the movie as I could stomach.<br /><br />Feel like demanding a refund for this waste of good electrons.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Everything about it was amazing and perfect. I wish there were more books in the series. I loved it so much
0374533555|5.0|This book is on my top 5 all time list.  Very well written. Thought provoking and challenging.  Awesome work. I have purchased copies for friends and will continue to do so.

B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Outstanding display of what talent, training, and the art and science of this group of artist can accomplish. This is a keeper, worth watching again.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is a true work of art. Ms. Rowling draws you in and doesn't let go until the very end. I was very impressed and happy to see/read her depth as an author.<br /><br />If you are a HP fan, be warned- this is a COMPLETELY different book. It's dark, very mature, and real. I agree with other reviewers, you know these people. The characters have traits we readily recognize in society, some hit closer to home and some truly make you weep and wish you could shake them to sanity.<br /><br />If you start reading thinking it will be an extension of Ms. Rowling's HP writing, you will be disappointed. The only correlation between HP and The Casual Vacancy, is their ability to be totally engrossing. Read with an open mind and you will not be disappointed at all.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is moving, engrossing, and it deserves to be restated, very real.<br /><br />I cannot wait for Ms. Rowling's next project, The Causal Vacancy has set the bar very high!
1400067820|5.0|Very well written, thought provoking and lifestyle changing.  Any thinking person would benefit from reading \\"Antifragile.\\"  Funny, insightful, technical, well researched, grand piece of work. I have bought several copies for friends. On my top 5 list of books, all time.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best book I have ever read. Definitely hooked on this series. Look forward to reading the rest of the books.
B0039HR5QS|4.0|Good movie based on the book which had six days...so this is faster! Reading is good says the CIA.  Right?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think season 1 is still my favorite but they did a good job with this one.  Killed off more main characters than Downtown Abbey but replaced them with a busload of new ones. Will be waiting anxiously for season 4!

1609611543|1.0|I purchased the book hoping I could use the information in it to help me loose the 30 lbs. I needed to.  The premise of the book seems to be that if you eliminate wheat from your diet, all kinds of miraculous things happen.  You loose tons of weight, your blood pressure and blood sugar counts improve, no more arthritis pain, no more back pain, you have more energy, etc, etc.  Well, not too far into the book Dr. Davis begins to hedge his bets.  It seems he backs away from the \\"wheat is the culprit\\" mantra and begins in slow steady steps to tell us that it may also be corn, potatoes, rice, oats, barley, and any other starch he can think of.  Ok so now we've moved on to the Palio diet it seems.  Then, if thats not enough, Dr. Davis tells us that fruit is terrible for us. Huh, fruit ?  ( Hedging his bets again.)  Yes Dr. Davis says, fruit has sugar in it, and thats bad.  Well, go on Dr Davis.  You've stopped us from eating any starches, any natural sugars.  I tried his diet for 5 weeks and lost an amazing 5 lbs.  Yes, 5 lbs.  I have to assume that it wasn't from eliminating \\"wheat\\" from my diet but from eliminating everything that can add calories.  I went to his blog on his \\"Wheat Belly\\" website and found that I wasn't the only one who didn't see the miraculous results from cutting \\"wheat\\" from my diet.  Quite a few people had the same paltry results.  Dr. Davis directs those people to another part of his website to explain to you what you're doing wrong.  He tells you you may be on some kind of medication that restricts weight loss.  Or, you are eating fruit and other natural sugars.  Or, and this is great, you are eating.  Yes, Dr. Davis tells you to fast.  If you want to loose weight you may have to fast.  You know, don't eat.  Thats the biggest hedging of bets yet.  Sorry Dr. Davis, you're a sham, a joke, a charlatan.  There is nothing new in your book that we haven't known for decades.  Good luck with your book and the millions its made you.
B0007N1BBC|5.0|I really like this movie.  I enjoy movies that go back in time, threading bits of history into their story.  The acting was great, the people were real people, in the sense that they were believable characters. I have watched it many times over since purchasing it and have yet to grow tired of it.  There is much to learn about history, about the North and the South's views of life, the way the people relate to each other, how views can change when we take the time to get to know the people on both sides of a situation.
B00BSBY38A|2.0|Amusing but 'way too protracted...<br />Many of the sequences are repetitive.<br />Wait until you can borrow the CD from someone who's already wasted money purchasing it.

B007HC3LHS|4.0|I really liked this book a lot, much more than I expected to, given the low price.  Cathy was a sympathetic character, and despite the fact that she made poor decisions during her relationship with Lee, she did not come across as a wimp.  I was once involved with a controlling, jealous guy (although nowhere nearly as bad as Lee), and I identified with a lot of her feelings.  The writing was good, and the story was riveting.  I would definitely read other books by this same author, and I would recommend this one to other people.  If you like a good, suspenseful story, give this one a shot!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|i actually tried to download it three times and it wouldn't load.  I uninstalled it each time.  It was a waste of time.  It might have been a fun game if I could have gotten it to work.

B006LSZECO|1.0|When I read a book, I want to be able to root for someone. I want to learn something about human nature. There's no one to care about here and the only characteristic that these people have is sociopathic tendencies. I really don't run into people like this in real life. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I initially downloaded the Free version and quickly realized it's worth to get the full version!  the graphics are excellent and so as the interactive elements of the game.  It's so worth the $1.99 fee.  I've used the game when we go to restaurants and have to wait either to be seated or to get served...it's an educational distraction!

B00B8WXFWE|5.0|The new album has the perfect balance of up-beat and smooth. It is much different than their reunion album \\"The Block\\"; which was good in its own right. It's like these guys just wanted to do this album as a favor to fans at first; but again ended up knocking it out of the park with an honest effort that speaks to every type of person from existing to new fans. Respect!!

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This app is definetly worth getting. The graphics are great for a free game. There are no adds or lags. The different control schemes will satisfy everyone whether you prefer tilting the screen or tapping. The goal of the game is to drive as far on the island as possible before the time runs out  by getting across checkpoints. Very very fun! There is no reason not to get this for the price.

0316044695|5.0|Both Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson did a fabulous job of bringing Marcus' story to life. From the rigors of BUD/S to the unimaginable horror of watching friends and teammates die, the action never stops. This is a powerful story and one cannot help being moved to tears in certain spots.<br /><br />Reading this you just know that Luttrell is a man of character and honor and is telling the stone cold truth about the events that occurred on that mountain in the Hindu Kush. There have been those who think this story is not truthful but the remains of his fallen brothers, Mike Murphy, Danny Dietz and Matt Axelson were found where he said they would be and with the wounds that he described.<br /><br />I liked the fact that Marcus gave deserved props to Gulab and the Pashtun people for their part in saving his life. As much as some would like it to be the case, just because you live in Afghanistan does not mean that you are a worthless barbarian and an enemy of the US.<br /><br />I live every day thankful that there are people like Marcus Luttrell, and all of those in the armed services, who are willing to lay down their lives if need be to keep this country free.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is an incredible book, full of magic and poetry. The writing is visually evocative, the characters clearly defined and fairly complex, and the plot pushes forward nicely without feeling rushed.

B000NGTJTY|5.0|Loved it. This is by far one of my favorite Jack Nicholson roles. He does a brilliant job playing a mobster, he was very convincing in this role and I can't think of anyone that would have done a better job. Leonardo DiCaprio was also very believable is his role. The very last scene is by far the best scene of the movie. I will admit, I'm not a big Mark Wahlberg fan but he made me proud in this movie.
1480111724|5.0|Readers of John Mortimer's superb Rumpole stories will be well aware of the eccentricities, vagaries, and sometimes downright thick headedness of the legal system and the judges, lawyers, clerks, and others who keep it going.  Mortimer's Rumpole was an English barrister, but friends of mine who deal with the US legal system have assured me that similar things go on in American courtrooms.  Brian Harris, a QC with many years' experience, has produced a fascinating book that deals with some of the peculiarities of the courtroom, thus echoing many of the same themes which makes Mortimer's barrister such a delight.<br /><br />Tales From The Courtroom is basically a series of short anecdotes or vignettes.  Each is introduced with a short descriptive sentence or two which often display Harris' wry sense of humor.  Because Harris is British most of the stories here come from courtrooms in the UK, but there are quite a few that have American roots like the Clinton impeachment or the Dred Scott case.  Some of the tales deal with well known names like Judge Jeffries or Judge Roy Bean, but I found the stories that were most interesting were of obscurer (at least to me) judges and lawyers like Henry Alfred McCardie or Lord Hewart.  Other tales, like that dealing with Herbert Armstrong, were illuminating in a different way: Dorothy L. Sayers often referred to \\"the Armstrong case\\" in her detective stories, but until I read Harris' description of his trial for murder for poisoning his wife and attempting to poison another man I never understood its significance. I also appreciated having certain obscure terms like \\"outlawry\\" defined in accessible terms.  When necessary footnotes further explain or add some details.<br /><br />The stories found in Tales From The Courtroom will amuse and sometimes frustrate you, but they do help those of us with limited experience of the legal world to better understand how it operates.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|Exellent sound, nice previously unreleased versions.<br />Disco at it`s best. History of popular dance music in one package.<br />Thanks to Mr. Nile for his music anyway, and especially for this unselfishly compiled peace of art.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|The only downside to the series is that it was not long enough!  I always enjoy watching it these the whole way through and it never gets old.  The cast is just a great team.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I like movies where I can learn about someone else's life challenges. Yes the movie brought tears to my eyes but<br />Gratitude for what I have and take for granted everyday.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I haven't even gotten a chance to try this game yet.  My 6 and 8 year olds as well as my 14 year old keep monopolizing it on my Kindle.  They really enjoy the game and the subtle ways it is different from their other favorite Temple Run.<br /><br />Easy and fun app/game for all.
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|It's very refreshing to watch actors that I haven't seen before. The plot is less predictable than most, and the character development is believable. I'm glad I overcame my initial horror of this show after having watched the Season 2 opener, which was especially grizzly, as my first exposure. I hope to enjoy TWD for many seasons to come.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|It's a rom-com. Get some wine, some friends, a box of tissues if you're a crier, and just watch it. Even if you hate the story, British accents, so yay!
0385349831|5.0|A wise man sits in a square taking questions about life on the eve of his town's massacre by an invading army. His wisdom, delivered in simple yet profound sentences, can alter the course of your life. A must-read for anyone interested in living a courageous, loving, meaningful life. My favorite quotes:<br /><br />16. In the cycle of nature there is no such thing as victory or defeat; there is only movement ... there are neither winners nor losers; there are only stages that must be gone through. When the human heart understands this, it is free and able to accept difficult times without being deceived by moments of glory.<br /><br />23. Defeat ends when we launch into another battle. Failure has no end; it is a lifetime choice.<br /><br />30. The act of discovering who we are will force us to accept that we can go further than we think.<br /><br />31. .. saying no does not always show a lack of generosity, and that saying yes is not always a virtue.<br /><br />40. Ask a flower in the field: \\"Do you feel useful? After all you do nothing but produce the same flowers over and over.\\" And the flower will answer: \\"I am beautiful, and beauty is my reason fro living.\\" Ask the river: \\"Do you feel useful, given that all you do is keep flowing in the same direction?\\" And the river will answer: \\"I'm not trying to be useful; I'm trying to be a river.\\" Nothing in this world is useless in the eyes of God.<br /><br />41. Don't try to be useful. Try to be yourself; that is enough, and that makes all the difference.<br /><br />42. Do one thing: Live the life you always wanted to live. Avoid criticizing others and concentrate on fulfilling your dreams.<br /><br />48. Dreaming carries no risks. The dangerous thing is trying to transform your dreams into reality.<br /><br />50-51. ... they risk taking a first step -- sometimes out of curiosity, sometimes out of ambition, but generally because they feel an uncontrollable longing for adventure. At each bend in the road, they feel more and more afraid, and yet, at the same time, they surprise themselves; they are stronger and happier. Joy. That is one of the main blessings of the All Powerful. If we are happy, we are on the right road.<br /><br />53. \\"Difficulty\\" is the name of an ancient tool that was created purely to help us define who we are.<br /><br />54. And to those who believe that adventures are dangerous, I say, try routine; that kills you far more quickly.<br /><br />68. Because Enthusiasm is the Sacred Fire.<br /><br />135. And may this lead us to behave impeccably, making use of the four cardinal virtues: boldness, elegance, love, and friendship.<br /><br />146. Excessive caution destroys the soul and the heart, because living is an act of courage, and an act of courage is always an act of love.\\"<br /><br />151. Our soul is governed by four invisible forces: love, death, power, and time.<br /><br />153. Therefore, what the future holds for you depends entirely on your capacity for love.<br /><br />153. The greatest gift God gave us is the power to make decisions.<br /><br />154. And precisely when everything seems to be going well and your dream is almost within your grasp, that is when you must be more alert than ever. Because when your dream is almost within your grasp, you will be assailed by terrible GUILT.<br /><br />169: The wounded person should ask himself: \\"Is it worth filling my heart with hatred and dragging the weight of it around with me?\\"<br /><br />177. On loyalty: And beware of the pain you can cause yourself by allowing a vile and cowardly heart to be part of your world. ONce the evil has been done, there is no point in blaming anyone: the owner of the house was the one who opened the door.<br /><br />178. The most important of wars is not waged with a lofty spirit or a soul accepting of its fate. It is the war that is going on now, as we speak, and whose battlefield is the Spirit, where Good and Evil, Courage and Cowardice, Love and Fear face one another.<br /><br />Iloved this book... surprisingly, as much as I liked The Alchemist.<br /><br />-- Brendon Burchard. #1 New York Times bestselling author of \\"THE CHARGE\\" and \\"THE MILLIONAIRE MESSENGER\\"loved this book... surprisingly, as much as I liked The Alchemist.<br /><br />-- Brendon Burchard. #1 New York Times bestselling author of \\"THE CHARGE\\" and \\"THE MILLIONAIRE MESSENGER\\"

0061950726|4.0|I was fascinated by the premise of this novel, the shipping of orphaned children from New York City to placement in the Midwest, more than two hundred thousand between 1854-1929. Setting the drama in current day Maine (2011) and 1920s New York and Maine, Orphan Train features two essential characters: ninety-one year old Vivian Daly and Penobscot Indian foster child Molly Ayer, seventeen. Struggling to stay in her latest assigned home despite an adversarial foster mother, Molly has agreed to a Community Service assignment for stealing a library copy of Jane Eyre in lieu of a record, eighty hours devoted to assisting elderly widow Vivian Daly sort through a cluttered attic. Vivian's attic is cluttered with more than tattered boxes of books,  as memories of a harrowing childhood in Ireland, New York and finally Maine, come tumbling out as Molly listens, rapt.<br /><br />Both without the comfort of family, cast upon the treacherous terrain of care by strangers, Molly and Vivian develop a rapport that plants the seed of a deep affection neither of them expects at the beginning of their encounters. Alternating between time frames, dominance is given to the the world of an immigrant child, born Niamh (Neev) Power in Ireland, who loses her entire family in a tenement fire. Gathered up with other displaced orphans, Niamh is a passenger on one of the notorious \\"Orphan Trains\\" that deliver homeless children across the Midwest for adoption as family additions, or mothers helpers, most often for hard manual labor none of them have previously experienced. Meant to free these children from the dangers of corruption endemic to the city, Niamh's (or Dorothy's, or Vivian's) tale reflects the fallacy of such an ambitious enterprise, no matter how well-intentioned.<br /><br />Vivian's story is truly heartbreaking, her circumstances wretched, raw courage pushing the child to survive her encounters with mistreatment, starvation, physical and sexual abuse and the futility of depending upon the system for security, let alone safety. Orphan Train paints a portrait of this country rarely seen, a questionable social experiment told with insight and compassion on behalf of  those caught in the web of do-gooders hoping to save children from city temptations. The evolution of an unlikely friendship, the mending of a lost relationship and the catharsis of telling long-held secrets make this novel a compelling experience, two females finding safe haven in the sharing of mutual pain and a capacity for love.

0441013597|5.0|Giving an explanation of Dune between the four corners of one of these little reviews is kind of like condensing an explanation of reality into a few sound bites.<br /><br />It's not so much a limitation of these reviews.  Indeed even the 1984 Hollywood movie based on this book got tripped up on the details, all too often sacrificing that all important portrait of the forrest by concentrating not only on its trees but even the leaves on those trees.<br /><br />These things are true because in this book Frank Herbert managed to create an entire reality out of the whole cloth of his knowledge of story telling, people, linguistics and perhaps most importantly the difficulties of life in the desert.<br /><br />In this way I guess the desert is its own character and maybe the most important one in this story.  Thanks to Herbert's artistry you can litterally feel the sun on your back and the sand between your toes as he describes it.<br /><br />For everyone who's seen the movie (or I guess movies) or who has either read or is familiar with this book, Arakis is desert or more specifically an entire desert planet.  Just like the modern deserts of the middle east find themselves surprisingly significant because of the petroleum products lying beneath their surfaces, the desert world Arakis finds itself significant because its own unique type of product:  spice.  In the future, the year 10191, spice is used by the Guild so that people and products can be transported between planets.<br /><br />The native inhabitants of Arakis are the Fremen and I guess sort of like the modern people of the middle east they find themselves subjugated...not so much by the elite among them as by rulers imposed them from the outside.  Until 10191 their externally imposed rulers were the Harkkonens, led by the evil Baron Vladamir Harkkonen.  In one of his examples of overstating the case, Herbert goes to great lengths to make his Baron repugnant in every way.  You can litterally smell the stench of him whenever he appears in the story.<br /><br />Facing off against Baron Harkkonen and his clan are the people of House Atreides, perhaps most notably the young Paul, ducal heir.  At the instigation of the Padishah Emporer, Shaddam IV, the main event in this story is the assumption of control over Arakis and its spice production by the House Atreides from the Harkkonens.  Not surprisingly the Harkkonens aren't excited about this prospect and use a series of schemes in order to re take the planet.<br /><br />Indeed, the question of who takes this planet, who conquers the desert really becomes the story of this book.  Along the way to its conclusion, readers will see a lot of (even main) characters die, they'll see many knife fights, they'll witness coups and wars and they'll hear (maybe much) more philosophizing than they care to because -- and make no mistake about it -- this is a book that takes itself very seriously.<br /><br />Even for those readers not planning to go on to read any of this book's sequels I think it's still worth the effort to read this one.  Regardless of the merits or demerits of the world he's created, it's undeniable that Herbert has created a world.  For the characters in it the lessons do relate to survival.  For the readers I think, Herbert's \\"faithful\\" learn that other all important lesson (particularly when it comes to science fiction):  suspending disbelief.f him whenever he appears in the story.<br /><br />Facing off against Baron Harkkonen and his clan are the people of House Atreides, perhaps most notably the young Paul, ducal heir.

For the readers I think, Herbert's \\"faithful\\" learn that other all important lesson (particularly when it comes to science fiction):  suspending disbelief.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I did not care for the book as I found it very tedious and the message was well intended but not very clear to me.... but the movie was fantastic due to the imaging which I understand was a blend of computer generated and real life images....and I was unable to notice the difference, which was the amazing part for me.<br /><br />.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Except for one song, I just love this new Bowie album. You hear songs reminding me of a wide range of things that David Bowie has done during his marvelous career. You can tell, that he had fun, when he made this record. So much power in the music and his voice. If you loved any part of his career, you will like this record. Highly recommended!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Awesome show if you're into fairy tales and fantasy. Great story line and keeps you hooked through out the show.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|But then, I do like it much better than the earlier film version of this story.  This is an incredible, classic story.  The first movie release formatted the presentation as though it were an oratorio.  I did not like that.  This version is full of setting and dramatic action.  I prefer it this way.  Also, the performances of Hugh Jackman and Ann Hathaway are theatrical gemstones!
B009FAQ9JW|1.0|The Amazon Prime stream and the TGG Direct DVD-R, an \\"Amazon Deluxe Widescreen\\" release, are both awful and should be avoided. Not worth the price--and the stream is free for Prime members.
0525953728|5.0|Absolutely worth reading!  Was one of the best books that I have read in a really long time.  Have no better explanation.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the entire series and am looking forward for the second movie to come out. It was so easy to read on my new Kindle Fire.

B009LDD4V4|3.0|evidently the network execs need to have the women barefoot 'n preggers ... so those viewers who find the forensic stuff interesting need to also like to see their women in the home (his feelings are so easily hurt by her, woe is them)<br />-- or do what we do ... fast forward thru the domestic scenes (except those involving sweets) -- then the season is relatively enjoyable.<br />brennan is, 70% of the time, a caricature (of what, one wonders ... her writers call upon her to be anything at any time ... nasty, small, mean-spirited, yet sweet and kind when the writers need sweet and kind, a genius but oh so stupid when the writers need stupid)<br />big galump of a husband is still religious.  and boyish.  way heroic.  and protective.  every woman's dreamcometrue.<br />the science is good --<br />sweets is a+<br />fox network execs display total commitment to pound of makeup per eye for women, as viewers unable to notice womens' eyes without pound/eye of makeup ... and thankfully network execs totally committed to idea of female body being grotesque to see, unless the women are in spike heels.<br />fox network execs also think customers want to buy fox advertising with every episode -- FOX/AMAZON SHOULD DISCOUNT THIS SEASON (AND REBATE CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED THE CONTAMINATED EPISODES).  we will not buy any of the items fox pushed at us.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|Unlike industry moguls Pixar and DreamWorks, Blue Sky Studios hasn't been quite as versatile in their subject-matter when it comes to pumping out computer generated animated feature films.  Most people are aware of their ever-growing Ice Age franchise but do keep in mind that these are the guys behind Robots, Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who, the forthcoming Epic and Charles M Shultz's long overdue Peanuts CG film.  In short these guys have certainly been keeping busy!<br /><br />Amidst all of these projects, Blue Sky released Rio back in 2011; a vibrant piece that forever silenced naysayers who claimed the studio didn't have access to the incredible color pallets of the competition.  Costing an estimated $90-mil, Rio comes in at a runtime of 96-minutes and wears an appropriate G-rating.<br /><br />The story follows Blu, a wild born domesticated blue macaw thought to be the last of his breed, taken from Rio de Janeiro and then deposited in Minnesota only to head back to Brazil when an ornithologist believes that a potential mate has been secured in the wild.<br /><br />On an existential level there's some ironic tragedy in the concept of removing a wild animal from nature, domesticating it so that it is completely dependent upon human care, then returning it to the wild where it's unable to perform such basic survival tactics as fly but not to worry, Rio is a lot more about having fun then it is environmentalism agendas (thankfully).<br /><br />Add to this some well casted voice talent: Jesse Eisenberg as Blu; Anne Hathaway as his love interest Jewel; Jamie Foxx and will.i.am as a streetwise and musical canary and cardinal duo; George Lopez as a local toucan; Tracy Morgan as a slobbering bulldog; and Jemaine Clement of \\"Flight of the Conchords\\" fame stepping in as the villainous cockatoo Nigel.  The casting is flawless in their respective roles and add a great deal of energy to the visuals, which in case I haven't mentioned, are crisp, bright, and bouncy.<br /><br />The opening musical number, featuring a rainbow stream of various birds of paradise in choreographed flight sets the tone of things to come.  While the film flirts with the concept of being a dedicated musical, I am pleased to report that the music here does nothing but add to the party-like vibe of the affair.  Everything from some original salsa-flavored tunes to Lionel Richie's \\"Say you, Say Me\\" to one of Jemaine Clement's hilarious rap numbers (straight out of his book as the character Hip-hop-opotamus).<br /><br />Separating this from a strictly talking-animals affair however is the brilliantly intertwined B-story involving Blu's adopted mom Linda and said ornithologist (the nerdy but goodhearted Tulio) falling for one another as well.  Had I been charged with the job of naming this film, I believe something like \\"Of Nerds and Birds\\" would have been in order.<br /><br />In all I found Rio to be a magnificent entry into the competitive CG market from Blue Sky, perhaps their strongest, most fleshed out to date in fact.  I'm apparently not alone in this assessment either as a sequel (Rio 2) is on Blue Sky's release schedule for 2014 (smack dab between Epic and Peanuts).  An interesting side note- it's oft rumored that Rio was actually responsible for Pixar having cancelled a film they were putting together called \\"newt\\" due to plot similarities.  You know you're doing something right when you can get the undisputed leader of the industry to stop in their tracks!e opening musical number, featuring a rainbow stream of various birds of paradise in choreographed flight sets the tone of things to come.

B007KOMTUI|5.0|This series epitomizes the 60's. As a woman it is good to see times have changed... somewhat! very entertaining and totally a fashionistas dream!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The whole story was very well done & it was so great a today kind of story I loved how they put the deceased wife as the best friend untilthe end !! the violent Part could of been delented ! But hey there has to be gun playin the good movies lol  !
B00425S1H8|4.0|I plugged this in to my new Windows 8 machine and it auto-installed and started working right away. Taking one star off only because the cable seems a bit flimsy. Wish I could take off just 1/2 a star instead, since it worked perfectly. So far I've used it to communicate with my older Garmin GPS, which requires a serial port. I plugged the Garmin cable into this and the GPS software recognized it right away.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|100 chapters of brilliance . This book is a must read for its survival and spiritual aspects<br />.5 stars is to modest
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Best tv drama series EVER! This series really brings the books to life with amazing accuracy. Lots of action and debauchery!
B000W7JWUA|2.0|I thoroughly enjoy the game, however this item came without the orange settlement tokens and this is very frustrating indeed
B0054SMIH6|5.0|my suggestion to you is do not buy this dvd  rent it or even better join prime and stream this movie
0345529057|4.0|Books come in a nice &#34;kit&#34; and haven't fallen apart yet. I'm only part way through the first book and am enjoying it so far.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this for my 5 year old daughter who plays the version on her brother's Xbox.<br />She loves it and now she can take it with her anywhere!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|The live radio only has 8 choices which seems a bit few for my taste...<br /><br />I would like at least 10-12 choices if it's possible since I listen to wide variety of genres...<br /><br />if anyone is having trouble with update, try uninstalling and reinstalling the app...backup the settings if you can before uninstalling if you have lot of presets...or make an account so you can retrieve it later...
B00ANAC32U|1.0|Normally I wouldn't pay $20 for just about any cell phone accessory but I guess I was celebrating my new Nexus 4 when I bought this. Also, people seemed to really love it. Well, it IS really good. Great fit, looks like part of the phone. But don't pay this ridiculous price!
0385344228|5.0|My book club picked this as our selection for March. I knew it was about a father defending his son in a murder case. It went so much deeper. I couldn't put it down. As a parent, it had me constantly thinking &#34;what would I do in that situation?&#34; I took some of my son's 8 year old friends bowling and I was in the last part of the book. I watching them bowling and being goofy but tried to imagine what they would be at 14. In my opinion, the book was well written and highly disturbing. If you like John Grisham and Scott Turrow, you will like this book.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|I decided to netflix this movie because Ryan Gosling is in it and I am a fan of his other movies. I don't even know where to begin. It was a complete mess. The score was terrible and did not fit the movie at all. There were several awkward scenes where it would just be Ryan staring off into space for like 30 seconds and then cut out.<br /><br />The plot was stupid. It jumped around so much and it didn't make any sense. There were so many completely unncessary things in this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this movie, it was a waste of a perfectly good two hours for me. I regret even finishing it after the cheesy beginning.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|For me, David Baldacci has had a mixed record.  I loved hist first book, Absolute Power, but didn't like the next few.  More recently, I love his Camel Club and John Puller series books.  This is the first recent book of that is not in those series that I really like.  If you like Absolute power or the Camel Club, this is a must read.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I noticed everything has already been written about this masterpiece. WALK OF LIFE is one of the best tunes EVER.A MUST HAVE CD.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I got turned off early with the opening political statement scene even before the story began.  As a student of Lincoln I fouond it was reasonably accurate as relates to the history I have read.  Beautifully acted by the major stars, hence the Academy Awards given it, and it was worth seeing.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I love this thing.  I have an Asus UX32 Ultra book that I put an ssd in but the USB 2.0 adapter that came with it allowed about 12-10 MB/s transfer which is what I get on wireless N.  with this I can transfer at 100-80 MB/s.  So I am extremely happy with this.  I am not carrying it around just leaving it connected at the house on my fast network and carrying the USB 2.0 because the wireless internet at hotels sucks.  so I like to plug in.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|this game is just great period every thing is great in this game it is fun I love it so much
B0043KK4N6|5.0|My cd came to me in record time and in perfect shape. I love the movie Burlesque and have been wanting the CD and<br />finally found it.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise, but seeing these two stars together is a guarantee of quality. The script gives them lots to play with, and play they do; their relationship is quite believable and touching as well. Gervasi directs very well, top notch in fact and unexpectedly coming from the guy who did the Anvil movie. It was great, but who knew he could direct a straight feature so tightly? A name to watch.<br /><br />I found the story entertaining and informative, and loving Hitch but not knowing this whole tale gave me plenty to think about. Hopkins gives a great performance, but Mirren is even finer as Alma. Their connection is real and carries the film easily, and the nice turns by Johanssen and Biel add to the fun.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray, it looks good, decent transfer, and over an hour of extras, a few docs, etc. But one scary thing Fox did here, which likely heralds a new era of scamosity, is package the BD and dvd together. You can't just buy either, which sucks for dvd viewers, and frankly the whole dvd/BD combo is a rip and is now standard; how many blu-ray viewers still want a dvd? Very few is my guess, but they print one up for ten cents and then charge an extra five or ten clams for it. Oh well, their loss, because it keeps me from buying most BDs. I rented this, as with most, and if they get rid of rentals, which they are trying to do with the whole cloud deal, I'll just stick with netflux.<br /><br />I'm guessing Hitch would agree. He didn't like getting ripped off by the studios either.<br /><br />But that aside, fine movie and well worth seeing for fans of Hitch or either of the two leads, who are among the best still working in film today.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I love this new album so much!  NKOTB never disappoints.  I've been a fan for over 20 years and can't wait to marry Joey Joe someday.  Yes, my husband knows!!!  :D
B00BK5D95C|5.0|The first song I had the distinct pleasure of experiencing, and it is AN experience, was Breezeblocks. I got one taste and I keep coming back for more. The album has an incredible flow and balance that allows for continuous and uninterrupted play from beginning to end. This album has been labeled under many genres and styles but none of them sincerely capture the true essence of the work. Soulful, melodic and intricate, this is undoubtedly one of the best albums released in the last decade.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Pretty cool to play but I like Bridges much better.  I mostly go for the hard puzzles as the 5 &amp; 6 are just for kids. The 9 x 9 can be really challenging.
B0063TX06I|5.0|Great cd  Received it super fast which was really great.  Recommend purchasing if you love the BeeGees.  Nice to have some good music these days
B00364K6YW|5.0|I enjoyed this version of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; so much more than the more recent movie version.  I think the acting is so much better.
B000JJCQ68|3.0|A great reminder of how precious life is. The movie itself is wonderful. But when I received disk it wouldn't play.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This is a pretty standard match 3 game.  Nice graphics and increasing difficulty as you go thru the levels.  Pretty good value for a freebie.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Great!  Recommend.  this is a great collection of BeeGees music.  You will love having it in your collection.  Listening to it now.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So glad it is available on Amazon Prime. I view the program on my iPad and the quality is outstanding. Netflix is only has season one available.  Thanks Amazon!
B003629IPW|5.0|I've never before realized MJ's talent, as the media has always made a living on his \\"weirdness\\".  In reality, and this DVD shows it, he had an amazing gift for music, dancing and creativity.  I never knew.  The drawback is that the disc opens with a King Obama commercial.  That Imperialist doesn't quit.  He's burning down our country and wants us to worship him every chance we get.  Get off my DVD! ...and get out of my life!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Wasn't expecting much but my 12 year old son said it was really good.  He was correct.  This was really a good movie that was a very creative screenplay that didn't follow the usual Hollywood formula.  Great ending.
1452101248|5.0|And even for the rest of the family -- this book elevates vegan/vegetarian meals to haute cuisine that will be the centerpiece of a dinner.  With this book you can make an entirely vegetable-based, show-stopping meal that the entire family/friends/dinner party guests will love and still be talking about next time you see them.  The photos are beautiful and inspiring.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love you Hugh Howey! This book is amazing. I bought it out of curiosity, (and because it was cheap, I admit) and now I'm addicted....what a wonderful rich world you've created...the story grabs you and throws you into a place that is both foreign and familiar. The situations are not so different from our world today, so you empathize with the heartache, the hopelessness, and the fear present in this society. As the story is told, and you get to know these wonderful characters, you realize that you are as hungry for the truth as they are! This was one of the best reads I've come across in a long time, and now I'm diving into the next part of the story in Shift Omnibus. I'll catch you when I come up for my next breath of air!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|this was a very good book in seeing both sides of Steve Jobs - the genius - the jerk.  Very well written and thought provoking.  Seeing the attitudes of Steve Jobs and the inter-workings of relationships in Apple actually make me appreciate Apple and their product more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good images and fun challenges. Like the first one but different. I highly recommend it, at least for kindle fires
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|I'M a big fan of Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA).  I love how he depicts human interaction in all of his films.  Joaquin Phoenix is borderline disturbing as Freddy Quell.  He gets completely lost in his role.  A truly fascinating actor and film.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|great movie - have always loved every movie that Denzel Washington has ever been in and this is no exception
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Options as to what the world could be like in the future.  Held your interest and there are two more books in the series.  Could have been a little shorter.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian Michaels knows how to make the best of your time with these short but effective workouts.  Definitely recommend this DVD.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a great album.Fun is a unique band with a unique style. If you like the earlier stuff you will love this.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|actually bought for my daughter at her request but I enjoyed watching it as well. Decent remakes of Beatle's songs
0307341550|5.0|I have just discovered this author and wanted to read her first book first.  This book has so many comparisons and yet stands on it's own as a novel about severely warped people in a small town in Missouri and the \\"hometown girl\\" who returns as a reporter from Chicago to investigate the murder of two young girls.  The depravity of the family, the town and the book itself cannot be overstated.  If deviancy and graphic descriptions of torture (both mental and physical) are things you just can't stomach you may not like the book.  But, the honesty and sadness are the salvation of the story.  It is man's unkindness to man that characterizes the story just as it does the world in real life.  It has shades of Stephen King without the supernatural which it doesn't need.  I can't say I never flinched at some of it and that alone gives it five stars in my opinion.  Not a book that will soon leave your subconscious.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I had been eyeing this seat for a while now. Some of the reviews had me on the fence but I'm very glad I bought it. Good design, pretty sturdy and well made. My son fits into it well enough but if your child is 25 lbs and up, I can see how they might grow out of it quickly, my son wont be able to use it 6 months from now but I have a 3 month old that will also get to use it.<br /><br />The best part of it is your child is right in front of you, its like they're sitting on your lap. Makes for pretty special moments as you ride around. Sort of increases the bonding during your rides.<br /><br />A few things to note.<br /><br />There is a bar that you will need to install on your bike to install the seat. It needs to connect to the head tube (part of the frame) and not the head set (part of the handle bars). Its important the the bar is connected to something that does not need to move in order to function. Check your bike to see if it has a 1&#34; space for the bar to be mounted.<br /><br />Also, I'm 5'11&#34; and my legs are pretty long, I have to open my legs a bit to pedal, otherwise I'd be kneeing my son every time I peddle. If you're bigger than me, might want to consider a rear or handle bar mounted seat otherwise it might be a bit comfortable on longer rides.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|One of the best Jack Reacher novels. Can't wait for the next one.  Reacher is everyone's hero. When is the next Reacher novel coming?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|wonderful show - love the acting and storyline! I am now addicted to the show and can't wait to watch!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is a good mix of hidden objects, mini puzzles and an exciting adventure.. I'm hooked wand I'm looking forward to finishing the story..
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I intended to watch the pilot to see if this was a series my husband and I could watch together.  When the pilot episode was over, I had to watch &#34;just one more&#34; before letting him know this was a good one.  Now into Season 2, I don't want to wait for him to catch up with me, so I keep taking breaks with my iPad and watching more episodes back to back.  It's that good!  I need to do laundry and clean my floors!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Truly the most beautiful book that I have ever read. Time to rethink how I live my life and time to start \\"participating.\\" I could not get enough of Charlie and his incredible mind.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|loved the movie - lent our copy to  a friend who waited over a year to return - bought this as a replacement
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I could not update on my T-Mobile 4G phone. I looked at the developer 's help file and it said to first uninstall the app, then install the new update.  Worked like a charm. I think the developers should put that step in the description so one does not need to look deeper to solve the problem. Apparently, I am not the only one.<br />HONEST THOMAS
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the characters and thought was very well written. For once the story was not predictable.<br />Loved the realness of the characters and was so sad when it ended because I will miss the main characters. Was so pleasantly surprised by the surrounding characters and how much depth and thought and reality was in them.<br />Have recommended this book to friends and my 14 year old daughter.<br />Loved it!!!!!
0307895475|4.0|[[ASIN:B00C04VNGO Bethesda 11761 Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for PC]][[ASIN:B004HYK8Y8 Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]<br />The new edition of the Official Game Guide is written very well. The new coverage on DawnGaurd and Hearthfire is very good. But bear in mind, the guide doesn't cover the Dragonborn DLC to this date, and makes it kinda difficult to follow some of the game play of this DLC.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|If you are like me, a huge fan of Portal 2, then go ahead and purchase this soundtrack. It also includes the music from the first game which is super awesome. Go on. Buy it.
B0093BUWGE|4.0|This is an artist with hidden talent and a versatile voice. Loved the arrangements, duets with the female singers, and his backup musical group. Cool R&B for fans who want to listen to soothing music. Enjoying most of the songs.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is so well written and I love the characters. Grey who? Cross is so much more of a fantasy man, he seems like he could be a real person. Eva is the kind of character I would want to know. Even Cary with his wishy washy sexuality preferences is such a natural character. This book was a true fantasy with all the money, power, and lifestyle that I could not put it down. I am completely consumed by the Gideon Cross/ Eva Tramell love affair.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a very refreshing album by Andrea Bocelli.  He is amazing in that he can sing anything in any language.  The DVD is also lovely with the beautiful scenes from the area as a great back drop.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|so far so good.  was worried that it would be another one of those free games that only let you go so far before asking for more money.  great graphics, and fast paced!
1603429999|5.0|Very comprehensive reference book with easy to follow instructions and clear illustrations. This book includes project workshops that use the specific techniques. My project goal (one of many) will be to experiment with each of these workshops to sharpen my techniques. A 'go to' book for circular needle knitters.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game has so many layers &amp; missions you could probably continue playing forever. Gameplay is free unless you are too impatient to wait for energy or diamonds to restore. Search for hidden objects in the many rooms of the mansion,  visit other players' mansions &amp;exchange gifts with them. You can also banish monsters that roam the yard to earn rewards. New quests are added regularly.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Unless you intend to watch the entire movie plus all the extras at one sitting you will find this blu-ray very annoying. First of all, it seems to take decades to load. Put it in and make a cup of coffee! Then you are subjected to many ads that you can't skip. When you finally reach the menu, it is the most confusing an baffling one you are ever likely to find on any disc. Finally if you wish to watch part of the movie and then resume later, the whole process has to start again! To bad, the contents of the disc are magnificent.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Much better price than retail stores. I was able to download it to my pc and load it into my iTunes library.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Just when you think the Terminator franchise can't get any better, pow!  The Sarah Conner Chronicles hits the seen.  Lena Headey is awesome, and Summer Glau isn't too hard to look at either.
1439156816|5.0|Writers will find \\"On Writing\\" a smiling, sagacious, radiant face once they lift the macabre veil of its author and openly absorb its pages. And it is promised to be an effortless journey once begun, as Stephen King's treasure chest is deeper and more luminary than the modern, and even the not-so-modern writer, could have ever imagined. Even if your not a Stephen King fan, the autobiographical gleam of his gold lures you in helplessly, excitedly, empathizing uncontrollably as you go along for the ride on this singular author's provocative journey to greatness. And then, a cool drink and luxurious repast to recuperate from your endorphin-drunk road buzz, the now enthralled, knowledge-hungry writer, from absolute beginner to veteran, is offered real writing tips that have teeth. Before the book's last page, it suddenly hits you that Stephen King's macabre veil is not so macabre after all ... just a symptom of our own ignorance, King laughing all the way to literary heaven, and, before he ascends one grandiose last time, to the bank.<br /><br />Yours in literature,<br />J.G.C.
B001NLL0RW|3.0|okay, if you have been reading these in sequence, you know exactly what to expect.  Three story lines (or if you prefer 3 short stories loosely connected by employment at Sigma Force ) that will come together at the end. Each of the story lines was engaging but it took a black box to pull them together at the end.  The denoument was really anti-climactic.  this is an instance when a book is too short to bring everything together in a satisfying manner.
B005HSL626|5.0|My grandchildren love this game and that is why I down loaded it for them. Of all the games that I have down loaded on my Kindle for them,this is their favorite.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|if you are looking for a 'feel good' story about a friendship between  a woman and a horse, walk on.  This movie is about Diane Lane ,based on a true story , and of a horse that won 3 very tough races to even place in. It does show women in a positive light despite the males in that day and age being discouraging to her.But there is no emotional bond between the main character and the horse.

0425263908|5.0|IT is a great story, great characters, easy to read, and relate, recommend everyone read this series, I love Sylvia Day!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Movie had it all.  The actors were remarkable.  All the emotions displayed were so believable.  Not having all professional singers, made it more believable.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|This movie is more about the people that the horse came into contact with then the horse itself. The ending is a happy one but because of the brutal war scenes and shots where the horse is being traumatized I would not recommend this film for children. I was actually put off by the many war scenes and of course war itself is disgusting.But I am a sucker for animals and I read ahead of time that the horse does not die so I went ahead and watched this. The acting was okay but you do to really get a sense of connection to any of the characters because they are in the horse's life so briefly.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I heard about the novel from the award nominations the film got at the Oscars 2013.  I always read a book before I watch a movie, so I bought the novel for my Kindle.... it was a really good read, and offered many insights into some common mental health issues that some may not know how to handle in everyday life.  Very good read overall...
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Chris Cornell is still the best American rock singer.  Kim Thayil's exotic sitar-flavored guitar noodlings are just perfect.  Matt's polyrhythms are just as intricate and interesting as ever.  The compositions are classic Soundgarden, inventive, complex, and varied.
B004G6009U|5.0|My favorite Disney animated film used to be The Little Mermaid.  I'm surprised this movie has surpassed it.  I never saw this movie in the theater because I thought it was going to suck based upon some SM elements on the trailer and the fact that they changed the movie's name from &#34;Rapunzel&#34; to &#34;Tangled.&#34;  When I heard that Chayanne, one of my favorite singers, did the voice of the leading man on the Spanish version of the film, I decided to buy it and watch it.  I loved it.  The plot, the colors, the character and background design, and the action were all great.  I highly recommend it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It is a good book. Kind of hard to get into at first. After the initial beginning, it picks up. Good read!

B000O8OTNC|3.0|I don't especially like or dislike this little sharpener, I have used it now for a couple of serated bladed knives and the filing is not really fine enough to leave a really smooth finish on the curved serations.  I have not used the carbide or ceramic sharpeners as that is not why I purchased the tool.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|As you might now, Disney rereleases its animated films every 7 years.  If you miss buying a certain movie, you have to wait until Disney releases it again.  I bought the previous version of Beauty and the Beast on DVD.  It was very good, although it didn't have a Spanish soundtrack.  I actually prefer watching these movies in Spanish, because these were the versions that played on the movie theaters when I was little.  This version might have a slightly better image, I'm not sure, but I can choose a Spanish soundtrack now.  Since I am pretending BluRay does not exist (I don't want to buy all my movies again), I will stick with this version for a while.
1476733953|4.0|Toxic winds blow through angry cloud-covered skies. The earth is dust and ash. The buildings of the city are hollow, decayed skeletons. This can all be seen through camera lenses from the safety of the silo. Top to bottom, people are safe. They have purpose --- from the mechanics who dwell in the deep down and feed power throughout the levels, to the farmers of the mid level, the IT geeks, and the workers of the upper level. Life is dictated, jobs have color-coded overalls, relationships are documented, children are allowed for via lottery, and you never, ever talk of the \\"outside.\\" To do so is a crime, and the punishment is to be sent outside to clean the lenses of the cameras and to perish in the harsh world while others watch.<br /><br />This is the world of WOOL.<br /><br />Actually a collection of five books, WOOL tells the story of the people of the silo, beginning with Sheriff Holston and his deputy. Holston is asking to be let outside, which is a crime. But he is a broken man, no longer able to live with the grief of losing his wife, a woman who was sent outside three years earlier. It is in this short opening book that we learn of the silo, the hierarchy, and the Uprisings of the past and the threat they pose to the order of things. Holston's story ends, but book two shifts to the deputy and the mayor, seeking his replacement in the deep down --- a mechanic named Juliette. Their journey down the silo and back up deepens the setting and expands the knowledge of the silo and its history. By the time Juliette's story takes over in book three, the power plays and political machinations in the silo are coming to the fore, and secrets long hidden begin to find daylight, threatening the silo and all those who inhabit it.<br /><br />Author Hugh Howey has designed a world with the harsh, post-apocalyptic feel of such novels as Justin Cronin's THE PASSAGE, Cormac McCarthy's THE ROAD, and Walter Miller's A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ. While it is categorized as science fiction like Miller's work, it is quite possible to shelve it alongside Cronin and McCarthy in general fiction. It is an accessible work for readers of all genres because the story is compelling, harrowing, and the people whose lives we witness unravel on the pages are vivid and engaging.<br /><br />The world of WOOL is gritty and frighteningly plausible. Through the story, as secrets come to light, readers and characters alike are left to wonder if some secrets are worth keeping. Is it safer, is it more for the good of all, to keep people ignorant? Is it more logical to create a lie than to allow people to hope foolishly? Sheriff Holston's tale springs the leak from which the story unwinds, but the majority of the book belongs to Juliette. Each character plucks at a different strand of the web, yet ultimately they all become entangled in the middle as the truth bears down. Their individual tales are haunting and sad, and Howey has done an exemplary job at making you give a damn. And you certainly do.<br /><br />WOOL was an enormous success already in the digital world and landed Howey a lavish contract for a print version. Whether you choose print or pixels, WOOL will capture you. It is a tremendously well-crafted tale, and a recommendation to read it is quite easily offered. If this is any indication of what we can expect from Howey in the future, then his next works will be eagerly awaited indeed.<br /><br />- Stephen Hubbard

0385349947|5.0|When Sheryl Sandberg chose the striking phrase \\"lean in\\" as the name for her audacious and personable memoir, subtitled \\"Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,\\" she literally struck a chord in some rather unlikely places. Among musicians --- if one is lucky enough to work with truly enlightened teachers, colleagues, or conductors --- the urge to \\"lean\\" into key phrases, themes or motifs conveys meaning through a wealth of interdependent artistic experiences that far transcend mere notes on paper. You learn that leaning in only works when performers become solidly rooted into foundations of confidence, technique and trust.    Believe it or not, that musical analogy has everything to do with Sandberg's finally liberated passion to wholly re-imagine the context of working women everywhere. Her journey to \\"lean in\\" began with introspection but steadily expanded into a mission, and then a movement, to ignite the vast untapped potential of half the workforce on Earth.    Emerging from myriad observations, anecdotes, dialogues, statistics, predictions, and a giant-sized helping of lived experience is the core truth that you can't \\"lean in\\" to anything from the brittle edge of a chasm carved out by countless generations of gender-biased assumptions and misunderstandings. As in music, the ability of women to \\"lean in\\" and discover deeper professional and creative dimensions in their lives depends on growing strong assertive roots and support networks.    One of Sandberg's most startling findings --- despite great strides made by the feminist movements of the '60s and '70s --- is how many working women retreat from being truly \\"at the table\\" in corporations that could not succeed without their largely unheralded abilities.    Sandberg, whose major career positions have included the U.S. Treasury Department, Google, and currently COO of Facebook, comes by her credentials honestly. By her own admission, she found herself trapped at various decisive points in life (job changes, relationships, pregnancies, self-care crises, aspirations, etc.) by boundaries of tradition where ability and expectations simply didn't harmonize. Instead of raging against those boundaries, she adapted her already-polished management and marketing skills to creatively turn them inside out, changing limitations often through savvy surprise and well-informed optimism.    In fact, for much of her career as a pathfinder and respect-builder for women in corporate leadership, Sandberg has acted by example, often unconsciously inspiring and mentoring women around her, while remaining open to their shared wisdom. When she began accepting invitations to speak about female gains and challenges in the workplace, however, the seeds of LEAN IN were sown and there was no looking back.    Her story of persistence toward change is told in bold chapter headings such as: What Would You Do if You Weren't Afraid?, Sit at the Table (with the men), Success and Likeability, Don't Leave Before You Leave, and The Myth of Doing It All. In just under 200 focused and meticulously researched pages (and don't skip her more than 30 pages of richly detailed source notes, many of them vivid mini-essays in themselves), Sandberg captures every woman's desire to seek and master her own limits, not the ones others set for her.    What makes LEAN IN so much more than an enjoyable, informative and deceptively smooth read are Sandberg's frequent and powerfully credible assertions that in advocating for the true potential of professional women, she is also advocating for their male colleagues. She believes that an inevitable and welcome byproduct of gender balance in the workplace will be greater fulfillment for all, to the point where even the concept of gender as a limitation for anyone completely disappears from the corporate psyche. In fact, she believes the gap can be closed now, giving everyone a strong and level foundation from which we can all \\"lean in\\" and truly achieve what we were meant to be anddo.    My only regret is that LEAN IN didn't happen around 1999, when so many professional women of my generation would have taken it eagerly to heart and set about rescuing careers that had become mired in gender bias and stifling stereotypes. With all it has to say, you'd think LEAN IN would have to be a much longer book, but its greatest asset is that it's an energetic work in progress. Reading it is just the beginning; you can follow Sandberg's active community online through [...], and of course there is also a LEAN IN Facebook page. All in all, this is a must-read for anyone whose life work is more than just a job.    - Pauline Finch
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is one of the most masterful renderings of day to day thoughts, feeling and actions.  Some psychotic, some not.  What a ride!  You MUST read this.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown has concocted a gripping and strongly paced thriller that weaves together The Holy Grail, pagan symbolism, secret Templar societies, biblical studies, the history of the Church, and the work of Leonardo Da Vinci into a melange that, weirdly enough, melds into a very readable and fairly taut story.<br /><br />Following the symbolic code left by a murdered curator of the Louvre Museum, Robert Langdon, Harvard symbologist, must unravel a 2,000 year old mystery that cuts to the heart of the Christian faith, following the clues hidden in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci. Aided by the curator's cryptographer daughter, the trail leads them to the Priory of Sion, a clandestine Templar society that is protecting a deadly secret, now being hunted by another group that will stop at nothing to protect the faith.<br /><br />Although there are mixed reviews regarding the historical accuracy of the information that Brown bases his thriller on, his rich interpretation of symbolism provides the heart of the story and the clues to the mystery are endlessly fascinating. In the end, the book will probably be regarded as sensationalist and trashy by some, and truthful, thought-provoking and challenging by others. For myself, I found it to be a thoroughly agreeable thriller, easy to delve into and hard to put down.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I loved reading this story. It was a well told story that kept me awake all night because I couldn't put it down. Fast paced and suspenseful. Any one interested in military fiction will enjoy this book.
B002BWP49C|5.0|seen all of them and man I couldn't wait for part 2 I knew they couldn't kill Bella off, so it was a cliff hanger that made me want to buy part 2. great movie great books. though I find the books are always better then the movies but they did a fine job with this movie the cg's are wonderful compared to a lot of movies i have seen overall I'd say it's the perfect closing for the book series. as well as part 2 which I am reviewing next.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's is my second time to read these books. To say they are good isn't right. They are captivating,stirring, a reminder of what can happen when we allow ourselves to hate and be evil. But the books should be read by all, so we can all agree to never go there.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were better than the movie and I really like the movie.  I read them in a day per book and almost couldent put it down to go to bed.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|** Originally posted at ReadingDiva's Blog**<br /><br />I have heard so many good and bad things about this book. I know must people look for ways to connect with a book and its characters, but for me I wasn't looking to find  some of my own young experiences reflected at me.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is a well written story that compels you to read it nonstop until the last page. The complexity of its characters and narrative of their lives explores the many ways love changes one's life. Though some people experience love in many different ways Beautiful Disaster manages to explore the feeling in its most natural and sometimes overwhelmingly raw nature.<br /><br />While I find those feelings nicely explored and displayed, the nature of each characters also brings out some of our own experiences when it comes to young love. The need, the new desires and the trust that one put into someone else is at times scary and most times unnatural. I loved Travis and his overwhelming way of loving Abby. It is easy to lose oneself in a world where breathing and loving becomes one and the same, and where the need of having the person you love close to you is at times overwhelming. Abby is a great character, she is funny, smart and mature. Her life experiences forced her to mature before her time. I think the author did an awesome job, these two characters had demons to conquer and wounds to heal. They fought the battler together and trusted that with each other support, love could conquer all.<br /><br />The raw emotions and overwhelming reality for these two characters brought them together and in turn it strengthens their bond. I loved this story, at times silly and funny and other times emotional and raw. I think the characters were perfect and fantastically developed. The way the author exploit their feelings and emotions made the story feel quite real and allowed us to navigate them in a way that most of it could be easily recognized as things we once lived.<br /><br />This young poppy love story brought back emotions and feelings that were at one time overwhelming and altering. It also brought out the undeniably most difficult phrase of all...what if.  Sometimes we don't stop to consider it until certain circumstances are exposed. I can now be considered a big fan of the Beautiful Disaster series because I was not only able to identify with the character but I was able to compare my young years of overwhelming love with the love felt by Travis & Abby. Beautiful Disaster is a fantastic story.<br /><br />Young girls will hope for a loving guy like Travis and women will wonder what if...his young poppy love story brought back emotions and feelings that were at one time overwhelming and altering.

B0087EACJK|5.0|You know, I'm not the biggest fan of stick figure games, but this  is definitely an exception. This game really makes you think about what you have to do next. It implements physics, which was a nice touch, and it keeps me entertained. I would really recommend this for anyone who wants something to keep them busy.
014241543X|5.0|I randomly decided to check this out from my library. I vaguely remembered reading about it somewhere and it seemed like it would be enjoyable. If I Stay is a touching, heatfelt story of a teenage girl who, on a random drive with her family, gets into a terrible accident, wakes up, and finds herself looking down at herself. Is she dead? Is she alive? What's happening?<br /><br />This book is very heavy and you'll shed a few tears along the way. It was short, compared to most books I read, but didn't feel lacking in the least. It's a quick read-I wanted desperately to know what Mia's decision would be.
B001EBYM8A|4.0|This is an action packed film.  I only wish that there wasn't so many swear words.  Otherwise, very good movie.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We love season 1 & 2 and have been able to watch them on NetFlix instant. I guess PBS has sold season 3 exclusively to Amazon and since I'm not a Amazon Prime member, I have to pay to watch it. Thought I'd purchase the dvd and enjoy the season that way.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The book was very thorough and sometimes had to much detail for my liking. But still, it gets four out of five stars from me. Can't wait to read the second book.
0439813786|4.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book-mostly, I'm not going to lie, because of the pictures. Yeah, that's right. There are so many of them, because Brian Selznick is going for a new feel in this book. Sort of a cinematic reading experience. Sounds crazy? Maybe it is, but it sort of works. Seeing pictures of a fight scene helps me picture everything better than simply reading about it, but some chases in books can be particularly descriptive, too. I can just say it was a good experience, the images were wonderful, and I hope to read more books like this in the future. Pictures shouldn't be just for kids!<br /><br />This book was a bit predictable, which disappointed me. I was looking for some conspiracy, some twist, that would shake me up and make me look at the book in a different light. I know not every novel can work out that way, but I don't want to be able to see the end from before the middle of the book. While I kept reading on, that definitely detracted from my enjoyment of the entire thing.<br /><br />This is really a quick read! I read it in a few days, but could have easily done so in a couple of hours. What with the big font, small pieces of writing, and page after page of illustrations, I was literally flipping through the pages to see what would happen next.<br /><br />While I recommend this book, mainly for the unique premise, I wouldn't see to hold your breath while waiting to read it. It's a sweet little story, but not one that knocked my socks off.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved every episode of this PBS series. It's a great drama as well as a bit of a history lesson of that time. Give an inside look into the class differences at that time also.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|I actually saw this on the big screen and rated one of the top five movies I've seen in my life.  The Academy laid another egg by picking Argo over Lincoln for best picture this year.  I actually felt like I was seeing the actual Abe Lincoln on the screen, Daniel Day-Lewis was so believable.  His was truly an amazing performance.  Delighted to add this movie to my collection.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Love jewel games and building the forest is really cool. I also enjoy the games produced and have purchased several games by big fish.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This tedious film is very slow paced and extremely narrow in scope.  It only looks at the abolition of slavery, and then only the parts of the issue revisionist prefer.  It doesn't even depict the assassination of this great man.  Not the Spielberg one would expect.  Pass if you get the chance to see it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am enjoying watching this series. My husband decided it is the British version of Little House on the Prairie. It would be appropriate for my teen age children to watch with me.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|I will keep this short and sweet...<br />Prior to the mid season &#34;break&#34;, the show was phenomenal.  The only &#34;great&#34; episode after the break was the episode titled Clear.  After that, the season dragged on with 3 very slow episodes building up to the season finale, which was a &#34;good&#34; episode but still very disappointing.  The season finale didn't give us any resolution to the conflict between the Governor (Woodberry) and Rick (Prison) and we didn't get a cliff hanger.<br />I love the show, and the beginning of season 3 was awesome but it ended with a thud.<br /><br />-Jason

B00BGIBVP8|3.0|At age 35 with two kids and one on the way my wife and I were expecting more humor. Instead it was replaced with a negative outlook and fowl language. We both felt there could have been a lot more done with this story line.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|If you love film noir this is one of the great ones.  The movie is soaked in nostalgia; characters are vivid, iconic, twisted, alive and sympathetic; the story keeps looping back on itself; it's gritty, gritty, gritty; very violent, steamy, sexy and corrupt.  And ultimately sweet, innocent, ironic and most importantly about redemption.  Always feels authentic.  You can taste the orange juice and smell the burnt toast.<br /><br />Good the first time and improves with repeated viewing.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Love this concert, have seen it on Public Television several times and decided to treat myself to my own copy. By far, the most superior music from any of the other shows, including the now popular movie.  Sorry Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, etc. . . your acting skills are admirable but no one can sing this music as well as Alfie Boe and the performers included in this concert. The only exception of course, the Jonas Brother who attempts to keep up with professional vocalists, , , but sorry, , it just illustrates more clearly the difference between professional singers and pop stars!!  Wonderful DVD, have loaned it to a few friends and just may order myself another copy!!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Perhaps it's just that this is a short story, but it really ended way too soon.  It left me with more questions than answers, and seemed to end rather abruptly.  I had no problem with the ending, just that it came too soon and left too many loose ends in its wake.
B003XDZLTG|5.0|I used to think Crocs shoes (any version of them, I am an equal-opportunity hater) were horrendously ugly. I mean downright hideous. The kind of shoes relegated to nurses or other people who wear them out of practicality (as they are on their feet all day). Then 6pm.com had a sale.<br /><br />I have two pairs of sandals (read: my summer shoes) already. One pair is roughly seven years old, another pair about four. They are leather and worn out. Everyone has a pair of shoes like my sandals, the kind that you have had forever but they are comfortable and easy to put on: the go-to shoe when you need to run to the store for milk or just want to walk the dog. When 6pm.com had this sale, I perused their digital shelves, looking at row after row of Crocs. They had the mega-sized fur-lined version. The flip-flop style (I hate flip-flops, just as an aside). The dainty dressy version. I clicked on a few styles that caught my fancy, but they did not have any in stock in my size (my husband calls me sasquatch; I prefer to think \\"small-shoe impaired\\").<br /><br />The Crocs Shayna Shoes were not my first choice. There were other versions of Crocs that are a bit more attractive. However, as any woman who has larger feet than average will attest to, sometimes you have to buy the shoe that fits but does not necessarily look good. I usually do not like buying shoes online, as shoes are one of those things you should try on and walk around in before purchasing. Crocs, however, are not really designed to be \\"fit\\" per se; they are a generic shoe that is supposed to be comfortable and practical, not something you would wear to the prom.<br /><br />After measuring my feet and selecting the appropriate size from the handy-dandy online sizing chart, I clicked the purchase button and waited for my Crocs to arrive. To their credit, I received them within two days and only paid for standard shipping (nice job 6pm.com; I may have to buy more from you in the future). Opening the box, my love affair with Crocs began.<br /><br />Fit<br /><br />As aforementioned, Crocs aren't really meant to \\"fit\\". They are more meant to just be the correct length; the rest just covers your feet. To this end, the shoes are adequate; they are the perfect length for my gunboat feet without being too long or short.<br /><br />Comfort<br /><br />Okay, I admit. Crocs are like walking on a cushion of air. Ohmigodwtfbbq, I finally \\"get\\" all those people who wear Crocs out of comfort and not fashion. These shoes are squishy, rubber/foam goodness. I wore these shoes for a relatively short time today, walking around the store and driving for ice cream (I had the worst craving for a Dilly Bar from Dairy Queen). During this time, my feet were blissfully happy in the squishy nirvana that are Crocs Mary Jane Clogs.<br /><br />Durability<br /><br />I have had these shoes in my possession for over a few months or so, so I cannot attest to how long they last. Given their rubber/foam construction, I would imagine that they are durable and will survive a goodly amount of time before it is time to donate them to the trash gods. I have, however, been able to test them in extreme weather.<br /><br />As luck would have it, today we had a particularly wicked thunderstorm rip through. As a result, our street became a river of muddy water. Now, we have this dying oak tree in our yard that is prone to drop branches randomly, one time on our car. Since I have become rather paranoid since then, I ran out in the torrential rain and moved the car to the street, figuring rising water is better than high-velocity wood impact. When I alit from my vehicle, I had water coming up to the middle of my calves.<br /><br />The Crocs laughed in the face of the water, squeaking softly as I waded to my driveway. They dried quickly and did not stain or discolor, a definite bonus. I must admit, I was rather happy with this. Tennis shoes would have been wet for hours and developed that lovely musty smell they get whenever they are soaked. My leather sandals would have become more discolored, again being wet for hours. The Crocs were dry and ready-to-go within an hour or so. The only downside was the squeaking noise they made when I walked. It was subtle, though, and not especially bothersome.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />Crocs are definitely the shoe for the summer. They are great in water, comfortable when walking around the mall/stores, wearable while driving, and easily cleaned. They can be customized if you so desire (the craft stores sell kits to gem and otherwise bedazzle your Crocs), and with the Shayna, Crocs are somewhat fashionable. With their squishy softness I would even recommend these shoes for the worker who is on their feet all day; the holes in the design keep your feet cool while the practicality will help your back and knees.<br /><br />The caveat: I have read articles that indicate Crocs, over time, are bad for your feet. Since they do not mould to the shape of your feet, they do not protect the arch of the foot properly. This could result, ironically, in foot and back pain. While I do recommend these shoes, make sure that you wear properly-fitted shoes at other times. If needed, see a podiatrist for a custom orthotic.hey are soaked. My leather sandals would have become more discolored, again being wet for hours. The Crocs were dry and ready-to-go within an hour or so. The only downside was the squeaking noise they made when I walked. It was subtle, though, and not especially bothersome.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />Crocs are definitely the shoe for the summer. They are great in water, comfortable when walking around the mall/stores, wearable while driving, and easily cleaned. They can be customized if you so desire (the craft stores sell kits to gem and otherwise bedazzle your Crocs), and with the Shayna, Crocs are somewhat fashionable. With their squishy softness I would even recommend these shoes for the worker who is on their feet all day; the holes in the design keep your feet cool while the practicality will help your back and knees.<br /><br />The caveat: I have read articles that indicate Crocs, over time, are bad for your feet. Since they do not mould to the shape of your feet, they do not protect the arch of the foot properly. This could result, ironically, in foot and back pain. While I do recommend these shoes, make sure that you wear properly-fitted shoes at other times. If needed, see a podiatrist for a custom orthotic.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Even better than their previous releases (Hard to believe but true). Amy Lee has a voice like none other. Especially liked &#34;Lost in Paradise'. The music and lyrics have an amazing amount of power and talent poured into it that you'll want to play it over and over again. I hope the bandstays together for a long time and  that Lee will continue to share her talent with a long career in songwriting and singing. Loved it.
B000VE439Y|4.0|I hadn't seen this in many years, but love the scene at the end where they sing Always Look on the Bright Side of Life...it is always a good laugh. The picture quality was much better than I remember.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I first started watching on Netflix but they only had the first two seasons. I checked on Amazon and I was able to buy and view on TV the third season...Great show and if you have not tried Amazon's Video service you are missing out...You are able to rent or buy and if you are a Prime member there are lots of free movies...Very convenient,
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this series !! I think anyone would love to watch this once they say down with it!<br />I look forward to the next series!
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|Great app! They really are free! I was sure that there was a catch, but no! I recommend it to anyone with a Kindle.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|their is one issue that needs to stop. see I really like that game but you have to pay for a world<br />and it is the swamp with yoda<br />so it has a few promblems but it is a great game<br />so iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttt rrrrrrrrrrrooooooooocccccckkkkksss
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Excellent rendering of first book of George R. R. Martin's massive series. Good casting, realistic portrayals of medieval-type society, interesting characters (both good and bad) and Tyrion Lannister alone is worth watching this show. And the baby dragons are totally adorable. Excellent, complicated, highly-detailed story for anyone who likes fantasy/magic stories.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|THe show has depth, humor, and a great cast of actors. The show is moving and captivating. Worth watching to those who haven't tried yet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book was an easy read, yet held my interest the whole way through. I had no idea how the book would end. Endings are the most important part of a story and this book had a good ending. I would recommend Gone Girl.
B0040I09RM|4.0|The plot, characters, and overall production are well done.  Having the main characters being outlaws with some moral code is always an interesting prospective but it works for this season.  Definitely worth watching.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Lots of boxes to match and it keeps getting more fun with each level but its hard for me to finish .
B006MW3V6U|5.0|THe show has depth, humor, and a great cast of actors. The show is moving and captivating. Worth watching to those who haven't tried yet.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I'm a 90's kid born in the 80's...this movie now lies among my top 10 all time favorites! PS. get the Directors Cut!
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Enjoyed all the Twilight series but the later movies are really well done; we enjoyed the special features as well.
1881273156|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book! I think it is a must-read! In a practical way, it talks about communicating love in an efficient way! I do recommend it!
B000YEJ6C0|3.0|The Artistic and Realistic combine in raw style. Going in reverse is sometimes odd to watch,as we already know the outcome, the interest lies in how it happened. The spinning camera is a bit over the top. Very intense action. Not for the weak of heart.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I love her music, and get in troublefrom the people upstairs because I play it loud.. Too BAD... I'm Psyched.. THEY&#34;RE MOVING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YAHOO !!!!!!!!!

B0063IH60K|5.0|i like a lot of solitaier games  keeps your mind straight .it is a game not to hard easy played
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is the 4th in the series, and while it's got Manny, Sid, and Diego in it, it has a host of new characters in it. This movie's is as good as it gets.Great for kids too.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Makes charging a snap, literally, and saves wear and tear on the micro usb connector. Get the connector near the charge spot and the magnets draw the cord into place.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|We love GoT and couldn't wait to purchase Season 1 - it was so good we had to have it in our home collection for re-watching!
B001CMSTBM|4.0|Great up and coming band! Saw them in Lawrence Kansas live at the Granada back in March!  They will become better with road life.
B000002AGN|5.0|It's good to hear these tunes again, after all these years.When these tunes first game out this was one of my favorites I'm glad to have it again.
0744014549|5.0|High quality paper, high quality painting. Ordered this after I played through the Tomb Raider Reboot. Surprised to find some earlier monster concepts that didn't find their way to the final game design. The illustrations about mechanism-related graphic designs are very intriguing. I ordered this book primarily to be able to see gorgeous Lara and cultly island whenever I feel like, but end up getting much more out of it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We love the Game of Thrones series (books and movies) and this season is great - can't wait for Season 3!!
B0097BY3K6|5.0|A great CD!  He is magnificent!  His crossover music is a great combination of rock with a hint of classical - good beat and fun to listen to.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game, it's alot better than the first!!! New levels and challenges. It's a great way to pass the time :)
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This movie was so beautiful it made me weep. Every award it won was DESERVED. Bravo to the cast, crew and to Anne Hathaway for her amazing rendition of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\".
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's challenging and fun. I like the music and the sound effects.  It's fun to play for a short time or for a long time.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Was gifted with seasons 1 and 2, so I had no choice but to buy season 3.<br /><br />I just LOVE the tv show Castle ... funny, quirky, great cast all around.  Have loved Nathan Fillion since Buffy days!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great games<br />Ver uhh fun to play intersting active1D veido game kindle is hayley the youtube red bull racing urges and a text message to this
B003L77GG0|5.0|They loved it.  They are huge Smallville fans and had all but the last season on dvds. It was a creative gift for them rather than a gift card or clothes, etc.
B005K17RU0|5.0|loving it. i wish i wouldve found this app a long time ago. loving it. i wish i wouldve found this app a long time ago
030758836X|2.0|I really thought I would love this book after all the glowing reviews.  I'm not sure I can finish it.  I am at 40%, and it is so blindingly boring, I don't want to keep reading.  At this point, there isn't one character that I am invested in, they are all unlikable.  Many people have commented on the ending, but I'm not sure I have the wherewithal to make it to the ending.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Just ordered this for a friends birthday arrived very quickly, In fact now I will end up giving it to her early, because I suck at waiting haha.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban hasn't put out any bad cd's in my opinion, but this and Illuminations are my two personal favorites.
B00122HW92|4.0|I saw them live back in NYC at the Garden in the 70's. They are just as good, if not better on this live 2005 CD. Unfortunately there are very few current bands out there today that have the playing chops that these veteran performers possess. One of the top power trios of all time.....
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This was a great movie i rented it but i am glad i did i wasn't sure if i would like it or not but soon as i watched it i loved it its my new favorite movie i would recommended this to anyone. GREAT MOVIE!!! :D
0071766588|4.0|this guide gives to you the key to pass the test, they are the same people that made the test.
B009329Y30|5.0|I had been wanting to see this movie since it came out but never had the chance to see it in the theater.  We rented it one night and were very happy with it.  It has a great story line and there's a lot of sadness, but it has a good ending.
B004P4S4NM|4.0|She is unique, soulful with great vocal texture. As a songwriter she excels as well. Her band is extemely compilmentary and talented. Taylor who???
B0076HNMU0|3.0|The series wasn't really grabbing my attention.  I might try it again, but for now I don't want to invest an hour for each episode.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie is fun and exciting with an scary element built in.  I would say that this movie should be watched with kids 6 and older.  Nightmares for the younger ones.
B004I744AS|5.0|Good dictionary, nice articles and quote of the day features.  The word definitions are pretty accurate. Thank you.  Wish it linked with the Kindle app to look up words while you are reading.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Overall I liked the movie. Sure it was slow at times but this isn't Die Hard. I will watch it again.
B000000WA4|5.0|By far one of my favorite cd's,so many good songs on here. I love the range of songs it gives.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This is such a great book!<br />It almost seems to give you a imagination at the end<br />Can't wait for the next one!!!!!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case is wonderful.  It looks so nice; the leather feels very smooth & of high quality.  The hard inner shell fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly & I love the horizontal & vertical rotating options.  As far as protecting my device, it seems sturdy enough to get the job done (I have not dropped it since receiving the case).  One thing: this is not a light-weight case (because of the rotating ability).<br />I am very happy with this purchase; I feel the case looks just the way you would expect & does everything it claims.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Bought it for my husband for his Kindle.  Couldn't wait for him to finish it so I could read it too.  Love the character and action.  This will be an author we will read forever!!
0062068415|5.0|What a good book. You feel like you are in the time era he's talking about and right along with them on the island.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Sharpened all the knives in my kitchen and it came back for more. Sharpened 3 pairs of scissors too.  Works great and the price is very reasonable. Seems sturdy enough to hold up to repeated uses.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|My family really enjoys playing this game.  It's a lot of fun & we're always trying to beat each other's high score!  Playing with your food has never been so much fun.<br />The graphics are good & the music choice is perfect for this game.  With 3 modes to choose from, there's a game style for everyone.  Also, trying to unlock the different blades & backgrounds can be challenging at times.<br />However, sometimes right before we start a game it freezes for a few seconds (but has always come out of it... so far) & once, while playing, I touched the screen to swipe the blade & it stuck there.  I couldn't do anything, the blade was in that particular spot whether my finger was or not!  Also, the points &#34;rewards&#34; are coupons.  I was expecting an ad-free version (since it's not the free one), & (to me) the coupons are ads in disguise.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Did not read the whole book, but from the demo it seems to have some good suggestions. I think the full book would be ok.
B00243FQFA|5.0|I love this tv series and was happy to find a nice set of dvds for the fifth season.  And it was delivered very quickly. Thanks again.
0790731002|5.0|Okay, honestly, I am not a girl who is into the superheroes (MARVEL, DC). I like books, haha! Anyways, I did grow up with Batman. Batman back in the day, was the awesomeness. I LOVED how they approached the movies. It was comically fun and cheesy, haha. And who says that's a bad thing? It follows the comics, it's not suppose to make 100% sense, like how the new batman movies are. From all the old batman movies, I really LOVE BATMAN Forever. I think Val Kilmer nailed playing batman, but not necessarily Bruce Wayne. It's an all star cast, and they all did a great job. My favorite was the Riddler (hello jim carrey people!). As for Robin, well, I wished they would have made him more teenagerish (but that would be weirder wouldn't it?). Was he necessary in the movie? I don't know. He doesn't make or break the movie in my opinion. Anyhow, this movie is a win. The colors, the visual aspect of it is fun.<br /><br />This was my childhood, and It shouldn't be locked up in a attic because of the new batman movies.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Great book Archer at his best.  Great plot, great characters and never boring, keep you awake reading all night, enjoy
0399157565|3.0|not done ready it yet. a little slow at the beginning. Not one of her fast pace books. I know she can do better
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Nice to sit down as a family and enjoy a movie.  My daughter saw this movie in school and loved it.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Aw I just about love this movie. When I was younger, I thought this movie was beyond stupid. And I think it's because I didn't understand it. This movie is about LIFE. Forrest is slow in his mind, but he has a big heart. He does many things in his lifetime too. I think he is one the most inspiring characters yet. He shows the human vulnerabilities that we face in life, and triumphs over them with his heart.  I can watch this over and over. Tom hanks did a WONDERFUL job playing as Forrest. I think the greatest thing about this movie, was that Forrest continued to live his life despite his love for Jenny. He loved her with all his heart, but that didn't stop him from 'living'. You know what I mean? Jenny lived a sad life, but Forrest didn't get drowned in it. All the characters in the movie set the stage for Forrest. Lt Dan was my favorite, haha. Even though the movie had a religious tone it in it (not so absorbed in it), it sent a beautiful message nonetheless. And I'm Atheist.
030758836X|3.0|I loved Flynn's clever and witty writing style and the way she alternated the story between Nick and Amy.  The author kept me turning the pages with her ingenious and suspenseful twists in the plot and her brilliant portrayal of a marriage gone wrong.  I couldn't put this book down and was enthralled by Amy's character development and the cruel ends that she went to in order to punish Nick or anyone else in her path.  Amy's diary was fiendishly shocking and clever and I would have easily given this book 5 stars for her writing but the ending was just so awful that I was actually ANGRY and DISAPPOINTED that anyone who can write so well as this author could have screwed up the outcome of this story.  Her ending deserves only 1 star.  While I was reading the book, I felt as if I was being taken on a wild joy ride only to arrive at my destination to find out that the place we were driving to never even existed.  I was loving every page as I went along but was left totally frustrated with the ending.  Flynn planned out the entire amazing story line but dropped the ball by not giving any thought whatsoever to the ending.  It's as if she got so tired and couldn't figure out how to finish the story since the ending was unreasonable and totally unsatisfying.
B009EBLCK8|4.0|Impresssive and Unique. I am from the US and its nice not having the typical US cookie cutter show. Great Show
B0087EACJK|4.0|Is it ironic to start by playing the second game in a series named &quot;continuity&quot; first? I think it is...
1557048630|5.0|For anyone who likes animated films, the &#34;Art of..&#34; books are the best. The concept art is always so fun to look at. I also think it is interesting to see the development of the characters. With the excellent story comes excellent development and the audience can see how the characters and scenery are developed in this book. Beautiful imagery.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This was a great movie in the theater and couldn't wait to own and add it to my collection. It was delivered fast and without damage. Thank you
B00B4W8AIW|5.0|Don't call it a comeback.<br /><br />Other than Metallica, has any metal band ever been under more scrutiny or pressure to deliver landmark albums with every successive release than Killswitch Engage?  Whether it was 'End Of Heartache', the record which had the impossible task of following up 2002's master work 'Alive Or Just Breathing' while simultaniouly introducing the world to the aural assault that was Howard Jones; or `As Daylight Dies' which had to duplicate the breakthrough success of its predecessor; or 2013's `Disarm The Descent' which faces the truly daunting task of both righting the perceived shortcomings of their second eponymous record and herald the return of Mr. Leach, Killswitch Engage, arguably the most successful band in Metalcore, seems to be forever behind the eight ball.<br /><br />Good.<br /><br />'Disarm The Descent' is a record which seems to have been written with the understanding that it would be perceived as the new standard-bearer; the record that would carve in stone the sonic legacy of Metalcore's banner band, or stand as the line of demarcation between the old guard and the shape of pinched harmonics to come.  'Disarm' has answered the call and then some, and Killswitch have offered a record that will suffer incalculable assassination attempts while it delivers track after track of calculated fury;  seemingly unaware of the internet arrows that fall well short of their intended mark.  From the opening, bludgeoning guitar chugs and Justin Foley's thunderous, fully automatic double bass on 'The Hell In Me', to the instantly accessible and dare I say catchy hooks of 'In Due Time' and 'No End In Sight', to the slow, even thoughtful anthem of 'Always' or the positively unforgiving metallic assault of 'Beyond The Flames' and 'Time Will Not Remain', absolutely every moment of 'Disarm' feels like a Killswitch record. The pedigree of this album is above reproach.<br /><br />Credit Adam Dutkiewicz who has resumed his rightful place at the sound board.  Just as Unearth experimented with loudness junkie Terry Date on their muffled 'III: In The Eyes Of Fire' before bringing Adam back in for their relentlessly brutal record 'The March', 'Disarm' finds Adam (AKA The George Martin of metal) comfortably back at the helm of the ship; providing clarity and balance where too often there is simply loudness and chaos.  Nowhere is this more evident than with the rhythm section of D'Antonio and Foley who simply could not provide a better percussive bed to Stroetzel's and Dutkiewicz's high, clean guitars and Leach's furious vocal spitfires.  Each instrument, including Jesse's, has been played and layered with surgical precision, with no one sound ever cancelling out another.  No small feat given Adam's and Jesse's shared and multi-tonal screams, growls and clean vocals that create harmony where one should expect to find contemptuous discord.<br /><br />What many will struggle with while listening to this record is trying to hear the songs with Howard on vocals.  Don't bother.  Howard Jones' vocals are singular and he is truly without peer in metal.  I can offer no higher praise.  Should you approach this record longing for the vocal prism that Howard offered on the three Killswitch records he sang on then nothing I can say here will convince you to give 'disarm' the proverbial fair shake.  However, approaching 'Disarm' as perhaps a spiritual, maybe even a sonic successor to 'Alive Or Just Breathing' can allow those willing to hear Leach and his searing, tortured screams and honest, soul-bearing clean vocals that seem to have been purposefully constructed for this record.  Leach's phenomenal range and nakedly honest delivery on 'The New Awakening' and 'A Tribute To The Fallen' are hallmarks of his style and the songs on 'Disarm' will be welcome additions to the Killswitch canon.<br /><br />So does 'Disarm The Descent' reach the dizzying heights of that dreamed of world we'll call fan's expectations?  That depends greatly on which end of the 'Bands must evolve/Bands must never change' spectrum you find yourself.  With this record, Killswitch Engage have solidified themselves as possibly the most consistent (read: formulaic) Metalcore band in the world.  Perhaps the addition of Leach on vocals will slake the thirst of those who require evolution from \\"their\\" metal bands.  For everyone else, however, 'Disarm The Descent' is an echo of the pillars that came before it and a metal album that will stand on its own as a remarkably engaging, if never shocking, recording from this genre.<br /><br />Guess you`ll just have to wait for that flute solo.ly on which end of the 'Bands must evolve/Bands must never change' spectrum you find yourself.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.  You get to know all of the characters well.  I was kind of sorry to have it end.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. For anyone who likes fantasy/ sci-fi/ romance, this series is for them! Would recommend to people ages 14 and up.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is one of the best comic book to movie adaptations that I have seen and think it was worth the price! It was delivered without damage and promptly.

1452101426|5.0|For anyone who likes animated films, the &#34;Art of..&#34; books are the best. The concept art is always so fun to look at. I also think it is interesting to see the development of the characters. Brave in particular, has very dynamic sketches and beautiful landscapes.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|Suspense, humour, touch of romance, all good enjoyable fun. In today's climate it's great to get pure entertainment from a story line that keeps you wanting more. no sordidness at all. a recommended romp.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Rodriguez is a great artist and part of a fascinating story. I don't think the producers knew what they had, therein lies the problem. Was he Donovan, a Mexican Dylan, the Doors, Barry Maguire or Sonny and Cher?. You can hear all of this in the production. It sounds to me that the producers couldn't wait for Rodriguez to stop singing so they could blast away at you with their synthesizers, bells, whistles, obnoxious noises etc. Apparently, all of this was added after Rodriguez recorded his tracks. The song 'Sugarman' is an inner city scream. The producers tried to make it something spacy and surreal. There are other cuts with the same overkill. The production just may be the reason the record didn't sell. If the producers didn't know what they had, how could the public identify? In person, Rodriguez is a mesmerizing performer and a great artist ahead of his time. Our loss. I think he had much more to say. In spite of the production, buy the cd. Rodriguez is great, too bad the producers didn't know what to do with him.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Was a really great game. I was hooked from the first time I played it. I have it for the kindle fire HD an  it looks great.
B0063GORYU|1.0|It is great for kids, but I don't think it is good for adults.  Will keep trying it and maybe things will get better
B001DHXT20|5.0|I get hooked into series and had to get this to follow the hulks journey to his time prior to the Avengers, and what a story to get told. tough and large onscreen, mellowed by the woman, all good fun.
B00679T1EO|5.0|Contains Christmas special in HD.  Also the format is the same as PBS's Season 1 and 2. Had previously ordered a Season 2 that did not include the Christmas Special.
B007NESCFG|5.0|A great performance by a true talent.  The show must have been awesome in person.  Hope she has another tour.
B009ZQGNPQ|1.0|We love Downton Abbey and strongly recommend the series to one and all.<br /><br />What I don't recommend is that you buy/download the Amazon version.  We missed episode 1 of series 3 on our DVR and decided to download it from Amazon.  The version they showed was notably different from the other shows and it didn't exactly fit in some ways.  Come to learn, after the fact, that the Amazon version of episode 1 is only 1 hour 7 minutes long while the official PBS version is 1 hour 52 minutes.  If you care about Downton Abbey I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere for your media lest you, like us, are forever wondering what happened in the missing 45 minutes.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|Made me privy to the true meaning and possibility of accumulating wealth. For the readers that would like a nice strategy to move ahead of their peers; read this book

B0091REZMW|5.0|I love it and the kids even like it. I give it a A + in my book!  also great time killer!
B008BM9L72|4.0|Tous les jeunes devraient avoir lu cette trilogie. Elle est simplificatrice, parfois vulgaire, certainement à appliquer avec  mesure, prudence et retenue. Mais en attendant qu'un auteur du type de Jane Austen prenne le relais, cela vaut la peine de le lire de bout en bout.
B007HO392S|5.0|My favorite Country artist.  She streamlines both pop and country music with such power and motivation.  Her energy is seen and felt in everything that she does.  She is a multi-talented woman with so much to give and has a very bright future!!
B0030F5W5K|5.0|I have watched this movie multiple times and never get tired of watching it.  Great story and message delivered in this movie.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I read some of the reviews, and I decided to download it. However, I had to delete my Facebook app just to download it to 16%. It won't even download onto my kindle fire. It will get to 16% and then say the download failed. I would rate it a zero if I could. Do not get it for the kindle fire. It won't download unless you have only one or two apps total; it's a memory sucker which is why it won't download.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Used this for a budget build for my wife. After reading reviews from Intel fans, I was concerned that it would not perform well or that the price/performance would be low. However, that is not anywhere near the outcome.<br /><br />On the processing side, it handles everything she does like a champ. She works a lot with Office related programs like Excel, Word, and Outlook, as well as doing everyday task like email and web browsing.<br /><br />On the graphics side, however, I was expecting poor performance, but it performs great. Actually, it is better than my own PC I bought from HP a couple years back for like $1200. I can actually play SWTOR on this thing at the highest settings (bloom and AA off) at 1920x1080 resolution at a constant 30-40 fps. And if she needs more graphics power in the future, all she will have to get is a ATI 6670 for about $70 to get about an 80% performance increase with the dual graphics setup.<br /><br />So overall, I love this processor and would recommend this to anyone looking to build a low-mid powered PC. After getting this processor at such a reasonable price, I think I am going to buy AMD chips from now on.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Classic Kelly.  Love her music.  She has a really strong voice. Best in her field of vocal accomplishment and popularity.<br />Very much worth the buy,
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love, love it. I am sometimes out and miss Revenge on TV every Sunday. Since I Revenge is my favorite show, I am able to watch the episode on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I really like playing this game, when I stressed out, or waiting in a doctors office or just waiting for anyone
0880796863|4.0|I prefer this original version. It is basic and easy to understand without a lot of excessive or confusing illustration content. The only minus is an awful accompanying booklet - it makes little sense in trying to use to gain an understanding of a layout or a particular card, for that matter. Get a good book to explain how to read your cards and spreads.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|I love it! It does everything I need it to do. I had to pay $1.99 but I think it's worth it.
006117758X|5.0|This is an awesome book. My favorite Bukowski by far. Shipping was quick. And the book was in Perfect, like new condition. I don't have anything but good things to say. You have to buy this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game a lot! You should definitely download it! Makes you feel like you are caring for and playing with a real horse.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Not sure how accurate and it runs a little long, but all in all the movie is entertaining. I would say its worth watching.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I found this book to be a great read all the way through. Marcus wrote it in a very selfless sense and gave credit where credit is due.  Explaining what it takes to become a seal and the realities of battle. Great book I would highly recommend!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|These books far exceeded my expectations.  Sometimes I find books that are hyped so much tend to be less than advertised but this series was magnificent.  The characters are well defined, the plot progression was spot on and the psychology behind the character behavior was realistic.  The sex scenes were hot and the entired series resonated with sexual tension.  Excellent read!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is a fun game that keeps you playing for a while. The object of the game is to outrun the gorilla chasing you for telling the idol. The literal twists and turns of this game can be challenging which only make you want to start again. The gems and the new powerups were a wonderful addition to the game. This game makes 5 out of 5 on the apper scale. I would recommend this to anyone I know.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|It was the ideal purchase. Due to my mothers condition, she did not mind us putting it on her, it definitely was less evasive than her hearing aid. We could speak to her softly, and she seemed to respond better right down to her last days. Thank you. The Dacey Family
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Excellent product.  Not good for carpets but it works great for picking up cat litter from hard wood floors.  Wish the batteries would last longer than about a year.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|If you are not familiar with Killswitch Engage...I would have to ask you what rock were you living under. But...if you have never heard them, then you are in for something special. KSE, has it all...great guitar work, double bass drums, screaming and singing vocals and awesome lyrics. This cd is one that will not disappoint.<br /><br />Ok, I know some people are saying....5 stars...really? 4 definitely, but 5? There are a lot of comparisons that lend to this cd. One is the last Killswitch cd. Some people were cool with it, I wasn't. I thought it was straight up garbage. That being said, Killswitch's garbage is still levels above a lot of the trash that other bands try to pass off as their \\"best work\\".<br /><br />I like HoJo as much as the next person, but you could see how everything was getting tired and complacent with Howard. Still a great vocalist, but the fire was no longer there and a change was needed. In steps Jesse...again. I like Jesse, but didn't know how he would fair coming up against Howard's vocals. To tell you the truth, I was a little worried about Jesse. Ah....no more. Jesse has come back with a vengeance. Jesse definitely has a better singing voice than Howard and now, he seems to have greatly developed his screams as well.<br /><br />I was impressed with Jesse's work and I am a HUGE fan of Jesse's lyrics. I am a Christian and I commend Killswitch for having the BALLS to go positive message when all the other SHEEP in this genre are following right along with each other singing about darkness, life ending, drugs and sleazy women. Especially about the women and how they broke their heart and now their life is not worth living. Dude, try to hold on to your manhood and don't crumble because some skank was cheating and left you...good ridance! Ok, off of the soapbox and on to the music. Right off the bat, \\"The Hell in Me\\" kicks you right in the face. I like that there is more double bass drum on this cd. A lot of people are comparing this to Times ofGrace, but I'm not hearing it.<br /><br />One's to truly look out for are The Turning Point, The New Awakening, and No End in Sight. All of the songs are killer, but these stand out a little more for me. As usual, the guitar work is exceptional but there is a new fire and freshness to the guitar playing. The band seems to be clicking on all cylinders...something that has been missing for a little while. Again, I love Howard, but this was a needed change.
