B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Cute and entertaining piano game, good for some casual fun or a quick break. Some of the faster and more challenging songs are extremely hard to play on a phone, though.
0385334206|5.0|A testament to its greatness is that ... well ... it's indescribable.<br /><br />What's the plot? Um ... well ....<br /><br />Who are the characters? Well ... yeah, it's kinda hard to say. Um... the narrator is both a character and the author. Nothing really happens, yet so much goes on. Oh, sections will make you laugh out loud because they're so stupid, except it somehow reaches the core of humanity. I mean, not only physically, but on a metaphysical sense. Even an alternative universe sort of way.<br /><br />Okay, now I'm babbling. But trust me, it's all that and so much more.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved it. It is a tale of injustice in the justice system. Salander is a amazing character. There are many layers to her. Larson was able to make a trilogy using characters who all have a background and are central to the story.  R.I.P. Steig Larson
1250006341|5.0|And full of lovely photos and period illustrations to boot.  This book cover the period thru Season 2, but there are only mild spoilers.<br /><br />Lots of stuff on  \\"service\\" and where in the hierarchy each job fell. And just as much on \\"society\\" such as  how American heiresses became known as \\"buccaneers\\".<br /><br />Beautiful, lovely book, good to look at when you need a quick Downton \\"fix\\".
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book went straight to my heart and I will never forget these life long lessons from these little women.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|Great movie for family night in. My daughter had seen in at the movie theater with her friends and couldn't wait for us to see it with her when it became available on video.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I wish that there was more! Amazon is always a great please to shop.  They make it way to easy to spend money! :-)

B000FC12YQ|4.0|So this was the second Agatha Christie book that I read.  And I read it immediatly following A Poirot Christmas.  As much as I liked this one (probably more than the first), I think that it was a bad idea to read them back-to-back.  Roger Ackroyd was very interesting and engaging, but even with that, I still got a little bored by the end.  Luckily, she redeemed herself with the ending because it was an awesome twist that I didn't see coming, even though I tried really hard to think of all possibilities and reasons.<br />The sister, Caroline, was a very funny supporting character in this novel.  And Poirot seems to never disappoint.<br />So I do highly recommend this book, but I feel like since it was so similar to A Poirot Christmas, that I should have read something else in between.<br />I don't know HOW Christie thinks of such clever twists and turns!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A completely original take on the horrors of WWII.  Such a different narration and narrator.  I couldn't put it down.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book.  I have read other books about dogs (Marley and Me) and \\"by\\" dogs (A Dog's Purpose) and being a dog lover, I really enjoyed them as well!  BUT, I have to say that this is by far my favorite.  It had the sweet yet humorous undertones that would be expected by a novel from the viewpoint of a dog, but also had sentimental depth that I didn't expect in this type of book.<br /><br />The progression of the story keep me completely engaged and took a turn that I never expected.  Being written by \\"Enzo\\" was such an interesting position to take, and it really makes you think what a Good Dog he is!  I laughed quite a bit and cried WAY more than I expected (at multiple places during the book).  The most heart-breaking point in the story was probably not where someone would expect without reading the book, but - without giving any spoilers - was when Denny had to take Enzo to the vet about 2/3 of the way in.  I was sobbing in a doctor's waiting room while reading through this chapter.  I'm certain everyone there thought I was just given grave news, but I was really crying about a fictional dog with a \\"dad\\" in a fictionally bad place in a fictional book.<br /><br />And as much as I enjoyed reading this entire book, the ending was so comforting!  I was sad it was over, but so happy for the way it ended.  I highly recommend reading this!  I think that even if you aren't an avid dog-lover like me, that you'd still be incredibly attached to this novel.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I had a misspelling in here.. is that why I got a \\"not helpful\\" judgment?? =(  Oh well, I fixed it and hope others find it more \\"helpful\\" =)
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Savages is an excellent film that shows the highlights and struggles of three friends connected to a world most fear. Two best friends, who's relationship is easily questionable, combine science with the best marijuana in the world. The women they share is kidnapped and they use wit and skill to save her. Blake Lively's acting is weak. If you ever watched Gossip Girl, she is pretty much playing Serena in this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like it because it is different than what I am use to. I would recommend this to my friends.
B00AE2J93I|2.0|Unfortunately, I tried to watch this twice and fell asleep both times. I have to say, the trailer made this movie look much more appealing.

B002ZG9774|5.0|If you have not seen this before what are you waiting for?  Aguilare can truly sing - I am now looking for other music she has done as I liked this so much.  The storey has a nice twist, is fun to watch and one that we have seen more than once.  I finally realized if it was on TV we would watch it - and now we can do that whenver we wish.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think it is made for younger kids but if you are a kid how loves horses than this a game for.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book shows how youth join forces to adapt to their life threatening diseases by giving support to each other while extending their concerns for their families. They understand each other's call for help in time of need. Centered around three friends with cancer and how through fiction tier t<br />Interest lead them on a last Wish REQUEST travel abroad to ask the author how the story ends.<br />  I found the book slow in the beginning. As I read further int<br />I realized that the lives of their parents are filled with regrets and try to hide their true feelings for fear that the child will feel that they are giving up.<br /><br />  Wills live regret for the<br /> as normal realizing that their love one

B0092MKFIY|5.0|My son and I went to an Awolnation concert and Imagine Dragons opened up for them.  I wasn't very familiar with them.  Really had only heard one song of theirs.  I was blown away by them in concert.  They stole the show! Incredible drumming and the stage presence of the lead singer, Dan Reynolds was so refreshing.  He was very humble, which was the opposite of Aaron Bruno of Awolnation...TRUST ME! Still love him though!  He sang very soulfully and you felt the energy.  And it sounded BETTER than the album.  I HIGHLY recommend anyone who has a chance to see them live and likes this genre of music to GO!  But get tickets fast.  They are the new big thing and are selling out everywhere.  By the way, anyone who posts comments about music that \\"isn't their kind of music\\" should be ignored.  Seriously, why would you write a REVIEW if you aren't \\"into that sort of music.\\"  Geesh.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|The product came in perfect conditions and in a secure way. The delivery was fast and very good, by the way. Recommend it for all people who wants to buy in Amazon because the treatment with the product and the costumer is awesome.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|My daughter is a really big Miley Cyrus fan. So I got this for her for Christmas and she has watched it again and again. Worth what I paid that's for sure.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|If ONLY I could give it 6 Stars;I WOULD! I WAS a Sniper in Vietnam. As I watches the Movie with my wife; I was making comments on what was in the movie. Each time,the wife would open her mouth to tell me to close mine so she could watch the movie. Before she could say a word,what followed in the movie would prove me to be right...So she just stopped trying,and learned to listen to me AND the movie.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|Well written and VERY SCARY! I watched this movie at night and it was awesome. Kept me looking over my shoulder the whole time. Good plot and very unique too! Has an ending you won't expect!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It's an age old story and very predictable.  I notice it will be on TV for Valentine's Day.  I will probably watch it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love, love, love this!  Quality all the way!  Can't wait for the rest of Season 3 and hope they continue!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful story with a surprise ending.  I wasn't sure of the author's eloquence to begin with but the story unfolded nicely and I got used to her writing style.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Great idea, great plot, well written, tautly paced, then as the revelations begin, the story loses its way. Credibility is blown, and the ironic outcome doesn't seem to fit the rest of the book. Having said that, I mostly liked it and will try another of Gillian Flynn's novels. I'd also add the caveat that of my own books, three are mysteries with thriller elements, and Gone Girl is better than at least two of them!
1609611543|5.0|Everyone who indulges in toast or a bagel for breakfast should read this book.  What a way to start the day.  You are doomed right from the first bite.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Seriously? NYT best seller? WHY? The writing wasn't horrible (some of it I found very good actually) but the story was! Just like the other readers who hoped for an ending that justified the good reviews I was completely ticked off that the story just stopped. No clever wrap up, not even a poorly written wrap up, the thing just stopped in the middle of this ridiculous story. This plot had so much potential and she delivered one good twist in the tale that had me thinking it might turn out to be a good book after all, but then it gets absurd, gets more absurd and then stops right there. I can see why she got stuck while writing it but she should have persevered, left it on the shelf until she came up with a way to end it properly. I am so disappointed and wish I had never bothered. I am certainly no literature snob and can usually find something redeeming about even the most mediocre of books, but this one....It was a waste of time and money and I am seriously bewildered by all the good reviews.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Apparently the CD is taken directly from the movie so the music and soloists leave much to be desired.  I had seen the movie and enjoyed it very much.  However, the CD lacks quality and I wouldn't recommend it.
B005LAII1C|5.0|You can't like family guy and not love this movie. Nothing like watching Giovanni Ribisi dancing to Tiffany. Too funny.
B0000020C4|5.0|I wanted to save a little money so I ordered the soundtrack from the movie Les Miserables.  I was disappointed in it because it was difficult to make out the words in some of the songs.  However, this CD is fantastic!  The words are clear and the music is superb.  This is definitely the CD to purchase if you are a fan of the play or the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My friend has this app and then I searched for it and I couldn't stop playing!<br />I give it 5 stars.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This isn't SALEM'S LOT or one of King's other masterpieces, but I found 11/22/63 to be an excellent addition to his catalog of page-turners, and superior to work such as CELL. Recommended for anyone who has read five or more of King's previous books (i.e., fans).
B0076DELIG|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book that I read it in a day! The end was very shocking and sad as it pertains to the military. Great read and I hope Connelly continues to write about Harry!

B00280LYHS|5.0|Ok so I just finished and I loved it. The best part was at the end when................. read it yourself.
B00A25NLOU|5.0|Reading this made me remember that night years ago when I first opened William Gibson's \\"Neuromancer\\" and couldn't go to sleep until it was finished.Like Gibson's recent work it's not really sci fi but visionary tech (vis-tec?) Propulsive yarn spinning. There's a touch of Da Vinci code but not so preposterous. It's a book about books and it's the first one I've read on the Kindle. That's a threshold we're all passing and the book references it well. Festiva lente...the Singularity awaits
1442359315|5.0|I greatly recommend this book for all, but especially for people facing loss in any form ( self-image, loved ones, job, etc)<br />When Dr. Alexander spoke in the Oprah show, I saw the child like curiosity in him when he shared his experience It is a blessing to humanity that we have such people among us to share their personal stories and be healed through them.
0312360258|4.0|The House of Night series has been on my TBR list for a long time! The series was actually banned in 2009 for \\"sexual content and nudity.\\" Interestingly, the series hadn't even been completed at that point so it is quite ridiculous for all future novels in the series to be banned when they have no idea whether there is any objectionable content! By contrast, this book won the 2007 Romantic Times (RT) Reviewers' Choice Award for Young Adult.<br /><br />The story takes place in an alternate universe where vampyres (that is how it is spelled in the book) share the world with humans although they live separately (at least they do in this novel).<br /><br />In certain people, a physiological reaction takes place that triggers a part of their DNA that will eventually result in the person becoming a vampyre. It is thought that this takes place during adolescence, due to the increase in hormones during puberty. Such an individual will be destined to become \\"marked.\\" A certain type of vampyre called a Tracker will place a crescent moon mark on the forehead of a person who has been chosen to become a vampyre. The mark is like a tattoo, but it is an outline only. Once a person receives that mark, they say good-bye to their old life and move to the House of Night which is a private boarding school in Tulsa's Midtown where they will live for the next four years learning all about the history of vampyres and what they can expect in the future. A marked person, or fledgling, has a very limited amount of time to come to the House of Night. They feel as though they are dying, which is true because their body is changing. Not everyone will survive the Change to become a full-fledged vampyre. The mark on the forehead becomes filled in once the Change is complete. Someone who has had special gifts bestowed upon them by Nyx, the Vampyre Goddess that they worship, is destined to become a High Priestess. Those chosen ones will also develop additional embellishments upon their body to set them apart from regular vamps. In Greek mythology, Nyx is the Goddess of the Night.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is a 16 year-old teenager from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma who feels as though she doesn't belong. Her dad left when she was just two years old, and her mom remarried when she was 13 years old. Zoey's new step-father, John, is a bit of a religious fanatic. He feels that Zoey is a problem child and, since they married, Zoey feels that her mother isn't really on her side anymore. Zoey feels that if her mom and John only knew what her siblings were up to that they wouldn't think she was the black sheep. She refuses to hide who she is and, for that reason, she gets into trouble. When Zoey becomes marked, she turns to her Grandmother Redbird who is the only one she feels will understand. Her grandmother is a Cherokee, and she has taught Zoey some of the old ways. While trying to find her grandmother in the lavender fields around her home, Zoey falls and hits her head and has a spiritual experience where she meets Nyx who tells her that she is something special because of her mix of Cherokee ancestry and vampyre destiny. She kisses the mark upon Zoey's forehead and, when Zoey awakens, she finds out that her grandmother has brought her to the House of Night. Her mentor is a High Priestess named Neferet. Zoey stands out as different than other fledglings because her mark has filled in ever since her spiritual meeting with Nyx. She instinctively knows that she is not to reveal to anyone what has occurred.<br /><br />Right off the hop, Zoey gets off on the wrong foot with Aphrodite, who is the \\"Queen Bee\\" of the fledglings. She runs a special clique called the Dark Daughters, and she thinks she is destined to become a High Priestess. Aphrodite tries to bully Zoey around, but Zoey stands up to her which earns her the respect of her small circle of peers. Aphrodite is jealous of all the attention that Zoey is receiving because of her mark and what she believes is preferentialtreatment from Neferet.<br /><br />I really like the alternate world that the Casts have created. Just as wizards must go to Hogwarts to receive training, the vamps must go to the House of Night. I like that Zoey is a strong-willed girl who doesn't let anyone push her around. Even when she is afraid, she demonstrates a lot of courage. The clash between Aphrodite and Zoey is typical high-school behaviour, along with the bullying and cliques. I felt as though I was right back in high school! However, because of the sexual situations in the book, I would recommend this for the upper end of the Young Adult range. Zoey's lack of parental support really saddened me, and I felt sorry for her. It was nice to see Zoey's strong bond with her grandmother, which is absent for so many kids nowadays, and I hope that we will see more of Grandma Redbird!<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more of the series! I am hoping that the maturity level of the characters will develop as they get older.treatment from Neferet.<br /><br />I really like the alternate world that the Casts have created.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|I didn't have high hopes for this series.  I was proven quickly wrong.  It is not your normal formula drama.  I highly recommend it.
B009MF5BXK|1.0|This  movie  is  a  joke.  It's  all  over  the  place  and  all  the  action  comes  in  the  last<br />ten  minutes  and  it's  really,  really  bad.  So  don't  buy  it.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|The Silver Linings Playbook was well-written and covered mental illness from the patient's perspective quite well. Quick manages to write from the first-person perspective of the mentally ill main character, Pat Peoples, perfectly. It's what makes the book both sad and filled with hope. I liked it and would recommend it to others. A fast read.
B004APVI1G|5.0|The real 3D version is better than the Blu-Ray verison 2D converted to 3D by the player/TV pair. The 2D to 3D version leads to an eye fatigue but the real 3D Blu-Ray version does not. It is pleasant to watch. Played it through a Panasonic DMP-BDT220 3D Blu-Ray player and Panasonic TC-P65ST30 3D capable TV with Panasonic TY-EW3D3MU 3D Active Shutter Eyewear for Panasonic 3D HDTVs (Medium) (2011 Model) glasses.<br /><br />I am assuming that you already know the story because many people already owned it on DVD and are now looking into the 3D version.
030758836X|5.0|I had pretty much written this one of as a \\"Chick Thriller\\" when it first came out.  When it was nominated for the Best Novel Edgar a few weeks ago I thought I'd give it another look, though.  I then found several reviews that clearly stated that this was not Chick Lit, so why not? I'm pretty darn glad I did.<br /><br />To attempt to review this book without spoilers is pretty tough considering it's all the twists and turns that make it so good.  To avoid giving away too much, I'm going to try to use my feelings and thoughts about the book as I went along rather than discuss specific plot points.<br /><br />Within a few chapters I was impressed with author Gillian Flynn's writing.  The author uses both the husband's and wive's POV in alternating chapters.  She is very successful in giving each character their own voice.  There is never any confusion between Nick or Amy's chapters, each feeling as though different people did write them.  She is able to distinguish each not only through writing style, but through the differences of male and female psychology.<br /><br />All is good for a while and the reader is thrown a revelation here and there, but nothing too shocking.  Just under halfway through the book, though, it really started to lose me.  I felt like I was reading an adaptation of a bad, cliched Lifetime movie.  This was \\"Chick Lit\\" and I've been robbed!  I was ready to toss it aside like so many other reviewers and commenters here have.<br /><br />About 20 pages after my breaking point I couldn't put it down.  Just like so many characters in the book, I had been fooled... rocked to sleep with a bedtime story, never that there was a monster under the bed.  In 20 or 30 pages so many seemingly unimportant threads and clues from the first half come slamming together so quickly that I felt like I had to stop to catch my breath.  From here on out the pace of the book never relents.  Flynn never lets you forget how you were just as easily duped as the sheep following the tabloid headlines.<br /><br />By the end I was exhausted both physically and mentally.  Not only did it keep me up half the night, it threw one curveball after another at my brain.  This one is a great read for anyone that like a good page-turner, psychological dramas, or even old fashioned noir.  You're doing yourself a disservice is you pass this one by because you think it's a chick book or if you bail on it early because it gets a little tedious - it's supposed to!
B007WFR1TE|5.0|It's a good album. The vocal is not as a heavy as I've expected, but it is good for a variety in my collection. And, to my surprise, the content/text of the songs is good too, not just plain or stupid as I expected. There is also their own original melody which is pleasant to listen to.
B009JBZH54|5.0|My favorite trilogy for a really good price... I bought another one as a Christmas gift. It shipped quickly, which is always a plus.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|I prefer listening to the music by albums. For Gojira I own almost all of their albums and I love all of them. To me it's like art appreciation. I don't just each song or passage separately and try to perceive Gojira's albums as creative testaments rather than products for consumption or dismembering.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|its hard to read the first book as it makes you feel very uncomfortable. but this last book is by far the best out of the three. action and not as many uncomfortable moments
B00574P9EQ|5.0|So accurately portrays the challenges of MS in a funny way - while bringing home the bigger moral truth that family is important.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|this book was much better then the first enough sexy content to be good but not so much it made u uncomfortable like the first. definitly answers questions you had with the first book. once you get through this fifty shades a darker the last book is the best
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I love that I can see everything at one time,including wind and 5 day forecast. Also weather by the hour is kinda cool.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|it was awesome that it was free and awesome how it is with the online books. i just wish it had better readability during dimmer times like the paperwhite does. but this kindle app is definitly a cut above. love it
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read this book alone. When I started to speak my husband's love language, he automatically started to speak mine without even knowing it. I never informed him of my little experiment but he noticed a change. A week in he asked me if something has changed and said that he's just felt so great lately \\"for some reason\\" ;) I love this book.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|i love this app. has a great assortment of sounds ( i have read that the buy it version isnt worth the extra sounds fyi). the only down fall is that if i dont set the sound to turn off after a time period that my alarms wont go off to wake me up for work.
B008RTE09S|5.0|Remember watching the movie on TV late 1970's and always wanted it on DVD, so now i have it . thanks
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|No freezing or download issues and finally a decent story line! Puzzles and hog were great. If you like the slightly darker games then this is for u. IF you are like my poor mother (who played this accidentally on my kindle fire) and  scare easily please keep away. :-) My only complaint is that it is advertised for free and isn't, I would rather just pay to begin with.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|my game froze the screen is the solid red backround i choose to play on. i tried refreshing also going back in n out . if anyone has a suggestion please write me. thank you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game fun and very easy to play. I will just pick it up when I am bored. it really is fun. my favorite part is the competitions.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I'm partial to crime-thrillers, and as a former prosecutor myself and a parent, I also was drawn to the story and conflict the main character felt.  A gripping story and fast-paced, I enjoyed the realistic courtroom &#34;drama&#34; and account of the trial strategies, etc.<br /><br />I recommend it!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I really like the idea of this game. Helps me destress when life gets to me. The price is pretty decent too. Keep up the good work.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Muddy Watters & the Rolling Stones. How can you go wrong with this one. It is my favorite of all time. LOVE IT!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|There are really no words that can give justice to the artistry that these guys bring to music lovers off all ages!  If you do not own this album, you better get it now!
0525953728|5.0|This book was written at a level for readers of all experience level and easy to understand for both military and civilian alike.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I really liked this app at the beginning, but now I only get the clock and no weather.  I even tried uninstalling and installing again.  Hmmmmmmm....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just got this game on my kindle fire the other day and so far I have to say I love it. It has great graphics and the activities are fun to play. I wish it was easier to get gems but other than that I would recommend this game to a friend.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have only had this thing for about a week and charged it up just once so far but, it fully charged my iPod nano, twice, my portable speakers which run for 8 hours or so and topped off my galaxy 3S from 70% and it still has 3 of the 4 recharge lights lit, when i finally exhaust its supply i will re-post. after using this charger for a few months, i must admit it is freakin' Awesome! I finally exhausted the battery life from the first charge after recharging my phone and ipod several times as well as a re-chargable blue-tooth speaker. If you don't have one you need one , instant re-charges for your gadgets anytime, anywhere. Probably the best 40 bucks i spent in December.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|a very good game.  I wish it was a little longer.  I had a great time playing it.  I am going to see if. I can find other G5 games to<br />' play.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|One of the best love/comedy movies I've seem.  I watched it twice to catch what I missed !  Great movie !
0521673763|5.0|Stahl does a fantastic job of outlining the actions of psychiatric medications.  He also provides (rather cowboyish) tips on prescribing and off label usage.  I would say he is the very model of a modern pharmacologist.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Definitely will order from this seller again.  Shipped quickly and as described on website.  Did not need to contact the seller.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|need to find a work in a hurry this is the appt for you you'll never spell a work wrong again
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Definitely a seller that I would buy from again.  Did not have to contact seller and everything was sent on time and as described.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|The songs are amazing. And I loved that I could download it and get it instantly. Wonderful purchase. I would recommend it highly!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|yeah; its not free you only get go play like a demo type. just be perpared to buy its worth it. I was entertained for a day!
B003QP4BJM|4.0|An interesting hypothesis about how science, technology, politics, religion, anthropology, and environmental factors have shaped the technological evolution of humanity. You don't need to be well versed in any of the factors listed above to appreciate the book.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|very addictive, love the writing!, wish this did not have a last season, i would highly recommend this to adults
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its the best game ever I love horses now I get to play with them at my house on my Kindle. Pretty fun actually not that bad. I liked it and rated it Not a bad game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it's the best-selling game worldwide but there should be wolves endermen and villages. Everyone should get this app
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I have read Harlequin since I was a teenager. While they are usually predictable, this one had a different story to tell.<br /><br />I would like to read more of this uthor
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game passes time easily and enjoyably. This game helps a person with a horse after one no longer can enjoy the activities as before in real life.
B0047SF41G|1.0|adrien brody has slumped to an all time low.  topher grace is terrible again.  the only reason I give it one star is because predator movies are classics.  why they are making these new ones idk.  dont waste your time.
1423136802|5.0|My son loves this set !! And the book was sent very fast. Great experience to shop here! I&#34;ll recommend to my friends.
B006LS7DQE|1.0|Great game, but bad transfer to kindle fire.  As others posted, I had to remove most other apps to load this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This Book is amazing beyond words it is impossibly amazing and it deserves 100,000 stars. It is my favorite book in the whole wide world(besides the amazing Harry potter series which is equally as EXTRAORDINARY) and I've read a lot of books for a ten year old and none other are as brilliantly crafted as this book. Believe me because I THIS book wasn't as  terrifically well plotted masterpiece than I would have stopped here but no, this amazingly detailed convincing book deserves more than the limit of twenty words and I would not advise this book for children cause it has some killing and violence and sadness but never mind that it makes it believable and a AWESOME book and words do not justify this honorable book.<br /><br />I very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very strongly recommend this book and Its series and you haven't lived till you read it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Buy this.  Watch it.  Fall in love.  Remember that love is a two-sided coin-- you'll be so glad you did it, but you'll be miserable that it's over.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The album, the whole album, and nothing but the album is what I've been listening to in the car. I haven't bought an entire album in years, but after listening to several of their youtube videos, I knew I needed the whole thing. Every song is fantastically arranged and performed. My kids will even turn it on without me - their favorites are Cello Wars and Peponi.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game. It has excellent graphics.There are so many activities to do. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|One of the most interesting and well executed shows I have seen in years. Can't wait for season two to be available on Amazon
1407130366|5.0|I was amazed at the price of these 3 books.  Even at Walmart they were $36.97.<br />These were not only about $13.00, but brand new
B003BWERF8|5.0|Not much to say - very small, works with various iPods and easily links to BT devices - earphones and speakers. So small you have to watch you don't lose it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm half way done in two sittings. Great book. Keeps you reading and wanting more. Def recommend this for anyone
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Love the cable length, sound quality and ease of use. It fast became my favourite extension mic for my iPhone and iPad!
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|Best Bourne movie yet! Really well done, it kept me riveted the entire time, really fun to see the way he solves problems as they come, I didn't want it to end!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|super price! great condition! I will be ordering again in the future no dought! It even came before cristmas! love it!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Getting to know Jack Reacher. Action, imagination and mystery.  Great read. Looking forward to the next book in the sequel!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It came before christmas even tho I ordered it late. Great condition! My kids were thrilled as am I. will be ordering again in the furture.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|When mounting to my kinect, the image displayed on screen in the test mode is so distorted and the corners are cut off to where it resulted in even less usable area than before. This product was a great idea and a needed enhancement for people with small living rooms, but was unusable in my experience. The product was properly attached to the kinect and was tried numerous times, always yielding the same, unwanted result.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|The best book I ever read this book is so great I give it five stars I recommend this book to any halo fan
B00632HWOG|2.0|I liked the old one better.  when you have 2 different accounts (emails) and you try to switch between the2 it wont let you.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|great app has white noise to help ya fall asleep, and perfect alarm! upgrade to get music to help you fall asleep and wake ya up :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great for everyone kids and adults will enjoy playing its time consuming but really fun!!!! you have to get it and try it for yourself
B00275EHJG|5.0|My 3 year old can't get enough of this movie.  She at least watches it 2-3 times a day since we received it in the mail it not more.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I bought this to use as a baby monitor on my kindle fire HD with my foscam 8910W cameras. The app has a camera scanner so it can get most of the details for set up on its own. Once I figured out the difficult part of port forwarding using a YouTube video or two, I'm now able to view my cameras from anywhere and I bought the app for my Android phone.<br /><br />Best features: control camera movement, movement and sound alarms, and viewing more than one camera at a time.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I am Ozzy is a fun read and I recommend it highly even for those people who aren't Ozzy fans. It is an absolute page turner and in places I found myself laughing out loud. This book doesn't get bogged down in every detail of John's aka  (Ozzy's) life, but it sure is entertaining! The stories he tells are so messed up, they couldn't possibly be fiction. Nobody could come up with this stuff, these events must have happened. Buy this book, read it, and enjoy!
1439153663|1.0|I am perplexed as to why anyone would enjoy this book.  Rape, incest, adultery, child molestation, physical abuse, murder, children dying, drug addiction.  It is one thing for a book to contain one or two of these occurrences - but to have all of them (and often within 1-2 pages of one another) is disturbing. The Kitchen House is abundant in human suffering but skimpy on historical validity and true good writing. After a rollercoaster ride of horror, the book has an abrupt and cheesy ending. When reading this book, I was either shifting uncomfortably in my seat or rolling my eyes.
B00122MWBK|4.0|We have really enjoyed this album of all the well known Goo Goo Doll songs.  There were just a couple that we didn't know and skip over when we listen to it since we don't like them as much but overall a great CD for the price we paid.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This was a poorly written and played horror flick.  It absolutely sucked.  I rate it below the B movies.  I would not suggest this movie to anyone.
B008Y589VU|5.0|The best movie ever, an eye opener!<br />Rachel is awesome.  Her best role. I can't believe it was only released in a handful of theaters in USA.<br />Highly recommend it.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I was channel surfing and saw it on. I told my nephew to watch it and he had to have a copy.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I am a huge believer in the Secret and have tried to live by the power of positivity. I was at one of my darkest hours and discovered The Magic. After finishing the 28 day routine I found myself receiving things I had wanted for a very long time. It really works! I love it!
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Totally misrepresented. A waste of phone space.i deleted it as soon as it downloaded and I saw what it was
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I enjoyed the first couple of shows and as I continued to watch I have now become a huge fan. I find the show to have lots of action, great stunts and a great story.  I can't wait to find out more of what happened to Olivia Queen on the Island. I would highly recommend renting this series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A friend told me about the book and It is one of the best love stories I have ever read!!I could read all three books again. IT IS A UNCONDITIONAL LOVE STORY!!!
B00A2BTCTC|4.0|I really didn't buy this for the comic, and found it cheesy.  I did like the narrative, however.  I thought the remix sounded great, especially in my car.  But for a remix, and at this price point, couldn't they have at least coded song titles onto the CD so they display on my car's display screen?
B006964E8S|5.0|Up to his usual standard. Keeps the reader interested to the end. I would really recommend it to Baldacci fans.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a good game and my kids love it. I just wish there were more things I could do with the horses
B000OCXMAE|3.0|It definitely is NOT the Linkin Park of Hybrid Theory, but it is the Linkin Park as we know it!!  They have gone a little softer with this album on some songs, but I still recommend it if you're a Linkin Park fan!!
B009OWGMYI|5.0|There's always room for another HIM compilation in my collection. It was especially exciting since it brought HIM back from the two year hiatus. Even though there's only one song new for HIM, hopefully it's brought the band back into the overall public eye and not just that of their super loyal fan base. I'm hoping for new material soon, but this is good for waiting for Tears on Tape.
B004J64QSI|3.0|I have seen and heard better but the ending was amazing when they had the original cast come out and sing. I liked it
B0027MJU00|5.0|Fabulous! Couldn't put it down. Took a chance on it after reading \\"Gone Girl\\" and being a bit disappointed with the end. Glad I did. The movement of perspective kept it moving at a great pace. I would recommend it, but caution that it gets VERY disturbing at some points. It was tough to get through some of the more gruesome parts, but I'm glad I stuck with it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. I am not one that likes to read these type of books, but E L James is a very talented writer. She had me hooked with the story line. I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to more of her books.
B00B2327AA|1.0|I BOUGHT THE ENTIRE SEASON OF THIS SHOW, WHY DID I HAVE TO BUY THE LAST TWO EPISODES IN ORDER TO SEE THEM?????<br />THIS SHOW IS NOT ONE YOU CAN WALK AWAY FROM,AND AMAZON HAS DONE THIS WITH AT LEAST ONE OTHER ONGOING SEASON AS WELL.<br />SO I HAVE TO BUY THE LAST TWO EPISODES OF THAT SHOW SEPARATELY AS WELL! I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.<br /> GOOGLE PLAY HONORS ITS CONTRACTS!!!!
B0097HSS4M|4.0|When I bought this app, I thought it wasn't gonna work. But it works! It's a very fun app if your looking to add Texts, get rid of Red eye, and its not only fun to play with, but it can touch up photos also. Very nice app.<br /><br />  Thank you for reading, and God bless :)
B0059XTU1S|4.0|As a fan of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, I enjoyed another great production.  The scenery, music and all the visual effects were as great as I expected them to be. A little slow in places but overall entertaining.  Looking forward to the \\"rest of the story\\".
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I read this book for a book report and acually really liked it and read it at least like 7 more times before reading something else.
B000T433CO|5.0|This is always one of my favorite movies during the Holidays. A complete chick flick, disguised as a Christmas movie. Love the characters and the relationships they build. Iris and the old man are so sweet together. Jack Black plays a surprisingly normal and affectionate composer, and Jude Law plays the dysfunctional heart-throb of an older brother. I enjoy Cameron Diaz in this movie, although her character is solidly neurotic. Finding an escape from everyday life during the holidays turned out to be a good plan for both Diaz and Winslet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game and it helps me get over the loss of my horse Dakota. it aldo allows my  younger siblings to see the responsability of havening a pet horse before the grt one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this game,It's really life like. I feel it's better then horse life adventures. But if you do like that game you will probably like this one.
B004A8ZWWY|1.0|Haven't even watched the movie...I purchased it to watch on a trip and anxiously opened it to download the digital copy to my iPad.  Sadly, the code for the iTunes Digital Copy expired in July of 2012 - clearly stated on the inside of the jewel case.  How Amazon can sell something with an advertised Digital Copy is beyond me.  Do not buy if you want the iTunes Digital Copy.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I rented this so much that I had to buy it!! It's like being there in person at the Royal Albert Hall! I love it!
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|It started out nice but when it drifted off from Ted to make the couple the primary focus I lost interest in the movie.
B00A19FMRQ|5.0|I really enjoyed Waris' story, it reads like a novel!  I couldn't put the book down, I had to keep reading, had to know what happened next in this brave girl's life.  What an amazing person she is after all that she has been through - such a strong and independent woman.  Waris' recollection of her life in the desert was especially interesting, though at times shocking and sad.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|It's Rod Stewart, what's not to love?  So glad he did a Christmas album - finally! I really enjoyed listening to it.
B00687Q0VC|4.0|Only one episode was received in HD. Rest were of lesser quality.  Series title score and history of Adams was fantastic.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The undercurrent of this story is so realistic. I haven't stopped thinking about the complexities of situations portrayed in Hopeless around love and sexual abuse. I read a lot and it's been a long time since I've carried a story in my heart after &#34;The End&#34;.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My husband read the Hunger Games series and LOVED all of the books.  He read the entire series within 2 weeks.
B005NQ94LM|4.0|Much has been said about Anne Hathaway's accent or lack of it.  Just ignore it and enjoy the story.  Anne and Jim Sturgess are perfectly cast as our two protagonists.  But it is Jim Sturgess who brings just the right depth of emotionality to the role of Dexter that we, the viewer still like and root for him even when he is at his worst.  Sturgess shows us how Dexter hides his feelings for Emma both from her and himself but doesn't do it in an obvious way. Anne is the ideal Emma; she hides her disappointments with Dexter and doesn't play her as the poor helpless heroine.  Throughout the film Sturgess gives us small glimpses into why he and Emma still have an unbreakable bond. As the film progresses we see that Emma is Dexter's anchor and we wonder why Dexter doesn't see it.<br />One of the major drawbacks of the film is that Nicholls wrote the screenplay from his own novel.  Nicholls tries to crowd as many years as possible within the time allotted to the film. One could focus on the technical aspects such as the pace of directing, the costumes, etc but ultimately it comes back to the script. The writer has to decide which elements of the novel to emphasize and which elements to chuck out.  Some years could have been either eliminated or condensed and some years should have been expanded. Unfortunately the viewer gets tired of seeing the calendar turn over. When Emma and Dexter meet in Paris there is not enough of the interaction between the two of them which explains why Emma makes the decision she does. The film has to be viewed as Dexter's story as he is the one who undergoes more changes in his character.  Although both characters have their highs and lows it is Dexter who falls the farthest but Emma rescues him. The film ends in the same way as the novel and in some ways it's a little ambiguous.<br />The rest of the cast is superb, especially Romola Garai who doesn't reduce Sylvie to a caricature of a humourless human being.  Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's motheris ideal. Although we would like to have had seen more of Clarkson and Ken Stott as Dexter's parents, but they don't appear too often in the novel.<br />One Day is not the traditional romance or romantic comedy; and the film should be enjoyed on its own terms. It succeeds on the level for which it was written.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  Nicholas Sparks has a way of bringing his characters to life that makes you feel like you know them personally.  I cannot wait for this movie to come out, will be interesting to see if as good as book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire in order to have quick access to a calculator.  I no longer have to run to my desk to get a calculator when needed at a moments notice.<br />I would recommend this app to anyone who needs or wants quick access to a calculator.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book for not only teen but adult also .. can't wait to read the second book would recommend series
B001NN4162|5.0|Brand new, factory sealed.  My daughter has watched this movie quite a few times already so everything worked out as planned.  Thanks.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a mother of six, I can't imagine what it would be like to doubt my child's innocence. Yet, when all the evidence is stacked against him/her what else can you do?  The author did a great job of portraying an all-American family and the unraveling of it.  The ending was a surprise...
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Other then the fact I had to sit through an entire movie with my girlfriend swooning over Zac Efron, this was a great transaction.  Thanks...
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the way it was written from the perspective of the two main characters.  I couldn't put it down. I was disappointed by the abrupt ending.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|If you loved cut the rope, or enjoy games like where's my water, you will love this game. It has puzzles, cute characters, a simple concept for a story line, and can be played with two small children giggling over your shoulder while they watch the pudding blobs jiggle and grow.
B004OZZ624|1.0|The movie drags on and on, the plot is unreasonable, and you never actually care whether he is successful.  In fact, after watching his complete and total ineptness, you hope he fails, or she is actually guilty.  The most troubling thing about this movie is that people have given it 3, 4 and 5 stars.  We must have more than a few gullible and naive people in this world if they find this movie the slightest bit intriguing.
0316228532|5.0|Author is one of the reasons for this purchase.  There are many extensive discriptions in this book that allows reader to vizualize the plot.  Easy read as well.
B008RYN44U|4.0|Well I love Gwen and her energy and clever wording.  This<br />is not my favorite album but is's quite good. It's hard for them<br />to top their earlier work.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I started watching season one on Netflix. When I got to the end I was hooked and wanted to see season two. ABC. didn't have all the full episodes so I went on Amazon and found the ones that weren't listed and downloaded them to my Kindle Fire. They were so clear! Much, much better than waiting for ABC's website to buffer and wait on the dumb repetitive commercials they slip in.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Was curious because alot of my friends had read the book and I enjoyed it a great deal. I also was curious about after death experiences
B001453LSI|5.0|I feel Melody is highly undervalued as an artist.  This is a very good album and I hope to buy more of her work.
B003L20IHE|2.0|Was not sure what to expect so kept an open mind. Zac I felt played his part well and the story was understandable of one finding it hard to let go of a lost one. Loved the brother relationship between these two brothers and how guilty he must have felt.This movie however is not one I would worry to watch again.
B009DBKKIY|5.0|I own all of the  \\"regular\\"CDM releases, except skipped some of the Aria and Dreams editions.  If you have them all, then CD#! in this is a repeat.  But, CD#2 has some tracks I do not own.  Still recommend this release.<br />NOTE - When I ripped Disc 3 onto my laptop to convert to MP3 format ,I noticed an unidentified Track #13.  I had to go onto I Tunesfor the song list to realize that there is track #3 that is not coded onto my disc, throwing off the remaing 10 songs - had to reenter the correct song data onto my library and change the disc data as well.  Not sure if this is unique or a major production problem.  But the mucis is all good and that is what is important!
B00866JL96|4.0|This movie I enjoyed, watching a young man who had experienced the serious side of life, had strength of character yet was also very vunerable. He was a young man who showed respect and honour to those around him. His feelings for this young woman were obviously going deep, yet he treated her with  honour, when asked he pulled back, yet remained in the background protecting her back, still allowing her to make her own choices and decisions even if it meant he had to let go. I have watched this movie a number of times and also lent it to a number of others who enjoyed it. Good movie, yes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS AWESOME I love it I have it for xbox computer and kindle its awesome for all of them! if your thinking about getting it you should
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This story is about 4 sisters living in the mid 1800, somewhere near Washington, Philly, or NY. It chronicles their life from puberty to adulthood and is a warmhearted tale about love and loss. I found it funny, the customs of courtship especially and laughed out loud often.<br />The story is driven by a very lively dialogue, making it a quick read. The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.<br />A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author.
B008476HBM|5.0|Great story for anyone who has had to deal with the convoluted workings of a family. Meeting new people, making friends, or falling in love is never easy and it's made even more difficult by the human failing of not being able to be open and honest with others from the beginning of the new relationships. This book is more than a window to the past, it is a relevant look at how many relationships florish or fail in our own times.

B000NI9UMS|5.0|Milos Foreman's earlier work, \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" holds the distinction of being the only movie, along with Frank Capra's \\"It Happened One Night\\", to receive all five major academy awards - Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. Great as that earlier work is and all that just recognition and honor it received, the fierce sadness of this tale of madness, both individual and institutional, is almost too much to bear. The terrible fate of McMurphy (Nicholson) at the hands of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is hardly compensated by that final glimpse of freedom for McMurphy's closest friend. But it is only in this later Milos Foreman classic, \\"Amadeus\\", this adaptation of Peter Shaffer's tale of \\"genius\\", that Foreman seems to be addressing the more redeeming consequences of this unsettling, and unsettled theme, this meeting of institutional madness and individuals within it who aspire to escape that influence.<br /><br />The forms of madness we are introduced to here, primarily in Antonio Salieri's (played by F. Murray Abraham) malicious ways against the humane and creative example of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by Tom Hulce), is no less harmful than Nurse Ratched's. In Ken Kesey's novel the institutional onslaught, through its key representative, Nurse Ratched, strips down the rights of individuals until they are completely stifled. There is quite literally no air to breathe for its protagonist and the result is a claustrophobic emptiness. Milos Foreman's adaptation of Peter Shaffer's \\"Amadeus\\" is no less sparing in its dramatization of institutional forces and the peculiar madness of its key representative, Salieri. While Salieri wants the creativity of Mozart's genius to flower, it is only for the selfish purpose of rabidly appropriating those works under his name. The goal is to entrap that incandescent activity of genius, to tap and transfer that light, and have that shine through him. It is an equally lethal form of imprisonment that destroys the protagonist of \\"Amadeus\\".<br /><br />The unique testament of \\"Amadeus\\", however, is that the artist, his art, and his unrelenting spirit of creation, can conserve lofty sentiments, ideals and counter the influence of a Machiavellian, like Salieri. Foreman has to tell this story given the stranglehold of institutional madness and its triumph over human helplessness that is the story of the previous film.<br /><br />\\"Amadeus\\" begins with the consequences of Salieri's devious ways. He is shown as an aged, repentant, inconsolable, and reptilian character, in an insane asylum. It is thus a tie-in to the world of Nurse Ratched from Foreman's previous tale of madness. Salieri has attempted suicide. As he recovers he recounts his tale to a young priest. His is a story of an aspiring artist who gives the best years of his life in its service only to be cruelly upstaged by a man of real genius. Salieri recounts his early pact with God. It is an act that belies his crudeness, his arrogance, and what is worse, his more prosaic understanding of God. It is no surprise that God flees from the drab soul of the man and chooses to move through the more rarified soul and music of Mozart. How could the music that Salieri imagines himself composing emerge from the trapped, sterile, and insecure soul of a fawning courtier?<br /><br />Salieri should have followed his father's counsel and been a \\"businessman\\". His commitment to God betrays a stunted notion of art borne out of a satanic pride and a crude understanding of divine ways. The language of business permeates his most private conversations with God. His prayers never go beyond conditions: the \\"if-then\\" craft of his begging prayers have a ferocity and primitiveness to it. Even the language of prayer constricts into the wooden form of a legal contract in Salieri's soul. It is no surprise, then, that the art that Salieri produces is similarly pedestrian. It cannot soar with God's presence, as he so desperately wantsit to. His music sputters and takes on the language and form of the courts. It is courteous, measured, mannered, and resonates with the decorum of his king's court. Indeed he is a courtier, through and through, and hardly an artist.<br /><br />Salieri's commitment and austere vows notwithstanding, the God and the muses of music descend on the unsuspecting soul of a prodigy in Salzburg. Mozart is touched by the divine hand, that Salieri so craves, at an early age, and his prolific output brings early recognition and honor in Joseph II's courts. The sheer facility with which the young Amadeus cranks out his tunes does not dilute the high quality of his musical accomplishments. Salieri is a terrible musician. But he has the eye of a gifted critic. He is a silent admirer of Mozart's genius. He knows a good tune when he hears it. When Amadeus's music is played it soars miraculously, just as he dreamed his own music would. Salieri cannot help but smile at Mozart's performances. In these brief moment we see this aspiring musician's soul opening up. But the admiration is not constant. Deep resentment follows. He cannot help but register deep disdain at the thought that he can never be Mozart. He is brought back to earth after the duration of the Mozart piece. The sheer pleasure of the fresh music has been a balm to his soul. His mood rapidly changes to one of anger when he is alone with himself. He curses his God, that he would choose one so crude, so unmannered and undeserving as that \\"boy\\". In this all consuming hatred he is gradually reduced to a shell of a man.<br /><br />Salieri has for years witnessed Mozart's prodigious talents, his rapid rise to prominence in the court of King Joseph II. Each time he is driven to this mixture of admiration and hatred. This drives Salieri to a new ambition. Since he is not born with talent, he can surely appropriate Mozart's genius as his own. Thus follows the devious part of the narrative. Salieri finds the opportunity to take advantage of Mozart's dire financial misfortunes and forces him to write a couple of operas so that he can pass it of as his own. Failing that, he will at least get a glimpse of what inspired composition entails.<br /><br />What follows is truly inspired cinema. I do not think there is a movie out there that shows the artist at work as movingly as it is shown here. Percy Adlon's Celeste comes close, and perhaps Minelli's Lust for Life. The especially poignant scenes show an admiring Salieri writing feverishly, hanging on to every instruction of an ailing Mozart. He is working the musician to death. Even when he is too weak to write, Salieri goads him on, willing to be dragged through the unexpected turns of Mozart's art of composition. Salieri is often confused in composition, but he meekly follows Mozart's instructions and copies down a wild sequence of musical notes. It is only after the tunes settle in his head, do we see a light go on in Salieri. We see this curious paradox of an envious autocrat and willing disciple gratefully clinging on to these insights in musical composition. When Salieri finally digests an inspired idea after a valient struggle, he is hushed by Mozart, since that is but the set up for the main sequence to follow. Thus we see Salieri bring dragged into the rigors of inspiration, the agonies of the work behind Mozart's magnum opus - the \\"Requiem\\". The soundtrack of Mozart's funereal dirge fills the room, as the musician faintly dictates the last notes to an increasingly elated Salieri. Salieri, in this final scene, is finally shown \\"composing\\" music as he had dreamed it, except that he is plugged into inspiration. Divinity in music is coming through that dying intermediary.<br /><br />The plight of the individual who is being refused into the mysteries of artistic creation has not been conceived in a film with as much pathos as in Salieri's life in Milos Foreman's Amadeus. In like measure Amadeus also shows the graces and curses that come with being a genius. Mozart's example shows that to have the gift of music can also be a terrible burden. Art ultimately defies destruction and it does indeed live longer than life. Salieri knows this, as his own life will testify. But he also knows that the beauty of Mozart's music is worth dying for, the gift Mozart is touched by is worth the destruction that inevitably visits the artist. In his marginalized role of sitting from afar Salieri witnesses genius while being acutely conscious of being condemned to the role of the admiring spectator.ntage of Mozart's dire financial misfortunes and forces him to write a couple of operas so that he can pass it of as his own.

B005S9EKCW|3.0|The definitive version of \\"Les Miserables\\" for our time is Bille August's brilliant telling of that story with Liam Neeson doing full justice to the grandeur of Jean Valjean's Christ-like persona and Geoffrey Rush unforgettably menacing as the perversely principled, and ultimately tragic, Inspector Javert. The equally important role of Fantine was interpreted with Uma Thurman's intense pathos and Claire Danes rounded out that superb cast with an impressive rendition of Cosette.<br /><br />I continue to look back at the sheer artistry of this film,  its success in crystallizing the core depth of the main characters and its remarkable incisiveness in transposing the profound dramatic theme of that massive novel in an effective, highly dense, two hour film, as a small miracle in the recent history of great literary adaptations in cinema.<br /><br />I began this year at the movies with the hope that the much lauded and anticipated Tom Hooper 2012 musical version would conserve the spirit of the novel in the way Bille August did it fifteen years ago. Tom Hooper's imaginative feat is impressive and his screening of Amanda Seyfried, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, and Russell Crowe as Cosette, Jean Valjean, Fantine, Marius, and Inspector Javert, respectively, has merit. There is much inspired labor that has gone into Tom Hooper's \\"Les Miserables\\"  with the individual reprisals of each of its characters, with their accompanying songs, capturing the emotional \\"highs\\" of the novel.<br /><br />But the Hooper version of the great epic does not live up to its promise. While it is a good adaptation of the novel it falls short of the artistic merit of the definitive 1998 Bille August adaptation. This is not to say that the impressive sets and exacting imagination of Tom Hooper does not touch the high emotional notes of that drama. All this is to be found in this version. But when all we have are high emotional notes the pitch of tragedy is drowned out. The poetics of tragedy need the emotional lows to set the emotional highs in appropriate contrast between the characters of Javert and Jean Valjean; the much needed interlude of speech was found wanting. Prose as much as the poetry of song was needed to let the emotional weight of the characters permeate our consciousness. We long for the music, fantastic as it is in moments, to quieten for a while, and let the drama emerge in turns through conversation, through the ellipses of spoken discourse. If only this was an adaptation where song and dialogue blended into each other to set the contrasts of emotion that much more stark in some of those brilliant song numbers.<br /><br />The spirit of the novel, its tragic sense, in its telling contrasts of the characters of Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert is diluted, even stunted, in this musical adaptation. This is an odd problem that I have seen recur in the famed broadway staged version as well. The deepest emotional moments in the book are often found in the quieter moments of this great melodrama. It as if the key reversals in the drama, Jean Valjean's conversion in the early book, and Inspector Javert's defeat in the end, required music interspersed by long intervals of silence, to let the emotions drop into our soul at the end of long protracted building up of character. The dramatic might of a character like Javert and Jean Valjean in this version is allowed to emerge in a musical narrative in an episodic fashion. The episodic musical set pieces when characters break into song take turns building and demolishing the character.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman proves he is a formidable talent. He is all there, in character, from those unrecognizable shots of him as a bloodshot, worn down, helpless convict he has become under Javert's whip and chains, to those images of utter control, dignity, and empathy as the Mayor of Montreuil-sur-mer. Jackman surely succeeds as Jean Valjean, he does all he can, and he cannot do more. But where he succeeds gloriously in his convincingly commanding voice of the saint-like ex-convict, he soon bumps up against the formalistic restrictions of a purely musical performance.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway succeeds poignantly as Fantine; but if only she was allowed to lapse into speech, to have her \\"settle\\" in to that wonderful character that was waiting to be further developed. Amanda Seyfried is beautiful in her fragile and luminescent way and her looks have a way of settling her into character in her more modest role. Her singing is exquisite but she is also allowed to linger and take in the rhythms of her character a lot more than the central characters. The biggest surprise was Eddie Redmayne, who has the single most emotionally wrenching song, after he loses his comrades in battle. Like the Cosette character, Marius as supporting actor, is not overburdened by belting out one song after another. The supporting actors are done a great service by being left to define their performances as much by silence as by song.<br /><br />The shock of the film was the Inspector Javert character. I expected Russell Crowe to be as effective, if not more striking, as the Geoffrey Rush rendition of Javert in the 1998 version. His performance, good and respectable as it was, was not characteristically inspired. This is after all the great Russell Crowe, an actor who seemed to carry the burden of lifting the standards of acting single-handedly during a period when acting in American film needed a new face and voice. His great performances in The Insider, Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, Master and Commander, Robin Hood, The Last Three Days set me up for another inspired performance. Like Brando, Crowe has had the remarkable ability of transcending the movies he has been in and if there is any actor who  could breathe new life into a film of the scale and power of \\"Les Miserables\\", after Geoffrey Rush's inspired turn, it would be him. Crowe has the range and subtlety to bring a fresh interpretation to the venomous, perverse, and tragic Inspector Javert.<br /><br />But it was not to be. This is Jackman's film from the first to the last frame. Crowe is strangely disengaged in the role. The crucial moment of reversal in Inspector Javert's life, during his great moment of resignation at the end of film when he admits to being wrong, and he submits to Jean Valjean's superior principle of compassion, ought to be the point of emotional climax in the film. In Hooper's hands this moment becomes a bombastic moment that undoes the dramatic power of the moment. The numbing paradox of following the law down to the letter is Javert's supreme moment of recognition; see how beautifully Bille August sets about capturing the emotion of this scene. Geoffrey Rush as Javert proves that the emotion at this moment is one of quiet failure. It is a crushing moment for Javert and a moment of release for Jean Valjean. The sense of tragedy is that of good triumphing over evil in a muted, subdued, way. There is a dignified admission of failure, but there is hardly a celebration of victory on the part of Valjean. This is a sad moment for both of them. During this supposedly meditative moment Hooper makes the wrong decision to have Crowe break out into song. The singing seems so out of place. I was hoping that Crowe would be spared here and allowed to lapse into speech; not because he is not a good singer here, he ably is,  but because this dramatic moment called for a quieter form of emotional depth, an almost lyrical moment of silence, a hushed soliloquy at best, rather than an operatic burst into song.<br /><br />To say that this 2012 version of Victor Hugo's epic, is a good, rather than great, version of \\"Les Miserables\\" is to say first that this film succeeds in scattered, though, inspired episodic moments of song and character. Tom Hooper's labor of love was, however, not translated well to an effective poetics on screen and was not sustained in the form of an emotional tour-de-forceof a drama of good triumphing over evil, which was what that 1998 version superbly brought about in the perfect casting and performances of Geoffrey Rush and Liam Neeson. To register this distinction between good and great literary adaptations I recommend seeing both these versions as closely together as you possibly can. It will give you a sense of how the use and abuse of music has the net effect of diluting the emotional contrasts of the story.to the venomous, perverse, and tragic Inspector Javert.<br /><br />But it was not to be.

B00AFEXRME|4.0|Robert Zemeckis's \\"Flight\\" is one of the standout films of the year. This absorbing and unique story of a pilot fighting his addictions is another brilliant showcase for Denzel's Washington's talent. It is heartening to see Denzel Washington getting better at his craft with age. The aura of this veteran actor still transcends the movies he is in, and as much as he effortlessly repeats this in Flight the brilliant direction and story is a worthy complement to his performance as ace pilot Whip Whittaker, who runs into bad weather, literally and figuratively.<br /><br />Flight's writer, John Gatins, an unpretentious and upcoming talent who penned the imaginative, underrated, Real Steel with Hugh Jackman from early 2012, proves that he is only beginning to find his Hollywood muse. Flight is similarly entertaining, but it is much heavier on serious drama. It is that curious mix of old fashioned big budget entertainment and intimate involving drama focusing on human foibles leading to tragic consequences.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis is one of the least self-indulgent directors working in Hollywood. He is a master of light-hearted, entertaining fare, for kids and adults alike, in the best tradition of Hollywood films -  Romancing the Stone, Back to the Future - being proofs of his great sense for spectacle and storytelling. But he has also made big mainstream movies with remarkable emotional power  and seriousness that has stood the test of time - Contact and Castaway, being notable examples.<br /><br />With Flight he has proved once again that he is also a master of this more serious fare that instructs and delights. Much of his effectiveness in making big budget films that turn into lyrical, intimate dramas, stems from his remarkable eye for casting, and his ability to hire great actors and leave them alone to find new directions in performance they have not gone before. As such, he seems to be that rare example of an action director who is also an actor's director, a great collaborator with the actors he has chosen for his title roles. One hopes there is more to come from the Washington-Zemeckis collaboration in the future because Washington, like Zemeckis, has broken new ground.<br /><br />Seeing Denzel Washington play the tortured role of Whip Whittaker to perfection in \\"Flight\\" got me thinking of his acting talent once again. He plays the victor and the vanquished with his characteristic pathos and honesty. The ups and downs of Whip's life are relentless and the chaos in Whip's life is hard to watch only because Washington gives his all in a precise and controlled performance. It takes a good deal of serenity, paradoxical as this may sound, in an actor to convincingly portray extremes of self-loathing and self-confidence on screen without it all floundering clumsily into messy melodrama. Denzel Washington as Whip in \\"flight\\" from reality is my pick for the best actor Oscar.<br /><br />Strength and failure converge remarkably well in Washington's portrayal of a pilot superbly alive to his craft but lost to life. In one blinding moment of decision his life descends on his craft. A man too used to success has to steel himself for a harrowing admission of failure.at collaborator with the actors he has chosen for his title roles.

B00A81MV3U|4.0|David O. Russell brings a deeply human dimension to this odd tale of two souls desperately living on the fringes. The tale centers on Pat's (Bradley Cooper) determination to reconcile with his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), despite the impossibility of that ideal and the valiant effort. As Pat goes through an exhausting course of attempting to salvage the last remnants of his failed marriage he is not always \\"present\\" in the moment, to notice the virtues of the people around him trying in vain to keep up with his highs and lows. This is especially noticeable when Pat chooses to open up to an unexpected friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who is also impossible to keep up with, and hardly notices her love and concern during his obsessive search for reconciliation with his wife.<br /><br />Even if the lives of Pat and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are in a tail-spin when we are introduced to them, their meeting becomes a promising occasion for allaying the chaos in their lives. But in an impulsive moment (or is it cold, and calculated) a quid pro quo deal is struck between them that promises to unhinge, rather than sustain, harmony in their lives. We  see the makings of a tragedy of two doomed people attracted to each other for all the wrong reasons. \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" begins with these premonitions of high tragedy.<br /><br />But it is surprising, even magical, when the movie becomes a beautiful, even consoling, illustration of a tale of hopelessness with a \\"silver lining\\". The story portends tragedy and chaos but there is also transcendence, this powerful will in the two central characters to overcome failure, misunderstandings, and impossible losses. The real power of the film was its success in conveying the experience of sheer exhileration that accompanies those moments of insight in the lives of Tiffany and Pat as they struggle to transcend their circumstances with relentless optimism.<br /><br />The emotional richness of the story has everything to do with the strange world of Tiffany and Pat. The freshness of the story unsettles all expectations. These off-beat characters have their kin in Hollywood history, from Frank Mackey in Anderson's Magnolia, to Ricky Fitts and Angela Hayes in Mendes's American Beauty. The pitch of the emotional drama of some of the scenes in Russell's film reminded me of the greatest scenes in the most trenchant melodramas made in the last couple of decades. The expressiveness of Pat and Tiffany together has an edginess to it that is a reminder of those brilliant scenes between Fitts and Hayes in the landmark Sam Mendes film. David O. Russell, an impressive director when he is at his best (See his Three Kings for instance) has the deft hand to transform the element of grotesque in the tale into a deeply human one.<br /><br />This movie embraces and shirks realism. Wounded characters miraculously transcend their circumstances. We are not quite sure where the psychological realism ends and the surreal begins. We are immersed in the psychological mayhem of the life of Tiffany and Pat one minute, and the next minute they are singing praises of each other. The film manages to put a perspective to the surfeit of realism as it hangs over the veil of romantic fantasy to keep the psychological chaos of these characters at just that right remove. The film suspends the unsettling reality of these lost lives at just that right \\"cinematic\\" distance to keep our attention on what is a genuinely moving human drama developing around the tumultuous ups and downs of  two young lives.<br /><br />Inspired acting from two eminently watchable actors in Hollywood: Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper breathes much of the life into this film. The charisma of these stars make their characters watchable. Both of them succeed early and well in bringing a sympathetic dimension to their wayward characters. Cooper and Lawrence are the backbone of the story until the last energetic frame of the film, even if Robert DeNiro as Pat's obsessive compulsive father and the poignant  and long suffering presence of Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother, tempers and renders meaning to a story that threatens to become one full of sound and fury signifying nothing.<br /><br />The scene with Pat reading, or devouring, Hemingway with intense interest is at once touching and comic. When Pat, in one of his many bouts of frenzy, retreats into this book he is deflated to find Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms end on a tragic note. In stinging protest he admonishes Hemingway's masochistic  streak. Pat is livid about the novel's unnecessary tragic ending. He flings out that book through the window of his attic rejecting the tragic sense of life in that novel. This form of art does the disservice of mindlessly courting the sad endings he is come to experience in life. This scene alerts the audience that the director may be setting us up for an ending that is a subversion of the tragic ending. The meaning of the title of the movie is for the first time brought up memorably.<br /><br />But a counter-argument is soon set up to Pat's critique of the novel. The tragic wisdom set up by Hemingway has an admirer. Pat's view of art is expanded as that counter-argument comes in the form of a letter from an admirer. It is worth seeing this film to find out who this admirer is and what the source of that tragic wisdom is.

Anderson's Magnolia (1999), Paul Haggis's Crash (2005), and Alejandro Inarittu's 21 Grams. Russell's \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a film that subverts the ending of these notable recent tragedies on film with a brilliant twist. Where Innaritu and Anderson leave their endings hauntingly open Russell will bend his ending to the reconciliatory themes addressed by the protagonist's ruminations on the tragic sense in the great American novel.ro as Pat's obsessive compulsive father and the poignant  and long suffering presence of Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother, tempers and renders meaning to a story that threatens to become one full of sound and fury signifying nothing.<br /><br />The scene with Pat reading, or devouring, Hemingway with intense interest is at once touching and comic. When Pat, in one of his many bouts of frenzy, retreats into this book he is deflated to find Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms end on a tragic note. In stinging protest he admonishes Hemingway's masochistic  streak. Pat is livid about the novel's unnecessary tragic ending. He flings out that book through the window of his attic rejecting the tragic sense of life in that novel. This form of art does the disservice of mindlessly courting the sad endings he is come to experience in life. This scene alerts the audience that the director may be setting us up for an ending that is a subversion of the tragic ending. The meaning of the title of the movie is for the first time brought up memorably.<br /><br />But a counter-argument is soon set up to Pat's critique of the novel. The tragic wisdom set up by Hemingway has an admirer. Pat's view of art is expanded as that counter-argument comes in the form of a letter from an admirer. It is worth seeing this film to find out who this admirer is and what the source of that tragic wisdom is. It will serve to illustrate how a \\"silver lining\\" plays out in Pat and Tiffany's increasingly convoluted and dangerous playbook of life.<br /><br />David O.

B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|\\"Jack Reacher\\" is a reprisal of those elegant Don Siegel detective thrillers from the 1970s. Tom Cruise returns to screen in fine form as the titular character to convincingly resurrect the intense cool of the iconic stars of the 1970s. This is a different Tom Cruise, edgier and relentless in his pursuit of the bad guys.<br /><br />Cruise's role as Jack Reacher is in part a reprisal of his Vincent character from Collateral with the key difference that the physically intense and commanding presence on screen in that Michael Mann classic now has a compassionate and intellectual dimension in this role to make Cruise's portrayal of the multi-dimensional warrior/detective/hermit Jack Reacher character genuinely convincing. The mystery and aura of Reacher doing all he can to restore justice in the shadows is admirably brought to life by Cruise. He convincingly brings to screen a heroic character who is seen when he wants to be seen and disappears when he must. The end result is that the larger than life persona of Cruise is aptly suited to bring the larger than life character of Jack Reacher effectively to the screen.<br /><br />Tom Cruise carries the peculiar wisdom of Jack Reacher with subtlety. His biggest accomplishment is to bring Reacher's physical intensity in harmonious relationship with his quiet, reflective, persona. As such Cruise has crafted a performance that goes very well with director Christopher McQuarrie's meditative, even stately, shot sequences. Do not expect to find the rapidly edited, hand-held camera shots, which has become the \\"grammar\\" of choice for action film narratives. The tempo is more classical and is the best recent tribute we have to those finely crafted Don Siegel action flicks from \\"Dirty Harry\\" to \\"Coogan's Bluff\\". McQuarrie's use of sound also evokes the best of Michael Mann movies, especially Heat.<br /><br />Another stylistic innovation in this film is its spare visual style. Special effects are held back to a minimum only because there is so much real action called for by the Jack Reacher character. One can clearly see that Tom Cruise once again does all his stunts to give his portrayal of Reacher at work in the most dangerous scenes in the film that much more authenticity. The car chase sequences are worth calling out as an impressive piece of driving by the star. McQuarrie's camera often shows those kinetic and precarious car chase sequences with Cruise in the driver seat. These car chase sequences have the visceral intensity of the greatest chase sequences in Peter Yates's unforgettable McQueen masterpiece \\"Bullitt\\".<br /><br />The supporting cast of David Oyelowo as Detective Emerson and Rosamund Pike as Helen Rodin, resurrects character types from McQuarrie's first film as a director where he obliquely sets out to critique violence in the Way of the Gun. Pike and Oyelowo once again demonstrate the high quality of Britain's acting talent flooding into Hollywood productions. The screen chemistry between Pike and Cruise are there to be seen. It is simple, understated, matter-of-fact. But there is a slow build up to something meaningful at the end of the film. Pike is perfect in the role and Oyelowo does an impressive turn as a detective who has much more going for him than his veiled personality shows.<br /><br />For those of you in the mood to see Cruise on the course of perfecting his craft in his fourth decade as a star see this film. Cruise is increasingly molding a unique persona on screen that puts him up there with the Eastwoods and Connerys of the world. This film may not disappoint those who continue to appreciate Cruise for what he does best, breaking the barriers of the action film and what an action star should do to take the action film genre to new heights in the 21st century.<br /><br />This is a relatively \\"small\\" film as far as the budget goes and has the look and feel of an indie film. Cruise's seering intensity keeps this film off-center to give new meaning to the mainstream action flick. \\"Jack Reacher\\" will hopefully find a solid niche of movie goers and find a steady stream of audience overseas. Even if this film does not look and feel like a traditional blockbuster Cruise film, it more than makes up for what it does not have by way of scale with its singular moodiness that is a throwback to the quiet intelligence of the great Siegel action movies. This film is a brilliant mood piece and  I hope that the film is successful enough to spawn more adaptations in the future.am action flick. \\"Jack Reacher\\" will hopefully find a solid niche of movie goers and find a steady stream of audience overseas.

B007REV4YI|3.0|\\"Skyfall\\" is a good movie with Daniel Craig doing another convincing rendition of the superspy for the 21st century. But it is overrated. It is a film enthralling to follow precisely and only because of its technical brilliance, the sheer speed with which the episodes move in this film to its climax. Bond's \\"fall\\" from the train,  in that wonderful preview shown all over the world, is an example of how brilliantly conceived some of the marketing campaigns in movies have become, and how one impressive stunt can cast a \\"halo\\" on the perception of the rest of the film. There are more action stunts like this dispersed through the film from Bond's exploits high atop state of the art skyscrapers in China to great action sequences staged on the streets of London and the great mystical landscapes of Scotland, that rival the special effects and stunts of great action film franchises from The Jason Bourne series to the Mission Impossible films.<br /><br />Daniel Craig has brought to James Bond the kinetic efficiency of the 21st century action hero. His movements have the snap and stiffness that fits well with the new cinematic aesthetic of the digital age. Craig has created a slimmer, more agile spy, efficient in the conduct of his business but deficient in the charm and allure that made Bond the Brand that made the movie franchise. The steely gaze of Daniel Craig, his quick lithe movements, gives his Bond an economy of expression and austere efficiency in the tradition of Eastwood's Dirty Harry and Schwarzenegger's Terminator though it strips off the soul of the classic charm that Sean Connery brought into this franchise in the early 1960s.<br /><br />The Bond brand continues to be re-defined in \\"Skyfall\\". From a purely economic point-of-view this re-branded Bond may last another fifty years. But as surely as the newly branded Bond has been fitted for the times it is certain that the allure of James Bond that fed the franchise for the first forty years has suffered a premature decline at 50.<br /><br />The James Bond that Sean Connery created for screen had a playful toughness taking complete delight in the seductive style, charm, and elegance of 007's exotic dream like existence. This philosophy of style is of course a product of the age of the cold war years but it also has a universal charm to it that ought to be used and adapted to our very different age in the new century. Mr Craig's predecessor, Pierce Brosnan creatively adapted Connery's toughness, the Scot's inimitable charm, and the \\"lighter\\" more self-deprecating style of Sir Roger Moore to bring his own distinctive brand of charm to the franchise.<br /><br />The charm and mystery of Bond ought to remain untouched because therein lies the source of its cultural staying power. We all know about the great tribute to Bond movies that the Austin Powers comedy franchise is. Its distinctive contribution is its slapstick comedy, its hilarious satire of the unique world of Bond. The deeper distinction of this form of satire is the underlying discerning commentary on Bond's charm - the fact of the character's mystery. Satire is often disguised admiration and Austin Powers is effective because it is born of this admiration of the central fact of the Bond universe - its invincible charm.<br /><br />Daniel Craig's interpretation of Bond jettisons charm and tradition.  Bond has become a shell of a man, set out to do his job as an automaton. Admirers of Craig, from Sir Sean to Sir Roger, see this new beginning as a virtue. But a new Bond for the new century appears innovative and even possible only as an idea. A \\"new Bond\\" is an oxymoron since it just does not work on screen. At least this viewer continues to look back to Connery's Bond with nostalgia.<br /><br />I like Daniel Craig in the Bond movies not because he is Bond, but because he is Daniel Craig. Craig is consistently compelling on the screen. He brings a raw energy and believability to his roles. But Bond is a mythic figure thatdoes not mix well with the Craig persona. Unless of course Bond is adapted to fit the Craig persona. Real innovation in re-interpreting Bond could not begin with a clean break from the past. That sort of innovation is a destructive rather than a creative act. Reinterpreting an iconic figure like Bond requires a careful continuation of tradition, especially when so much good has come out of that tradition.<br /><br />It is an interesting irony to me to see how Daniel Craig's philosophy of style is more easily traced back to one of the great nemeses of Bond films, the great Robert Shaw character, Red Grant, in From Russia with Love. It as if Red Grant's intense robotic screen presence and style triumphed metaphorically over Bond's fluid style. That fantastic fight scene in the train when he is on the brink of pounding Bond to bits ultimately ends with Grant pushed overboard. But he seems to have got the better of our hero in the long run by re-surfacing a half a century later to take over the Bond franchise in Casino Royale, Quantam of Solace, and Skyfall.<br /><br />While this bit may be a bit overstated here the point of this illustration is that there is a certain coldness to Mr. Craig as Bond that reminds me of the more expressionless character of Grant's type in that early film. It is this emotional vacuousness of Craig as Bond that seems to me the tragedy of the new Bond for the new century. After every Bond movie, featuring Craig, I feel that we have lost that cultural institution for good, its allure, the special mood, of the traditional Bond film. Even the wonderful pounding John Barry Bond score has been modified or diluted to an unrecognizable form and left behind along with the great elegance of the previous Bond in the dust of the last century. This British Terminator as the new stand-in for Bond seems terribly inadequate.<br /><br />Aspects of \\"Skyfall\\" that hold up beautifully to the tradition of Bond films is Adele's song \\"Skyfall\\" and Ralph Fiennes's superb turn as Gareth Mallory, a key aide to \\"M\\". The song is intoxicating and will almost certainly be the high point of the \\"style\\" of the film and will continue to be the \\"selling point\\" for the film in the long run. The eccentric bad guy, Silva,  played by another competent actor Javier Bardem, makes for a story that is not as enthralling as it has been made out to be. Dame Judy Dench has hardly performed badly in front of a camera or on stage. As \\"M\\" she continues to be interesting as ever. But the human dimension that Mr. Mendes, the director, attempts to inject into the script, by making \\"M\\" the target of Silva's wrath, only succeeds in deflating the mystery of \\"M\\".<br /><br />Not all the action in the world can prop up a Bond film without a Bond who exudes the magic of the character conceived by Ian Fleming. One usually got that style in a couple of gestures from Sir Sean at his prime, in a few minutes of light-hearted wisecracks and banter in the inimitable elegance of Sir Roger, and in the dramatic intensity and laid back ease of Dalton and Brosnan. But in three films with Daniel Craig we see the new action star of the 21st century in place of the mythic character. Craig is an eminently watchable actor, a superlative action star, but his style is not in keeping with the spirit of this great mythic character. This franchise is alive and well; its financial success, supreme as it is, is no sign however that the Bond we know and admire is alive and well.does not mix well with the Craig persona.

B0076D21O2|4.0|Roland Emmerich's film \\"Anonymous\\" is  worth a look. It resurrects one side of the Shakespeare authorship question by introducing the mass audience to the theory that Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford, was Shakespeare's ghost writer. If you are an \\"Oxfordian\\" this may be the movie for you, not for what it substantiates but for what it dramatizes.<br /><br />I have not paid any attention to the Shakespeare authorship controversy and I continue to remain indifferent to the conclusions of either camp. The fact of the inimitable plays is proof enough for me that there was a committed hand and a matchless imagination behind them. Whether it was Devere, Bacon, Marlowe, or Shakespeare himself is less important for a viewer who judges the merit of a film by the story it tells.  I enjoyed the film, because it takes a position on the authorship question, extracts the dramatic core of the theory and does a great job of movingly telling a story of an unparalleled life committed to art. The film evokes the fun, the labor, the inspiration, and the obsession behind the astonishing feat that is the Shakespeare (or according to this film, the Devere) corpus.<br /><br />The fast paced dramatic narrative is not only entertaining but also imbued with pathos of the story of an artistic life consumed by genius. There are the usual maladies that a big budget Hollywood film suffers from. The director, Roland Emmerich, one of the leading lights of Hollywood, has built his reputation with big budget disaster/science fiction productions (his resume includes \\"Independence Day\\", \\"The Day after tomorrow\\", and \\"2012\\"). Even if we continue to get plenty of spectacle and sensationalism here the pathos of the story of the obscure, anonymous, artist shines through. What Emmerich leaves us in this version of the genesis of Shakespeare's plays is the universal tale of the tragedy of the artist.<br /><br />Emmerich's films have their place in world cinema and I am glad that a person of his talent has made a film on Shakespeare's plays. The story that unfolds about Devere as author is an intriguing possibility. Plausibility is what is aimed at here given the fact that the life of the author of these plays will always be shrouded in mystery. Even if this fictional recount of the genesis of the greatest plays in the English language is not history, the major premise of this story is plausible. The film meets that delicate balance of truth and fiction. Any perceived factual weaknesses in the script is adequately balanced by the authentic telling of the story of an artist passionately committed to his art. Stories like this are valuable reminders that legacy of an artist can transcend history and its petty squabbles, and poetic truth is ever at odds with historic truth.<br /><br />The film brings us top notch performances from Sebastian Armesto as Ben Johnson, Vanessa Redgrave as the aged Queen Elizabeth, Joely Richardson as the young Queen Elizabeth, David Thewlis as William Cecil, and Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil. The guy who plays DeVere (Rhys Ifans) is quite brilliant and Rafe Spall as \\"Will\\" Shakespeare is amusingly appropriate for the role of a dumbed down fraud who happily took the credit for Devere's labors. To take the film on its own terms is important in order to appreciate Ifans's portrayal of DeVere as a person who lives for his art and nothing else. The idea that anyone can live solely for art even if it comes at the cost (or from the artistic/political point of view - benefit) of near universal anonymity drives the pathos of this \\"biography\\". The obscurity that is the lot of the genuine artist is hardly a deterrent for the passion of  genius. Genius, this story repeatedly reminds us, disdains acclaim, honor, and embraces fate even if that turns out to be tragic. The pathos of cheerfully embracing the dismal lot of genius is the transcendent theme of this story.<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich's greatest merit is to evoke the passion of the artist tolife for us. \\"Anonymous\\" reminds me of Peter Shaffer's \\"Amadeus\\" for its soaring tribute to the spirit of the artist who composes his works, not for popular aclaim, but for a much more deeper source of validation. Devere writes because he must. Only an inner compulsion to delight the audience explains the creative act that is the Devere/Shakespeare corpus. Devere desperately wants to entertain the popular audience with his plays but we movingly see how the deeper notes of his plays stuns not only the festive crowd into a thoughtful silence but the greatest poets of the age - from Marlowe to Jonson - who look at the performances of his plays with envy and awe.<br /><br />Devere we learn in the end is seeking validation from one solitary voice. In this case, Devere's audience of one will be Ben Jonson, who we have repeatedly seen being stunned by the artistry of Devere's plays. He is floored at the end of each performance like his distinguished peer, Marlowe. The scene with Devere at his death bed with everything lost - his office, reputation, honor, his son - outwitted by the Machiavellian Robert Cecil shows at once the peculiar liberty of the anonymous artist and the agony of his isolation. But the divinely unconcerned look in the dying Devere despite losing everything confirms his rising hope in the legacy of his words. His real worry is to secure the posthumous life of his words. He does not seem to be bothered about restoring the rightful authorship of these plays under his name. Honor is a distant concern; the survival of his art is only obsession. As an artist he is happy to stay invisible; he is at peace despite betrayal and dispossession. The only endorsement Devere seeks is Ben Jonson's verdict of his plays.<br /><br />Jonson's ecstatic note of acknowledgement that the poetry, the words, are the most wondrous he has heard, and his confidence that those plays will continue to amaze future readers, is a scene of great dramatic power. This is the high point of the film. Devere's story may end up in obscurity but the plays will transcend his age; his writings will soar past the political intrigues and conspiracies of the age and live for all ages. Ultimately the wider audience will keep the meaning of these plays alive and well. The author is unimportant but his literary legacy will never be condemned to anonymity.<br /><br />Mainstream films that attempt to resurrect the life of genius this way ought to be encouraged. Films that entertain can also happily bring with it moments of surprise. If only films like this could be brought to screen more often and be a more regular part of Hollywood's friday night fare, we would perhaps have more readers taking up Shakespeare. The story brought to life here is not unlike a Shakespearean play - with themes that resonate with a popular audience. The film, like the plays, offers subterfuge, deceit, war, obsession, love, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, the ingredients for great drama; but there are also moments of moral redemption and loftiness, with the narrative offering an eloquent argument for the high value of the uncompromising artistic life utterly devoted to art.<br /><br />Roland Emmerich's \\"Anonymous\\" is a film of undeniable emotional power. This retelling of the \\"Oxfordian theory\\" should be seen with reasonable expectations, and by this I mean, the claims of the story offered here ought not to be seen as a serious excursion into history. \\"Anonymous\\" shines as a story passionately told about a writer in love with writing, who seemingly disdained authorship by risking complete anonymity, to create the greatest poetry of the Elizabethan age.life for us. \\"Anonymous\\" reminds me of Peter Shaffer's \\"Amadeus\\" for its soaring tribute to the spirit of the artist who composes his works, not for popular aclaim, but for a much more deeper source of validation.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm a fan of Nicholas Sparks and thought I'd created a great villain in Last Resort. Readers say he was a great one and one they loved to hate, but I have to give credit to Sparks for creating a well-crafted villain right down to his blurred vision and slurred words. I could just picture him. When I got to the ending chapters, I didn't want to put the book down and couldn't wait to see what happened next, though the beginning was a little slow. Near the end of Chapter 15, I found a POV slip, but I guess if you're Nicholas Sparks, you can get away with that. I have to still give his story a five, even with a POV slip. The man can spin a story, and I love his stories. The ending brought tears. I lived the story with Erin turned Katie. I loved the fact that though she never fought before, in the end, she fought like a wildcat. Another great read by a true yarn spinner. I was surprised to see the suspense in his usual love stories, but since I write romantic suspense, I loved it. I'll always read his books.

B0086700CM|5.0|Well I love this game so much and I always get the coins but anyway this is a great app you should get this app this app is a great app for your family
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|No matter how old you are you will enjoy this book. It shares a great adventure of three companions that travel to the great wizard to achieve their greatest wishes. There is never a dull moment in this story. I suggest you read this.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book ready for next book in series. Liked the surprises that came with the second book. Characters are getting better each book.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|They say that everyone in prision is innocent; but when evidence comes to light that Andy Dufresne did not kill his wife and her lover, the Warden snuffs the light out.  Andy had become a too valuable asset.  But Andy keeps his hope alive by working out a long range plan.  He invites his good friend 'Red' to come find him in Zihuatanejo if and when he gets out.  However 'Red' thinks he's too institutionalized to make it on the outside.  Against all odds we find ourselves pulling for Andy and &#34;Right&#34; to win out.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fascinating story and well written.  I'm not sure what  is real and what is fiction.  If you don't get this you are insane
B003MOHX8S|5.0|One of the best albums out there that captures a broad gamma of moods. Two Steps from Hell is badass in this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I love it a lot it give good moves for ur fingers and hand when I first got this games I had a good high score
B006B9TLT0|5.0|Taylor Swift... just saying her name makes you smile.<br /><br />The quality of the recording was top notch. Fans of Taylor MUST buy this one.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I think its a pretty cool game the only thing i dont. like is that u cant rotate your properties
B0047685I2|5.0|Ever After... a love story.<br /><br />With Barrymore in the lead, what could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />Watch it and love it.
0345803485|1.0|If you're into poor writing get this book.  I don't know why it got so much good press.  It's a waste of money.
0062200909|5.0|WETA has really pushed it this time with the release of the book. It makes the reader appreciate the depth of Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-earth.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The kids are growing up, the cheating husband is STILL running for office, but I never seen to tire of this cast of characters!
B009XY97VC|5.0|Two Steps From Hell has just earned an extra star in my favorite list. Their music seems to grow more mature and deep with each passing release. Invinsible was good, Archangel was grand... SkyWorld is awesome.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie was entertaining, but nothing like the Bourne series we are used to. I bought the other three, won't buy this one.
B00709GTGS|5.0|One very cute, sweet and romantic story about a couple that seems to belong in their own timeline. A shame that most people dont know about this one.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|great service and great show- Delivered super fast.. Finished it in two days!!! a a a a a a  a
B009O07NDY|5.0|Just listen to the first three tracks and you will feel as if you never left Middle-earth in the first place.
B005AUWY90|4.0|With over 500 customer comments on this movie, no one will read this, but I'll write it anyway. First of all, the movie is brilliantly done. The animation is incredible and the acting is fine. The story is over-the-top, but that's fine. It's exciting and it keeps moving. My only caveat is that the version I got (used, through Amazon) is a bare-bones edition, with not one single bonus feature; not even a trailer. Disney has apparently released a plethora of editions of this -- including that ridiculous 11-disc one. Eleven? Come on! At least some of those various editions must have making-of documentaries, even though those are usually just puff-pieces. But I do like to see the actors in front of the mic, doing their lines. But that caveat aside, I quite enjoyed this film. Maybe I wouldn't if I were a kid, but those days are long gone. For me, as old as I am and as many movies as I've seen, this is a fun film. So there, all you one-star people!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Aside from the highly sexual nature of this book the story line is pretty good. You definitely want to know whats happening next.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|It's all part of the plan....or is it?  Sublimely funny tale of the end of the world and the angels, demons, witches and people involved ....whether they know it or not.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a great book.<br />It had me smiling, laughing, thinking, reminiscing and wondering as I read it.<br />I highly recommend it.
B0051XQI84|4.0|Great movie, well done and very funny... just wish it wasn't so quick!  But I guess that will be for the sequel.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|i cannot wait to see part 2 - this is a fantastic saga !  thanks for the prompt delivery (via instant video)!!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is a fun game where you feel like you are back in the 80's again. Still cannot win however!
B000683VI4|5.0|I Love this movie! Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is simply a pleasant show.  I would recommend it to<br />anyone that wants to relax and be entertained.
B00004TS0E|4.0|I am really glad to add this movie to the rest of my collection of holiday movies. Will watch for more deals next christmas!
B003XRELGQ|2.0|I read this book for my literature class. I prefer Slaughterhouse 5. However, this is also interesting and unique. Science fiction has never been my favorite.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was fun, sweet, and easy to read. I loved it! It kept me interested and the pages flew by.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game 'cause I really like horses. This is a great game for horse lovers and people who own horses.
0807126063|5.0|St. Ignatius believed that people could write their way to truth, and medievalist Ignatius J. Reilly (Jesus? Really?) does his best work writing as he lolls around on his stain-sheeted bed - that is, before he loses said sheet during a failed insurgency at Levy Pants.  Hilarious characters abound, while never losing sight of what's most profound - the truth of the insanity of being human.
B005I2YL4G|5.0|Works great for a low budget htpc build.  Running for about two months with no problems.  Bought several more for simple work builds.  Stock fan works fine but a little noisy.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I believe this is the best Sherlock of the TV lot!!!!!!!  Bring on more seasons, please, please, please, pretty please.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Just  a fun game, all of my kids downloaded it onto their devices after playing this game on my Kindle HD.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was written from the perspective of the young people involved in the story.  In my opinion the story has a powerful message for children youth and adults.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Quick download, was free at the time, good for quick updates, faster than waiting for weather.com to load up on my PC.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I got this book and I was not able to put it down once I started to read it.  I loved the story and the characters, Sky and Holder are amazing. This book was a page turner and just when I thought the story was winding down, BAM plot twist, and I had to finish the book in a day.<br /><br />I'm not sure if my review does this book justice, but it is definitely worth reading!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|What a great surprise.  I loved the writing. I loved the storyline.  The characters were well thought out.  It's a fun and easy read.  It left me wanting to find more books in this series.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter is absolutely Amazing... I can't wait to purchase the next season. I'm addicted. I totally recommend Dexter to everyone.
B005K2YTG4|4.0|The product arrived in lovely condition. It holds my kindle nicely, doesn't scratch it in any way, and, I feel, protects it more if dropped.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am not a horse fan, but this app is kind of cute.  Not sure If I will keep playing. it's sort of like farmville where things are timed and you have to visit friends.  Not sure if I have the patience for these kind of games anymore.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I don't normally play facebookesq games like this but since its easy to get neighbors and possible to get the rare dragons without buying gold this one catches my attention.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love this book!! It's awesome because of the adventures of Dorothy, I imagined the details it was awesome !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this application is a wonderful pass time with so many different games all in one I love it I highly recommend that you get this app
142314189X|5.0|I liked, the quality is very different of book of Brazil!<br />But,I think that, the book should arrive with less damage!<br />So, I really liked!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you have read fifty shades of grey this is the next best series . I really enjoy this series
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|it was good with all the mistery looking for stuff the HINT BUTTEN and puzzles but how do you defeat the Eden guy
B008G59IBI|5.0|Another great album! I was worried about the fact that they would be coming out with 3 albums but it amazes me how many great songs they pulled off to the general public!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a nice simple game. My only complaint is that most other horses cost waaay too many gems. Kinda takes the fun out of picking a new horse.
B007QNRMUU|4.0|Love this album! Jason is just one of those great artists that pulls at your celestial heart strings! Can't get better than that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is such fun you have to get it. I though it was going to be dumb but it turns out really fun
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed how the author was able to paint a picture with words of their lives.  The ending was heart breaking, but she made a good point about quality of life.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Read this book 25+ years ago & found it to be just as inspiring. Personal victory in the MOST difficult circumstances.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing!!<br />It's even better than the movie! I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy in this series!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Delightful little game that just keeps on entertaining. Very fun. Definitely fun and more than a little addicting. Soon, you, too, will dream of coins.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful dystopian fiction! Great writing! Unique even! This was just the kind of dystopian fiction that I love - well imagined enough that you can see how this world could be created. I was fully engaged throughout. As unique as I thought the story was, there were times that I got to thinking about the parallels with Lord of the Flies. Perhaps if you read it, you'll understand the reference, because at this point I'm not sure I could describe the connection very well. Definitely worth the good reviews!
B0054SMID0|5.0|It starts out just a bit slow, and has a couple of slow spots, but quickly gets interesting and is a very good movie.
B0083Z614S|5.0|If you want something to read that is nostalgic or something to read with the kids then this is for you. Although the traditional speech and format can confuse some if read with patience or aloud to others it isn't so bad. It's worth it and might inspire your children to put down video games and run outside.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|It was a great depiction of Prohibition with strong characters and an even stronger story line. LaBeouf continues to surprise!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I've had my eye on this kindle fire case for a while now... I finally broke down and ordered it.  I'm glad I did... I absolutely love it!!  It fits my kindle fire perfectly... it's good quality leather and the color is very pretty.  I ordered a used one because they were sold out of new... it arrived in perfect condition, you can't even tell that it had been used previously.  I would recommend this to any kindle fire owner who wants a unique cover.  Even though it has straps it does hold your fire securely in the case and it doesn't leave any room for it to move.  It's perfect!
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I thought Blake Lively was the best actor in this movie. I loved the story line and the way the ending played out.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Excellent game! Works perfectly on my Android system. Never stops and the notifications are consistent. Thank you for creating it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked this book as it is giving us a peek into the world we will be living in for eternity.  Really fascinating reading especially for those of us who are approaching the age that we will be experiencing these things in the not too distant future; because, as you know, nobody lives forever.  The author is a neurosurgeon , thus a scientist, and did not believe people really had authentic out of body experiences into the heavenly kingdom  but changed his mind when he was escorted there by a heavenly being.<br /><br />I believe that God is allowing us have a glimpse of what is waiting for us at the end of life.
B004SIP7XK|5.0|This movie arrived quick and it perfect condition. The movie was wrapped and unopened. Works great, just as expected. Perfect!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Less ads, more play time. other wise it is fine a little tip here or there on how to win would be nice
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A wonderfully written novel that sweeps you up and away to the Old  South - and it's old customs - both good and bad. A page turner from beginning to end. Captivating characters weave a story that you won't soon forget! Both Lavinia and Belle are triumphant co-heroines!
B0063IH60K|3.0|the layout of the game is masked by your arm as you play,so it is irrritating, enough so I only play a short time
B008Y5OWMK|2.0|critics hated it but what the hell do they know?i found this to be a v.ery good tale of a forgotten part of the history of greed and bigotry in america.
1926778103|5.0|I was a little surprised at all the negative reviews regarding the pages falling out of the book. I'm not much a fan of the actual game, and just interested in the art. All in all a nice book. I suppose I can get detailed info elsewhere.
0061684384|5.0|a great book for tattoo lovers and an incite into Kats life, a great companion to the Tattoo Chronicles so why not get them both, i did!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Written as if by a teenager, the Fifty Shades trilogy is candy for women of all ages. The third book of the trilogy continues to explicitly describe the sex life of Christian Grey and I-can't-even-remember-her-name-she's-so-bland, but now they are married. Whoop-de-doo. And apparently the sex and deep love for one another is still getting better and deepening, which is hard to believe if you have ever been married. However, the novella still can turn you on in quite a dirty way, which hopefully can translate into your own bedroom...
B00571F26Y|4.0|Amazing and scary info/ research by a cardiologist on how man has changed dna of wheat over milleniia so that it is not very compatible for human digestion and causes an array of illnesses.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|It was FAOTD - but I hated it so much I deleted it right away from our Google Nexus tablet.
0882847953|5.0|This book and &#34;Stick Control&#34; are the backbone of rudiment books for percussionists. It is no less than essential that this book be used to learn or tune-up one's understanding of accenting unexpected notes in percussion play.  All of my comments in &#34;Stick Control&#34; apply here. Get this book and after you are have completed your first pass through this book there is no way you wont be a better drummer as a result of your work. Isn't that what it all about.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I love Les Miserables, it is one of my favorite musicals. Which is the reason I got this soundtrack as soon as I saw it. But I was very disappointed to find the case was already cracked when I opened the package. Luckily the CD still worked, but I am nevertheless displeased that the case was already so damaged before I even received it. You can do better Amazon, I know you can!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is app is great for horse lover's train your own and have a blast the graphics are great and never blurry
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordan, I haven't decided yet. I'he read and reread this and I still laugh and 'awes.' Percy Jackson is priceless; Frank is exquisitely done and Hazel is (pardon the pun) golden. Five stars!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an okay game. I play it all the time when I'm bored. and yeah its a kinds fun game
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Gods or Giants? Piper or Reyna? Percy or Jason? Greeks or Romans? Leo or Frank?<br />If you haven't read the other book, this will not be as good as it should. But, please, pick your team, curl up in bed, and get ready to see the wonders of Leo World; wether you hate it or not, you'll find people on your side.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am just going to add to all the other brilliant reviews and say this was awesome! It was very 'real' feeling with very accessible characters.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|All the comic book characters, tv & movie characters, or cartoon characters in the world are not half as entertaining as this group of young people.  Love how they even move forward with characters by bringing in girlfriends.  I don't purchase tv shows, but these are pure entertainment no matter how many times I watch them.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|3 stars out of 5, a decent story, but Howey's writing isn't at the level I expected.<br /><br />SPOILERS WITHIN<br /><br />The story was OK. The meta-plot of the silos and the people in the Silos destroying the outside was a really interesting idea. The first story was awesome, the second story was better. After that, I started feeling like I just wanted to get to the point. I think the writing was what didn't do it for me. The writing didn't really hold my attention. The characters weren't of a depth that I was interested in them. I thought Juliette was okay, but she didn't really do anything except react to the situations that she was placed in. She just sort of understood that what she was doing was right and I felt like it was already supposed to be assumed by me that what she was doing was right. I'm just supposed to \\"get it\\" and I don't feel like she worked it out for herself, really. I would have liked to feel more attachment to her. I would have liked to have all of the characters more fleshed out.<br /><br />All of the situations seemed designed to be cliffhangers that ended up getting resolved easily and I got kind of sick of them. Like when she goes down to fix the pump in Silo 17, but then she loses contact with Solo, then she runs out of air, BUT WAIT there are air bubbles conveniently underneath the staircase. Or when she goes back to Silo 18 and the guy comes out from under the fire blanket, oh no we just lost Lukas, BUT WAIT it wasn't actually Lukas. I felt like these things just happened so that there would be some kind of surprise, but it didn't really feel like anything I cared about was happening at all. And this could really be because I just wanted to get done at the end, so it could be my fault.<br /><br />There are a lot of sci-fi books that I just don't get, Hugh, so I hope you don't feel offended. Others include \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"The Stars my Destination\\", and \\"The Hunger Games\\", sci-fi books people love and say are classics, Ijust didn't enjoy them much.<br /><br />So, overall, I would recommend this, but I don't think it was as good as I expected. I don't regret buying and reading this book. I'm glad I gave Hugh Howey my money and had the chance to read such a highly rated book on Amazon. I'm glad that he is proof that writers can publish their own works. I hope that this is the future of publishing and I wish him well. But I just didn't like this book that much.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|All the comic book characters, tv & movie characters, or cartoon characters in the world are not half as entertaining as this group of young people. Love how they even move forward with characters by bringing in girlfriends. I don't purchase tv shows, but these are pure entertainment no matter how many times I watch them. Keep up the good work!!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I was distressed that the one I purchased didn't work.  It took a bit of work, but when I was able to finally contact customer service, they made it right.  I was a bit surprised that when I came here to edit my original review, to include my updated satisfaction, it had disappeared.  Makes one think.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin weaves the biographies of 5 men with history to tell the story of Lincoln's political life.  More than worth the time it takes to read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Since my Kindle is new I haven't played many games,  what I have has been easy and fun. Looking forward to playing the different tile set-ups.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|awesome movie! I loved the ease of download and streamed it flawlessly to my tv! I really use this service too much...
B0090SI42Y|2.0|It's never good when you can't wait for the movie to end.  I had such high hopes for this movie.  It's really too long and in the end it's boring.  Some of the fight scenes are cool but it ends up just being meh.
0312360266|1.0|This book sucked. I literally hated it. I struggled to get through it. The characters were dumb. Most annoying expression ever: \\"easy peasy.\\" What teenager says that? Everything everyone said in this book was annoying. All the characters made me roll my eyes. Don't read it. It's stupid.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|I use this cable with my 15\\" MacBook Pro with Retina display, which has two Thunderbolt ports. I am in a University setting where I get pervasive wireless coverage, but I prefer the hard-wired connection's speed, the constant connectivity, and the ability to access networked drives. It is expensive but I very happy with its performance.<br /><br />Things I really like about this connector:<br />1. It makes a fast connection. The speed of the data transfer through the connector is a bit hard to gauge in a 'normal' setting since I get almost 100 Mbps on my connection (thus I am not sure I would notice if the connection was slowed some due to the connector).<br />2. The connector is easy to use and mostly unobtrusive (see below). I am able to plug it in and nearly instantaneously have an internet connection. In addition, my internet connection is up and running as soon as I wake my computer up, which is not always the case with my wireless connection. I am particularly pleased with this re-connection speed.<br /><br />I do wish they would have used a slightly more flexible cable though. The cable that connects the computer side (the Thunderbolt connection) and the internet connection (the ethernet connection) side is fairly stiff and it unfortunately does not bend out of the way of other cables very easily. It does not interfere with the power cord at all (that connector is quite small), but if I plug in another thunderbolt connector in the real estate on the left side of my desk gets crowded.<br /><br />A couple other things I have noticed, but that have not yet caused me any problems. The ethernet connection side gets warm during use, though not hot. Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, there is some wiggle room in my Thunderbolt port. I do not think this is this cable's fault I notice the same behavior with the [[ASIN:B009K916ZK Apple Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter MB572Z/B]]. The cable has not yet fallen out, nor has my connection dropped so I do not consider this a significant problem.<br /><br />All in all, the cable works and works well. If you need a hard connection to the internet and have a Thunderbolt port on your Mac, this cable is a fine choice to fit that need!
B0076DELIG|3.0|When I read a series of novels such as these Harry Bosch novels, I find the sense of discovery wanes the further I get into the series.  That often means the first few/several novels of the series are the most enjoyable to read.  I think this is the case for me and The Black Box.  I enjoyed reading it, but it did not interest me as much as many of the previous novels in the serious.<br /><br />Still an okay read, but not as solid as the series as a whole.
0765325950|5.0|Let me start by saying that i am very disapointed in all 1 star ratings because the widow of Robert Jordan wanted to wait 3 months to bring out the kindle edition. Personally I was very pleased with the book, and felt that Brandon did an exelent job bringing this series to a conclusion.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I've read all of them now (I think), so there's little in the way of discovery for me when I pick up a new Reacher novel.  I beleive this can cause me to enjoy the novel less than someone is newer to reading Reacher.<br /><br />Still I plowed through this book in a hurry and enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />Felt like Reacher was more of a thinker than a beater in this one, but that's okay.  Sometimes.
0307956350|3.0|The basis of this story was good but it was very drawn out and did not always keep my attention.<br />I would not recommend this book.
B007RXC3A8|3.0|THIS IS A PRETTY DRASTIC GENRE MOVE FROM PROGRESSIVE TO POWER/80'S METAL SOUND. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT MYSELF BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S LIKE METALLICA WHEN THEY WENT AND MADE THE \\"BLACK ALBUM\\" WHEN THEY WENT FROM A THRASH BAND TO A POWER METAL BAND AT BEST. I LIKE THE BLACK ALBUM. BUT THIS CD IS NOT THE BLACK ALBUM. I LIKE IT, BUT DON'T LOVE IT, AND I HOPE THEY GO BACK TO THEIR MORE PROGRESSIVE ELEMENTS OF PAST CD'S IN THEIR CATALOG.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This one octive keyboard is lots of fun to play with, especially since you can play more than one key at a time just like on a real piano. I love it!
B007V80WUC|5.0|THE SOUND IS DIFFERENT, BUT IT WORKS. BECAUSE THEY RETAINED THERE PROGRESSIVE, HEAVY ELEMENTS BUT ALSO THERE ARE MUCH SOFTER MELODIC MOMENTS, AND IT REALLY WORKS FOR THEM. YES, I ADMIT, IT TOOK 5 LISTENS BEFORE I COULD GET INTO IT. THE TWO CD'S THEY DID WERE BRILLIANT AND LOVED THEM IMMEDIATELY. THIS ONE WAS HARDER TO DIGEST, BUT IN THE END, IT IS ANOTHER CLASSIC CIRCUS MAXIMUS CD AND THERE COMING TO ATLANTA TO CO HEADLINE THE PROGPOWER USA HELD IN SEPTEMBER EACH YEAR IN ATLANTA GEORGIA. I'VE SEEN THIS BAND TWICE, THE FIRST TIME, WAS THE BEST AUDIO SOUNDING BAND I'VE EVER HEARD. THE SECOND TIME, THEY PLAYED A PRE-SHOW ON WEDNESDAY AND THEY PLAYED A MIX OF CRAZY COVER SONGS AND THEN MICHAEL ERICKSON, THE SINGER SANG A SONG FOR CRIMSON GLORY AND HE HURT HIS VOICE AND THEN WHEN THEY CAME ON, THE SINGER WAS OFF. HE WASN'T BAD, JUST NOT AS GREAT. BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE CD AND I'M A HUGE CIRCUS FAN AND ALWAYS WILL BE.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I' m addicted to Angry Birds!!! Please help me!!!! This is the first time I' ve played this game. YEAH!!!
B008NR91NO|4.0|I DON'T MIND TELLING ANYONE THAT I'M A HUGE OLAF THORSON FAN AND HAVE SENT HIM SOME PEDALS AND HE HAS SENT ME SOME THINGS. HE'S A NICE MAN AND EVEN A BETTER GUITARIST/SONGWRITER. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED PREVIOUS VISION DIVINE CD'S BUT IF I WERE TO TELL  OLAF WHAT I FEEL ABOUT THIS, TO ME, IT'S SOUNDS RUSHED. AND I KNOW WHY AS WELL. HE GOT BACK WITH LABYRINITH TO DO A SEQUEL TO \\"HEAVEN'S DENIED PART I\\" AND THEY DID A GOOD CD BUT NOT GREAT, THEN OLAF TOURED, THEN QUIT LABYRINITH AGAIN AND ALL THE SUDDEN THERE WAS A NEW VISION DIVINE CD OUT. THAT WAS REALLY QUICK. ALSO EX-STRATOVARIUS TIMMO TOLKKI, WHO IS NOT THAT NICE OF A GUY, AND I KNOW THIS FIRSTHAND, BUT VISION DIVINE MISSED TIMMO'S PRODUCTION CAUSE OLAF PRODUCED THIS WITH THE KEYBOARD PLAYER. OLAF ALSO CHANGED GEAR AND WENT TO ENGL AMPS AND IBANEZ GUITARS, SO HE SHOULD'VE HAD A BETTER SOUND BUT IT'S NOT. A GOOD CD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE LAST ONE. SORRY OLAF
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have no words to describe this book. It is SO real and the characters are real. I loved every page of it. I loved that there is no fairy tale in this book. I love that there is real strife and struggle. Ms Hoover has quickly become one of my favorite authors. I can't wait for her next book to come out.
B005PK553C|5.0|LOVE THIS!!!  I am so glad I watch this season.  Will def watch the rest of season two and hopefully watch as it goes!
B005QMOZOO|5.0|I choose this book because I love Austens books, and when one of my favorite crime authors write a book with a story based on on of Austens most famous ones, I had to read it.
0345803485|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a very interesting book. It definitely has my attention. However I am not finished reading it. Can not summarize it yet.
B000W91RUG|4.0|Love this show!  Just wish there were more episodes per season.  Looking to get season 2 next.  Great gift for my husband.
0312084986|5.0|We purchased this as a gift for a family member who loves James Herriot books and she was very happy with it. I can remember being read these stories when I was young and reading then over and over again. He was an amazing author and vet. A wonderful gift to you or someone else.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have read many of the DeMille books and really liked most of them.  I was looking forward to this one because of the main character, Detective John  Corey, a character in a couple of other books.  Det. Corey is funny.  However, that being said, this book was not as good as the others.  It takes place in Yemen ( a place I would not care to visit).  It is a fairly quick read.  Read &#34;Plum Island&#34; to get the backstory on John Corey.
1904994768|5.0|This book has all the scores needed for research and to try to advance your own score. We love Twin Galaxies and find their help on this book so wonderfully refreshing.
B00ARN0XGG|4.0|As a fan of the series, I own all 3 of the previous movies and I can say that my money was well spent on the just released 4th installment.  While others may not like the \\"found footage\\" style, I have been hooked on it since I first saw [[ASIN:B000KE5JES The Blair Witch Project]].  It's true some movies filmed that way aren't all that good, but I have never been disappointed by the Paranormal Activity series, and after watching PA4 I am still not disappointed.  In fact, once the credits rolled I was one happy fan.<br /><br />I will admit that this one wasn't as scary as the previous installments, the first movie being the scariest.  However, the creators of the film did a great job by using a certain specific story element of the previous movies and turning it into a completely new source of scare.  It wasn't a cheap kind of scare either, rather this time around the \\"haunted\\" characters of the latest chapter had more to contend with in this film than any of our previous haunted families.  This new element was both thrilling and terrifying at the same time.<br /><br />Now, I do strongly recommend that those watching this movie see the previous three installments first (and in the order of their release).  You really need the context those movies give you in order to enjoy PA4 properly.  I can only imagine how bad this movie might seem without the overall mindset the previous installments provide.<br /><br />4/5 Stars

B005COO1X6|4.0|This was really scary, Have you ever traveled alone and thought of stopping at a vacant run down pull over???? Not after this one. Love it,
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|Excellent!! What a great artist. I have been a long time admirer of JT and this album is definetly a keeper. Go out and buy it now for next Christmas.
B005LAII94|5.0|An awesome action movie with just a touch of mixed up romance! Interesting plot, kept me and my fiance intrigued throughout the entire movie. The cast members couldn't have been better fits for their roles!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I heard some of this on television and decided on that basis to but the CD. It was as good as I had hoped, if not better. Not to be missed. Buy it now!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|So far so good but I could not continue the book until I wrote a review.  I would like to finish a book before I give a review of it.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I got this for a Synology DS1512+ and works pretty well and its a lot cheaper than the Synology RAM module. If you are in the same situation, I highly recommend this module.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|very good game.  Lots of different puzzles to do.  And a challenge.I really enjoyed this one.  Very challenging.  Send more this way.
B008JFLWLE|1.0|it's ok but i have no use for it in advanced algebra try putting this equation into it and u'll see what mean but otherwise its great
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game it is very addicting and it is free. The creators did a great job and should keep it up.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book because it had been chosen this month by my book club.  I have a very mixed opinion on this book.  I loved the plot, liked the characters, yet I positively hated the ending.  I closed the book in disgust.  Many others in the group felt the same way.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Okay, so it's Sherlock Holmes with a modern twist. That said, it is still a good story and Sherlock has many of the quirks that he always has.<br />Watch it - you will like it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I fell in love with the characters.  The author gave them all such depth that you really felt to be a part of their lives.  I found it interesting hearing the conflicting thoughts that gave insight into an abusive partner.  I literally got chills with the final revelations of the book.  I hope the movie lives up to my high expectations after reading this book and falling in love with each of them!
B007R9MFPU|5.0|Aptly titled surprise hit album from much loved Ultravox.  This disc is Ultravox through and through at their best. A pure gem.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|It really only takes one song from Taylor Swift and you will know that  you will love or not her songs.<br /><br />The metaphors are extraordinary, in my humble opinion, and her voice soft and able to hit high notes too.<br /><br />I would recommend this cd to my friends.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I had first heard that this was a book for teens.  I think it has too many murders for children but it is a good story and very easy reading. It is a classic and I was interested in reading it myself.  Much action.  If you like an adventure story this is a good one but a little old fashioned with no sex, only many characters are shot.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|What can I say, 60 years old and still kicking butt with their tunes. Wasn't sorry for this purchase, some new tunes and a few oldies.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The only think about the game is if some thing happens w/your Kindle, your game goes back to zero,  your score doesn't follow you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I wanna tell everybody tht this app is awesome and everybody should get it. I play it everyday and I enjoy it soooooo much and the best part is tht its FREE!!!!!! :) :)
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|This Nerf N-Strike Elite Hail-Fire Blaster is so wrong on so many levels, I was hesitant to give it to my son. However, when he chooses to play with it (which isn't often) he loves it. It's a really cool \\"blaster\\" that shoots soft \\"bullets\\" so quickly, it's thrilling for adults too.<br /><br />The Blaster can hold up to 8 Quick Reload clips--although it only comes with 4 (FOUR), so if you wanted it to work with all it's power, you'd need to go buy 4 more quick reload clips. That is why I took a star off, because I think when you pay the money for this sort of item, you shouldn't have to pay extra to \\"complete\\" it.
1432794426|5.0|Having \\"studied\\" Michael Jackson extensively for a very long time, I do believe I know most of what is to be known about him. This is why I can honestly say that \\"Defending a King\\" is one of the best books about Michael that has ever been written.<br /><br />The book concentrates on Michael's final years, which are the years less known to the public. The book tells many details (some were new to me and many I already knew).<br /><br />But the details are not what is most important in this bool. What I love about it is that it is written with so much love and respect.... a wash of LOVE filled me while reading... a love that felt like coming from Michael himself.<br /><br />Defending a King is not only defending. It is LOVING and honouring not only the king - but Michael, the human being.<br /><br />Thank you Karen Moriarty, for this gem of a book,<br />LOVE<br />Betelgeuse
1419553429|5.0|I did not have time to finish the whole book, I just used the RC section. But it is really helpful! If you are aiming for a 700+score, you should read it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love fruit ninja. it is a really good game.I will rate this game 5 star becouse it's a great game of stradagy
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a very raunchy, funny, weird, and fascinating book.  I never thought I would read a book like this...ever.  It was a good read...I may get part two and part three. It makes you definitely want to spice up your sex life.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book but i was very disappointed that it reall is a suplicate of Racing In The Rain
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I loved Phillip Phillips on American Idol. His cd has proven how good he was on the show and that he deserved the win!
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Bought this for my 6yr old. She loves it. Plays very well on both my kindle fire and kindle fire HD.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a wonderful Series. Am not completely done with this one yet, but<br />I love it all - just like Season 1.<br />I am taping Season 3 on the TV and look forward to Season 4.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Since I like the TV show, I got the CD. Sadly, Fade into You, the best song to come out of the show so far, was NOT on the CD! The CD is enjoyable without the song BUT gets 4 out of 5 stars for the omission.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|As stated above i haven't played much l am at level five.  i have not completely figured it out I'm not sure when i am supposed to due a certain action.  i just guess or due what i want  but it still keeps my attention. i wouldn't call it fun but something to pass the time.
1573222038|5.0|I had read Sarah Waters &#34;Little Stranger&#34; and loved it and the style it was written in. I found &#34;Fingersmiths&#34; at the library and gave it a try. I couldn't put it down! I love the writing style and how Waters paints a vivid picture to the point where you feel like you are along for the ride. The twists and turns will blow you away, so just try and hang on! One of my top ten vavorite books and I read alot!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|So good. Keeps you pop n your brain. I never wanted to put it down. So many surprises and turns.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game and its perfect for kids who dont have horse or cant get a horse its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this wonderful app thinking it might be one of those cheap ones where nothing ddoes anything but talk but it is amazing! the horses do anything a real horse can do. it should be sold for at least $5 because it seems to belong to a game system game.
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|There were tough guys.  It was about money somehow.  People wanting to control and influence others.  Nothing new or inspiring.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|It's a good movie from Microsoft, considering the fact that it is the only movie about Halo made to this day and that teenagers played through the whole movie. It is not bad, like some reviewers claimed, and there was one other person who wrote that anyone could do that movie. It's simply not true. The special effects were surprisingly good, acting was good and not childish or stupid. We even seen aliens, that looked also surprisingly good, even though you couldn't always get a clear look at them. Well done prequel for Halo 4.
1451695195|5.0|This is a great book. Loved it. If your not sure if you believe in heaven, this is the book for you.

B00AMBH70S|5.0|So great movie! I loved it. Matt damon is a bad ace but hey jeremy renner is to hot for school.
B009CGLO3K|4.0|Overall, the film is an intriguing look at the Fairy Tale, however, the end is very flat, like it didn't know what to do next.  If they had created a mystery at the end, I would have looked forward to a sequel.<br /><br />the HD is amazing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Clever...fun ....UN predictable<br />Don't preview<br />Allow for surprises<br />Enjoy the ride<br />° ° ° ° ° ° ° ° °
B009ANP4F4|4.0|I thought it was excellant. I really enjoyed the movie and the plot and how they broke up the story.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I liked the cable and it works fine with my pocket kindle.  It fits in to the port and easily plugs a usb on for fast charging.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Great application for viewing video and flash web sites remotely.  My only complaint would be I would like to see more screen size options.  Doesn't handle 4:3 to 16:19 conversion well with black bars taking up lots of screen real estate on what is already a small mobile device screen.  I would definitely recommend this for remote access to desktop or home machines from a tablet.  Works well over wifi and 3G/4G connections.
B008B68J2G|5.0|Bought this for my niece who loves monster high.  It is absolutely adorable.  Looks like a mini cafe. Any Monster High fan would love this.  Shipped very fast as well.
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|I was hoping against hope that this BR release would show the 16x9 widescreen with black bars in true BR format. Alas, it turns out to be a German vendor rip of a French dvd copy. The quality is poor, certainly does not display BR standard imagery. Again Amazon has failed to screen the product for an accurate assessment of what the customer is buying. This happened to Amazon's offer of \\"The Warlord\\" with Charlton Heston and now this. The rush by some vendors to put a BR label on an old DVD copy is dishonest, and Amazon should take better care to protect its customers from faulty products or dishonest claims from vendors.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought this was great - it kept me guessing at times...although a little far-fetched, but overall cute and an easy read.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I thought at first it was too flimsy (the foldable cover) but, it works on tables and my lap as long as the surface is steady. Bought it for using in class and so far the price seems worth it for the case's use and style. Will see how long I can keep clean the white color down the road.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|A very engaging novel.  The characters are well drawn and interesting, the plot intriguing.  The shifting narrative point of view is very effective in facilitating exploration of the themes.  Just when I thought that I had unraveled the mysteries and secrets there was another twist and turn that urged me to continue reading.  I was interested and entertained from start to finish.  Morton's narrative style is also a winner.  I found her use of language delightful and truly beautiful at times.  She uses words to paint a canvas for the reader.  A pleasure to read such good writing.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I bought this movie for my grandson. He loves,this movie. Seller was great. Delivered on time. No problems at all.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I'm a huge Soundgarden fan, and was a little skeptical of a new cd in 16 years, but this one delivers and more!! Chris Cornell's voice is still as strong as ever and the band rocks hard. Defintely worth it!
B00999DFP0|1.0|Did not receive my order.  I contacted Amazon and they told me my purchase was,lost in transit.  I was,really upset because I should have received the full 5 season of The,Big Bang Theory the day after Christmas.  Had a girls nite party planned. NO DVD's though.  I was not notified, I had to email to find out what happened.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I learned how to play all these songs then I learned other songs I really like this app so does my niece and nephew this is very time consuming especially in the waiting room. I say awesome app totally recommended.
0399160744|5.0|A treat for the eyes that is both amazing and technically perfect.  I have made my own &#34;Slinkachu&#34; scenarios and posted them on Facebook.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun game with good graphics and it's FREE that's the best part. I got this game thinking that I wouldn't like it but then when I played it I loved it. I give this game ten out of five stars.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The book was well written - a little predictable but still some original and thoughtful conclusions.  The characters were well developed and consistent
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I read the first chapter online and was hooked. Alot of characters to keep track of so I had to print them off and can carry them in my new zip up kindle case I bought here also.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I love mahjong, and this is a nice game but i have a little bit of trouble telling some of the pieces apart, there are no numbers or symbols and it makes it difficult to see them as well as i would like.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Wonderful dog story. Man's best friend indeed. As the old saying goes; I hope to live my life as the man my dog thinks I am.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|My girlfriend loves this movie! I thought it's ok as well. It's not my kind of movie but it made her happy so im happy!
B004GJDQT8|1.0|1st it does not install cleanly and clearly on Nexus 7 You have to install Amazon App Store which I did not want?<br />My wish was simple. I wanted the same Amazon shopping app that's on iPhone 4s couldn't get it.and now Amazon ads are popping up everywhere. Uninstalling NOW Yikes
B00A3K2PZA|2.0|I expected a much better acting, directing and story line from these known actors. Nudity is the only thing that kept the movie somewhat interesting.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this, and I have recommended it to others.  Although it was somewhat predictable, I have to admit I didn't see what happened at the very end coming!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I saw the movie first and loved it! While there were some differences from the movie, which were to be expected, the book was funny, and a great story. I thoroughly, enjoyed it! It was very hard to put down.
B005LAJ1HW|4.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift, recipient requested it and has stated he is enjoying watching it. No further info on product.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love it. Great reporting and accuracy for my area.&#12288;So handy to turn on my kindle<br />and know I will have an accurate  report right  at  my  fingertips.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son was playing this on his iPod while waiting for the dentist and I caught a glimpse. When we got home, I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and immediately started playing.  I got through the entire first 150 puzzles in about 48 hours because I couldn't put it down!  Really great, free app!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I stumbled upon this book title while reading an MSN article about how much it costs to lose weight. The article had different slides, each of which showcased different ways people try to lose weight, e.g. gastric bypass, dieting, personal training, etc. and one slide made reference to books people read as guides for weight loss. On the list was Wheat Belly, so I said why not...let me search for it on Amazon and see what it's all about. Well, after reading all the reviews, I was convinced I should buy the book and perhaps try out what Dr. Davis recommends.<br /><br />Needless to say, after reading the book I was in total shock about the impact wheat and wheat products have on overall health. And since I've tried so many workout DVDs, weight loss programs and diets in the past to get back to my ideal weight (135 lbs.), it was pretty easy for me to give this wheat-free lifestyle a try.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that since starting this program on Sunday, January 13, 2013, my whole outlook on food has changed. Additionally, I've had less and less cravings, and when I do have cravings, it's for things like fresh veggies! And the best part of this journey so far is that I've lost 5 lbs after my first week of this program. I now have 10 lbs. to go to reach my goal weight. I ought to add also that I didn't do one single ounce of exercise in my first week, and I was still able to lose 5 lbs!<br /><br />What Dr. Davis says is so true - you automatically end up eating less calories each day when you eliminate weight and limit certain carbs. Packing up on veggies, meat and nuts allows me to feel full all the time and not have those crazy cravings I used to have when I was a Carb Monster!<br /><br />I'll be updating my review as I progress.<br /><br />Jan 22 - I went out on a limb today and had corn tacos for lunch at about 3 p.m. While exercising at 7 p.m., I got the worst headache and instant stomach gripes about 30 minutes into my workout. I've never had those reactionswhen working out, so I can only attribute them to the fact that I had tacos after 1 1/2 weeks of complete elimination of wheat and most processed carbs. No more tacos for me! Definitely isn't worth the bad feelings!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|a lot of fun but i keep messing up which bird does what. any angry bird fan will like it
B007LE2VDM|5.0|Since I first saw Christina in concert she has never disappointed me with a release and this one is certainly no exception. Her voice is beautiful and the songs truly amazing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is fun.it does teach you how to take care of a horse if u want to learn. I think its fun and u should totally get it.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This movie is AWESOME!!! great story and the visual effects are really well done. Watching this movie is a trip on itself but if your into taking psychedelics- this movie is unbelievable!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Fabulous! Loved The first season and just bought the second, third and fourth. I highly recommend it's worth the small price.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love to play but if it were 5.00 not 7.00 it would be the best app in the whole store!
B00AL3KEE8|5.0|This is really something you should acquire if you're a big fan of this movie.  This is an incredible movie soundtrack.  Rarely will I ever buy a cd soundtrack to any movie.  There was so much music I have never heard before on this soundtrack and it all sounded great.  I believe all were played at some point in the movie.  This soundtrack is a real bargain.  Not only do you get great old songs from past movie soundtracks, but also some new music made entirely for the movie. When you open up the cd package and unfold the contents, there should be a movie type poster with Quentin Tarantino.  On the back is a full list of all the songs.  It also has a message by Quentin that some of these are originally downloaded from his own personal record collection.  As if you were actually playing the records yourself and hearing them for the first time, as he said he did.  So there is a personal bond to hearing this collection.  You are hearing for most of these records, how Quentin hears them when he plays them.  So don't expect the recordings to be clear and crisp, but as if you were to hear it played off a record player.  The original music made for the movie are of course new and clear as in any new cd recording.  There is also some dialogue from the movie on this cd.  All are very good and reminds you of the dialogue said in the movie.  The cd also has a little poster booklet on the opposite side of the cd slot.  It is a little booklet of pictures from the characters in the movie.  Not exact reality based replications but designed in a more artistic way as if they were photoshopped.  In all, I was surprised by the quality of this movie soundtrack.  It is not every day you see a collectible movie soundtrack cd.  I call it collectible because I was impressed and I think anyone would be proud to have it.  I would say this is a must own for any fan of the movie and the music from the movie.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Haven't watched the 4th movie on this particular DVD set, but the first three movies played great and looked great.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had not seen the series until this year.  Before watching more of the current season I wanted to catch up on the past.  It is a wonderful protrayal of what I imagine the time was like.  The acting is phenomenal!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|All in all a great book. Very enjoyable and a great way to spend  a after noon with not much to do.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thought this book was very relevant to the times we live in with kids doing unspeakable things at an alarming rate. I feel that it gave a good perspective of what the parents of these kids go through. Conflict and self doubt but none the less unrelenting love regardless of what their child has done. I enjoyed it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book and I could not put it down! I kept hearing about it and wanted to see what all the hype was about. It is definitely a page turner and a good read. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 is because of the ending, I was really disappointed. Maybe she'll write a follow up book that can change the ending.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Hard to hear dialog then would get drowned out by music and sound effects dog dog dog dog dog dog
B008F2AKUA|4.0|Huey and The news embody what the 80's sound was.  Loud, hard, fun, good music!  If you want to experience the eighties this is it.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This is an amazing set. It's been years since we've seen a concert by Led Zeppelin and here it is. Shot at the 02 in England, in 2007, it shows you that Led Zeppelin still is the best rock band ever. And the fact that they are older has no barring on their talent. For years people kept saying Led Zeppelin should just pick a new singer and tour again. NO, No that won't ever do it. Once you see this and watch all of them together again, you understand that it is magic that flows through these men. With John Bonham gone, the other members picked John's son Jason to be their drummer for this one concert, and oh man, he does his Dad proud. Amazing all the way through. Once you have watched this, and then understand they will never perform together again, it makes you sad. This is a DVD I will watch again.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Great graphics, great game play and lots of head scratching. It started off as a simple maze puzzle game but as you progress, then it will begin to introduce other elements like cats, dogs, vacuum and rats. Timing of how the mouse progress through the maze would becomes important
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well written script, and the actors, settings, even to the tiniest deail are superb. Mu husband enjoys this serie as much as I do!
B0058VW36U|5.0|We have a small day care of 12 children.  They love the cut the rope on our kindle and also laptop.
0670020478|5.0|...about this brilliant and charming man's ideas?<br />If you need a true 'wake-me-upper', watch Sir Kenneth on youtube, as he speaks to the issue of real education for our children, especially around imagination, creativity and passion. The books fleshes out stories of people who made their dreams realities.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|I was so excited to read this book, but I soon discovered that the author substituted practical advice with pages and pages of anecdotes. The message is clear...and good, but not the reading style that I enjoy reading.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|The HIGHLANDER is book one in Zoe Saadia's The Rise of the Aztec Series. I like it so much that I already bought the bundle that includes the next three books in the series. This is a story of ancient Mesoamerica and the various cultures within it.<br /><br />The Highlander is a unique young man who travels outside his people's territory in his teens to spy on a much greater culture, one that has great buildings and much more spectacular on the surface than the much more modest tribe that the Highlander is a member. He is both intrigued and repulsed by these Lowlanders, one of whom becomes his best and most trusted friend.<br /><br />It becomes a journey of two friends from enemy cultures who form an unexpected, challenging and enduring friendship. For the Highlander nothing is as it appears to be, not with his family, his people or much of anything else. In the end he must decide to fight beside his friend, fight against his friend or stay out of the brewing battle that is certain to bring much bloodshed.<br /><br />The story also reminds us of women's fate in most past societies, even princesses, as they were too often shuffled off for political reasons at a very young age by their fathers to become the unwilling bride of this or that powerful man. The Highlander is determined to prevent the love of his life from facing this fate.<br /><br />This is a great piece of historical fiction that is well written. It also is well worth the read for those who enjoy a good adventure with romance, secrets, politics and war as a backdrop. I very much enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more of Zoe Saadia's books. Well done!

The in your face, edgy little rocker who’s voice blew anyone who listened away, is true to form and belts it out in this album.  From this album on, Avril became the very thing she stood against… just another media driven pop singer.

B004GXZ69W|5.0|My company bought me one of these ergo mouses to try and I loved it so much that I bought one for home.<br />The small is basically for female hands. My fiance thinks it is too small and doesn't like it. He probably would need the regular size. Actually, the one I have at work is the regular size - and I got the small one 'cause it's just a little large feeling sometimes as my finger tips don't reach the end of the mouse keys and the base is slightly bigger. So for most people the regular size will be fine. The regular size is more neutral with silver buttons and the small has the mouse buttons in a lavender sort of color. It's pleasant and not overly girly.<br /><br />You can customize the buttons if you like. If not, then the bottom most button is right click and top is left click.<br />It does take some getting used to. But you're &#34;supposed&#34; to mouse with your forearm and not your wrist...blah blah. So, it forces you to be in a better position. Since I started using these mouses at home (I play a lot of video games at home) and at work where I use my mouse a lot - my wrist pain and most of my hand/finger pain has gone away.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie adaptation did not touch my heart the same way the book \\"The Silver Linings Playbook\\" did.  But I still find myself giving it five stars because its occasionally noticeable flaws are outshone by its virtues.<br /><br />The protagonist is Pat. He's a former high school history teacher and coach (as well as a bipolar disorder sufferer) who went a bit crazy after \\"something\\" went wrong with his marriage. That something landed him in a mental hospital as part of a plea bargain. We meet him the day his doting and loving mother gets him discharged from the facility. Pat is touchingly and sometimes even maddeningly naive about the chances of renewing his marriage with his wife Nikki. Like many people (including me), he's been conditioned by Hollywood and popular culture to expect a happy ending to the \\"movie\\" his life seems to be to him.<br /><br />But Pat should have remembered that sometimes the happy ending that you think you want is not the ending you are going to get and the one you get is much better than the one you want. The \\"twist\\" in his life-movie plot comes in the form of a young widow named Tiffany who is struggling to overcome her own personal demons. Somehow, grudgingly, Pat becomes friends with her and then something more along the way...I won't say more than that, except to say the story has an immensely uplifting ending that put a smile on my face.<br /><br />This odd love story unfolds in Philadelphia and against the backdrop of the NFL season. Pat, like his brother and father, is a rabid Eagles fan and a great deal of the story delves in what that means to love a team so much. Suffice to say that even though I'm from Washington DC (go Redskins!) it made me want to go see the Eagles play and root for them to be part of the Eagles fandom brotherhood for just a moment (so long as it wasn't a game with the Redskins).<br /><br />There are three things about this story that stand out to me as being particularly praise-worthy.<br /><br />1.  Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely luminous as Tiffany.  She may have been a bit young to play the role of someone who was in their mid-to-late 20s, but she was so beautiful, sad, and compelling, I was more than willing to suspend disbelief on that part (and besides some people do look much younger than their actual ages...and a thirty-five year old being involved with a 21 year old may be uncommon but it's hardly deviant).<br /><br />2. Dr. \\"Cliff\\" Patel (Pat's therapist) is a great supporting character...especially when he reveals that he too is an ardent Eagles fan.<br /><br />3. The depiction of serious mental illness like that Pat suffers (and to a lesser extent Tiffany) is not sugar-coated but not portrayed in an ugly way that might repel the viewer. The scene where Pat has a major episode and winds up scuffling with his parents is well done and heart-breaking.<br /><br />So how did the movie and novel differ from each other?<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />I think most of the changes were driven by the need to keep the story moving along and prevent the movie from getting too long.  I only think the ones that made the movie a little less compelling than the book were items 1, 2, 3, and 4 below.<br /><br />1.  The movie ended with the Tiffany and Pat professing their love for each other at the end of the dance competition, instead of lying down on a snowy field to watch for clouds and saying that they needed each other (vice \\"loved\\").  I actually liked the book ending better, but I suppose the movie had a more Hollywood ending simply because Hollywood knows what sells.<br /><br />2.  Nikki did not come to the dance recital in the book, but Pat did have his brother drive him past the house where she was living with her new husband and family and seeing them happy, Pat realized his marriage was truly over and that he didn't want to bother or bother with Nikki anymore.  I think that would have made a better resolution than what the movie did.<br /><br />3.  Pat's family was not Italian-American in the book.  I didn't mind this change, but I wished that they had played down the \\"lovable noisy Italian American family\\" cliche some.  All the people yelling at each other got slightly annoying.<br /><br />4.  Pat exchanged more letters with what he thought was his wife Nikki in the book and contrary to the movie, he did not find out that the letters were fake until Tiffany told him they were.  These letters and the ones Tiffany wrote him under her own name shed a lot of useful light on Tiffany and how she felt about Pat.<br /><br />5.  Pat and Tiffany did not go to the beach with their friends in the movie.<br /><br />6.  Pat's father in the book did not have his own problems with low level OCD but was simply somewhat withdrawn from his family although he did love Pat and his wife.<br /><br />7.  The Eagles games featured more prominently in the book.<br /><br />8.  Pat's father was not a bookie in the book and did not make any bets about the outcome of the game with the Cowboys or the dance competition with his friend.<br /><br />9.  The dance that Pat and Tiffany did in the book was more a modern dance than ballroom, and they did better in the book than the movie.<br /><br />10.  The scene in the book where Pat got in a fight at an Eagles game was somewhat different than what the movie showed.  Pat did not get arrested.<br /><br />11.  Pat did not get mugged and his leg broken in the movie like he did in the book.<br /><br />12.  They used different songs in the movie and book as the song from Pat and Nikki's wedding that was playing when he caught his wife cheating on him.<br /><br />13.  Pat's mother did not go \\"on strike\\" to try to change Pat's father's behavior in the movie like she did in the book.<br /><br />14.  Unlike in the book, Pat did not blot out the reason why he wound up in a mental hospital in the movie.<br /><br />15.  Pat was in the mental hospital for four years in the book and was hazy about how long he had been there (somewhat deliberately).  In the movie, he had been away for eight months and knew that.<br /><br />16.  While the movie showed Pat as working hard to lose weight and get in great shape for the sake his hoped for reunion with Nikki, it was not done to quite the same degree as in the book.<br /><br />&lt;end spoilers><br /><br />So I would say see the movie and read the book...both are worthwhile, but it's the book that will stay with me more.<br /><br />Finally, those who like this book/movie probably will like \\"Ordinary People,\\" another story that also deals with family tragedy and mental illness but is similarly uplifting with some romantic elements.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0140065172 Ordinary People]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0018RE7GM Ordinary People]]as not Italian-American in the book.

B007WPM7SO|4.0|Really liked this movie, great acting.  I read the book a long time ago and loved to see it come to life.
0374533571|5.0|...by which I mean that so much \\"literature\\" is drab, gray, lifeless, or sad (like the narrator of this novel notes himself).  \\"The Silver Linings Playbook\\" is none of that.  It's an uplifting story about two people recovering from tragedies that broke them and finding love in the process.<br /><br />The narrator and protagonist is Pat.

They are very disrespectful into the Art of BDSM. That book is so vanilla its quite comical. A mindless sapranacious plevian wrote this and is very immature if you were to ask me. If you want to read real dark erotica the true true blue fifty shades of grey not crap read Anne Rice's Erotica (Yes Ladies and Gents the same woman who brought you the vampire chronicles and the Witches) talk about hot and steamy tales ohhh my my my it will make you think of very very naughty thoughts and shift in your seat.

B002ZG9940|5.0|The entire drama of this film rests on two words, \\"Mr. Butterfly.\\" We must be vigilant to realize that once, and only once, they are spoken by the wrong person. They cause the entire film and all of its relationships to rotate. I felt exaltation at this detail. It is so rare to see a film this carefully crafted, this patiently assembled like a weapon, that when the word comes it strikes like a clap of thunder. A lesser film would have underscored it with a shock chord, punctuated it with a sudden zoom, or cut to a shocked close up. \\"The American\\" is too cool to do that. Too Zen, if you will.<br /><br />\\"The American\\" allows George Clooney to play a man as starkly defined as a samurai. His fatal flaw, as it must be for any samurai, is love. Other than that, the American is perfect: Sealed, impervious and expert, with a focus so narrow it is defined only by his skills and his master. Here is a gripping film with the focus of a Japanese drama, an impenetrable character to equal Alain Delon's in \\"Le Samourai,\\" by Jean-Pierre Melville.<br /><br />Clooney plays a character named Jack, or perhaps Edward. He is one of those people who can assemble mechanical parts by feel and instinct, so inborn is his skill. His job is creating specialized weapons for specialized murders. He works for Pavel (Johan Leysen, who looks like Scott Glenn left to dry in the sun). Actually, we might say he \\"serves\\" Pavel, because he accepts his commands without question, giving him a samurai's loyalty.<br /><br />Pavel assigns him a job. It involves meeting a woman named Mathilde (Thekla Reuten) in Italy. They meet in a public place, where she carries a paper folded under her arm--the classic tell in spy movies. Their conversation begins with one word: \\"Range?\\" It involves only the specifications of the desired weapon. No discussion of purpose, cost, anything.<br /><br />He thinks to find a room in a small Italian hilltop village, but it doesn't feel right. He finds another. We know from the film's shocking opening scene that people want to kill him. In the second village, he meets the fleshy local priest, Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli). Through him he meets the local mechanic, walks into his shop, and finds all the parts he needs to build a custom silencer.<br /><br />In the village he also finds a whore, Clara (Violante Placido), who works in a bordello we are surprised to find such a village can support. Jack or Edward lives alone, does push-ups, drinks coffee in cafes, assembles the weapon. And so on. His telephone conversations with Pavel are terse. He finds people beginning to follow him and try to kill him.<br />The director is a Dutchman named Anton Corbijn, known to me for \\"Control\\" (2007), the story of Ian Curtis, lead singer of Joy Division, a suicide at 23. Corbin has otherwise made mostly music videos. Here he paints an idyllic Italian countryside as lyrical as his dialogue is taciturn. There is not a wrong shot. Every performance is tightly controlled. Clooney is in complete command of his effect. He sometimes seems to be chewing a very small piece of gum, or perhaps his tongue.<br /><br />His weakness is love. Clara, the prostitute, should not be trusted. We sense he uses prostitutes because he made a mistake in the relationship that opens the film. In his business he cannot trust anybody. But perhaps Clara is different. Do not assume from what I've written that she isn't different. It is very possible. The film ends like a clockwork mechanism arriving at its final, clarifying tick.<br /> Roger Eberts shocking opening scene that people want to kill him.

B0086T77MG|5.0|Love what they did with this season! It picks up right where the first season left off, as far as the story line goes of course. But even more the quality of the second season is every bit as good as the first. Love what Cumberbatch and Freeman have done with Holmes and Watson. Simply brilliant! This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys quality entertainment and storytelling. I wrote in my review for the first season that two would simply not be enough...I believe I may have understated my point. I am more than eager to see the next season!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love it, sad the season is almost over! I really hope there will be another season coming soon! Jessica Lange deserves an award for her performance.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Love what Cumberbatch and Freeman have done with Holmes and Watson. Simply brilliant! This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys quality entertainment and storytelling. I watched the entire season in two days...simply could not get enough. I can already tell you that two seasons will not be enough. We will need more very, very soon!

The size and number of compartments make this a great bag for carrying a camera and all of it's accessories around while out on vacation without much bulk. It held up well, although the strings on the front aren't really made to hold anything, and their layout is strange. Other than that--a great, great bag!

B008DM4OTA|5.0|my daughter loved it and it challenged her to think critically to solve problems herself but its nothing so advanced a 4 year old cannot figure out.  Awesome app!
B000002N2Z|4.0|In my opinion, it's not the best in the Deftones catalog, but is a good CD to have in your collection. If you need to complete the Deftones catalog, that is.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome!! Once you get the hang of it you just can't stop! I was playing for over an hour my very first time in the game. What a brain teaser!<br />Love it!!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This game was great until I had to pay to go any further. Nice graphics. download slow but didn't crash. takes a lot of space. cjh
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it just got it but it is very fun and easy to learn how to play. even my 4 yr old can play this. it is very realistic and great graphics.
B000063UR2|5.0|goes perfect with the Lord of Darkness figurine I bought for my daughter... I DON'T WANT TO GIVE SEVEN MORE WORDS!!!  IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT YOU HAVE A MINIMUM FOR THE NUMBER OF WORDS THAT I USE IN MY REVIEW OF A PRODUCT !!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have always enjoy (more than one story going on at the same time) Tom Clancy is very good at not looseing you when he moves from plot to plot.
B003K5ZQGU|3.0|I wanted to see this because I really like Emily Blunt. She does a nice job with what she has to work with, but the script and directing we're ho-hum.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I love horses but so far this is the best way to play with your own. It free and fun so try it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The video had a couple of minor skips in it, annoying but not a deal breaker. As to the series itself,  there is no better way to pass the time... Delightful!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son showed me this game...I'm hooked...not very good at it and it can be frustrating, but I really enjoy playing it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved how you where in the confused conversation in Kevin's head.  New look on thing how people can be crazy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a really fun game although it took me a while to work out the 8 level.  Good graphics and challenging in the later levels. Definitely a must have!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked this story, but it did resemble &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; a little.  Will make a good romantic movie!
0425263908|3.0|Story almost mirrored Fifty Shades of Grey.  Didn't offer the same thrill and passion because story line followed too much the same as Ana and Christian's story.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|It is absolutely incredible how the franchise has been re-created!!  Great special effects and incredible plot that will surely be the start of a new era!!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Thought that this was supposed to be a comedy - Vulgur and offensive with almost no comedy - do not recommend
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|And I am already in love with the new season of Downtown Abbey. Very interested to see where the estate will end up!
B0045XGRQE|4.0|If you love Iron Man you will love this film.  Acting is top notch.  Action scenes are great and NOT over the top as in some SyFy movies...I would have given it a 5 stars, but I reserve that for films like Argo, Flight, Lincoln...BUT 4 stars is a B+ in my book.<br />See it.!!
B0016JBCJW|5.0|My only regret is how long it took me to see the film. I loved the story, and the chemistry between Wilson, Brody, and Schwartzman is great.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|This is my third favorite among Audrey Hepburn films.  First is Roman Holiday and the second is My Fair Lady.  But playing the part of Holly Golightly (Truman Capote's unique creation) in Breakfast at Tiffany's is I think Audrey Hepburn's most challenging role.  Her character is subtle and complex while George Axerod's excellent script and Blake Edwards's fine direction require a wide range of expression.  Her performance is for the most part outstanding and certainly captivating as is usual with Miss Hepburn.  There are moments of pure delight as when she sings \\"Moon River\\" sitting on her window sill on the fire escape and then looks up and sees \\"Fred\\" AKA Paul (George Peppard) and smiles that very winning smile at him.  Ah, to have Audrey Hepburn smile at you!<br /><br />I also loved the scene when she enters Fred's apartment and lets him know she has figured everything out and then asks to snuggle with him and puts her head on his chest so sweetly, like the innocent little girl she once was.<br /><br />But of course Holly Golightly is not innocent.  She is a poseur, a fake, or as Berman puts it, \\"a real phony.\\"  She is the kind of poseur you meet in any big city, a quasi-sophisticate who, like the real life Paris Hilton, is more or less famous or well known for being famous or well known.  She is also...well, perish the thought, but she makes a living by taking advantage of men, or like a geisha by entertaining them.  I read somewhere that Marilyn Monroe turned down the part of Holly Golightly because she or her agent felt that playing a prostitute would not be good for her career!  The way Audrey Hepburn plays the part, and indeed the very character of the real-life Audrey Hepburn herself, precludes any thought that Capote's upscale big city waif could be anything so crass as a prostitute!<br /><br />This is of course a love story, a romantic comedy and a splendid one.  Paul \\"Fred\\" Varjak is a writer being kept by 2-E (Patricia Neal in an unattractive role that she should have turned down).  Paul is at the stage of his career when he begins to falter and lose confidence in his ability, and--as Holly notices--fails to even have a ribbon in his typewriter.  He has become a poseur himself, a man posing as a writer who is really just a gigolo.  It is part of the magic of the script that one can hope that somehow his love for Holly will inspire him to regain confidence in his ability as a writer and allow him to throw off the shackles of being kept by an older woman.<br /><br />Miss Golightly herself has other plans.  She wants to marry a millionaire and live happily ever after.  She has a beloved brother (the real Fred) who will be getting out of the army soon.  He is a little bit slow and probably will not be able to take care of himself.  She believes that if she marries well she will be able to take care of him.  But in truth Holly Golightly is in escape from her past, from being the country girl Lula Mae who married an older man when she was 14-years-old.  She ran away from the country and hid in the city.  She wouldn't be the first.  She never wants to test herself; she will not fall in love.  She subsists on a diet of \\"rats and super rats\\" and finally on a \\"scared little mouse\\" and none of them make for a good subsistence.  Can't she see that she needs to love and to allow herself to be loved?<br /><br />Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi, a buck-toothed Japanese man, is a hoot and holler and amazingly transformed.  Also  stealing a few scenes from Audrey Hepburn (if that's possible) is \\"cat,\\" or as I understand, several orange tabby cats who play the part of Golightly's cat who has no name and is only called \\"cat.\\"  (Obviously she hadn't read T.S. Eliot's poem on \\"The Naming of Cats\\" otherwise she would know, as all cat lovers know, that every cat must have at least two different names.)<br /><br />Okay, for the fun of it, here's a speculation on a theme that may someday become a PhD dissertation at some place like UCLA or USC:<br /><br />Was Holly Golightly a kind of Truman Capote alter ego, a kind of person he would have liked to have been, perhaps the object of the desire of the man that Truman Capote wanted to attract?  Perhaps Holly Golightly is the soul mate of George Peppard's character.  It is interesting to analyze or attempt to analyze Breakfast at Tiffany's in terms of Truman Capote's psyche.  It's almost impossible to think about her character without thinking about him.  Perhaps it is better to just experience the character of Holly Golightly without the realization that she is the creation of Truman Capote.  Knowing who Truman Capote was forces us to think about Holly Golightly in a way we would not if she had been the creation of someone what was not gay.  One thinks of Elton John's tribute to Marilyn Monroe in his song \\"Candle in the Wind\\" and wonders if being a gay man somehow gives one a unique sense about women.  Instead of seeing women as objects of desire as heterosexual men do, perhaps Truman Capote and Elton John are able to see woman in a more objective sense.  Not entirely objective of course, but in a way that allows them to appreciate the woman in a way not colored by sexual desire.  One might say that other women should be able to also achieve such a perspective, but their view may be clouded by competitive feelings or by a jealous distinctly different than something Truman Capote or Elton John might feel.<br /><br />Or perhaps the story is just an elaborate joke that Truman Capote played on the world.<br /><br />At any rate the bottom line is that Breakfast at Tiffany's is a totally original, sweet and delightful romantic comedy with all the fluff we expect in a romantic comedy with only a hint of the stark realism of the world.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\"SC:<br /><br />Was Holly Golightly a kind of Truman Capote alter ego, a kind of person he would have liked to have been, perhaps the object of the desire of the man that Truman Capote wanted to attract?

B009157BWU|5.0|This movie is so good!!!. It moved me to tears. I would recommend that you rent this one. It shows the how a young chimp is raised by another chimp who does not know the young chimp at all.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this show. Even have my brother hooked on it :-) He had to download his own copy with amazon!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|this book was totally awesome i could not put it down and stop reading<br />i recommend this whole series to read
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I read a great deal of spiritual, psychological and medical material and this book intersects all 3 topics in most enlightened way.  Anyone who wants to grow personally would find this book valuable. I know it is not a new book was the material is still fresh. Have reread it several times skimming via my kindle highlights to ponder the concepts.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|Season 2 was funny. I do enjoy this show. Good characters make almost any show good, and this is no different
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been looking for a game like this ever since I got my kindle, and now i'm thrilled to have finally found it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I honestly loved this book it was so touching and I'm seeing the movie with some of my friends on Valentine's day.
B00A757EFW|2.0|PAC-MAN-LITE<br />The game is too difficult to maneuver, at least on the Kindle Fire.  I cannot manage to get him around the corners fast enough.<br />I grew up with this game and was pretty darn good at it.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|It's a great game that you can easily get lose track of time when creating the park and then managing all the rides.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|This is a well built rig. Surprised at the quality. I have bought several other el cheapo brands. Going to purchase a couple more of these for friends.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Enya's music is always so relaxing and smooth. I just love her style and she didn't disappoint in this winter album.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game.  I play it everyday and I never get tired of it.  It's just a really fun game!
B0027MJU00|4.0|This book was very well written.  The author never lets you get to comfortable in an idea before springing another surprise at you.  This novel kept me interested and totally in the moment. I'll be thinking about this story for awhile.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was a page-turner with a lot of hidden surprises! finished in a day and a half! A good read on these cold days.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|Love this album! Totally worth it. If you like ready or not, you will probably like several others on this album!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham steers you from one direction to another.I can just see them plotting there exit from jail and dreaming of the gold and Islands.Making up for the tome in jail.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Lots of bullets, very little in the way of character development or plot. If you are looking for just pure shoot'em up action, I suppose this movie hits the mark.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Came on time and looked great! Still wrapped in plastic! At a decent price, too.  Very satisfied with this purchase!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I was very suprised by the quickness of delivery, it only took four days and the shipment was in great shape as expected. Thank you for your great service.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|This book drew me in right away and I thought the author did an excellent job of character development.  I like the way the main character went back to examine his past and the flashbacks also caused me to do some \\"reflection\\" myself as I was reading. I figured out the killer just before it became evident in the book, but there was a surprise I had not expected. A thoroughly enjoyable read, even on a dark subject.
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|Have collected every one of Streisand cd's or dvd's<br />Can't live without them, such a great entertainer.<br />Will love this as much as rest of collection
B006TF6WAM|5.0|It is an unlikely story, but delves into the beauty of simplicity! The message of care, friendship and love reminds one to appreciate others. Harold's ever present humility is a lesson to us all!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Breath of fresh air, dynamic,  realistically incredible! I'm awestruck, it leaves y o u speechless and craving for more. A must read!!!!!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Not as Tim Burton creepy as I expected. I laughed and loved it. The mix of characters was amazing and the underlying lesson about science was expertly weaved.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I am disappointed cause I loaded this for my 5 Year granddaughter and she cant play it.  I was hoping it would be like the one we have on the pc where is can do games, puzzles etc. This is not for a young child.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this case for the kindle fire hd. The price was reasonable, by comparison to &#34;kindle&#34; brand products, but yet if fit my kindle fire hd 7 inch perfectly.  I wanted a way to prop up the kindle to watch videos or view recipes as I cook, and this works great. It never falls down.  The only issue I have with it is that you need to position the kindle with the camera on the bottom in order to have access to the charging ports when the case is closed. This means that for some games it has to be rotated the other way, not able to stand up.  It's a small issue for me, but worth mentioning. Maybe a cut-out for the charging cables might help with this?
B0026IWNZ4|1.0|I tried probably 8 times! i love this movie! i was really upset. I made popcorn and was all set with a cozy blanket and then i was heart broken, I followed all the directions! I even tried disconnecting and reconnecting my internet nothing helped. I guess I ll be sticking to dvds from now on.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I love Johnny Depp, Tim Burton and Chloë Grace Moretz. But this movie was odd and didn't seem well put together. I just think it could have been done better and the plot much improved. I love Johnnys character and the witty humor but I can't overlook the horrible plot in this one. And much as I would like to say I loved this film, I didn't.
B00319ECGK|2.0|I had the DVD version which I lent to a friend and it was never returned. Seeing as this is one of my favorite movies and having a bluray player now, I bought the Bluray version expecting that the Bluray video transfer would result in a new viewing experience. I was disappointed on 2 fronts. 1. Video quality: I could not tell that this had any improvement in definition over the standard 480 DVD resolution. There appeared to be quite a bit of noise in the dark portions of the screen which is usually what I see when viewing a 480 resolution DVD. 2. Audio options. Besides language options, there are no other audio options (ie dolby 5.1 vs DTS etc.). So it seems to be a pretty stripped down render overall.<br />Not sure if other bluray versions of the movie are better, but the one I bought was disappointing. Not the enhanced high definition experience that some of the other reviewers have commented on.<br />Doesn't change the fact that this movie is one of the best sci fi movies ever made, though!
B0060D2WYI|5.0|I hear people complaining its creepy and that it scares kids but for me as a kid i loved this movie. So much that as an adult i've been trying to find it for years on dvd. Instead I found a digital version which is even better! To those of you who think that this movie is scary you have to remember the people who grew up with it are generally the same people who grew up with even more gruesome shows like Ahh! Real Monsters and Ren and Stimpy. Overall a wonderful buy and I'm very happy to finally have a copy of The Return to Oz.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Absolutely Amazing! I didn't think this book would effect me the way it did. This is a must read! Loved it!
1452110581|5.0|...but even I am tempted to pee on this book.  It's great!  Funny, good photos; it will make any cat lady, cat hoarder,  cat fan and cat happy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of my favorite shows!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!  Would recommend to every one....truly delightful show!!! I never thought I would be watching PBS!!!!
B004SIP71M|5.0|Arrived nicely packaged, plays perfectly, and is a good movie with excellent actors.<br />Arrived on time, price can't be beat.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I love this album! And it was so easy to purchase the mp3 & it automatically loaded in my amazon cloud in about 1 minute. :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book. was so. incredibly. awesome.  BUY IT NOW. Do you need to be convinced why first? ok.<br /><br />I really enjoyed her first two books \\"Slammed\\" and \\"Point of..\\" - I purchased Hopeless as soon as it was available and made sure I had a solid day set aside to read it because I had a hunch that this would be a \\"can't put it down.\\" Well. I was right.  I went the entire night- 0 (zero) hours of sleep until the next morning- I laughed. I cried. I fell in love. I held my breathe. My heart broke. My heart healed. This book is INCREDIBLE. No wonder it is a NY Times Bestseller, Amazon Bestseller, No. 1 on Goodreads.....<br /><br />When I was done, I purchased this book for a friend of mine- and sent it overnight (Amazon Prime 3.99 shipping)so that she could read and we could discuss these characters immediately.<br /><br />Finally- the author won my heart forever by including hotline and websites for both suicide and child abuse help groups in the back after the last chapter- both concepts that are dealt with throughout the novel.<br /><br />Hoover got every detail of this book perfect. perfect. the dissociation (\\"forgetting things\\" and blanking out after a tragic event). the suicidial intent. the anger. the isolation. the anxst. every feeling to the \\"T\\" of a survivor of suicide (S.O.S - or otherwords the people left behind after someone you love kills themselves). the \\"mom\\" on the run. the bullying. the hexing. the joys and hatreds of highschool. the profile of a childii abused. everything was so perfect and perfectly wrtitten. The story was breathcatching and page turning. The story was wrapped up nicely (with no to be continued or let's see what happens in the next book nonsense).  Just.... it was amazing.<br /><br />Adult themes<br />Strong language. sexual situations/scenes (is NOT erotica). intense and emotional topics.<br /><br />\\"They remind me of me, and everything I've had to overcome to get to this point in my life. And while I could sit here and feel sorry for myself, wondering why all of this happened to me... I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to wish for a perfect life. The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down. I'm choosing to stand up taller. I'll probably get knocked down a few more times before this life is through with me, but I can guarantee you I'll never stay on the ground.\\"<br />~ Hopeless, Colleen Hoovery for myself, wondering why all of this happened to me...

B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I'm not a sci fi nerd or anything (ok, maybe I am...a little), but the ending didn't make much sense, even to me. Without giving anything away, let's just say that the end basically negates the entire movie. Otherwise, it was a neat idea with pretty sound acting. JGL NAILED Bruce Willis.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|My oldest wanted to read it and I like to read what they are reading.  Looking forward to seeing the movie with my daughter.
0761169431|4.0|I got this book for my 10 year old son, who loves the Oragami Yoda series. I thought he would like making other Star Wars figures. The Oragami in this book is a little advanced for a beginner, but with a little practice the figures emerge with ease.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is definitely worth reading but I felt the ending was not the best and was sort of disappointing! Shift between characters gave a great insight as to what was going on in terms of foreshadowing. Great read for the beach or cold weekend by the fire- a bit fluffy.
B001E45XT4|4.0|The headphones work really well and can get loud enough that you dont even have to wear them on your ears if you don't. I wanted a mic that could pick up more noise so I can whisper and it be heard - but works nicely.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|what a personal and tragic childhood Jaycee went through. Very glad she is home now with her family.<br />Very graphic story.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very Quick service and the right product.  would recommend this company to others.  Over all agood product for the price.

B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I didn't even begin to like the characters, no reason to.  No reason to keep watching a bunch of people get shot.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I really, really like this show. I find the family interactions funny and great to watch. It is nice to see some of the same feelings and emotions I feel shown in a humorous way - making life easier to handle.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|So I bought this for my sister for Christmas and now have spent time watching this with her.<br />GREAT SHOW!
B003NX6ZDC|4.0|Listening to Brandon Flowers sing is very soothing. I look forward to more of his work as a member of The Killers and a soloist.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Delivered right on time as expected.<br />Purchased for a gift...my Mom couldn't stop talking about this.<br />The film has great reviews too.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Like all seasons of Dexter, this season drew me in and wanting to see more. I love watching the emotionally stunted Dexter trying to deal with 'normal' life.
B000ZNRBK4|4.0|I like it excellent delivery. More convenient to use and I would like to suggest my friends and relatives to buy.
B001N3GUIE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the graphics of this movie. Also, I was better able to like and appreciate the story and characters as an adult since the last time I saw this movie was in my childhood. I recommend it to any science fiction fans.
B00A17AD36|5.0|See the written review I've given for the single and it's ditto for the album/cd.  Thanks for the fast download.
B0093LFENA|4.0|I find this album entertaining. I really like the songs with some being listened more to than others. Good work by Robbie Williams.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|it's fun to play,but the game does crash when trying to fight other people online sometimes. sometimes the game will roll back in time, and every thing you did is no longer there.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|Continuing the saga of Dexter, Season 3 brings you closer to understanding the inner workings of the mind of a beloved serial killer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such an insightful book. I loved the writing style. It's hilarious and so sweet at the same time. Definitely a boom to read repeatedly.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Lacked good acting,solid story line.  Graphics poor. Proof that even action movies need strong cast, and good story line w/ kick*ss graphics
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Kind of a waste if time but : now one thing. So not use all the gems<br />Hhhhhhhhhhhh high b h h h h h h h
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|The game is very entertaining but when you purchase a new pack for ninety nine cents, the levels should be harder. Other wise the game is fun for all ages!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I didn't think it would draw me in but once you start and get past the easy levels it's fun.  I find myself shaking my kindle fire to try to get coins and prizes to fall into my area.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun and is so addicting. It's so much fun. I love this app and I can't stop playing it.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This second season series got better, had to get used to this new actor who took Andy's spot after he passed away between season 1 and 2.. I like him, can't wait for &#34;War of the Damned!&#34;
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Great movie for Christmas! Great humor and a fun twist on the traditional tale. Perfect for Christmas Eve traditions! We love it!
B009MO57H6|5.0|me, a big fan of this series I always find this entertaining and FUN!! I loved the first fight series Milla (Alice) has with the Undead and she uses the chain/lock in a spectacular fantabulous way of dealing with keeping the undead away from her! Great to see Michelle Rodriguez and Sienna Guillory again (both HOT as hell)! Can't wait for the next one!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I don't watch a lot of TV, and I'm very selective when I do. This series is so well written and the photography is brilliant. It's not over the top or made simply to shock, this has a great story line and keeps you coming back for more!
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Was a very cute movie. I would recommend it to anyone. A lot of good foreign films out there to watch.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This is one of those movies that have lots of little quirky things going on that make it delightful if you're observant.  Even if you need to be hit over the head with a joke, this movie has lots of those too.  Steve Carrell is great, characters are cute and likeable, story is interesting.  Nice, feel good movie for the whole family.
0064430227|5.0|My daughter love it, and she wants me to repeat reading the story to her<br /><br />She likes Harold drawings and they became real.<br /><br />She loves the balloon.
B002W7H3EA|4.0|Watched this with the kids and even they liked it.  Cary Grant is great in this Hitchcock classic.  Only thing I did not like was the very ending which I felt was abrupt.  Not scary, but good story.  You might want to pause it every so often to explain what is going on for the younger ones.

B008XBASVY|5.0|This book was a joy to read. It metaphorically provided a sort of comical relief from my own dysfunctional high school, similar to that of the protagonist. It was an addicting story, and it made me burst out in laughter when I was surrounded by the proximity of my own desolate bedroom walls. I adore this book. Props to Chris Colfer.

B000Q66JXA|1.0|Being a fan of Merlin, and The Mists of Avalon, I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  How disappointed I was with it. Even with extensive knowledge of King Arthur, I found the story line hard to follow!  It appeared that the 'actors' were reading from cue cards, the 'acting' itself was fragmented, and the entire story disjointed. I kept waiting for the story to become more interesting, and at several points I was tempted to turn the movie off.  I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone who has a love of King Arthur.  If this is your first movie of that genre, don't bother - you won't even understand the lore.

B00B19DMUE|5.0|The scariest movie I've seen in years! I'm going to have to watch it again and again! Highly recommended, but not for the squeamish!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This is like no other book I've read, a farce but with plenty of commentary to insult almost all in our society. One can only imagine what other innovative creations Toole might have given us had he lived longer. This book is NOT a beautiful creation but rather a critical vision of what we are through some hilarious characters the author develops in the book.  I highly recommend &#34;A Confederacy of Dunces&#34;.
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|This was an outstanding film.  The acting, directing, and story were great.  It was EXTREMELY emotional, but beware...<br />IT WAS DEFINITLY THE SADEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Be sure to set aside everything and spend an entire afternoon or late night wrapped up in this captivating story of a love gone wrong and the mystery of a possible murder.  This is one that you will definitely tell your friends about.
B007RTAR64|4.0|nice accessories, good clothing and nice overall look.  Mimics the actress and the character well.  Comes in a visually appealing box also.
0679420266|4.0|Quite often people do not understand what \\"the Stranger\\" is about. In my opinion, Camus has summarized it best by saying: \\"In our society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death. I only meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game. In this respect, he is foreign to the society in which he lives; he wanders, on the fringe, in the suburbs of private, solitary, sensual life. And this is why some readers have been tempted to look upon him as a piece of social wreckage. A much more accurate idea of the character or, at least one much closer to the author's intentions, will emerge if one asks just how Meursault doesn't play the game. The reply is a simple one; he refuses to lie. To lie is not only to say what isn't true. It is also and above all, to say more than is true, and, as far as the human heart is concerned, to express more than one feels. This is what we all do, every day, to simplify life. He says what he is, he refuses to hide his feelings, and immediately society feels threatened. He is asked, for example, to say that he regrets his crime, in the approved manner. He replies that what he feels is annoyance rather than real regret. And this shade of meaning condemns him.\\"
0937381888|5.0|People say this book is difficult to comprehend, but this is your book if you sincerely want to learn how to brew and want to learn the reasoning behind every step, ingredient, and equipment use.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Many people is giving less stars to this book, that the author has no good writing style and so on. But I like it! Funny way of telling a story. And the main character resembles myself, smart(you know what ...).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So happy with this book and so glad i have it to read again some day!  I would recomend this book to anyone who loves a good read!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a good story, and I couldn't put it down!! It was heart wrenching what happened but cool to see how everyone was connected. Fate brought Dean and sky back togethet
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like it because I can switch to whatever version my Sunday School teacher and pastor is using.  And I can find the verses right away.  Very cool app.
B007CUPFEC|3.0|Humph, this one was not as good as the first one. It got boring fast because it was a whole bunch of the same old stuff from the previous two movies. I guess this would be a rainy day flick.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I have a grouping of 'Holiday movies' that I take out and watch every year just before the Holiday season.  This is one of my favorite included in that group.
B005BV0A44|5.0|I purchased this download because you just can not pass up some good classic metal. For those who listen to this genre should know what I am  talking about. From beginning to the end, I just can not stop!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This is a favorite.  I haven't been able to watch it since I purchased it, so I can't comment on this specific copy.  I am hoping that it is the same movie they show on tv and that I won't be disappointed.  If it is, I won't.
B006H5120E|4.0|Because it's redone in 3d I think the 3d is too accentuated, compaired to others I've seen that are filmed in 3d.
B005LAII80|4.0|I know that when you think of Judge Dredd you think of that awful 90's movie with rob schneider and frankly who can blame you. It was ultra cheesy and completely not true to the graphic novel. It was a Hollywood monstrosity of the highest caliber.<br /><br />But let me tell you right now , this one IS NOT a Hollywood monstrosity. Its a painstakingly crafted and accurate to the graphic novel as you could get for a $50 Million budget. Karl Urban does a great job as the cold but effective Judge and the brutality of the graphic novel carries on through beautifully.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent and gritty. This is not a movie for the weak of stomach as it hammers you right off the bat with just how brutal and terrible this dystopian world is but the Judges are what keeps it from completely falling apart.<br /><br />If you missed this in the theater , do yourself a favor and buy this. I haven't spoken to a single person that's seen this movie and hasn't come out completely shocked at how good it is. Its absolutely worth the asking price (which is cheaper than going to the theater).
1609611543|5.0|Lots of valuable information.  I felt like they were describing my symptoms to a tea.  Great recipes included.  Would recommend this book if you are wondering if you have a gluten/celiac issue and would recommend this book if you already know about your gluten-free/celiac status.
0385535147|5.0|This is a very good book and I enjoyed it very much and suggested to my family and friends to read it as well.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone, no matter your interests. Very intelligently written and the characters draw you right into the story and don't let go.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|This app is pretty cool. Its main purpose is to stream content from your device to a TV. It does that, and more. I'll note that I am reviewing the 'paid' version (it was a free app of the day), so I don't know what features might be different from the free version.<br /><br />I downloaded this for use on my 10-inch Motorola Xoom, currently running Android's latest OS Ice Cream Sandwich. It's good for what it does, which is stream content to compatible media devices.  It will stream photos, music, and videos from computers and other devices that it finds (&#34;local media discovery&#34;), and it also offers a variety of other online sources from which to stream content. These range from the usual suspects -- YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, etc. -- to several lesser-known services.  If you've used a Roku, it's a similar experience, but with fewer sources.<br /><br />The app also detects compatible devices to which it will stream content, so it found my LG 'smart' TV and an Xbox 360. According to the developers' website, It would probably have found my Blu-ray player if it was on. It did not detect my Roku, so I'm not sure what the website means when it refers to &#34;media boxes&#34;.<br /><br />When you stream content, the app will initially ask you which device you want to stream to. You can also choose to stream it to your device's screen. This option didn't work with some of the services, but as far as I can tell that's not the app's fault.<br /><br />My only real complaint, after an hour or so spent playing with iMediaShare, is that it unexpectedly closed several times. It didn't crash, because it kept on streaming the content, so perhaps it's a compatibility issue with the Xoom. It was necessary to restart the app to control the content that it had been streaming.<br /><br />Overall, an app well worth having.
B000SEGMAU|3.0|The writer seems really impressed by Cohelo...or maybe that's just my thinking...<br />Morrie is one of the few really likable characters I have met in the recent past. His words carry a lot of wisdom. he tends to get over optimistic at times, hard to digest for a realist like me. His humor is remarkable given his health situation. I wonder though, if he really practiced what he preached.<br />All in all this book confirmed my belief that teachers change lives....for better or worse...
1611761565|5.0|This was a very good and informative book written in layman's terms.<br /><br />It was narrated well and easy to understand.<br /><br />Highly recommend this audio book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So. Good. Drives you crazy in the best way, such  suspense that you don`t want to even consider putting it down.
B000A0K2JO|2.0|Not sure what's up, but doesn't work on my computer. I half expected this, but it was worth a shot to try out.
B000QCS9NM|4.0|From the book's blurb and title I thought this would be about scam artist Victor who faked choking in restaurants, but that is barely a subplot to what becomes an in depth character study of a fairly complex sex addict. Each chapter peels away another layer of what seems at the surface to be a dismissive unsavory human being. I enjoyed the creative opening chapter which warns readers that we will not like this person--going as far as calling the character several untoward names--in the third person and then follows as a first person narrative by that same person. It is a very unique and fitting way to start this book out.<br /><br />I couldn't sustain interest in reading a book like this very often, but I guess it came along at the right time because I thoroughly enjoyed how different it was from plot-driven stories that I typically require. If you enjoy thick, heavy satire and can tolerate a cynical narrator opining and describing the lives of a cast of mostly unlikable and/or depressing characters (seemingly hopeless, nonredeemable addicts and patients with severe mental disabilities), give Choke a try.

B008DM4OTA|2.0|I downloaded this for my daughter that is 4 and it quickly became one of her favorites....One problem, it will completely freeze up the entire Kindle. Since I paid $$ for the app I will not delete the app and pray for an update.
B0098460O4|5.0|I absolutely love J&C on this CD.  They are as wonderful as I hoped that they would be.  The song selections are great and they seem to have improved since their AGT performances.<br /><br />One complaint: the audio production has a few problems.  At times, the music is so loud that it actually makes it hard to hear the performers' voices.  Also, it seems that Jonathan's powerful voice is sometimes turned down (attenuated), which disappointed me.<br /><br />I give J&C an A+.  I give whomever did the musical production a C.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I still strongly recommend this CD.

The only disappointment I've had is casting Tom Cruise as Reacher in the movie. How can a 5'4\\" pretty boy play a 6'5\\" tougher-than-two-railroad-spikes character?
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.  Really like just about anything with Channing Tatum in it.  This is fast moving and hilarious.  Check it out.

B008K8X0IS|5.0|As the title states, this is a specific review of the Collector's Edition set for Season 1. First of all, let me state that I was very ecstatic that I got this product at a great price of $39.99 when Amazon price matched Best Buy's offering. To everyone who got this set at the said price, we are a lucky bunch.<br /><br />The box is made of quality material. It's not just some cardboard box set like other collector's edition. The front cover is soft and feels like it has a cushion. Once you open the box set, you'll see the Dragon egg inside its recess and the Season 1 Digipack. Underneath the season 1 digipack is another blu ray with a sneak preview of the first episode of Season 2. I know that's a bummer but it's better than getting nothing else as an extra.<br /><br />You also get DVDs and digital copy of the first season.<br /><br />The Dragon egg feels very solid. It's a little heavy for such a small egg but it was finely crafted. Great for display in your office or just on your collector's shelves. Overall, this is a great product. If you don't have the first season already, get this.Specially if you find this product going down to $39.99 again. IT's a no-brainer.

B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Looper(released Sept/12)stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe Simmons,Bruce Willis as Old Joe,Emily Blunt as Sara Rollins,Paul Dano as Seth Richards,Noah Segan as Kid Blue,Piper Perabo as Suzie,Jeff Daniels as Abe,and others.This film starts out at a fine pace,introducing us to its main characters and what they do,then everything comes to a screeching halt as the movie slows to a crawls pace and then until it drags into the finish line.This is not what I was wanting to see of a film like this with so much promise.<br />The story has Levitt as a looper.This is 2044 and loopers are basically just hit men.The twist is they hit peeps from the future that are sent back by crime syndicates,who are finding it hard to dispose of bodies in their time.Each hit has the payment attached to their backs,whether it be gold or silver bars.Jeff Daniels is a part of a crime syndicate from the future and is in 2044 overseeing operations.The initial kick and big money is the draw for folks that want to become loopers in the first place.The drawback is is that sometimes the people from the future will randomly decide that they want no witnesses at all to their hit's death,including the loopers that kill them.So the loopers themselves can become instant targets also.<br />One day Levitt is awaiting his hit,but it is late.When it does arrive it is himself(Willis),but older.Willis escapes and Levitt's butt is suddenly in a sling,and Levitt is now on the run from Daniels and his posse.Levitt and Willis do meet up,at which point rumours of a new future crime syndicate takeover by a man known as the Rainmaker,are confirmed.Willis has a number scrawled on his hand which he got from a friend in the future.It is the birth date and the hospital which the baby Rainmaker was born in.The task now is to kill the Rainmaker.Levitt goes to a farm where a single mother lives with her son.Willis in the meantime seeks out two other possibilities and dispatches both.<br />One of Daniels men finds Levitt and the child,but before the man can kill him the child kills the man.It seems the child has telekinetic skills of greater proportions than is the norm for 2044.It is then Levitt realizes that this is the Rainmaker.Willis meanwhile kills Daniels and his men right in their headquarters,then comes to the farm to kill the child.As Willis pursues the mother and her child across a cut cornfield,one of Willis's shots grazes the child and angers him.He ends up levitating his mother and Willis,but the mother calms him down enough for him to drop them both.Levitt in the meantime had tried escaping but the air blast from the child's initial rage has turned over his vehicle.An injured Levitt seeing Willis pursue the boy and ready to shoot the mother,decides to stop the child growing up to become the Rainmaker due to what circumstances would do to change him.Levitt kills himself,and of course Willis disappears.<br />The film as I said was moving along wonderfully and I was enjoying this kind of neat concept about loopers and what they do and why.However,when the plot took Levitt to the farmhouse,the film suddenly slowed to a snails pace and never regained the flow it had had previously.To get from Levitt's first introduction to Blunt,the mother of the future Rainmaker,to the end was interminably long and got very boring VERY fast.The director obviously had details and plot to tell,but this entire sequence of events should have been whittled down and edited with much more alacrity.As it was it spoiled(or me)what had come before and took away from an otherwise promising film.This was a very disappointing turn of events,but poop does happen unfortunately.As far as performances go,I have got to give Willis most of the credit with being the driving force of this film.Levitt is not as likable a lead actor as the producers would have us think and his performance was far too weak to be in the drivers seat.When Willis comes on the movie crackles with intensity and lights up.Without Willis,the\\"lights\\" dim considerably.I also found Jeff Daniels to be in top form also as the syndicate rep in 2044.I hadn't seen Jeff in ages and it was a nice change of pace role for him.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes,commentary,a featurette,the scoring and an animated trailer.<br />All in all a disappointing Sci-Fi flick,that SHOULD have been far better.It had a great concept and moved along well until Levitt goes to the farmhouse,and then the pace falters considerably.Willis is THE star here because Levitt just does not have the acting chops yet to carry the leading man role.\\"lights\\" dim considerably.I also found

0765316897|4.0|Don't think of this series as Star Wars. In there everything got darker in the second movie only to cheer up in the third. It's a well-established formula. Whether intentionally avoiding that or through plot necessities (I suspect the former given the author's iconoclast tendencies) Sanderson has avoided doing that here, and instead this is the darkest book of the three. If you're looking for hope, or a ray of sunshine don't bother looking here. I never thought the first book was particularly cheerful (despite Kelsier) but it was miles less gloomy than this one. Basically, everything is dying, it's the end of the world, the ash never stops falling, and the mists are advancing during the day and killing people.<br /><br />Continuing on from [[ASIN:0765316889 The Well of Ascension]] where Vin unleashed the dark force that the Lord Ruler had contained, this book deals with Elend and Vin's attempt to save the world. While the first book was about trust and the second about faith this one is about hope. The ideals of the last one turned out so bad that Vin's attempt to sacrifice all to save the world was actually the cause of its destruction. Unlike other evil villains who rely on evil henchmen to further their plans, this villain relies on good men to do his work. The sheer cruelty of getting someone to sacrifice all for a noble cause so that you can destroy their world was one of the more impressive revelations of the last book. Suddenly everything that you know is wrong, because Ruin can rewrite anything not written on metal, including the prophecies relating to the Hero of Ages. The sheer uncertainty of knowing what to trust is what keeps this book going fresh, because yet again it doesn't really go anywhere. Elend and Vin spend most of their time besieging Fadrex City while Sazed and Spook are off north in Urteau trying to retake the city from rebels. Although there are some interesting twists the immobility of both quests makes the book somewhat stagnant, even if not to the same degree as the last one. After all, who cares about Fadrex City when Ruin is loose?<br /><br />Vin and Elend had basically all of their character development in the last book. They learned to have faith in each other and trust in themselves. So this leaves very little characterization since most of the work is already done. Despite having become a Mistborn Elend is basically the same man in this book as he was in the last. His only real conflict is over how far he should be willing to go. I have to say that the self-confident emperor Elend is nowhere near as fun a character as the bookworm nobleman Elend from the first book. The only two characters that do get developed are Sazed and, surprisingly, Spook. These two are in the north trying to take back a city. Sazed is questioning his faiths after the death of Tindwyl in the last book, and while his loss of faith feels real and has a decent resolution there is too much harping on about it. Spook becomes surprisingly complicated as he tries to be the hero he's always wanted to be. With some prodding from Ruin he gains new powers and tries to take over Urteau himself.<br /><br />I gotta say, these are addictive books. Ever since I started I couldn't put them down. Each book I questioned whether they would succeed or not because each time they could lose without making eventual victory impossible. Yet this time I always knew that things would turn out alright in the end, even if some main characters started dying. And I was wrong. Without giving everything away almost everyone you ever met dies in this book. It's the end of the world and it has consequences. But while it's great that he's trying to remain consistent with his apocalyptic theme it's not an easy book to read. What I'm basically trying to say is that this isn't a happy ending, though it easily could have been. He wrote himself a fairly easy way to make it so and then intentionally turned away. Out of all the main characters only maybe three survive, and that's including relatively minor leads like Breeze.<br /><br />If it seems like I'm complaining overmuch about my favorite characters suffering, well maybe I am. But in previous books they always triumphed against adversity and to have them fail to do so only at the end seems cruel. These are such good characters that it really hurts when they start dying, and I ended up feeling very disappointed with the conclusion. It is possible for a book to be too gloomy, and while it maintains a fine balance throughout the ending tips it over the edge. It also feels somewhat silly and deus ex machina-y. That's probably because they're fighting a god, and there's no way that ordinary mortals can win against that. I think the book simply amped the danger too high and was left with nowhere to go but odd directions. That's not to say that some of their revelations aren't clever (the fact that the Lord Ruler was possibly doing the right thing for example) but the defeat of Ruin seems necessary rather than well done. It's still worth reading but I really do wish that the conclusion didn't leave me feeling so darned cold.<br /><br />As for the series as a whole, it never really lived up to the potential of [[ASIN:076531178X The Final Empire]]. Sanderson took the traditional endpoint of a normal fantasy series and dealt with it in the first book. Then he found a way to continue on from there. While this was a great twist and a clever idea all the books after the first one seem unfocused. The need to have a villain greater than the dark lord (himself insanely powerful) left very few options and the choice to make the enemy an incorporeal force meant that there could never be a plausible ending without something of a cheat. An incorporeal villain can work (see Sauron) but you have to spend your time fighting his minions and destroying his bases. The villain here doesn't even show up until book three and the heroes spend most of both books fighting random nobles. Sanderson doesn't seem able to manage a book without such a clear purpose and while the uncertainty of motivation inherent in Ruin is genuinely threatening it doesn't help with the narrative structure.rvive, and that's including relatively minor leads like Breeze.<br /><br />If it seems like I'm complaining overmuch about my favorite characters suffering, well maybe I am.

B0039208JE|5.0|Juan Carlos Ure&ntilde;o IS ME BATMAN 1989 DIE HARD GIRLS... EVEN IN FILMS YOU GOT TO BE HANDSOME IM PROUD OF MY FILM I WAS 3 YEARS OLD IN MY MOVIE BATMAN 1989 GOT SO RICH I PUT A BED IN MY STUDIO THE STUDIOS SCENE 21 THE SECRET OF THE ALLEY SCENES IN MOVIE FOUR ! ! .
076531178X|5.0|This book is an excellent start to an excellent series. This is a fantasy world where the Dark Lord won. Quite some time ago too. It's been nearly a thousand years since he took over the world and the population is divided into the nobles and the skaa. The skaa are basically serfs, but treated far worse than even slaves were. They are killed for the slightest reason and any interbreeding is forbidden. This is enforced by laws mandating that any lord who sleeps with a skaa must kill her within a few weeks. The lords are every bit as bad as might be expected from this.<br /><br />The magic system is unique, and while it takes a bit of getting used to it works surprisingly well. The magic is called allomancy, and it involves eating metals to fuel their powers. Different metals give different powers, from the ability to repel metal to the ability to influence emotions or gain strength. Most allomancers can only burn one type of metal, but there are rare ones who can burn all ten. They're called Mistborns, and it's hardly a surprise to hear that the two leads have this ability. Because of the limitations of these powers much of the action is rather cleverly thought out in an effort to show how they would work in practice. Too often the rules for magic change depending on the situation, and while one character may have powers beyond what she should her very uniqueness shows how well thought-out the rest is.<br /><br />The world is a dark one, with constant ash pouring down and mists that rise every night. It seems vaguely Georgian due to the frequent use of pocket-watches, but generally speaking it has more of a Renaissance vibe to it. The Final Empire is largely feudal in nature, but the lords are watched over by the Steel Inquisitors, a sort of bizarre religious order who have nails driven through their eyes and out the back of their skulls. They serve the Lord Ruler (or Sliver of Infinity) the godlike and immortal being who rules the world and cannot be killed.<br /><br />But despite the dark and epic-sounding scale of the setting this is essentially a heist story. Kelsier is a thief and a Mistborn whose latest job is going to be taking down the Final Empire. To do this he has recruited a gang of thieves, including a young girl called Vin who has just discovered her own Mistborn powers. Her job is to learn to be an allomancer while infiltrating high society and serving as a spy. As might be expected things go sour before the end, and there are a large number of plot twists and turnarounds before the end.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this book is the characters. Vin is a scared little girl who has never trusted anyone in her life and who is trying to get used to the idea that her friends might not betray her (trust is one of the biggest themes of the book). She goes through so many different changes in the course of the book that her character is thoroughly developed and more than a little disturbed. It always seems possible that she might give into her anxieties and betray the party before they can betray her. Kelsier is a good deal of fun. He's the undisputed leader and he is always cheerful and optimistic, even when he has no cause to be and has to fake it. His wife betrayed him and got him sent to the mines where she died and he developed his powers. Despite this he is determined to trust his crew, even though Vin seems unable to do so.<br /><br />The rest of the crew is fairly generic. Some people have complained about this, but you know what? Name me a fantasy series where every character is complex and well thought out. And isn't [[ASIN:B002G7PWQM Game of Thrones]]. This book revolves entirely around its two lead characters. Anyone else is secondary, and while they all have personalities there isn't the time or a reason to develop them further. Apart from Sazed and Elend of course, who are excellent characters both.<br /><br />This is an excellent beginning to a good series. The other two books [[ASIN:0765356139 TheWell of Ascension]] and [[ASIN:0765356147 The Hero of Ages]]) never quite reach this level though they are both good and develop the story established here in a logical manner. Well worth reading.Well of Ascension]] and [[ASIN:0765356147 The Hero of Ages]]) never quite reach this level though they are both good and develop the story established here in a logical manner.

0920668364|5.0|Very touching book and instills in young children family values many are lacking today.  Also good book for older adults having trouble dealing with taking care of their aging parents.  It puts everything into an order.
0765316889|4.0|[[ASIN:076531178X The Final Empire]] was a tightly focused, plot-driven story. This book is rather less focused. Unlike last time where they had a fairly clear end goal (destroy the Empire) here they have to deal with the uncertainties of politics and two armies besieging Luthadel. The siege takes up most of the book, even though the title and most of the concluding chapters is tied up in the Well of Ascension and saving the world from the mists. I honestly didn't find the siege interesting, and while the character development was nice it went on far too long without any resolution. Perhaps it should have been two smaller books? At any rate it feels long and has some tedious moments despite the general quality of the work itself.<br /><br />Having defeated the dark lord in that last book what's left to do? Well this is where the story starts defying the genre conventions and deals with the ideals of the survivors. Elend's government isn't doing too well, nor have people flocked to the good guys' side in the wake of the Lord Ruler's death. Instead everything is tied up in petty politics and poor decision-making. Meanwhile the mists have started popping up in the day, and this time they're killing people. Throughout the book there is an undertone of dread as Vin tries to work out what's going on in the world. Essentially the plot is divided between the big picture (evil force that the Lord Ruler defeated is returning) and the little picture (Luthadel is under siege and politics suck).<br /><br />But the main focus of the book is not empires or battles, but the changing relationship between Vin and Elend. I have to say that I find them the cutest and most authentic couple in fantasy literature. Most of my favorite parts in the last book came from Elend's odd behavior and Vin's uncertainty how to deal with him. But now he's king and uncertainty and eccentricity have to be avoided. He is growing up throughout this book and learning to project his power in a way that people will respect. But the question is whether he'll do it in time?<br /><br />Vin is going through an even harder patch as she tries to find purpose in her life without any real guidance. She feels confused about her life and her goals and this is all tied up in her uncertainties and insecurities. She doesn't feel that she deserves Elend and worse she feels driven to find someone capable of understanding her situation and abilities. Most of the book is taken up with her agonizing over this and related issues such as her own helplessness to protect him. Basically she is a superpowered teenage girl only with even more issues given her background.<br /><br />There are other characters returning, but none of them get nearly as much time as they did in the last book. The only major new character is Zane, Elend's half-brother and a Mistborn serving under Elend's father, the evil Straff. He's insane and seems intent on getting Vin to come with him. He's also the closest thing this book comes to a main villain. After an immortal dark lord running an evil empire he's something of a letdown.<br /><br />A good part of the problem here is that they never really go anywhere. Admittedly the last book didn't range that far outside of Luthadel either, but it made up for it by its tight focus and string of major events. Here they don't have anything happening for most of the time, and what little they do have is rushed in at the end. The whole well of ascension quest doesn't even begin until 2/3 of the way through the book. Even then it feels like a distraction. It comes so out of nowhere in fact that I thought they were saving the resolution of that story arc for book three. I don't want to bash the book too much because it's still very good, but its lack of focus made for very disjointed and slow reading. The final book ([[ASIN:0765316897 The Hero of Ages]]) recovers from this, but it is a decidedly gloomy entry into what was an often dark, but always entertaining series.<br /><br/>In conclusion, this book has a lot of good and important character moments. Elend learning to become a king is probably the most important change that they need to cover and Vin's uncertainties and insecurities are something she needs to overcome. These moments are generally handled pretty well, but the plot is too lacking to truly keep your interest. The siege of the city isn't that interesting, and while he gets the tension quite high it's only because he ends the siege story arc and stuffs a new one in there. The final conclusion and revelation are great, but they'd have been much greater if they had been properly set up earlier./>In conclusion, this book has a lot of good and important character moments.

0765325950|4.0|I will spare the obvious cliched lines.<br /><br />A Memory of Light is a fitting conclusion to a series I began reading at 15.  So long that I am no longer the same person.  This series always brings me back.  I have faithfully reread this series countless times.<br /><br />There are misteps, there are glaring ommisions, there is heartache, and laughter.  As is true in all books in &#34;The Wheel of Time&#34;, there is a great deal to digest.<br /><br />The biggest truth is simple.  If you are a fan of fantasy or science fiction, you are doing yourself a disservice by not reading this series.  Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson have given us the most epic story of our time.

B003ZHVJFK|5.0|I love the tekken franchise, it has always been a pleasure playing them. I remember seeing the trailer for this, and I thought it looked awesome. So I had pre ordered it on blu ray/dvd/digital copy combo pack. Prior to this film, there was the hit tekken anime film from 1997.<br /><br />Story: This film takes place in the future. Kazuya, Heihachi, Jun, and Steve Fox are older. The city is living under a marshall law, run by a military, and Jin is a skilled street fighter trained by his mother, Jun Kazama. After \\"Heihachi\\" fires a missle at jin's house, killing his mother, jin decides to join the Iron fist tournament. Jin wins an open fight call against marshall law. He is then known as the people's choice and is sent to the Iron fist tournament. Steve fox is guiding Jin through the iron fist tournament. The second and best fight of the film is Raven vs Eddie Gordo. Jin fights his way to get revenge on heihachi mishima, unaware that he is his grandfather, and kazuya is his father. Jin meets a sweet gal, Christie montero. The story is great, the concept is great, stays true to the game in every way.<br /><br />Casting: Jin was casted perfectly, he has the hair, the tattoo, the body, the hoodie, and even the fighting style. Heihachi looks almost identical. Kazuya still has the scar on his face, he still has his sadistic side. Marshall law delivers some great fighting moves as he does in the game, good casting over there. Raven, again looks identical to the game, no joke. Eddie gordo, one of my favorite characters. Miguel roja, nice casting, looks like the character. Jun kazama looks great. Steve fox, he has aged because he is in the future, but he looks good. Sergei dragonov, another one of my favorite characters, well casted. Yoshimitsu, a master swordsman, looks awesome. Nina and anna williams, they look as great as always. Bryan fury was more than I had expected! Great casting by all actors.<br /><br />Fight scenes: These are the most well choreographed fight scenes I have ever scene. Within the fight between Eddie gordo and Raven, you notice how well choreographed gordo's moves are, they are literally taken from the game. The way raven reverses gordo's move is beyond me. Jin's actor is clearly a skilled fighter. The actor playing marshall law is a real fighting champion. The final fight of the film is totally epic, I was stunned by the total non stop action.<br /><br />Blu ray quality: The blu ray quality is great, so is the dvd quality. The digital copy downloads perfectly onto your PC. The set comes with the making of the film.<br /><br />Final Word: This is definitely one of my favorite video game adaptations of all time. This is a tekken must have. I hear they are currently working on a prequel entitled \\"Tekken Rise of the tournament.\\" Cannot wait for that. There is not a single thing about this film that could be better. I will be reviewing Tekken blood vengeance soon, and tekken 1997. There are many great video game films out there but this is one of the best.I have ever scene.

B0034G4P1W|3.0|I expected to really like this movie as I love Chicken Run, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. The humor seemed to come in spurts but the stuff that was actually worthy of provoking more than a half-smile just wasn't frequent enough. The animation was pretty good and the storyline was pretty original, but I just didn't get the enjoyment out of this one that I thought I would. Even my kids didn't love this as much as I had hoped they would. They tired of watching it halfway through and found other things to entertain themselves. I suppose if you really love pirates or you really love claymation, it might work. I just didn't think it was as good as the hype.

It has the intrigue and period accuracy of Upstairs Downstairs, but the characters are more approachable.
1250007208|4.0|Cinder is a very scientific and political book with a little splashes of romance here & there. It is not something I usually go for, but in this case I was very impressed with the way Melissa Meyer pulled off this excpectional great story, and make me fall in love with Cinderella Cinder's fairytale romance again. It actually reminded me a lot of another version of the TV show Once Upon a Time with all the fairytale mixed in one world.<br /><br />  Cinder is a cyborg which in generals terms means that she is part robot. Initially I was very bored with her, the only good moments came through Iko, who is an android, and the best character in this book. She's sarcastic, she's funny, and she brightens any scene just by her presence. Yes, I totally fangirled over Iko, and I freaking love her. Coming back to Cinder, I started warming up to her about halfway through the story when we get to know more about her background, and hidden secrets. That's when things started to get more interesting, and I was compelled into finishing the story, and finding out more about Cinder's heritage.<br /><br />  Melissa Meyer created a very sci-fi world with cyborgs, androids, and lunars which is commendable but I really wished that everything would have been in balance. I get that it's fantasy, but there has to be enough romance in it because it is a retelling of a popular fairytale which was filled with romance. There are very cute moments between Cinder & Prince Kai, but there was very little interaction between them overall, and I never felt their love. Arghh! I just didn't feel it. I don't know why, and that was my only disappointment. But their story is not over yet, and it will continue throughout the series, so I won't judge too soon.<br /><br />  Cinder is an extremely well written book with one of the most creative & original worlds I've ever read. It is highly recommended to readers who enjoy retellings and dystopians. I love that throughout the book we got glimpses of future characters & princesses, and I can't wait to read about every single one of them, but I'm really hope Iko gets her story because I already know that hers will be my favorite.racters & princesses, and I can't wait to read about every single one of them, but I'm really hope Iko gets her story because I already know that hers will be my favorite.
B003YCIE68|5.0|My wife grew up with this movie, and she shared it with me this last season on VHS. I thought it was fun and humorous so I ordered it DVD for us to watch every year.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loved it. Watched it over and over again . Would recomend to anyone and is a great movie for all ages.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Holy mother  of God thus is honestly one of the best things I have  ever read. It's just so beautiful and honest and perfect.
B000VIHMS4|4.0|I was so confused to what size I should get. I looked up a bunch of reviews and I got a mix of getting a half size smaller to a full size smaller. I have a friend that has a pair and she told me to get a full size smaller. I wear a 6.5 in women's shoes, and a size 5 in boys. I got a size 4M in big kids. They fit perfectly. I'm glad I got a full size smaller. My toes just barely hit the front of the shoes and I can still wear socks. I suggest you get a full size smaller. Timbs do run really huge. They are great quality and the shipping was quick. Happy with my purchase!
B001AOKA3W|3.0|I'm really conflicted about giving this film more than 2 stars but it sports a very original giant monster in a very realistic-feeling scenario. Filled with mysterious glimpses of the creature and the destruction it is causing  many blocks away. You feel like you are there... huddled in a corner of a store or someplace while the beast gets closer. This film brings the godzilla-type movie right up to the present, and with it, an amazing sense of real danger.  That being said... We now must address the negative aspects...First and foremost is the annoying person who accompanies us through the entire movie. His name is Hud and he seems to never shut up. I really can't describe how obnoxious this character is, except to say - he makes the other shallow & annoying characters seem interesting and likeable in contrast,and truly, that is quite a task - because they all come off as spoiled high-schoolers instead of \\"sophisticated\\" New Yorkers.(p.s.-what's up with the girls all wearing the babydoll style dresses? & what stupid company in Japan is hiring an american who's barely drinking age as a vice president?)  Anyway, it's too bad they didn't all get squashed in the first 5 minutes and a homeless wino didn't pick up the camera and take it from there.  So here I stand ... conflicted ...it's the same way I feel when I think about watching this dvd... I want to watch a good monster movie...but can I deal with Hud & the gang? ...conflicted... I think I'll watch Godzilla (the original, of course).

B007TNS6JI|4.0|I'm into fantasy games, and even though this is basically a hack-and-slash game, I couldn't put my Kindle down. The graphics are incredible, and the multiplayer gameplay is a nice touch, if frustrating at times.<br /><br />Pros: Excellent HQ graphics<br />Different difficulties for greater challenge and rewards<br />Different classes to choose from<br />Voice-chat during online play<br />Combat system actually looks somewhat realistic<br />The list goes on.<br /><br />Cons: FREAKIN' ADS!<br />Takes lengthy periods to get new gear<br />No actual character customization<br />Frustrating, but not major, glitches<br /><br />The basic idea of the game is that your character is thrown into an arena-like area where they will fight waves of enemies. The goals for each stage are different, like survive all waves or kill a certain amount of named enemies. There are also side quests that offer extra experience and gold, like &quot;Hit (enemy) with fairies X number of times.&quot; Sometimes, you'd have to replay the fight to fulfill the side quests, but the extra experience and money make it easier to become more powerful.<br /><br />After every fight there is an opportunity where you can open chests. There is a bronze, silver, and gold chest. You are given a free bronze chest every 24 hours, but otherwise need a key (keys will construct themselves when you have less than 5). Silver chests have more promising rewards than bronze chests, but require gems (special currency) to open them. Gold chests have the most powerful rewards, but cost many more gems than the silver ones. From the chests, you can receive potions, skills, weapons, armor, gems, etc.<br /><br />I would recommend getting this game if you like arena battles and constant fighting.
1844137872|5.0|great book for the price, this review has to be 15 words long but i said it in five. ok
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Loved it.... I almost cried at the end. It's so moving for a 15 year old boy... in my opinion.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Usinf a Sansung Smart TV I have encountered a unpleasant event withthe Amazon App where the picture and sound become out of sync. If I close the program and restart this problem goes away.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This was an interesting premise even though no one comes close to explaining how they discovered time travel.  Fun and always interesting to see someone's vision of the near future.
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|Four experienced stars having a great time.  Helen Mirren is wonderful as an action hero. Whoda thunk?  This movie is the opposite of serious, and you don't want to interrogate the plot or premise too closely, but it is terrific fun.
1439102813|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is the fictional story of Alice Howland, a Harvard professor of psychology who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. The book was absolutely fascinating, wonderfully written... but it was such a difficult read, emotionally. The story is told from Alice's point of view, the view of the person enduring Alzheimer's. Her struggles, her fears, her loneliness and frustration - everything Alice experienced completely enveloped me.<br /><br />Genova takes readers through so many emotions, helping us feel how complex dealing with this disease must feel to the patients and their caregivers. I laughed when Alice ordered ice cream: \\"'I'll have a triple-scoop Peanut Butter Cup in a cone, please.' Hell, I'm on Lipitor.\\" I felt angry that her husband would leave her alone in the house for long periods of time, or when her daughter said, \\"She should try to recall the information on her own and not get lazy.\\" Some of the scenes I found most profound were in the earlier stages, when Alice slipped in and out of confusion, aware of what was happening to her yet unable to control it, and acutely feeling the grief or humiliation that followed.<br /><br />My husband asked me, \\"Why do you read books like that?\\" Fair enough; many parts of the story brought me to tears. I thought about two moments in the book. The first was Alice's realization that many of her friends and colleagues were uncomfortable around her. They wouldn't make eye contact with her, or they'd avoid her altogether. The second was later in the story, when Alice is listening to her family argue: \\"They talked about her as if she weren't sitting in the wing chair, a few feet away. They talked about her, in front of her, as if she were deaf. They talked about her, in front of her, without including her, as if she had Alzheimer's disease.\\"<br /><br />Because of my hospice volunteering training and limited interaction with people who have Alzheimer's, I thought I knew a good bit about this disease. I don't believe I'd ever really internalized what I'd learned, how it must feel to the patient, until reading this book. Yes, the content is difficult and often terrifying. But novels like Still Alice foster deeper insight, understanding, and a more human connection.ieve I'd ever really internalized what I'd learned, how it must feel to the patient, until reading this book.

B000I186FW|3.0|Some things about this movie are cool--visually, it can be pretty interesting.  And Natalie Portman is wonderful to look at, as always.  But the movie takes itself way too seriously.
1849839727|4.0|I bought this book for my husband for Christmas and he is enjoying the read. There are lots of great pictures, too.
0199267170|5.0|You can't go wrong with the complete works of Shakespeare. A must-have for any well-read, English-loving writer, reader or poet.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could NOT put this down!!!!  The 2nd book was more like a 'bridge' for between the first and last books and it will be hard to imagine how they will pull it off in movie version, but I was totally captivated with the characters and the world they survived in via the written word.  I was a bit disappointed in the movie, Part 1, as there was so much detail not included for the character build-up.  I totally recommend reading this series and then seeing the movie.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Daniel has improved greatly in his acting capabilities since his early start in The Tailor of Panama and then on to the Harry Potter role.  I was anxious to see this movie and thought he did a nice job.  The movie itself was ok altogether and I would recommend seeing it at least once.  The scariest part of the movie, if you ask me, is the very ending when the Woman in Black looks right at you.  I look forward to seeing more from Daniel.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Well researched, easy to read, reassuring and true!  If only the rest of the world would slow down a minute and listen...
B001TH16DI|5.0|I CAN'T BELIEVE THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIES! THEY ARE AWESOME IN BLU RAY. SOME OLDER MOVIES DON'T LOOK AS GOOD WHEN THEY ARE CHANGED OVER TO BLU RAY BUT NOT IN THIS CASE. I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS WHOLE BOX SET. IT IS AWESOME AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL OLD SCHOOL TREK FANS! I LOVE IT AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|The main achievements of Berglund in the Sibelius catalog are the premiere recording of Kullervo and the Helsinki and Bournemouth Symphony sets. The two cycles are very similar, though the Bournemouth tempi (the present disc)are slower. I can't see any any reason why a Sibelius fan should not have both cycles.<br /><br />Sound from the early 70s is good, playing is good. I really can't find fault. The 2nd symphony here is as good as Helsinki, but as this version is new to me, I have been playing it over and over. The brass sound here is \\"brassier\\" than in the Helsinki, but I like both. For the 6th, Berglund has a bit of a slow pace in both versions, I have a slight preference for Helsinki there.<br /><br />For the 7th, the Helsinki is in four tracks, the Bournemouth in one track, as is mostly done today. I like the high end strings a bit better wih Helsinki.<br /><br />For 15 dollars, or even 20, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />The extras in the set are different in part from the earlier edition of these symphonies on CD. This one includes Tapiola, as it should. Symphonies are first, extras on discs 3 and 4.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love the harry potter series and I love to watch them over and over again.  Your never to old for magic.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|Ordered because the price seemed great. The packaging looked like it had been opened once and resealed; frayed edges on the box, some disks looked marked up and the plastic wrap was loose.. The discs all seem to have areas that skip. Cleaning the discs does not resolve the issue. Very disappointed in the purchase but from reading reviews of the box set and individual seasons, which I should have done before the purchase, it seems this is a common issue due to low quality of the product in general.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I felt depressed after watching this. \\"Mega City 1, the home of 800 million people, living in the ruins of the old city,\\" or something like that. The Judges, the thin blue ventricle, plugging what breaches of justice they can. And then, Judge Dredd. First thing, bro. Urban ain't Eastwood. Somehow, Karl Urban saying, \\"so how about it, Rookie,\\" for me, doesn't carry the gravelly weight of an Eastwood, Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Dunno, maybe it's my era. Just didn't ring. After that, there's the story, amazed at how pretty the graphics were. A common thread in a popular perception of value in contemporary movies- make the action like a first person shooter in an RPG, then jack up the gory visuals and slow down the violence sequences so the eyeballs can feast on that cheek that was just ripped open by the fitty cal bullet, by the carcass that was skinned before killed, etc., etc., etc.. Interestingly, that ain't exactly storytelling, it's MTV video techniques applied to feature film. Which, hmm, yeah, if that's your attention level, that's what makes it good for you. Great. After a while, I just got bored.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|The box set was a real bargain. Excellent packaging and fantastic picture quality. The show itself is a great romp through some of the greatest events in ancient history. Not always completely accurate historically it is still great entertainment. Unfortunate the series was cut short and they had to jam in so many events in the last few episodes. The fall of Antony is spectacular.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|I was just browsing and sampled a song or two and decided to give it a try.  I can't believe I have missed out on Johnny Winter for so much of my life.  I absolutely love this CD and plan to add many more Johnny Winter CDs to my collection!
B00000IFP6|4.0|Great sound quality and performance, though a bit fast in tempo, bordering between lively and rushed.  That's one interpretation!  In a perfect world, you should have a number of different interpretations of these works...
0316069434|5.0|This was a very fast delivery. Thank you. I willl use you again. The book is in great shape. Thanks again.

B005LAII80|1.0|Disc won't play in any of my PS3 players. Reports across the internet affirm the same problem exists for many other users as well. Lionsgate is selling a faulty product.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I didn't want the book to end. I would recommend this book to avid fans of love stories.  Can't wait to read my next book by Mira.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|As much as the tv series was good, the book is even better! Really gives you insight on the story
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This is a good and fairly long lasting game that I have always enjoyed. It's fun to try and improve your time score after playing them all. (Which will be a long while) .. I have noticed one or two games are not set up quite the way you expect - and although frustrating CAN be worked through in the end. Overall the design variations<br />Are very enjoyable. (I do find it a hard app to exit - which is a bit annoying) .<br />CW
B0076L0S76|5.0|I'm not sure why there's so much hate for this movie, makes no sense.  This movie is pretty honest, and not in a depressing way.  It's also fairly off-beat and has a strong cast.  I thought the pairing of Charlize hanging out with the old high school dweeb had a lot of laughs and an odd-couple feel to it, that alone made the movie worth watching.  The rest of the story had some good takes about parents, old flames, becoming 'an adult', shallow teen-age stereotype novels, and much else.  The ending was a bit clipped, but there was nowhere else to go with the story at that point, and it's up to your own point-of-view where she goes.  The final kitchen table conservation with the dweeb's sister was a bit hokey, but still made sense.  I thought it was off-beat with laughs but an underlying seriousness ... thumbs up.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Badass tale of one tough mother &@$!@&.  Take no credit for himself. This guy is one American bad ass.  Yay
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting.  Can easily lose track of time and kill a couple hours.  Makes time sitting around go by really fast.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I typically like guy movies. Loved all the Will Ferrell movies and the like. This movie was disappointing. I could not get past the fact that Teds voice was Peter from family guy. All the same gags were thrown in like they do In Family Guy. Not original or funny.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|i waiting this for so long and i highly recommand this star trek collection dvd even i am very begginaer fun in star trek fun very fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game so much! I had to get it on my kindle just so I could play the extra tablet levels!
B003YOZNBU|3.0|This film adaptation of DC comics' supernatural western begs the question, &#34;why so serious&#34;? This CGI-laden fantasy/horror/Western hybrid often gets bogged down in &#34;heaviness&#34;, and could use an injection of humor now and then. I think Tim Burton would've been the perfect director to helm this film, but nobody asked me so what we get is a film with it's heart in the right place, but lacking the seasoned talent to carry it through to a satisfying production. Another perfect director for this film would have been Sam Raimi. (Think of his film The Quick and the Dead and you'll know what I mean.) Another complaint of mine, which bothers me to no end, Is that contemporary directors always seem to fall back on filming half their scenes at night or in darkness, which may be effectively &#34;moody&#34; on the big screen in the theater, but on the TV you often go nuts trying to figure out what the &@?!$ is going on. (And I have a 46&#34; HD TV, in case you're wondering...) So in conclusion, three stars for a film that could've been really good but failed in the long run.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I &hearts;it my grandson and grand daughter are 6+7years old they &hearts;it very very much that I'm going to cry!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|it's a cool book. i'm still reading it, but I like it so far. It has the intrigue that keeps you reading, and that's good too. a little childish in the description of the relation between the 2.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I liked the story line of the first season better, but am loving season 2 as well!  I think it's great that they allow the actors to come back each season in a whole new story line as a whole new character.  You really get a look at the actors' abilities and range of emotions.  Keep it up!!!!!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Cheap and nice for low shots if you are following something in the street like a skate board, easy tu use and really practical

B000002LK2|5.0|My favorite British new wave/synth band from the eighties. This is not the effeminate stuff you are probably thinking of like Human League. This vocalist has the deepest voice I have ever heard. Synth/new wave it is but even Marilyn Manson did a remake of Reach Out and Touch Faith in which he barely had to change a thing. New wave/synth from the eighties that shows a more masculine side to the genre.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|a fun way to kill some time while waiting for some thing more important to come along, god bless america.
0385474547|4.0|What I can I say.  Only needed to be able to read the text and it was delivered in readable condition. My son needed this book for one of his college courses and I found this book at a great price and he can re sell it when he is done using it.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I downloaded this app today and nothing about it functions. Complete waste of time even though it was free it still was not worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun!  Need more senary on Temple Run!  Thanks Amazon for these free games to play on Kindle and i don't like you tell how many words to use on my comments.
B0082SU98U|4.0|I saw a movie of Pollyanna many years ago when I was still a child, and it made a big impression on me then. This story about always seeing the positive in any situation is just as memorable in book form as it was in the movie. It really makes you re-evaluate your own attitude. At first I struggled a bit to understand the American accents portrayed in some of the characters, but after a while I caught on and it didn't bother me anymore. In fact, the story is written very well and the characters are strong. I even gave my husband a chapter to read that I thought he needed to hear!
0749336072|5.0|We're very happy with this purchase. It was exactly was we wanted and was a very good value. Thank you!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|pretty good. graphics are better than alot of games. gameplay makes you think alot. like the story line. a little tough.

0151003084|5.0|The book itself was very much smaller than I'd expected, not at all a full-size page. But that's irrelevant to enjoyment!<br /><br />I loved the rhymes but even more the illustrations. The pen and ink kind of lent and sense of age or mystery or something and made the story seem archaic and mysterious. And something about the font also does the same thing!<br /><br />Great purchase.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|the piano guys are AMAZING!!! i love all their songs, and their youtube videos are so cool. they film in the coolest places!! they are such an inspiration for me to play the piano more!
B000069AUI|4.0|Some very non-mainstream music on this album. I am told it is typical of much of Cold Play's music.  I enjoy it and Cold Play fans will.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Wonderful rendition of Les Miserables.  Captures the most important scenes from the original book very well.  One should either read the book or watch newly released movie Les Miserables (2012) to enjoy this musical fully.
B000002C1W|5.0|I bought this as a replacement to the cassette I listened to for years and wore out.  I listen to this DVD often, even today and look how long ago it came out!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Neat game, constantly changing techniques required to negotiate the tasks.  if you like &#34;objective&#34; oriented games that are the same old shoot and click Goo might be for you.  The premise is that goo balls need to move towards the &#34;goo clean up system&#34;.  You have to create bridges, towers, use physics on moving bases and generally think ahead to accomplish the tasks - each task is different enough to challenge you.  Game ended to soon but I managed to kill 6-7 hours of down time with it.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I liked a few songs off this album before I bought it.  Had to let it grow on me, but like most of the selections on this album.  Not sure I would recommend unless you are already a Cold Play fan.
1451695195|4.0|This is a book that offers something both to the general reader and to those who may be out to learn more about Near Death Experiences. Whether you end by believing in 'heaven' or not you will find the book is clearly written and may be read in a few brief hours. I finished it, reading at a relaxed pace, over a period of three days. That being the case, what have you got to lose?
B0012GMVG2|5.0|If you are a Toto fan, this is the one album you should know. I actually wore out my original and this was to replace it.  Great music here.

B005HPY8LU|4.0|not her best, but enjoyable.  If you are a Kelly Clarkson fan, I believe you will like this album.  Still letting it &#34;grow on me&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game with great graphics and a lot of customization options. you don't get stuck with nothing to do like most games where you have to buy gems and coins.
0316044695|5.0|unbelievable story. riveting.  couldn't put it down.  Not necessarily a person who reads a lot of military tales however I had heard a little about this story in advance and really wanted to find out the whole thing.  I learned not only about the mission, but Marcus Luttrell as well.  I have since gone on to read two other books regarding the conflicts in the Middle East.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I enjoy escapes,  and enjoyed this game.  Also like the no ad option if one chooses.  I hope more levels are available soon! Keep the fun coming.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|If you like enigma, pick this one up.  Just slightly a departure in sound from some of their other albums, but worth a listen to.  I like some of the unique tracks they have on here.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was simply awesome. It was recommended to me by my neighbor and I must say... I'm glad I read it. However I did expect more of a suspenseful fight scene such as the one that was written in The Lucky One. Either way, if you don't know what book you should read next.... definitely choose this one :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really fun, but I feel like the only way to get enough coins or gems to do anything is to buy things or complete other games and tasks and things. I'm getting gems just for writing a review lol. But all in all it's a fun game. Worth a shot, especially since it is free.
1439148813|5.0|. This book came quickly .  and in good condition . . I am already a few chapters in. .
B008C20TDG|2.0|When I bought this book, I was expecting more from the book.  I was disappointed. I have heard so many great things about this program too.
B0000009SY|5.0|I think Joe's garage is the best CD Zappa produced. It has all the most popular songs on it; Catholic girls, yellow snow. . . . .
1935670913|1.0|This book was okay, unremarkable in many ways, mostly unedifying. I didn't mind the entrance fee for a few trite phrases which might not have occurred to me otherwise and now help to focus my efforts. For example, at one point the author says that it's better to set goals than chase sales; he reasons that sales will follow. He explains that, when setting out on the unpublished road, he set himself the goal of getting five five star reviews. WHAT GOOD SENSE, I thought (even though this piece of advice would have lead me to purchase a book with a different title).<br /><br />What the author omits to mention, and which many other reviewers here have, is that he paid for those reviews. Whether or not he said to the review company that he wanted the reviews to be honest, the boost to his presence on Amazon that thousands of dollars worth of review purchases must have done (it was specified that the reviews be Amazon verified) and subsequent review attention must really have helped his fledgling career along the way. Locke will probably know how much help it was, as he boasts about keeping track of the effect of his various \\"marketing strategies\\" meticulously. Knowing this now, I feel the book was an absolute waste of money. I can't afford to follow his route and wouldn't be inclined to. To omit this information makes a lie of Locke's whole story and renders it pointless. He's not a success, he's just a rich man.<br /><br />My advice to budding writers would be to pick up some good books on how to write well instead --- The Art of Fiction by David Lodge, or even something like Poetry In The Making by Ted Hughes which has a lot of wisdom that can be transferred to prose. The main gist of this book --- Locke's SECRET PLAN --- is \\"get lots of contacts and try to sell them stuff, but don't be too up-front about it\\" which we all kind of knew already. Spend your dollars and cents elsewhere, unless you can afford to buy the reviews that Locke can. I'm not denying that a certainamount of business nouse is required to make it as a self-published writer these days, but don't let people like this guy completely ruin it for us before we get there, yeah?
B008FYZIVY|5.0|purchased as gift for Mom, a big Downton Abbey Fan.  She was so excited on Christmas Day, she just loves it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is a lot of fun, especially for little kids. they love it! every time I babysit my nephew all he want to do is play the &quot;horsey game&quot;
B004N66XYE|5.0|purchased as gift for Mom, a big Upstairs Downstairs Fan.  She was so excited on Christmas Day, she just loves it!
B009GED3HS|5.0|Himym is probably one of the best comedies written in our time! I will be very sad when it ends.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I loved this movie. Karl Urban is perfect in this role and the special effects are outstanding. I hope it is a continuing franchise. Highly recommended.
0316228532|2.0|After reading the HP novels, I was anticipating the next work of art by JK Rowling.  What I found is a novel that seems to be written for the sole purpose of shock value.  It is a complete departure from the writing style, symbolism, and wholesomeness of her previous works.  The only point I see in this book at all is that Rowling wants to distance herself as far away from the HP novels as possible in an effort to avoid being pigeon holed.  If that was her purpose, she has succeeded.  I found the plot's cohesiveness to be lacking.  The story has a very confusing start with introducing characters with very little connection to each other.  Over time there is some connection, but as a whole the plot and characters are not developed enough despite the staggering amount of pages in this novel.  The last couple of chapters seem to be hurriedly wrapping things up so that the book can have an ending, but the ending is in itself very lacking.  There were enough f-bombs to sink the Titanic, and the amount of time spent on pedophilia, drug addiction, rape, incest, adultery, teenage promiscuity, self-cutting, etc. don't serve much purpose in the novel.  Again I think Rowling just sat down one day and said to herself \\"I bet if I write about all the crappiest things that happen in society, they will never say that all I write is children's books.\\"  Again if this is what she was thinking, she succeeded.  But I would have rather her goal to have been to write an awesome novel that doesn't need adult language and themes to make it sensational.
B00B47NO2O|5.0|This was such a great show! Levin bacon and James purefoy are pure gold together and their scenes together are totally enthralling! As for the violence. I was expecting a lot more the way people were complaining about it. It wasn't that bad at all just as much as csi or law and order. Thrilling and entertaining a recommended watch!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ordered the ap for my son to use on his Kindle Fire, which he loves. The only problem is that it took some time for him to learn how to navigate without a keyboard or mouse.
B004LROUNG|5.0|LOVED THE BOOK...FOUND IT HARD TO PUT IT DOWN.  AND WAS SORRY WHEN  IT WAS OVER.  READY TO START ANOTHER GRISHAM BOOK.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|You cant really go wrong with this chess app. It does what its intended to do. I did notice that on my older android, that i lagged a bit, but still was playable. Got this during the free app day
B00AREIAI8|3.0|F UN and interesting.  Educational and informative.  I enjoyed the good game my horse very much.. my favorite part was training a mnemonic d grooming.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is amazing for young readers. It has advice, vocabulary and the type of book you would expect for a 6 grader
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is okay but isn't the most fun horse game there is. After a while it gets kinda boring.  Horse life adventures is more fun.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|This was a great album an Amazon made it available at a fantastic price.  An easy listen and if you like Marley you will love this album.
B00000612P|5.0|I bought this CD because I've got a bunch of Rod Stewart stuff and this CD is really cool tunes.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is another classic Harry Bosch novel, Connelly keeps your interest in the story line that is typical police dialogue.  Reads like a chronological report with built in conflict and personal issues addressed.  Makes a cold case seem current.  Harry still rocks.
B000001F2X|5.0|This is another GREAT CD from J.J. Cale ! If you like J.J. and don't have this CD then get it !
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|I have read most of David's stories and enjoy them all. This book had great suspense and good story line.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I love Kid Rock's stuff all of it !!!! And I see his new stuff also is very easy to listen too !!!
B0042LJTQO|5.0|Listening  to it now. I have it on my iPad, and enjoy it all ay long. It's soothing, passionate and uplifting, all at the same time. So glad I made this purchase.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|This guy has been around for a long time and has played with allot of people. There's gotta be a reason.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The book was good just wish it was a little longer & explained a little more about some people like Alan and candy and how they ended up. As always a true love story that came with tears.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This game is very addicting and hard to put down. Trying to figure out what the next part of the island will hold makes the game play very enjoyable.
076115728X|5.0|I love this book! I wish I had read it before having children of my own. We all need to know life happens. It is what you do with it that matters.
B007W8S2MG|3.0|This review is not meant to be controversial. I am going to give this game 3-Stars for a reason. The last Persona game I've played was Persona 3 Fes on PS2. That game immediately had me interested from the opening cinematics. The game has just the right balance of combat and story/narrative. I went on to complete that game but never actually played the Fes parts. I know that 99% of the people who purchase this game know exactly what their buying and this is the perfect game for those people (this review is for the other 1%). For me I love Jrpgs but this game has replaced the balance of combat and dialogue with mostly dialogue. Now I'm sure it's quite possible that it eventually equals but at the 4 hour mark I haven't seen it. Playing the game for 4 hours doesn't give me enough experience to give a full review to this game but it at least warrants a first look review. My fair comparison will be with the game Zero Escape, now this game is obviously story driven with very small amounts of any actually choices/gameplay. That's something I knew getting into that game because that's the genre and style. This game is a turn based JRPG and should behave as such. I understand the game needs a warm up but 4 hours is far to long. I will continue to play this game because I know there is a great game hidden in all the text. Even if I go onto to love this game my review will always stand for me because the opening of the game is it's first chance to truly pull me in and this game has failed along with many others. Another small gripe is that the touchscreen is not used not even for simple things like selecting saves or starting the game. Overall with the Vita's underwhelming library of games this is one you should consider purchasing. If possible I would give the game a 3 and 1/2 stars because it's definitely a lot of fun when there is fun to be had.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like it i love it i eant some more of it. Give me more coints to start with.  Okaythank u
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome and mindless. I played the game for hours on end for no reason. Best part is it's FREE.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game...so addicted. I cant stop playing the games :) my favorite is the air hockey game. I could play that FOREVER lol.

B002GHHHL0|5.0|very good movie for shark fans. this movie is full  Of surprises and twists. I love this movie and would recommend it.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book provided an inside look at what goes on inside the Beltway.  It explores the unique relationship that former presidents  share, both the good and the bad.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This book was a thrill ride. Full of twist, turns, and surprises. Well written and great editing. I loved the characters, good and bad.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|great book for learning how to cook like a chef! Has lots of bonus content.<br />I would recommend it for the info on learning alone.
B001LMAK88|5.0|Very entertaining. It has a lot of different things. I love horse. Horse play a good role in it, I mean there are many horse action in it.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I guess I am too old to appreciate it.  Sorry.  I am sorry that I spent the money on it.
6305754969|5.0|I have watched it on TV so many time. but I wanted to have it on DVD. I like to stop very frequently, reed the subtitles. These two guys John and Robert did a wonderful job together with the rest of the crew.
B004TI5N38|5.0|It captured my interest from page one--and held it to the end---he always has a turn a round ending. Would recommend it.
B005LAII08|5.0|It's nice to do 3d for special occasions, blue ray just for fun, or have the regular DVD in the car.
B005GVF95O|4.0|Great for the very young as soon as theyy can grasp shapes.<br />I have even played this myself. I find that --just the activity keeps the mind sharper.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My family loves to watch this movie in 3d. 2d just doesn't do it justice. The graphics are spectacular and it's a great story-line too.
B00A88FLI0|4.0|Too expensive, but extremely cool. price should be lowered to about 30-40 dollars at most. i would sell it for 29.99
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Actors with skill and on camera chemistry, raw, real and heartwarming. You don't have to be a sports buff to enjoy this film.
0525478817|5.0|I started this book during a flight. Never, but never thought that a misanthrope like me can be so deeply moved by an american novel. I did, I almost wept and I don`t care if these are (or not) behaviors a teenager could display in a situation like that described in the book. The book is nice written and very very touchy. Period.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies for any time of the year!!  Love Cary Grant and Loretta Young in anything they did.
B00A757EFW|3.0|very like the original game but navigation just little cumbersome. still entertaining. typing this review on a tablet is a pain. but words?
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I did not fall into this Dr. Kay as I have before with the rest of the books.  I love PC's series, but this one just did not hold my interest.  I stored it away on my Kindle for another time.  Maybe it will appeal to me then.  Sorry Patricia.  I wanted to love it.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|this item arrived in time and in great condition, all the disks work and I am very pleased overall. Love this show, and love the price of this item!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome no Wi-Fi needed. It is awesome because you<br />can save your money to buy more stuff every so often they change themes. And it is so addicting and way better than temple run!
B00004XQ83|5.0|This item arrived on time and in great condition, its a wonderful movie and it has a wonderful soundtrack full of diversity, I highly recommend this item.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|21 Jump Street was hilarious! I'm glad I finally picked this one up. Aside from a meager love story the comedy in this is original and fantastic.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Beautiful picture, but old story. It is basically a horror film in space. The first Alien was much better. Fun to look at though I guess
B000PMG16U|2.0|This particular set doesn't seem to play correctly on my BluRay. I have a brand new samsung smart blu ray do it has to be the discs. THEY TAKE FOREVER TO START AND SKIP MIDWAY THROUGH THEFILM.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|For some mad reason I started reading this after getting it together with first book as a package - despite hating the first but quickly realised my mistake and stopped.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I went to Best Buy & Wal-Mart both to try an find a decent case for my 7&#34; kindle fire hd and Wal-Mart had nothing for it, Best Buy however had this very same one for about 45.00 dollars , I got this for almost half that price on Amazon!! I love this, it's durable , when I go to close it my kindle goes into sleep mode an when I want it to stand so I can read, it holds itself in place, I would recommend this product to anyone , and Amazon is just awesome!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I got this after reading a review by a  female columnist that this book was erotica for the liberated professional woman exploring and admitting her sexuality. It's the opposite. The basic Mills and Boons premise is here: that a very wealthy man will whisk you way to ultimate comfort and look after your every financial and emotional need. The 'heroine' is discovered under the cinderella cobwebs as an overlooked humble beauty who only needs to be given expensive clothing to finally shine. Ok porn doesnt need to have a believable story. Still the idea that a USA college graduate who is beautiful, intelligent,  fiesty & non-religious is not only a virgin but naive and not even interested in sex until her rich suitor appears is pretty laughable. I skim read all the sex scenes after the first couple as they were so predictable and repetitive, but the story in between the sex was insulting in its reinforcement of the idea that everything that happens is ok if the money is good enough.  This is supposedly a publishing and cultural phenomenon.  Poor news for our progress.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book touched me, and my heart I loved it more then any other book I have ever read. It was breath taking and amazingly written. One of Maggie Stiefvater's finest.
B002MG0MF8|4.0|It would have been five stars except that there were a couple of minutes in the video that were quite blurry. The original play won the Pulitzer Prize back when it really meant something. It's the ultimate feel good movie and a happy experience. All the characters are so colorful and even the small roles are gems. Josephine Hull stole the show and Jimmy Stewart did such a great job in his role. It was if the playwright knew both of them and wrote the original for them.
B00866H7SS|5.0|The crossfire series has kept the erotic fantasies alive Bared to you Puts you in amongst the characters and their lives while keeping you in the heat of the moment strongly recommended to those wanting to add some spice to their love lives while continuing the cross theme. Thank you
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This is right up there with  Departures!  Having lived in Japan many years ago and understand those of his age, I could relate to  the devotion to  and perfection of Jiro's life work.  It stays in my DVD canon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome color quality is awesome I would recommend it for everyone plz try it you will love it
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Picture this -- reading until 12:45 to get to the end of the 4th book (not knowing there was a 5th), excited and unable to wait until the next day to get to the ending, even though you have to get up for work in the morning. That was me. All of a sudden, my husband heard me crying out, begging to buy this one, as the last one left me utterly desolate!!<br /><br />This one is by far the best book of the series...and I wish the movie player in my mind could just play it onto a screen so I could watch it!! So good.<br /><br />A great tie in to all the others.<br /><br />I wish I could give it...12 stars...but alas, it won't let me :(
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many quriky turns and discoveries.  Never knowing who's &#34;the bad guy&#34; or who's the &#34;good guy&#34;? The only time I put it down is when the Kindle battery ran out...A novel for those who think they know it all...surprise... does the good guy come in last?
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Loved it so much we bought this for our parents for Christmas, and they were blown away, as well.  I'm not usually interested in historical dramas (yawn!), but this is different - I was sad to have it end.  I wanted it to go on and on and on; I was drinking in American history like never before.  And, we'll enjoy it many more times.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book really held my attention and was great read, the main characters were essentially unlikeable, this usually puts me off but I held out to the end as the writing was really good. I'm not sure I would recommend it.
B00A3XWB10|5.0|I have to agree with many reviews upon the first impression of this release. The appeal isn't immediate. It took a couple listens before I started to actually \\"hear\\" it. While past releases had the potential to instantly reach out and grab you by the ears, this one takes time. Now, I'm realizing just how great this disc is. It's full of punk energy delivered through a sound reminiscent of the Crue, Skid Row, etc. The ability for this album to grow on me like it has proves, to me, its desire for prolonged longevity. This isn't a here today, gone tomorrow disc. This is going to stand the test of time and catapult Crashdiet into a more recognized name in the music community. I challenge EVERYONE that hears this to post recommendation links on their Facebook pages. Give the guys a hand. The effort they put into this deserves our respect and willingness to help get the word out. Crashdiet rocks!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|As with all of the books in this series, I would prefer if the author restrained his use of casual profanity.  Call me a prude. Still, I have obviously enjoyed the series or I wouldn't have persisted through the first four volumes.  What upsets me about this chapter is the great lack of anything positive.  Taken as a standalone, this would be a serious depressing book.  Even in the context of a many volume series, it is difficult to see anything positive.  I'm a glass almost full kind of guy, but this volume was still very difficult to read at times.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can usually tell where a plot line is headed, but his author kept me on my toes!  Cunning, twisted, pathological, this book will be re-read again!
0316017930|5.0|It came on time because I needed it for school. It was in great condition. So no complaints to the seller or the product.
0786955570|5.0|I need not make my review too long; just go to boardgamegeek and read the forums/reviews -- the fact is, this game is more about buying the pieces, the tokens, the tiles, etc. and then you have a real fun game system to make it your own. The base rules are good, really, but if you stop there you might end up feeling like the game is too mechanical. Go concot yourself a variant (if that's not your style, just go crib someone's and don't question it much) and the game takes on new life. The adventures are long enough to play for a long time (even by yourself!)... and then online there are tons of adventures!<br /><br />So yes 5/5.
B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|scenes were any good. And let's face it that is the only reason any man would watch it. Gina Carano is a very gifted athlete and is extemely skilled in martial arts. The problem I had was every fight scene looked the same. she beat on the men they beat on her, back and forth untill you know without me saying who wins. I like seeing a woman really beat up a man but only if it is real and I don't know who is going to win.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Switching from IOS to Android meant I had to buy some apps again. But guess what? This app is only sold in the Amazon store, and is therefore unavailable to most of the world. So, utterly and completely useless.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I found this movie to be very cute and entertaining and I am an Adult over 30.  :)  I Highly recommend this movie.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Watched Looper and had high hopes for it but thought the plot was only ok.  Problems with time travel like many others that deal with this subject.  Wished for a happier ending.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Love sci if fantasy.....you will enjoy this dark tale...not for the younger readers....which makes it even better from my perspective.
B0097UGXFK|2.0|Well done, for what it is, but creepy and disgusting at the beginning and not satisfying at the end. (SPOILER ALERT) The bad guys are still in charge at the end, which means there is no dramatic payoff, no big reward for the audience. Lots of ups and downs, and lots of great acting, but the tone is off for the first half. What I really wanted to see was a revolution. You root for Katniss, but you don't root for the movie. I didn't like the dramatic device borrowed from the \\"Truman Show,\\" where the Games people are controlling almost everything. The dramatic question is not will she make it, but will they let her make it. And that makes it less dramatic. All in all, an interesting movie but not a satisfying story. (\\"The Truman Show\\" is a much better movie.) The whole Hunger Games thing almost feels like a con game, where the audience is being conned. In any work of art, I look for truth, insight into human nature, a comment on the human condition, and a knowledge of people and the world. None of that is happening here. I don't understand why the book and movie are so popular. I tried to read the book and didn't care for it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app lots of fun. Had not enjoyed using an app like this in a long time. Will definitely recommend to friends and family.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Ome of the best SF stories I've read in quite some time.  Great story, great characters and well edited too.  I could hear Mark Whatney's voice as I read the story.  Plus some fantastic humor sprinked in.  Please write more Mr. Weir, you have real talent.  I will pay full list for your stories.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I haven't downloaded it yet is 7 dollars worth it and yes I am a girl haha seems nice though
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A little slow starting but the mystery of it holds you. Then Wuthering Heights picks up speed.<br />In, time, very satisfying.
0765325950|5.0|Very fast paced. Lots of battle scenes, and lots of loose threads brought together very cleverly for the denouement. I loved it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was told multiple times that it was the best gift my husband EVER got for Christmas.  He knows his sound quality as its what he does for work.  He was amazed at the stereo sound on a wireless headset, made me sit and listen to it.  Big pat on the back to logitech and myself for digging a little deeper in my pocket and paying the extra for this quality product.  I was greatly loved and appreciated by the user, my husband.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|loved this book my book club gave it a WOW.  Hope there is a next book about this family from the author
B009O07NBQ|5.0|LOVED the movie.  LOVED the soundtrack :)  Howard Shore did the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, so of course, it is GREAT :)  I TRY to spend my $ locally, but local retailers just don't stock cds anymore :(
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Awesome Seller!!!!!!!!!!!! Very Fast and was in perfect condition!!! Thank you! I will buy from this seller again! Great Service!
B005LAII80|4.0|Okay, I get why so many give this five stars and I did very much enjoy this film, but...<br /><br />The best Judge Dredd film is still Robo-cop. Hear me out.<br /><br />Judge Dredd the Stallone craptacular had some very fine Judge Dredd qualities about it even if it failed on some important notes. Mainly, the decision to turn Dredd into a heroic character. My understanding (and much to Stallone's credit) is that Stallone fought to keep many elements in tact from the comic but simply lost too many behind the scene battles. Ultimately though, Rob Schneider as Walter the Wobot and other elements made this film just too off base from the source material.<br /><br />This film Dredd, gave us an incredibly gritty take on Judge Dredd. Far more grittiness than even the comic book had. It was as if the pendulum swung too far the other direction. This Mega-City One was a bland and brutal place, devoid of craziness and relying on the 90's version of the stereotypical thug for the vast majority of its baddies. Despite some of its perfunctory elements, the whole film worked and it was nice to see a more visceral take on the action. Karl Urban was fantastic as Judge Dredd, even sounding eerily like Clint Eastwood in several scenes (which is acceptable as Dirty Harry was the template for Judge Dredd). Olivia Thirlby was also great as a young Judge Anderson, giving us a much more human side of the Judges, even if she was well on her way to becoming nearly as hard as Dredd by the end. My only complaint (albeit a small one in the overall context of the film) was a small scene in the finale in which Dredd chose an action that could make him out to be sadistic. Dredd was never a sadist. Overall though, just not a particularly good Judge Dredd story yet a good film and decent introduction to that universe. I know that may seem confusing but I stand by it. Karl Urban = Great as Dredd. Film = Great entertainment. A Dredd Story = A decent introduction if not the best example of a Dredd story. The important part is that the producers got the important elements of Judge Dredd, mostly right.<br /><br />A quick note on Robo-Cop. So many elements in that film were spot on from the old 2000 A.D.s with both the gritty and nasty city and all of its twisted humor and irony in tact (Something sorely missing from Dredd (film) and the strong fascist cop protagonist (if too sympathetic in relation to Dredd). Even Robo-Cop's famous line is right out of one of Judge Dredd's earliest comics, \\"Come quietly or there will be trouble.\\" Anyway, still the best overall Judge Dredd adaptation.<br /><br />So for Dredd, despite its flop in theaters, it has been doing amazingly well on both rental and purchase for home video and I know I would love to see more of Karl Urban as Dredd. Fingers crossed.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I am an Enigma fan so any cd I purchase I am going to enjoy.  Like getting good used cd's thro Amazon
B008KYOCA2|1.0|The only reason I chose this app was because it said it would sync with my google calendar, perhaps the other android apps do, but this Kindle Fire app does not. It is obvious that the writer of this app does not speak english as the helps are totally unintelligible.  Don't release things until they have been tested, don't use us as testers.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I love Wes Anderson films.  They are all vaguely the same and have similar characters- but that's ok.  In this case though, it didn't feel like the same characters in a different situation... it felt like the same characters in a pastiche of several Anderson films stuck together.  Entertaining, but far from great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so cool.it combines my love of my kindle and horses.I have always wanted one and now I can
B000MD9UJC|5.0|These are super simple to install, super bright and the batteries in your maglight last longer.<br />What's not to love?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty cute game.  Just wish you could change your persons looks.  But oh well.  Other than that a great time waster.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Loved this book.  Found it hard to put down.  I could see the characters and enjoyed the story line.  It is a pleasant, easy read and has a feel good factor to it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series never stops to amaze me. Just when you really like a character, they get bitten.<br />Lots of close calls too. Don't know hope they escape the &#34;walkers&#34;.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|If you read the first book and liked it, then don't read the 2nd book.  It shouldnt have been a trilogy.  The first book was much better.  They should have made the trilogy into 1 great book.  One was enough.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|It is almost like really playing the real board game.<br />It does have some settings to set the play.<br />I would recommend this game.
B0098460O4|5.0|The Gift that is Jonathan and Charlotte should not be missed by anyone. I am not an opera buff by any stretch of the imagination but I adore what these two young adults can do with their vocal power. Almost moves me to tears.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game is quite fun... probably playing it a bit too often!  I'm going to buy the ad free version because I believe it is that good.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This was a good romantic baseball movie.  I loved watching the drafting and scouting aspects of baseball.  Clint made the movie.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|Our son loves this tractor and is bringing it for &#34;show and tell&#34; tomorrow!  The front bucket and backhoe are functional and easy to use.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'll never buy another Sennheiser MD280 set of phones again.  These Sony units are so much better built, pack smaller and are way more comfortable.
1594135851|5.0|I was afraid the series would be to 'tweeny'.  Quick read, interesting characters.  Frightening that this could be a future reality.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I typically don't write reviews, however this book left a significant mark on me. I have never read something that has caused me to contemplate life in the way I am after finishing the book. John Green is an incredible author who created characters who made their way into my heart. I highly recommend this book to those of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses....and this is so much fun...a d very realistic for an app that is free..u ca. traain the horse...feed...and clean it...so neat
B00A7CI82I|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie and look forward to morein the Bourne series.  Hopefully we get to see Jason again.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I have really begun to see a change in my body since beginning the workouts. This change has been faster than turbo jam and many of the others that I enjoy doing.I am seeing definition in my body all over and not just in one area...but it does make me not like her!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is unbelievable it's so realistic and fun u get to take care of the horse buy new horses train compete much more!!!!!!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Much better than the last several books. I really enjoyed this one. It keeps you interested all the way through.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book had interesting insights into life in Brooklyn years ago. Very good story and narration was excellent as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I READ THIS BOOK IN 2 DAYS.  I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, I REALLY WANT TO TAKE MY HUSBAND TO SEE THE MOVIE.  IT HAD A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AND TRULY A LOVE STORY.  IT WAS NOT MUSHY GUSHY THAT IS WHY I ENJOY NICHOLAS SPARKS BOOKS SO MUCH.  ITS A GREAT READ.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It works well for me on my first gen kindle fire.  I was able to upload photos on my PC and organize them into different folders on the photo cloud. I can now view and show them to others on my kindle or PC.  I have not tried to use it on my phone yet, but if it works like it does on the Kindle, I will be glad.  No more worries about lost photos.  5GB should be about 2000 photos so I am pretty sure that will be enough. Thanks Amazon.
B004Y042N8|5.0|Definitely a great game to get your mind working. I have played this type of puzzle game before. You will enjoy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story was AMAZING! There are times in the book that brought me to tears, as well as times when I was cheering Hazel Grace and Augustus on every step of the way.<br /><br />This is a story that is hard to tell and read.  No one wants to think about a child getting cancer and the challenges that it brings into their lives.  The greatest benefit that I got from this book was the perspective of the cancer patient, Hazel, that tells the story in the book.  My own brother was diagnosed with cancer about 9 months ago and there are so many times that I don't know what to say or do.  I see people treating people with cancer differently as if their personality changed overnight to this person that is sick and helpless now.  The truth is that it can happen to any of us at any point in our lives.  Our job is to make sure that those we love know it and that we show it as often as we can.  There are no guarantees how long we have to mark our mark on the world.  Making a difference in the world and leaving a legacy of their lives was a key point discussed multiple times.  A person may have 80 years or 16 years to leave that mark, but the length of time doesn't determine how great an impact we can have on those we love and love us.<br /><br />Some details that I especially appreciated, given I'm going through this process with my brother right now, is that they want life to be as normal as possible.  The patient doesn't want to be the center of attention and a novelty for others to watch and comment upon.  Even when we have the best of intentions, too often we are looking at the situation from our perspective and the impact its having on our lives, instead of what the patient is going through.  I know that is true for me and it was a wake up call for me to focus on the right things.  Focus on all the great things about the person and the impact they have had on everyone around them.  Also, there are times when there truly is NOTHING to say.  Its ok to just be there and and besilent.  That can be as big a comfort as saying the exact right words, because there really aren't any perfect words for the situation.  Bottom line it SUCKS to have cancer.  Its how Hazel and Augustus chose to fight the battle that made the greatest impact on the reader.<br /><br />While there were tears and cheers at times, I found the story to be exactly what I needed to hear to try to be the best sister I can to my brother right now.<br /><br />John Green, thanks so much for pouring your heart and soul into this story.  It definitely showed!<br /><br />I give this book a SOLID 5 out of 5 stars!!
B00003CXAA|2.0|I was very dissappointed with the appearence of the outer case (as it was to be a gift) It was pretty scuffed up and still had sticker price tags on it that if were removed waould have ripped the package further. Needless to say so close to christmas and all had to ask my dad to switch out his. The disc were fine the package not so good.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This came quickly.  Just what my son wanted for Christmas. He was thrilled. Just one of the many reasons he loves his mom.
B003L20IHE|5.0|The DVD came in very good shape. There were no scratches or nicks the case cover was in very good shape. I had no problems watching the movie. If you like to watch movies then I recommend Amazon. It is the best place to find good deals on movies!!!
038572179X|5.0|I received this book promptly and in excellent condition.  This book has been chosen by my book club as a must-read.
B00633W614|5.0|I read the first part to this series &#34;Only Time Will Tell&#34; and it was such good reading that I couldn't wait to read the second part.
B00A993UWM|4.0|I personally enjoy this album more than her last.  It seems a little bit more &#34;grown up&#34; to me (I mean, as &#34;grown up&#34; as Kesha gets) but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's catchy pop, a great workout album, keeps you on your feet!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing Solitaire but after a half dozen games it gets old, so go to something else for awhile.
B00005JLIU|5.0|This musical cracks me up every time I watch it. The costumes, the oblivious Millie, Miss Dorothy's innocent mouth calling another woman a female dog...it's got a bit of everything. Marimba players be advised, there is a moment of marimba abuse that is difficult to watch, but once you're through it the rest is great.
B005HSL626|5.0|Really like this game, do better on this, takes pretty fast thinking & movement. This would be good for kids.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|This is a good show. It's like Alias meets the Dollhouse, but is itself worthy of 5 stars. Fast-paced, quickly addictive, and full of cool twists. Each episode gets better than the last, plus there are a lot of episodes, so you won't be sad after 15 or 16 episodes..because there's 22 of them! The finale is really good. I am purchasing season 2 after just tonight finishing season 1. I have to keep going with this awesome show.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Had no idea what to expect. Had not read a Stephen King novel since I was a teenager in the 90's. What an adventure!
1853261580|4.0|I bought it as a gift for a Pay it Forward initiative.  The gift recipients liked the book and hence the initiative was successful.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|really great condition, amazing for the price. it's one of my favorite movies so i'm so excited to now own it
B008QYT7DI|4.0|It's a short book that has much deeper meaning than one might think.  I read it in an hour and enjoyed it a lot.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|I am not usually into this genre of books.  I typically stick with murder/mystery books, but since this was a classic and was free, I decided to give it a try.  I love it!  The way Ms. Alcott developed these characters made me fall in love with them and think about them even when I wasn't actively reading the book.  Once finished, I found myself wondering what happend next to the characters and how they lived the rest of their lives.  Not something I usually think about after finishing a story.  Beautiful book and beautifully written.
0425252868|5.0|Best WWII story I have ever read!  Hard to put the book down once you start reading it.  I was a WWII &#34;Gold Star Child&#34; and am a USAF veteran and was particularly amazed to read about the chivalry of the German fighter pilots. I have already recommended this book to a lot of my friends. It is an AWSOME read!<br />CJF - Kansas City, MO
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|Loved this book! Finished it in one day. I am downloading the next one right after this review. A must read. Don't believe me download a free sample and get hooked yourself. So excited I found a new series to read and new people/caricatures to fall in love with. Off to download the next was. I have a feeling I'll be up late and passing out with my kindle in hand.
B0090X4HES|5.0|Luv dis cd., Arrived in a timely matter..Great customer service. Highly Recommended..! Will be ordering again in the near future..
B00005JLKB|4.0|The DvD set was a described by the seller, all discs in the set work and function properly. Also, the price was very fair.
1878424114|1.0|Deepak Chopra's The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is proof that the more you dumb down (and thus distort) Eastern spirituality, making it palatable for the clueless masses, the more books you can sell. Chopra has the formula down pat--reducing real Spirit-communion to \\"psychologized\\" feel-good mumbo-jumbo tied together with the ever-marketable concept of \\"success.\\"<br /><br />The seven spiritual \\"laws\\" of success that Chopra identifies are hardly immutable universal laws; they are merely his idea of what produces \\"success.\\" When Thomas Edison was asked the secret to success, he replied, \\"1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.\\" If Edison were alive today, and someone asked him the key to success in the New Age spiritual market, he'd probably observe the popularity of Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra and reduce it to one law: Get Oprah to push your teaching.
B002ZG976U|5.0|The DVD was practically brand new when I opened the package, and shipping was very fast as well! Would purchase from the seller time and time again,
B001JIDE3M|5.0|This is a Great product. Came quickly and was packaged well. Great seller, would do business with. If you haven't seem the movie, I recommend it highly
0783116934|5.0|THIS IS A 'HISTORICAL' MOVIE FOR ME...I saw it advertied once years ago... and I couldn't remember the name... but it haunted me... and I knew that it was about a Russian man....<br />It is about a serial murderer who chose children... mostly... and it is well done for the story it had to deal with... evocative... sad and frightening  to think that children, as I well know from my own experiences, are so eager to be liked and to please... so open and unafraid... the perfect victims... and this man did the unthinkable.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app lets you see everything about your battery how much voltage health for battery how much time you have untill it needs a charge I would get it if I was you
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE ANGRY BIRDS IS A FUN GAME. AND YES I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO FRIENDS. ITS GREAT
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a great read, get this book and soon. Awesome to read.you won't be able to put it down and if you do it won't work for long you have to pick it up again.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|The standing Kindle case is as practical as a book cover, convenient for everyday use,and has the additional feature to stand alone when I want to continue reading while my hands are busy. The bright red color makes it both pretty and easy to spot on my desk.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|Good quality fast delivery So that's why I like it.  What I don't is being forced to make my review so long.  It's my review not yours.
B00AY9RV90|5.0|With the understanding that this is the residual of their previous album, I think it's quite nice and a bit of a miracle to get more from new order than they usually give. Be very grateful. A bit on the rocky side this ep is. The electronics don't seem to mesh all to well, at least what I've come to expect but like I said, very good for the leftovers of waiting for the sirens call. Hope to see some new material in the next coming years.
B000301YY8|4.0|Good quality, good sound, fast delivery.  Yada, yada, yada, yada ,yada, yada, et., etc., etc. again, I like the CD but hate ur review process.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very clean app for the Kindle Fire! Easy to navigate and the graphics are good also. Thank you for making this a free app! Could always do without the ads, but thats what you get for free!
B0001CCY7E|3.0|Loved some of the music but some I didn't. The theme song was the reason I purchased it, of course I knew that the movie soundtrack would be included.
B000NY12LO|4.0|It dragged for me a bit. But delving into the psyche of a bullied teen (especially on the heels of the Colorado school shooting) was interesting.
B008Z9L8QI|3.0|I've been listening to SP for about 20 years, and consider myself a nerdfan. I was the guy buying singles back in the 90's to get b-sides that weren't otherwise available, and even I wouldn't pay this absurd price for an album I already own, even if it is expanded. I like the fact that there are a few of the Pastichio Medley songs in their full form here and some tracks from other demos from that era, but for $100+ I would expect a complete library of all 3 MCIS Demos, the Gravity Demos, all recorded songs that comprise the Pastichio Medley as well as whatever alternate versions of existing songs that were deemed necessary. I can do without rough cuts, tracks missing vocals and others that were released already if it means making room for songs that are never likely going to see the light of day. Those who want honey must have some money, but this release isn't sweet enough!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really liked it but it could've ended better or had another book. But it was a really good book
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finished this in a day! Once you start there's no perfect place to stop, except the end! Very very highly recommend this series!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My heart was pounding during the end. This is really good book. Katniss is a really good heroine. Peeta adds a loving twist to the book. As they fight for their lives they have to make the choice of life, death,  and Love all while being watched by the whole wide world. Then the twist that changes their whole wide world. The kiss seen around the world. The deaths of innocent little children like Rue. The best books ever. The movie is a lot different do not let it fool you.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I think the cast did a great job with this classic. It's high energy and a lot of fun. The scenery is gorgeous.
B000O3XU4G|5.0|I bought this to replace a copy of this edition which I thought is very well translated. The copy I got was marked &#34;very good,&#34; I<br />think. I found it a slight disappointment but overall am very glad to own this book again.
B002VPEAM6|5.0|I bought this book for my mother after seeing the movie. She found it comical and inspiring. She typically reads any book that Oprah suggests.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Perfect rental for a road trip.  Wish I could've purchased the movie instead of renting, but as usual, Toy Story is awesome
B000002GC2|5.0|If you haven't listened to this album in a while, do so immediately!  It is truly a classic and will bring back some good feelings.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys plot twists and suspense. Martin keeps you on your toes and begging for more.
B005VJ8ATS|5.0|As much of a fan as I am of the genre, I hesitate to even call this \\"science fiction\\" because it really is a very different kind of movie than one usually thinks of using that term. It's more like The Time Traveler's Wife than Star Wars, though even that comparison fails because Another Earth is far less \\"sci-fi\\" than even Time Traveler's Wife. In the end, Another Earth is simply a thoughtful, insightful, compelling story of loss and redemption that is based on a premise of the existence of another planet, though for much of the movie the reality of that is somewhat irrelevant. Well worth watching.
0385536828|5.0|Not a masterpiece but a thoroughly fun read. Told through the train of thought of a girl I could easily slip into. Tales of light espionage, relationships, and family. Definitely a fun read I recommend checking out!
B000AWYOGE|5.0|This is a good movie. In all the movie is just about a single mother trying to survive and take care of her daughter. But there is a ghost little girl whose looking for a mother. So you know where this going.
B0000028VT|5.0|Legendary, Classic, Timeless, Magical<br />have some of Mariah Carey's best work,<br />WORTH EVERY DIME<br />i lover everything about this album
B005OK721G|5.0|This movie is awesome!! It's perfect for those who like those action and on the edge of your seat movies.
B000002BQK|5.0|Classic R&B,<br />this record has some of Mariah Carey's best work,<br />WORTH EVERY DIME<br />i lover everything about this album
B002XTXG1G|3.0|This movie looked cool looking at the cover and I enjoy watching movies based on true events. It has good fighting scenes and good storyline on the guy Charles Bronson but I always recommend reading the true facts on the story on wiki or some reliable source since movies usually exaggerate. The soundtrack was very annoying and the some the scenes could've been done better. I'd wait till this movie goes down in price or better yet just rent it.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah Carey's come back effort, The Emancipation of Mimi<br />The Ultra Platinum Edition [CD/DVD Combo] has what you need<br />my personal favourite on the 2nd disk track 16. Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do) &<br />17. So Lonely (One & Only Part II)
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This is a wonderful, well crafted novel. The characters are perfectly developed, each with their own unique voice. I think this novel would mean even more to someone that lived in the 70's, but I as a 20-something still found it captivating. I highly recommend it.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|5 stars for this album..<br />my personal favourites: Oh Santa, One Child, When Christmas Comes, Auld Lang Syne (The New Year's Anthem)
B008K6HN8I|5.0|the title says it all.  free to boot!  I'd say a must have if you want to go a little deeper into your kindle fire hd
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I have watched this show since it began. I have the whole series and tell other people about it as well. I can't get enough of Dean!
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Great acting. It had a great twist at the end!  It was an all around scary jumpy movie! A must see.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I read this for the second time, and I couldnt put it down, even though I had already read it years ago.  It is so good, that knowing generally what will happen didnt hinder the enjoyment.  It is truly a fantastic series.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|The benchmarks don't lie, if you don't plan on overclocking this CPU is the sweet spot. You get nearly 3570k benchmarks at a much cheaper price. Overclockers should avoid though.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Faster than you can think<br />Ridiculously cool temperatures<br />Inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fan isn't quite silent<br />no overclocking
B008X9Z37A|2.0|case in cheaply madethe top is not to sturdy but it will do till I can afford the one I want
B002ZBTWL0|5.0|Let me begin by admitting that I am not a musicologist.  That fact, I believe, puts me squarely in midst of music lovers who are simply moved by what they hear.  With that in mind, I highly recommend this recording of Attila. Whether you are a long-time Verdi fan (as I am) or are merely experimenting with Verdi for the first time, you can't go wrong with this recording in your music collection.  If Muti's version doesn't \\"grab\\" you I'm not sure what will.  The price is certainly right.  Why not give it a try?
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums currently. Macklemore explores such a range of issues, topics and emotions, many of them outside of the usual range of hip hop music, and with beats and vocals more complex than most hip hop albums. Same Love is one of my favorite songs, ever, and I'm pretty sure Thrift Shop was written especially for me. I highly recommend this album.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I have always loved this book and i might go see the new movie that is so not like this instead it is about a wizard named oz
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This series is one of the best series I have ever read. The books keep getting better as I move on in the series. I will definitely recommend this book to others.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I literally could not put the book down! I just wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great--no problems at all with it.  It charges super fast, and the 5-foot cord is a definite convenience.  Once again, Amazon comes through with quality.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Pros:<br /><br />Nice quality<br />Easily adjustable mic<br />Mic comes across clearly<br />Clip on the remote to attach to your clothes or something on your desk, making the wire less to worry about.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Uncomfortable since day 1 when gaming for 1+ hour.<br />Literally fell apart piece by piece (also happened to a friend with the exact same headphones)***<br /><br />***I'm not the type of gamer to throw my headphones around the room, either.  I buy something, i take care of it.  Took care in taking them off my head and setting them on my desk every time.<br /><br />To me, not even reducing the price on these things would be worth.  Just not a quality product in my opinion.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I've had the folio case for a year, and it's offered good protection for my Kindle while also looking pretty slick and being reasonably priced.  My only criticism of it would be that relating to the top two corners peeling back from the base, which is what happened after a year and necessitated by buying a new one.  However, I carry my Kindle with me everywhere, and it gets hard use on a regular,daily basis so I would think that the cover would work fine for the average user..
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Watch him win the American Idol and have been following him since.  Phillip is one of the best story tellers in music.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This a compelling and well written story. I loved this book, I couldn't put it down.  My heart broke for Sky but I'm glad Holden and her aunt were there to help her through it.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|The movie has an interesting premise: a school for super heroes and their sidekicks. The storyline was quite different as they hone their skills and some super heroes are pitted against the ingenuity of the sidekicks. The feats of some reminded me of X-Men. The story kept my interest all the way through.<br /><br />The Bonus features showing how some of the stunts were done by the actors themselves was a great peak behind the scenes.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Bought this album after hearing Ho Hey about a dozen times on SiriusXM. There is nothing not like about this album. Distinctive sound, not too far off from Mumford and Sons and Fleet Foxes. I can really appreciate their album as it is a departure from today's synthesized, bass-lead music that tops the charts. The Lumineers are worth looking into, as they are really going places.
0385340567|2.0|Bummer, just when I thought I had been able to replace the left leaning Stuart Woods and the butchery he's done to the Stone Barrington character, Lee Childs writes and anti Christian, anti U.S. book - where he makes the folks who flee the Iraqi War re-enlistment to Canada: the heroes and the Crazy Christian Guy: the diabolical fiend.  Yawn, how many times has that same story been written - - - Christianity is an easy philosophy to attack, our philospher tells us to turn the other cheek, and for me to close my wallet to Lee Childs books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow is all I can say. Thank you for writing this book, its amazing. I fell in love with it!!!!
0321857895|2.0|I am a big Mike Rohde fan and was looking forward to reading this book on the metro ride to work. I can look at it on my Macintosh at work (and presumably at home). It looks good.<br /><br />But there are only about 6-8 visible pages on my iPad. Someone at Amazon should be doing some basic q/a on their product before it gets released. And Mike Rohde should yell either at his publisher or at Amazon.<br />Update - he is aware of the problem and working on it:<br />From RohDesign.com:<br />\\"Kindle Issues - Almost There (I Hope)<br />Not all of the news is good, in particular issues with the Kindle edition on iPad.<br /><br />The Kindle version issues have been tougher to solve than I think anyone expected them to be. I worked with the Peachpit team to created some modified documents to help troubleshoot the issues, and hopefully that will identify and rectify the problems we're seeing.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure the issue is only affecting Kindle Reader on the iPad, as I was able to see the entire document on Kindle Reader for the Mac. If you have the Kindle edition on a Kindle Fire or Android Tablet, I would love to hear your feedback. Right now we have the Kindle book pulled while we resolve the issue - hopefully soon. I apologize for this and appreciate your patience.\\"
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great book and a way to face reality and life itself. Even if it's just a journal.
0316228532|1.0|I was very excited since I loved all of the Harry Potters books. I do not like reading books with bad language for one thing which surprised me from her but the story was just so awful and the characters sounded like they were from some criminal minds episode. I took it back after reading a third of it and got my money back to spend on something worth reading.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This book kept me enthralled and interested through out with quite an unexpected ending.<br />Well, written and easy to read
034580404X|3.0|Decent book.  A little too much sex.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|The story is quite grabbing but I found myself skipping a lot of pages particularly in the beginning and when his philosophy on religion etc was written about.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very entertaining and easy in New to these type games and beat it property quick. U need to buy it
B009GIPDQS|5.0|an excellent read, interesting, well written, with a nice twist in the tail.<br />I found this book easy to follow
B001BANK32|4.0|Well worth the price for the book. STEPHEN KING what a great Arthur, probably my second favorite king book .
