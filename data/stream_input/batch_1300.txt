B0060AY6FO|3.0|P.D. James' \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" continues the story of most of the characters featured in Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  At the beginning of her sequel, James briefly summarizes the significant action and the temperament of the most significant characters in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", so it is not necessary to be familiar with Austen's book.  Not only being familiar with Austen's novel, but also liking it, will make \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" a more enjoyable read.<br /><br />Pemberley is the magnificent estate of Mr. Darcy, husband of the former Elizabeth Bennett. It is fairly close to Highmarten House, where Elizabeth's sister, Jane, her children, and her husband, Mr. Bingley, reside.  The two families exist, for the most part, in peaceful harmony until their sibling Lydia, wife  of the charming, but disreputable. Mr. Wickham decides to surprise Elizabeth by showing up at Pemberley, where her husband is not welcome. Murder and chaos follow, disrupting all of the characters' lives.<br /><br />James, as always, writes well and does a very credible job of expanding on Austen's book using a distinctly Austen style.  Don't expect much detective work in this novel, however.  Readers expecting an Adam Dalgliesh-like book will be disappointed. The \\"mystery\\" takes fourth place to James' description of the characters, how they interact, and  what their lives have become. James' handling of only one of the characters surprised me a little.<br /><br />I confess I'm not a fan of  books that continue/expand on plot lines and characters created by famous, classic authors. Usually these classics begin and end where they should and are best left to stand alone, leaving readers to imagine --if they want to -- what came next. P.D. James is an extraordinarily talented author.  \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" is well written and skillfully adopts Austen's style, although it is missing some central elements of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", including how these qualities impact people's lives and what will happen in the romantic lives of the characters.  I liked it, but the plot left me rather flat, and I'd rather leave Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy, Jane, Mr. Bingley as Austen does. (I would not mind at all a new Dalgliesh...)<br /><br />Three stars.the romantic lives of the characters.  I liked it, but the plot left me rather flat, and I'd rather leave Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy, Jane, Mr. Bingley as Austen does. (I would not mind at all a new Dalgliesh...)  Three stars.
1423140591|5.0|Second in the Heroes of Olympus fantasy-adventures series for kids starring Percy Jackson of Percy Jackson and the Olympians fame.<br /><br />My Take<br />Riordan has started the Heroes series to differentiate between the Greeks (Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and the Romans (Heroes of Olympus). The purpose of this particular installment is to identify more demigods for the Prophecy of Seven and cement the alliance between two rival factions.<br /><br />Okay, I v-e-r-y slowly understood why Percy's memory was tampered with but I don't understand why people he knew--and knew that they knew Percy--cooperated in not filling Percy in with his lost memories? Sure, Nico says he can't interfere, but, why not?<br /><br />Oh man...the Roman navy...snicker, laugh, guffaw...just wait til you get to that part! Oh, and then the part about the grains kidnapping Hazel! Too funny as they try to bribe Hazel into giving up to torture and death by promising her \\"grain. So much grain\\" just before Wheat dissolves into Chex Mix.<br /><br />It's a journey of battle and self-discovery for our three heroes and Riordan provides enough laughter, tension, and drama to make this a truly fascinating story. The jerk. Now I have to wait for The Mark of Athena scheduled for publication in 2012!! So not fair!<br /><br />The Story<br />Percy is beginning to think this chase with the gorgons will never end. It doesn't matter how often or how he kills them, they just keep getting up and coming after him. So it's a good bit of fortune when he comes across Hazel and Frank guarding the door to the inside of the Caldecott Tunnel in the Berkeley Hills. Jumping inside followed up by a rockfall slows the gorgons down giving the three the chance to cross the Little Tiber River to safety.<br /><br />Well, not literal safety for the Romans who \\"greet\\" them are so not happy to see him. The only real rescue is when Percy proves that he has amnesia. Then Percy, Frank, and Hazel take the First Cohort's battle flag after successfully storming the castle--a most unexpected, somewhat unwelcome maneuver by the other cohorts.<br /><br />But Mars appears as a result of it and demands they take on a quest. A quest to rescue Thanatos. For without Death, the Romans and Greeks don't stand a chance against their enemies as Gaea has seized Thanatos and his Doors of Death. She controls who stays dead and who comes back to life and if Gaea can keep bringing their enemies back to life...<br /><br />It all has to be done in four days. Four measly days to sail to Alaska, find and rescue Thanatos, and return to Camp to help in the battle.<br /><br />The battle will go against them if they fail and Octavian is doing his best to ensure their failure. It takes the three of them willing to sacrifice to affect the outcome of their quest and the survival of their friends and family.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Percy Jackson has lost his memory and is fumbling his way across country.<br /><br />Hazel Levesque is a daughter of Pluto and cursed with wrenching up jewels and precious metals from under the earth. Objects which result in the death of anyone who touches them. Queen Marie is her greedy mother suckered into a deal with Gaea. Nico de Angelo pretends to not know Percy; he is Hazel's brother and the ambassador from Pluto. Sammy Valdez, a.k.a., Leo, was Hazel's first love back in 1941 before her mother uprooted them to Alaska.<br /><br />Frank Zhang can't believe it's possible for him to live up to the legacy his father and grandmother tell him is his. His grandmother is mean with a strong sense of family and pride. His father simply ignores him until Frank pulls off a heroic feat. His mother Emily died saving her unit in battle.<br /><br />Camp Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood. Reyna is the current praetor of the Twelfth Legion and, without Jason, solely responsible for its defense. She rides a pegasus named Scipio, a.k.a., Skippy. Octavian is their reader of auguries and areally nasty kid not above using blackmail to get what he wants. It cracks me up that he \\"rips the entrails\\" from teddy bears to read an augury. (I also think he's a bit psychotic...)<br /><br />Dakota and Gwen are the centurions for the Fifth Cohort, a.k.a., the Fulminata. The dishonored legion which gets all the lousy jobs and is the first sent into battle, especially if it will result in destruction. Jason Grace was their praetor until he went missing back in October. It was due to Jason that the Fifth was starting to make a comeback from their disgrace in the 1980s when Michael Varus insisted upon attacking in Alaska to fulfill that prophecy.<br /><br />Don is a faun and Gaius Vitellius Reticulus is a Lares, a household god, a.k.a., a ghost of a dead legionnaire. Hylla is the current queen of the Amazons (and Reyna's sister)--what we know as Amazon.com--and does she ever have a mad hate for Percy! Kinzie is one of Hylla's adherents.<br /><br />Annabeth is mentioned as is Jason Grace. Tyson and Mrs. O'Leary show up just in time to escort Ella and help in the battle at Camp Jupiter. Thanatos is Death; Pluto's right-hand man. While Pluto sees to the holes in the boundaries between life and death, Thanatos goes after the souls who escape back into Life. Iris is the rainbow and messenger goddess and runs a health food store in between. Sigh...Iris has finally found her own identity. Fleecy is her assistant.<br /><br />Stheno and Euryale are the gorgons chasing Percy. June/Juno/Hera is Zeus/Jupiter`s wife and she has been manipulating Percy for the past eight months. Gaea is waking and sending her sons, the giants, to Camp Jupiter to destroy it; the first stage of the conquest of Earth. Alcyoneus is Gaea's eldest giant son and he cannot be killed in his homeland; Polybotes is a brother and leads the forces against Camp Jupiter. Otrera was one of the original Amazon queens until she died; now she's back and challenging Hylla for her throne.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover presents the essence of the story with Percy holding the 5th Cohort's eagle as he balances himself on a floating slab of ice with Hubbard Glacier looming up behind him.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game was one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read. It was the fast-paced and thoughtful tale about humanity's only hope, six-year-old Ender Wiggin. It covers the military's forging of the boy into an unwitting, yet ruthless killer who must save humanity from an alien species bent on Earth's destruction. It is a poignant account of how military officers put a young prodigy through trials that have driven others insane.<br /><br />The characters of Ender, Valentine, and Peter are rich and multi-layered. The plot is masterful, and the book is a pleasure to read. I highly recommend it for science fiction fans and those interested in military strategy.

B005ELQVGW|5.0|This album is the one I've been hoping for from Björk, for some time. Her creativity on \\"Biophilia\\" is off-the-hook, a sequel of sorts to her _a capella_ album \\"Medùlla\\" (which I would also recommend). Happily, Björk's heavily gamelan instrumentation is vibrant, pleasant to the ear, and deeply intriguing.  The lyrics on this album center around a poetic storytelling of the progress of the Universe, as currently understood by science. Her verses are succinct facts of physics. Unlike some of her earlier albums, the lyrics don't feel like random lists of nouns. There's great poetry to the lyrics.  The booklet includes almost all the lyrics (not 'Dark Matter' for some reason; is it a play on words? we can't see the words because they are dark matter?). The artwork is fun, and mostly variations of what you see on the cover. Most striking in the art design is the incredible font based on a music staff used for the song titles.  Stand-out tracks are 'Crystalline', 'Cosmogony', 'Virus' and 'Solstice'. But, \\"Biophilia\\" is really a concept album, meant to be taken as a whole.  I really enjoy \\"Biophilia.\\" It definitely stands as a high point in Björk's repertoire.

0913866156|5.0|I was told by my Uncle to buy some tarot cards, in order to, I don't know, help my psychic development. I looked at a few decks, then there was this one, when I saw this deck I knew it's the one I wanted, the colors, the art, they were all what I was looking for. Really lovely set of cards, probably the best deck out there.
0743550927|5.0|I've always loved this book....from the first time I read it...many years ago, until I'm re-listening to it now.  Frank McCourt was indeed a very special man, with a special way of telling a story. It was a terrible childhood for him and his brother, but to write it in an enjoyable story like Angelas's Ashes is just amazing to me. To have come through all the tradegy in his life and go on to become an awesome teacher (please read \\"Teacher Man\\") to so many is an astounding feat.  I purchased this audio not for myself but to give as a gift to my family physician who is an \\"irish catholic\\" man with a very gentle demeanor. I hope he enjoys it as much as I think he will.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really worth it !!! it keeps me busy for hours!  some games are hard some games are easy but they are all tons of fun download! !!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app is great. works exactly as described.  I can even watch movies with no lag.  only complaint is that when useing 2 monitors on Pc the second monitor is laggy on the tablet ... but I'm guessing this is because its still using memory to keep the other monitor alive ... maybe a option to free up monitor 1 when monitor is being displayed who fix that.  other than that amazing ... get it while its free 1/6/12
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app, I'm rating it so I can get points. I would definatly get his app. if they made a sequel to this game I would play it.

B001P06GX4|4.0|We had already researched this product and knew it was what we wanted. The pieces are plastic and I'm always afraid I am going to break them but, so far they have held up. My entire family loves this game. It arrived on time and we are very satisfied with it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have to congratulate Deborah Harkness for her writing. For 600 pages I became completely caught up in the characters, the settings, the historical nuggets, and the world this author has built. Yes, this is at its heart a romance, but it's also so much more.  I thought Matthew was a lovely, fascinating alpha male (are we really going to require a 1500 year old man to live up to the demands of modern day feminists in his behavior? That would have been very poor characterization.) Diana was a normal, sometimes strange woman, but I liked that. I liked her specialness. She ate a lot. she slept a lot. She did impulsive things and had a high energy level. Her emotions were strong and I could really relate to her.  This isn't a book you read for plot, although there were lots of fascinating plot points that kept me turning the pages. Maybe because I'm also an author, I could sort of sense Ms. Harkness setting up seemingly innocuous moments that will certainly come into play in the later books. I'm looking forward to that. I loved the sensory nature of this book. I loved the conversations and the matter of fact way that magic flitted in and out of every scene. This is not a modern, barge-through-the-plot, finish-and-forget type book. This is a book you have to sink down into to really appreciate. I'll be re-reading it several more times before the sequel comes out, and I'm sure with each reading I'll notice even more of the little details the author wove into the story.  I loved this book and if you like rich, emotional, multi-layered books about life and magic, I think you will too!

B004EPYZUI|2.0|What can I say, the movie was boring.  The WW1 scenes were unrealistic.  The story was blah.  I fell asleep the first time I watched it; watched it again and still wasn't impressed.  The girls were cute though.

B001E9641K|5.0|There aren't a lot of good two-player board games, but this one is an exception.  Designed for 2-3 players, it balances well as a two playre board game without being either overly simple or overly complex.  Although the winter-themed motif makes it great game for staying indoors when it's snowy out; it's a fun gaem year-'round and a good game to introduce people to Ticket to Ride without needing a large group.

B000002LQR|4.0|The Chili Peppers have been around for almost 29 years. The band is much older than me or any of my friends who know and listen to them. We grew up with the Chili Peppers as a famous band with great songs from the past twenty years that had become major hits. But back in early 1991, the Chilis were mostly just an alternative rock group that had a mix of funk, punk, and metal that didn't always come together perfectly with the reputation of performing only wearing one sock each. They were crazy party animals whose first guitarist died in 1988 from an overdose. They had four albums, only one of which made it on Billboard.<br /><br />Blood Sugar changed all that into what we know today. Two of their most successful songs ever, \\"Under the Bridge\\" and \\"Give it Away,\\" came from this album. It was the right combination of music types that came out at the right time, when people were looking for new types of rock to go mainstream. There are plenty of great songs, especially those two singles. \\"Breaking the Girl\\" has a great little bridge with a bunch of percussion sounds, and there are plenty of great sounds and funky lyrics on songs like \\"If You Have to Ask,\\" \\"Apache Rose Peacock,\\" and \\"My Lovely Man.\\" The chorus in \\"The Power of Equality\\" is in a minor chord or something and sounds a little sour, but it works. There are also some sexual references, such as the name of the song \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and, the eight and a half minute monster, \\"Sir Psycho Sexy.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the biggest flaw on this album is that several of these songs sound very similar. A friend of mine will often play songs from Blood Sugar in a playlist, and I know that the songs are by the Chili Peppers right away, but can't figure out what song it is without listening to the lyrics. I'd say there are five or six songs like that (which is why it's only four stars). Strangely enough, \\"Under the Bridge\\" and \\"Give it Away\\" are very different songs compared to each other, and aside from the five similar songs, the rest of the album follows suit in trying to expand the type of music that the band is coming up with. There are some softer, sweeter songs, like the sorrowful \\"Under the Bridge,\\" one of the first times that frontman Anthony Kiedis really sings, or \\"I Could Have Lied.\\" There are some more crazy songs, like \\"The Greeting Song\\" (whose lyrics I still mostly cannot understand to this day).<br /><br />This one album showcases the Chili Peppers' versatility and different musical styles, a great mix between the good ole days that many people aren't aware of and the success that came afterwards.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I've had several friends who have had the same problem with these PS3 Turtle Ear Force PX21 headsets.  They are fantastic when they don't have a fairly regular issue with the connection of the wiring into the headset.  The headsets have a piece of tubing where they are inserted into the headset that is no doubt heat shrinkable tubing with the purpose of holding the wires tightly to the head set so the internal wiring is not able to be pulled free from their attachment to the circuit board.  Unfortunately the tubing is not holding the wiring properly and just use with no abuse allows the inserted wire to work loose, straining the connect point to the circuit board.  I had these for just about 60 days when this happened.  As I read the Amazon exchange policy, \\"Pound Sand, so sad, too bad\\".  They offer an unspecified refund, starting at only 50% at the minimum, and you pay freight both ways.  I don't think I would buy this or many other electronic items through Amazon in the future.  Looks like they only offer exchange with 30 days of purchase.  BE WARNED.
1568363931|5.0|The Delivery came a day early. It was a nice, exciting surprise and the book was in great shape, too!<br /><br />The book: I love the layout. Every thing is easy to read and scan! The only thing that was missing was a calorie estimate. I know it's something you can easily look up, but it would be great if in the next edition, something like that could be added. The recipes are fun and there are things that I really want to try, though I've felt that some of the foods in them were okay before. The most difficulty I have understanding is the tamiyagi eggs, but I'm not sure if thats an author error or my own. I love the step-by-step pictures, though!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|-Read on Kindle-<br />I just wanted to add another 5-star review, I'm sure I have nothing new to add.  AWESOME book.  Didn't realize there was a movie coming out until I had read all three, so I hope they don't butcher the story.<br /><br />Great story, well flushed out characters.  No graphic blood/gore/sex.  Heavy stuff, not for little kids, but teens and up will appreciate it.  Not written \\"for children\\" but at a level most people will be able to understand.  I'm a 27 yr old English minor, so I have read a lot of material.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying and reading.  One of the few books that after I finished the trilogy I almost wanted to start them all over again. SOO good.

Katniss is growing as a person, as we see that.  We get some character development on our guys, I think there's more development of characters in this book than the first two.  I thought the ending was great.  Wouldn't mind another one telling more about what happens after.  Hoping the movie does well enough we get all the books.  Hope they don't butcher the great story.  LOVED IT.

B0067AC5KA|5.0|If you haven't read this you haven't lived. If you've read it life is over. What am I going to read next after this amazing trilogy. Doesnt seem like anything will live up to it  RIP Stieglitz Larsson. You left a truly amazing story behind. I will probably read it again
0446677450|5.0|I LOVED this book.  If I had read this book right after I got my bachelor's degree, I would have been happier as well as wiser.  Its book title and premise seem inflammatory to academics of the finance and business fields but Kiyosaki has to sell his book to make the public want to pick it up.  However, you \\"can't judge a book by its cover.\\"  As far as PRACTICAL knowledge and education, I got more out of this book than I did attending a first semester finance community college class.  It basically explains how society \\"conditions\\" us into thinking all we have to do is 1) go to school 2) get a well-paying job afterwards 3) work ALL YOUR LIFE and climb the ladder of corporate success to get promoted 4) save for retirement.  He does this by comparing the financial life of his true father who was an educated professional who became a \\"wage slave\\" compared to the financial life of his friend's uneducated but wealthy financially independent free-wheeling father who \\"took him under his wings\\" and helped mentor him into becoming financially astute from a very young age.  Unlike the main critical reviewer, if you read the book, Kiyosaki doesn't cite how EASY it is to be rich - in fact he confesses he failed a number of times to start a business even after YEARS of experience learning about business since he was a child and even lived homeless for a while with his wife because he was that desperate and determined to succeed.  His point is that we are \\"conditioned\\" to act in certain ways such that our appetite for risk is usually dampened - For example, we're conditioned to strive for better paying jobs but which take up more of our precious time, energy, and effort as well as money RATHER THAN take risks such as starting a business or striving for royalties and patents which could make us money again and again without us PHYSICALLY having to be present EVERY MINUTE in order for $$'s to keep rolling in.  His point is that if you want to be FREE from the daily 9 to 5 rat race, then you have to take risks, make your money work for you rather than spend it all on ipods, playstations, cars, and new houses - Understand what is an expense and what is a liability and what is an asset. For example, buying a bigger house is NOT an asset - it's a liability - and especially after the 2007 mortgage crisis crash, his statement CERTAINLY PROVES TRUE!!  He also introduces certain important concepts such as \\"leverage\\" in a simple but clear way without you needing to be a college finance whiz.  If you're looking for a \\"Get Rich Quick Scheme\\" book, you'll be disappointed.  Instead, what you should take from the book is that you have to keep your eyes and mind open for opportunities (and there are always a few out there somewhere) just as he did if you wish to escape the 9 to 5 rat race.  Any failures in your quest to make more money should be regarded as helpful experiences for the next time that you continue on your quest.  He brings home the point that the rich and those who strive to be rich look at the world as a GAME and that in order to cross \\"Go\\" and collect your $200 and more, you have to think outside of the box, that there are rules but there are also OPPORTUNITES.  His book should be read as inspirational as well educational.<br /><br />A lot of what he says is repetitive and he's not the best WRITTEN author about business (which he freely admits), but for any layman who knows NOTHING about business and who's initially learning about business and finance and wants to understand it from a REAL WORLD point of view that's BASIC, DOWN-TO-EARTH, his book would be a PRIMER book on MY list and I've even recommended it to others also naive about how making money works and/or who think their economic situations are hopeless.then you have to take risks, make your money work for you rather than spend it all on ipods, playstations, cars, and new houses - Understand what is an expense and what is a liability and what is an asset.

B001W6S0C6|5.0|I first saw this movie over 22 years ago when it first hit theaters. As soon as the VHS version came out I picked up a copy. Although, I watched it multiple times as a kid I still misheard dialog making it not make sense and mistook some of the murders the Joker committed as being random instead of premeditated. For example, when the Joker kills that mobster on the steps of I believe either city hall or the court house for years I thought that was a random killing, but later after seeing the same mobster in another scene where he refuses to accept Joker's authority over Grissom's gang after Joker kills Grissom in retaliation for setting him up for having an affair with Grissom's mistress the killing makes perfect sense. Joker's killing of Grissom for a while seemed dicey and excessive until years later I was finally able to understand the plot behind it. For a long time I thought Joker had simply gone mad and was killing people he previously associated with at random with no rhyme or reason. As time went on the movie actually improved as I was able to better understand The Joker's motivation . After recently seeing the movie on TV after so many years I didn't hesitate to pick up a copy on blu ray and I'm glad I did.

1594202842|3.0|I won't retell the content but rather give you my take on it. I liked reading about the \\"hands-on\\" exploration of the differences between \\"extreme micromanaged parenting\\" (or whatever you want to call it) and a more typical Western (think permissive & encouraging) approach. I have long had a problem with parents who praise capable children for achievements far below their potential. One anecdote is that of the author becoming upset with the children not appreciating her birthday and giving her quickly made birthday cards. It may seem rough but the kids themselves later admitted that their mother was right. This puts the right emphasis on the importance of doing better than just \\"ok\\" and on the importance of respect for one's parents.  Having said that, the author's approach to parenting seems unnecessarily extreme. There is a lot of time spent trying to perfect the children's performances but it does not always achieve the best outcome especially with the younger daughter. There are many great times together that to an outsider appear ruined by overbearing practices.   Near the end, literally on the last page, the author seems to admit that life is short and she still doesn't know how best to live life to its fullest. To me that should have been the focal point of the entire book instead of descriptions of continuous drilling of her kids on the violin or on the piano. If there is a sequel, this is what it should be about and it would ideally include the grown-up kids' perspective in their own words.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this ap. easy to use, cant believe its free. has everything I wanted including an easy search feature, and easy to read print
B005Z271Y6|5.0|If I have to summarize my review in just a few words, it's got to be Wow and again WOW! This lady is a gift from God and her voice just permeates through your whole being. I have to admit I was not an Adele fan before and I bought this disc more for the hype surrounding her chart topping songs. But boy, am I glad I did. To say I was blown away is an understatement; I felt like I was there among the audience at the Royal Albert cheering her on, finding myself totally drawn in by her powerful voice and I also felt an emotional connection. There are so many songs in the disc that appeals to me like I'll Be Waiting, Set Fire To The Rain (and I haven't heard those songs before this) but the icing on the cake got to be the last two numbers - Someone Like You and Rolling In The Deep. This blu-ray is worth every dime just for those songs and as a bonus, you even get a CD of the songs to play in your car. And how can you improve on such an awesome performance? By producing a 3D version and the option of having the lyrics on the screen.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I don't review many of the things I buy on Amazon but I had to review this. Generally I do not buy covers for electronic devices because I think they add bulk and take away from the beauty of the device. Furthermore with a modicum of care you should be able to get at least two years out of a device without too much wear and how often do we keep devices beyond that time frame. Because I knew I would be throwing the Kindle Fire into into my briefcase and suitcase I though I would get a cover.  This case is perfect. It adds a lot of protection and very little weight or bulk and it looks good as well.  Highly recommended.

B005RJ6AIK|4.0|I saw the movie recently, and while watching the credits, turned to my husband saying: \\"We have got to get that soundtrack!\\" I've enjoyed Hawaiian slack key guitar music since my first trip to the islands 30 years ago. This album is a wonderful collection of authentic, mellow island music, and it introduced me to several artists I had not heard before. I'll be playing this alot - especially when I want to be reminded of the aloha atmosphere I miss so much between visits there.  By the way, we enjoyed the movie very much - George Clooney is terrific and anyone who has travelled on Oahu, Kauai, or Hawaii (the Big Island) will get a kick out of identifying the various beautiful locations.
1451627289|2.0|I had never read one of King's books and thought I would try this one because of the Texas connection.  What a disappointment!  If this is typical of his books, I will never read another one and regret wasting my money on this one.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I am not an audiophile, but I don't use super crappy headphones either. I found the E6 to ultimately act like a nice, surprising set of slightly better headphones, and not at all a bad deal for the price. You know what I mean...the first time you put on PX-100's from your stock headphones, or upgraded from those horrible white apple buds?<br />I tried these in 3 different scenarios:<br />1) with my Grado 60s I really felt like there was a nice clarity and punch to all sorts of music. I found that with the Grados listening to Apple Lossless I was getting best results with setting #1, the flat EQ. Generally speaking, I like a flat sound, but it was punchier with the E6, with a better space and no clipping or other distortion. It didn't seem as pronounced with classical music to me.<br />2) in the car, using an ipod nano via stock Honda stereo. Gotta say that it really gave a nice improvement on setting #3. It made listening fun again. It isn't magic, just clearer and cleaner<br />3) Apple Lossless via Ultimate Ears Triple Fi 10Pro, my preferred portable earphones - here I didn't notice a whole lot of difference in anything. To me, the TF10s already have a lovely aural space and flat sound, and maybe (placebo effect?) there was a little more punch with the E6 across jazz, pop, and classical.<br /><br />I don't like the muddiness of setting #2, and can't imagine where I would use it.<br /><br />For the price, I think it is well worth it. They are fun, not magic. They clean up the sound a bit and give it a fresh sound that adds some dimensionality to some music with some gear. I'm sure this is a gateway drug and before you know it I will be buying a $500 headphone amp. It is hard to go back...

B004XDYJRU|2.0|Tried the free version for a few days and found the app very useful on the Kindle Fire as well as my HTC Rezound.  It's got plenty of stations to choose from and easy access to popular podcasts, too. However, I grabbed this version yesterday and was disappointed to find that the recording feature fails.  Actually it looks like it's recording, and it even creates a file as if it's recorded somethign, but after completing a recording, nothing shows up on the \\"Recordings\\" tab.

1878424114|5.0|I found this book in a book sale at my local library. I had always heard of Deepak but for most of my life was wary of what I considered \\"New Age\\" philosophy, thinking it too simple. But this book has some very good ideas that can't hurt to believe in and can inspire us to change for the better - to evolve. I have had enough experiences with \\"coincidences\\" to know that Deepak is on to something. And the more I clue into them, the more they seem to happen. I am not saying I am GOOD at following these laws, but I believe I suffer when I don't. My favorite law is that we are all unique and have something we do better than anyone else in the world. I love telling that one to people - their eyes usually light up at the remembrance of it. Deepak knows he is not saying anything knew, but giving us gentle reminders of what we already know, deep down in our Souls. What a wonderful man and gentle Soul. Thanks, Deepak, for this perfect little book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Downloaded this when they offered it as the free app of the day. I just LOVE it and look forward to using it when I am away on vacation. I have always wanted to be able to remotely retrieve files off my home computer and this thing worked the first time I installed it. Just remember to download Splashtop Streamer onto your home computer - and that is free also! BTW - I am running it on my Acer Iconia A500 tablet and so far it works flawlessly.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|The app itself is great. Many Bible translations at your fingertips.  However, none of it available without an active Internet connection. Not my own personal study notes, not my calender, not a single verse!  It is useless to me at church, during visitation, or at a home study group.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I found out about this book through a tweet from Avett Nation. I love anything Avett Brothers and decided to give the book a try.  From the first couple of pages- I was hooked. I'm not an avid reader and this book captured my every attention. The characters were so real. I was disappointed when it ended. I formed a bond with the characters  and was so sad to see it end- I guess thats what a good book does to you. The best part of this book is the poetry- incredible! Thank you Colleen!!!

B003Q6D25K|4.0|With a much bigger (if still small by Hollywood standards) budget than the brilliant original, this upstart does it again.  We discover that this is really a prequel that sets the stage for the who, why and when all this ghostly stuff occurs.  We move beyond the young couple in \\"1\\" and here see a complete family unit.  A father on his second marriage - with a teenage daughter in tow - his new wife and their newborn son.  After strange sounds and events begin the couple installs strategically placed cameras throughout the house.  This of course is how we see all the spooky stuff...but not any physical beings...until the end.  Plenty of gotchas of course, but genuinely creepy.  Stillllllll!  At some point don't you call 911?

I acquired this app for my Kindle fire and it is quickly becoming my \\"go to\\" Bible of choice.  I can quickly change between Bible versions without losing my place or cluttering my desk.  Incorporated in the app is a ton of different Bible studies to choose from.  Only thing I miss is a good concordance.
B004VF68AQ|3.0|This album is basically boring from a truly creative perspective. In many ways I can appreciate the quality of the song writing, the melodies, the hooks. But who listens to Jane's Addiction to hear normal well crafted pop rock songs? This album is what one would call slick. Its perfected to death, its overdubbed with electronics, its had the life choked out of it. Gone are the cool Zeppy grooves, gone are the Pink Floyd moments of psychedelia, gone are the surprises and unpredictability.<br /><br />Personally I don't think the lack of Eric Avery has anything to do with it. Both Strays and even the overlooked Panic Channel album at least had the Zep moments, but this album sounds like Perry told the band he just wants to write some good straightforward songs, nothing fancy. And that's what we got.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are a few decent songs on it. End to the Lies and Irresistable Force being the 2 that drew me to the album, but after that we fall into mostly forgettable \\"nice\\" songs....<br /><br />And I for one don't want \\"nice\\" songs from Jane's. This has nothing to do with their age or the quality of their first 2 albums. It has to do with their creativity now and not settling for good enough.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I got this app for free from amazon app store. It is a nice app but some tweaks could make it really good  1. An option to mute phone when playing on laptop will be very useful. sometimes i just sit far from my laptop and want to play on my laptop not on my phone. There is an option to play on the laptop also but to mute the phone will be helpful  2. Also it changes the resolution of my screen when connected and it looks awful to look at the videos or anything on my screen when connected. May be my PC resolution is bad. But atleast if it could maintain the same resolution that i have without connecting will be helpful.  Thanks for the free app ... :)

B00164GDA0|4.0|This is a coming-of-age story about 4 best friends, all about 12 years old.  Set in Castle Rock, Oregon in 1959, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Teddy (Corey Feldman), Chris (River Phoenix) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) set out on an adventure to find the body of a fellow classmate who had been reportedly killed by a train outside of town.  The idea itself seems a bit unusual, but what else was there to do in the small town.  In an era with no electronic entertainment other than radio and limited television, this was an adventure.<br /><br />Most of the film follows the boys on their journey of several miles by foot, following the train tracks.  It would include a hilarious overnight stay in the woods.  As the story progresses you can see each of the 4 characters personalities develop.  They are all different, but it is easy to predict what will come of them in adulthood.  Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace, who heads up a gang of older teenagers who are in competition to find the body as well.  It seems that the public notoriety of the find outweighs any consequences.  Sutherland looks just like the character he will play a year later in the vampire saga &#34;The Lost Boys&#34;, also with Corey Feldman.<br /><br />Rob Reiner does a fine job directing all of these young actors, several of which have made some decent movies.  River Phoenix in particular shows the promise that was never quite realized in his short life.  The film while set in a different era, still resonates.  It is emotional and yes, sentimental but it works because of the honesty of the scenes.  It is never maudlin or foolish.  Seen in high definition the film gives some new justice to the Oregon landscape that ranges from distant snow capped mountains to a swamp-like forest.  The surround sound is appropriate for the style of film.  Recommended.
0375826742|4.0|I have just finnished brisingr and thought it was a good book. Out of all the inheratance books this one was the least exciting out of them all because it takes Eragon 200 pages to get out of the Varden camp but after that it is a great book. Out of all of them it is also the goriest and even some is not even nescecary. All in all it is definetly a good read

B004HYXW1O|5.0|If you love amazing music and appreciate great writing - This album is for you!!!!   You really hear how this band has grown as a group. Every inch of the music is superb - drums, keyboards, guitar, violin. Everything is just right! They are \\" The Script \\" for a reason. Every single song has depth. Through all the lyrics and singing, you definately get a vivid sense and story telling that no other album has yet to compare. Their music is motivating, uplifting, inspiring, I consider this album to be a very visual album. They describe every inch, every feeling, that they are going through. You will find yourself nodding you head to every song, even the emotional ones! It's definately an art to be able to be that descriptive- Everyone should own this album!!   The Script in Concert - Make sure you go!!! Lucky in the U.S for not having to be around 20,000 screaming girls in Ireland to enjoy their live concert. Their concerts in the U.S is close and personal and they sound absolutely amazing! Also, you get to see Danny's moves!   Nothing - as humans, we can all relate this song - bad break up, going to a bar, drunk dialing, making a fool of yourself. This is a classic love story. This is the song I find myself singing along with more than any song in the album! Sooo catchy!  Science and Faith - this song has thee most meaning of the whole album, no wonder why the album is named after it!   For the First Time - this song reminds me of \\" we cry \\" the most from their first album - one word to descibe this song SOULful!!  Dead man walking - I love the vocals from this - raspy, smooth, laid back, a mixture of everything I love.

B002NJWHHA|2.0|The movie before I had read the book was excellent. I had no clue why my brother said it was awful compared to the book. I decided to read the book myself and it dumped the movie in the trash.<br /><br />Good things:<br /><br />The actors were the perfect people for the parts and saphira was perfect.<br /><br />Most of the cities except furthen Dur were perfect as well.<br /><br />Bad things:<br /><br />The razac dieing and getting beet up. WHAT! The razac killed Brom and escaped then played a crucial part in Eldest making it impossible for a 2nd movie.<br /><br />This movie could have been the next LOTR but they didn't they not to, instead they made it in to a it an hour and a half movie not having time to expand the characters.<br /><br />Let me lay this out flat. The movie is nothing like the book. It is a hole different story in general. The rose sapphire in furthen Dur, the flight to find the razac, even the morning sage at the end of the book isn't there.<br /><br />The movie is okay by it self but the only reason I would buy it is because it had the name Eragon and Saphira in it.

B004O3YGMC|2.0|This app is not a true \\"remote desktop\\" client, but instead requires a proprietary component installed on your PC. I run Win7Pro which has (true) Remote Desktop built into it already -- I don't want yet another app exposing my desktop to the internet.  This is just another potential security hole, waiting to be exploited.  Same thing goes for any remote control app which doesn't use a well tested protocol and/or server app.

B00026WUAU|5.0|\\"Street-Legal\\" finds Dylan at an all time low in his personal life. Having finally ended his marriage to Sara Lowndes, Dylan delved head-on into cocaine addiction and depression. The record finds him dealing with these and other demons, many of which had reared only fleetingly on the previous three records. By facing them head-on here, he successfully ends the relationship saga that began with 1974's \\"Planet Waves,\\" and drops several hints at his next phase, in which he sought redemption in the form of fundamentalist Christianity.<br /><br />\\"Street-Legal\\" is by no means an easy listen, and has divided fans since its release. The record has often been criticized for its slick, crowded sound, but others, including myself, finds it fits the distressing, manic state Dylan seemed to be writing perfectly. Dylan's voice on the record shows the first signs of damage that would only grow worse over the years; the rich, manly tone he had from \\"New Morning\\" through \\"The Last Waltz\\" has devolved into an adenoidal, nasally whine. It's a bit jarring to listen to at first, but again fits it with the 'cry for help' tone on most of the songs.<br /><br />Lyrically, \\"Street-Legal\\" is Dylan at his most inscrutable since \\"Blonde on Blonde.\\" After streamlining the wordy, free flowing style of the 1960s' to expand into more compact and concise forms of songwriting, he unleashes here songs such as \\"Changing of the Guards\\" and \\"No Time to Think,\\" with lyrics as cryptic and mysterious as anything on \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" or \\"Blonde on Blonde.\\" The former kick starts the album and seems to be a signal for change, that Dylan is about to enter a new phase and that one must abandon all that came before in order to prepare themselves for what comes next. It boasts one of the most exciting arrangements of Dylan's career, including a great ascending-descending vocal line and a sax riff after each verse that will stay in your head for days. The latter is not quite as successful, with an arrangement that sounds like a 1970s' soap opera theme. The lyrics, however, are interesting if a bit heavy handed.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the record, Dylan gets raunchy on \\"New Pony,\\" bargains with his own lover to accept his own selfishness and fears on \\"Is Your Love in Vain,\\" pleads for her return on \\"True Love Tends to Forget,\\" agrees to go separate ways on \\"We Better Talk This Over,\\" and finally winds up alone but alive on the bittersweet epic \\"Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat),\\" in which he finally, reluctantly realizes he needs to let go to carry on. \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\" has a severely weakened Dylan on his knees pleading for redemption in the face of impending doom, which opens the door for \\"Slow Train Coming\\" and the Gospel era. All of these songs successfully paint a portrait of a soul in crisis, with only the somewhat corny \\"Baby, Stop Crying\\" coming off as noticeably weaker than its surrounding material, though it's not a bad song at all.<br /><br />The 2004 remaster of the album is incredible and has managed to win over many of its initial detractors. To hear it with such a great deal of force and clarity makes all the difference in getting all the various nuances needed to appreciate it out there.1970s' soap opera theme.

B001IHJ97E|4.0|All the great things about Brainstorm have been delved into already by previous reviewers, but I would like to address the aspect ratio alternations which occur in the film. What they've simply done is transfer the same film from theatrical to home screen for authenticity's sake, and for that I can't fault them.  It makes for a unique viewing expreience, which is what this amazing film is anyway.
1933633867|5.0|Debt: The First 5 000 years!  David Graeber's book is one of the most interesting I had the occasion to read in the past few years.  His iconoclast approach to the economic debate has the great value of making you think again about what you thought you already knew!  His concept of \\"communism of the rich\\" certainly rings a bell with today's news regarding our ongoing economic crisis.  Furthermore, his linkage of coinage to the axial age of violence, military states, slavery and the nuisance of markets makes you pounder about the nature of our world.  Spanning from Mesopotamia, to Confusian views about military and merchant, and to Luther's need for temporal government and protestant thinking, rarely book has embraced so much in terms of span and human societal evolution.  His last chapter of on the use of US military might in support of the dollars also raises eyebrows.    Although Graeber does not provide ready made solution to the issue of our time, he helps us reflect on the way the world is working and how we are interacting with our fellow human being.  An economist by training, I cannot say that I buy everything Graeber states, but I warmly recommend reading this great book!

B0025KVLTM|4.0|Sgt Pepper is a good album, but it's hardly the Beatles best.  I much prefer A Hard Day's Night, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Abbey Road and even the often criticized Let It Be.  That said, Sgt Pepper is probably the most important album of the rock era.  It announced that rock music could be whatever the artist decided.  There were no boundaries.  In the hands of a great band like the Beatles this was great.  The lack of boundaries for lesser bands was usually disastrous and led to a lot overblown nonsense.

B0053YGYO4|3.0|Well, as noted by others, this is not surprising in its disappointingness.<br />It does not suck, but it's not awesome either.<br />I really think Coldplay needs to drop Brian Eno, and stop thinking so much about radio play.<br /><br />There are 4 good songs that will certainly make the mp3 player, some others that are tolerable, and others that are so stupendously awful, I almost didn't make it to the end of them.<br />Less than half the tracks are memorable or singable, and Martin still can't seem to write lyrics much beyond tired cliché and sappy, meaningless drivel.<br /><br />Now here's something to consider: the complete album in mp3 format sells for $5.<br />Guess what?  That's probably because there are only 4 songs worth owning:  \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\", \\"Charlie Brown\\", \\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\\", and \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\".<br />Those songs are really quite good, but that's it.  Out of 14 tracks.  Okay, I suppose the last 2 minutes of \\"Up With the Birds\\" is also pretty good.<br />So you can either buy those four songs individually or spend one more dollar and get the whole thing.<br />That's probably the way to go.<br /><br />Anyway, I often ponder the creativity, quality songwriting, and well-done production found on Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head.<br />It reminds me how excited I was in 2003 for Coldplay's next album.<br />Now, I'd be impressed if even half the tracks on an album were as good as some of the stuff on those first two.
B005URRCUY|3.0|The \\"Majesty of Muck\\" has left the building, at least for now.  Slick production, 4-on the floor back beats, soaring vocals, repeat throughout . . . looks like the Black Keys have their first breakthrough pop album.  One would expect a polished, radio friendly, bank account boosting album with Danger Mouse behind the glass, and they got in spades with El Camino.  Disclaimer: I don't begrudge any artist for pushing the boundaries of their artistic creativity, and the Black Keys are one of the best rock bands out there in terms of keeping their music fresh.  I'm not waiting for the next thickfreakness to come out, nor would I want it too.  I like this album for what it is and it will certainly go over well at just about any party.  Clearly it is an album designed to reach a broader audience and I'm sure it will, for better or worse.    That said, pop music is a little too repetitive for my taste, and a little too light on lead guitar work.  Not much in the way of soloing here and Carney's drumming sounds like a drum machine (no fills).  Sonically its spectacular and we get some interesting sounds coming from Aurbach's guitar in the form of riffs which I like a lot.  On the negative side (at least for me, YMMV), its very \\"indie\\" sounding and actually Indie Rock cafe named El Camino one of the best new releases of 2011.  And their probably right . . . i'm just not that into indie or pop.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun. I love it ,it is the best game. whoo. it has many different games in one, which makes it fun.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Too many ads causes it to slllllllooooooowwwwww down. The game is fun however, and the slowness allows you to perfect your timing for special effect birds like white bomber and yellow speeder. Needs more levels.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|device: Kindle Fire<br /><br />I find this one distinctly boring; I suggest taking a long look at the available screenshots to make sure this is a game you might like. It worked very well on my Fire, but I still didn't care for it.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|On this CD Josh Groban opens his heart with soaring vocals over majestic musical tracks.  The variety in the numbers is fascinating, making me wish I just knew more of the back story on some of the lyrics.  It doesn't get any more personal than this.  Being a singer of more than one language myself, I appreciate the originality, variety, and vulnerability shown on this album.  To those who don't appreciate the variety, this album seems to represent life with all of its ups and downs, including bittersweet moments, memories, and yearnings.  There are inspiring numbers, some larger than life showing great vision and an inspiring message, while other numbers are intensely personal. Having discovered Josh's music only a few years ago, I can easily appreciate the new vocal and lyrical challenges he now shares with all of us.  The falsetto is awesome, and even after listening to the CD a number of times, I look forward to the vocal range between warm deep notes and the falsetto punctuations with anticipation every time. Thank you for sharing part of your heart, Josh!
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This piece of garbage software will only function with a proprietary operating system like Windows or MacOS. Completely useless.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|There was much to be excited about when it came to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. It may have been a remake, but it also featured the likes of Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, and Mark Strong in a spy movie. Odds are that you're a fan of one of those actors and who doesn't love a film about spies? Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy are what initially attracted me to the project and Mark Strong was just a pleasant surprise, so the anticipation was very high. Unfortunately, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is basically a waste of two hours.<br /><br />A press screening for this was held nearly three weeks before the film's limited release date. Everyone who attended was handed what was referred to as a \\"cheat sheet,\\" which not only helped describe the film but also went into detail about \\"The Circus\\" along with definitions of code names and terms that were used throughout the film. This is being mentioned because unless you've read the book, have seen the original 1979 film, or receive this \\"cheat sheet\\" and go over it in great detail then you will more than likely be lost throughout most of the film. Five years ago, Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly released a film called Southland Tales. The unusual thing about it was that the movie was actually episodes 4-6 while a prequel graphic novel contained episodes 1-3. It's an interesting approach that deserves credit for trying something different, but the bottom line is that most people won't and don't read up on a film before it's released.<br /><br />With that said, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy isn't completely incomprehensible. You still know what's going on, but you just don't care. It's a very slow moving film that relies on dialogue more than anything to tell the story. Its nonlinear sense of storytelling isn't a smooth transition and is a bit difficult to keep track of at times. Didn't this character die earlier? Wasn't he working for somebody else like five minutes ago? Wait wait wait...WHAT? Who the HELL is that guy? These are the types of questions you'll probably be asking yourself. The majority of the characters seem very similar to one another and even share similar hairstyles. So everyone basically comes off as old, bitter people working for the government that are paranoid about a mole and probably should have retired ten years ago, which is kind of odd since the film revolves around retired agents attempting to be pulled back into the service.<br /><br />Gary Oldman puts in a fascinating performance as George Smiley, but it fails in comparison to most of the other film characters he's known for. Smiley doesn't even speak for a good while (Oldman is probably shown on screen for at least a good ten to fifteen minutes before he actually says anything) and the fact that Oldman went through such precise detail just to pick out the appropriate pair of glasses for the character is admirable. He has one magnificent scene in the film, which occurs in his office with Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he tells the story of how Karla never returned his engraved lighter. It's easily the best scene in the film. Tom Hardy is also fairly fantastic in his role as he shows quite a bit of emotion in the film and Mark Strong offers the type of solid performance you'd expect from the English actor.<br /><br />Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy does have a few redeeming qualities that mostly lie within the performances of Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy. Its decorative setting and use of unique perspective automatically makes the film appealing to the eye. The film is really bland the majority of the time though and is extremely uneventful. Even when something violent does occur, it fades into obscurity rather quickly and is covered up by the gargantuan amounts of jargon that's constantly regurgitated amongst everyone on-screen. So despite a few semi-decent performances and an experience that's at least visually intriguing, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a thriller that never really gets thrilling. Your constant uphill battle to stay awake until the film ends is far more exhilarating.nds is far more exhilarating.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I was excited that this was a free app today.  However, that excitement dwindled quickly!  I installed the Streamer on my computer, started the app and as soon as it gets to the Splash screen, the app forces close.<br /><br />I am running CM7 Android 2.3.5.  There is no excuse why I should receive FCs every time I start this app!  I am very disappointed and I am glad that I didn't fork over $5.00 for it!  I am pretty tech savvy and even performed a Fix Permissions...all to no avail!<br /><br />I believe there is a major problem with the app platform.  After reviewing the main website, it seems that this app is more geared to the ipad, iphone and itouch.  The Android platform seems pretty new and the developers should really test this app before putting out on the market.  Too many FCs is NOT a good thing!
B005K17RU0|3.0|while it was definitely visually appealing, once I had opened it on the morning there was from there on out no way to close it. even if its a minimal effort program it makes me nervous and when Im running on low battery having extra apps open makes me feel like I'm draining it faster.

B000MXLTTG|2.0|The book, March of Folly, is my second copy and one which I purchased to share with a friend who loves history.  The book arrived in a timely manner and in good packaging. BUT when I opened the book, which was  advertised as \\"used\\", I found that it had a broken spine which saddened me. I am in the process of  re-gluing the spine in the hopes that pages will not fall apart from binding. I would suggest that  sellers of used books describe flaws so that we the purchaser can make an educated decision to   purchase or not.
B002YE452Y|5.0|I must say that I bought this Deluxe Edition of She Wolf at target for $10 and that was a really good deal for a cd/dvd.  I've heard a lot of albums over the years from pop, rock, latin, r&b, and more.  But I have to say this is my favorite album of Shakira of all time with [[ASIN:B004624N6K Sale El Sol]] coming in second.  This album has redifinded pop music and the electronic/dance scene.  After two years I still can't get enough of this album, I'm just amazed by it each and every time I listen to it.  I love all the songs on this cd and think the dvd is cool too.  I must say that Shakira became my all time favorie artist from her two albums She Wolf and Sale El Sol.  I must say that no one can entertain better than Shakira.  She is just an amazing artist and many years from now she will still recieve critical acclaim from her albums and tours.  Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine was dead on when he said \\"nobody makes better pop records in the new millennium than she does\\" and Jim Cantiello from MTV News was dead on when he said \\"is one of my favorite pop albums of the year (if not the decade -- yes, I said decade)\\".  Also pick up Shakira: En Vivo Desde Paris CD/DVD set!
B006MHWXMS|2.0|At first I thought this was a great app!  It looks very nice and allows for recurring tasks which gtasks online can't do.  It also lets you set up priorities and such for your tasks.  However, once I marked a task completed on gtasks, it did NOT sync through to my phone.  Also, if I made any changes to this app on my phone, they did not always sync through to my tablet even though it always reports a full synchronization success.  I don't know what the issue is.  But obviously, if the sync isn't reciprocal and working correctly, your task lists get really messed up.  I am actually worse off for trying to use this at this point.  I gave it 2 stars because it does have a nice UI.  If it worked as stated, I would have done either 4 or 5 stars.  My phone is a Galaxy S 2 Epic 4G and my tablet is an Acer A500.
B001CZVVXW|4.0|This is a recording from a live performance by the Royal Opera House. It is an outstanding performance all around.<br /><br />First of all the music: All singers were excellent (or even better.)  Carmen (Anna Caterina Antonacci) sung well with emotion and deep conviction.  Don José (Jonas Kaufman) was also excellent albeit with some sharp edges occasionally.  Micaëla (Norah Amsellem) was simply outstanding.  She was so effortless with such a sweet way of singing, perfectly suited to her role in the opera.  Escamillo (Ildebrando D'Arcangelo) was excellent from a technical point of view, but he was a bit stiff in his manner.  He does not have many arias, but he sings some of the most popular and well known songs.<br /><br />Next the peripherals: the acting, the set design, the costumes, all that stuff that is secondary to the music (for me), but still makes the experience so much richer, if well done.  In this regard, this was one of the best acted Carmen performances I have ever seen.  Antonacci was outstanding with her emotion in bringing out the best of Carmen.  It does not get any better in \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" than what she did in this performance.  Other principals were also excellent actors. Set design was minimalist (I mean minimalist in the utmost.) Costumes were good, appropriate for the period.<br /><br />Next the Blu-Ray: it was disappointing. It was hard to believe that I was watching a Blu-Ray disk.  I can call it at best a decent DVD.  Blu-Ray requires sophisticated cinematography and HD recording, and you don't get it in this version.  Recently I bought several opera performances on Blu-Ray.  One of them, a Tosca performance had an incredibly well made Blu-Ray recording (and cinematography), and I could not help compare the recording quality of the two.  (You can see my review of Tosca if you type \\"Tosca blu ray\\" at the Amazon search box.)  If it was not for this, this performance deserves five stars every other way.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor know how to make very beautiful and haunting sounds. To  up-beat techno, rock n roll, and some melancholy tones these guys know their music. I do warn everyone that this genre is not for everybody most of these songs do not have any lyrics at all the tracks mainly consist of techno and piano. It does include the trailer song \\"Immigrant Song\\" which is a good listen. In the end if you like the modern day Radiohead then you most likely will enjoy this Soundtrack.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story has a very good pace and although some characters come off as two dimensional, the main ones have good development.  Although it's mostly written for teenagers and at times it shows, I as an adult found it fun and am looking forward to reading the next second book in the trilogy.

I'd highly recommend this to anybody interested in getting some legos at a good price.

0062082353|5.0|This is the autobiography of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. Chris tells it like it absolutely is... and I only speak for myself, an Honorably  Discharged Viet Nam Era Veteran... when I say that's THE ONLY WAY IT SHOULD BE TOLD! As people are wont to do...  they throw around mantras like they're nickel and dime clich&eacute;s... such as \\"War Is Hell\\"... without really knowing what war is really like. Chris and his very able co-authors... talk and paint a verbal picture that is as clear and real as the written word is  capable of  producing. The directness of the discussion... of not only boldly and unflinchingly killing the enemy... but the competitive and proud record keeping of these deadly statistics... will  obviously upset some people. But who cares! When you're out there facing death... every second of the day and night... as well as defending and protecting your countries beliefs and allies... that's the only way to survive and be victorious. And this *IS  THE WAY* men in war talk and interact.<br /><br />Chris shares in crisp... clear... straight-forward-matter-of-fact... dialogue how he grew up in Texas and wanted to be... and actually became a cowboy. He shares the competitive recruitment maneuvers of all our major Armed Forces that were literally side by side in a mall-like environment. After first being denied entrance into the military due to existing \\"cowboy-injuries\\"... he eventually got accepted... yet he still had the ultimate goal burning in his soul of becoming  a vaunted SEAL. When he got the opportunity to become a SEAL he details the now universally accepted knowledge of the PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PAIN AND ANGUISH THAT IS SYNONYMOUS WITH *HELL WEEK*! He also unlocked the secret key to surviving SEAL training: \\"GETTING THROUGH BUD/S AND BEING A SEAL IS MORE ABOUT MENTAL TOUGHNESS THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BEING STUBBORN AND REFUSING TO GIVE IN IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS.\\"<br /><br />With these truths self-evident... all readers who have not had military experience should accept as gospel Chris constantly wanting to go to war... constantly wanting to be in the street level life or death brawls... wanting to be a sniper... to have a more effective individual capacity to kill the enemy! This IS the way a true warrior feels... lives... and breathes. They are the polar opposite of people  trying to get out of the draft or get a cushy assignment back home.<br /><br />The reader is literally taken by the hand and led through Chris's progression as (as statistically recorded) the greatest sniper in American military history. Sniping and killing becomes akin to a professional ballplayer. Not only the melding of the \\"physical\\" and \\"mental\\" into one spiritually synchronized movement... but also all the superstitious minutia that can range anywhere from pawing at the dirt to slapping a teammate on the shoulder at a certain time when you check your equipment. There is a real exhilaration when you kill in war... especially in a lonely singular enterprise of being a sniper.<br /><br />I have never believed in \\"love your enemy\\" when you're at war... and I believe Chris strongly echoes that belief when he says: \\"SAVAGE, DESPICABLE EVIL. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE FIGHTING IN IRAQ. THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE, MYSELF INCLUDED, CALLED THE ENEMY \\"SAVAGES\\". THERE REALLY WAS NO OTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE ENCOUNTERED THERE.

0439023491|4.0|The second book in the Hunger Games trilogy is equally riveting to the first, but I felt like the plot is starting to fall apart. Things are getting almost too extreme in this fictional world and additional scenarios are added where they are needed to make the story jibe, but which must have been created after the first book because they don't quite fit. My biggest problem with the second book in this series is the characters are starting to shift from their original personalities which always makes me a bit angry. Katniss starts to become weak of character which she wasn't at all in the first book. See my last review for my wrap up.
1401216676|5.0|Batman goes to Arkham Asylum on a fool's errand - to try and talk sense to the Clown Prince of Crime, the Joker. But Joker's not there! He's escaped and plans on destroying the Gordon family. Will the Dark Knight save them? Or will Joker have the last laugh...<br /><br />First off, this is an acknowledged classic and I utterly loved it when I read it several years ago. Re-reading it now, I can say this book most definitely holds up, this is a classic Batman book for a reason. What I forgot was how slim a book it is - it's 46 pages long! The other Bat-classics, Returns, Year One, Long Hallowe'en, they're all at least 100 pages, the last one I think is nearly 300 pages. 46 pages!<br /><br />It's a testament to Alan Moore's skilful plotting and Brian Bolland's superb artwork and layouts then that the two of them are able to fit so much and develop it so well in such a limited frame. And here's the other surprise about this book, even though Alan Moore's name is on the book, Brian Bolland is far and away the real reason anyone, whether they like superhero comics or not, should pick up this book. The artwork is GORGEOUS!<br /><br />Look at that iconic cover - Joker looking perfect, his pose fit snugly within the rectangular cover; it says so much and is such a beautiful cover. I've got a large print of this framed in my house I love it so much. Looking through the book though are so many other frames that are utterly fantastic - the Joker smiling a winning smile to the Carnival property owner; Joker's gun as it points at Barbara Gordon; the Heart of Darkness-esque shot of Joker sitting on a bumper car atop a pile of (fake) dead babies; the design of the red hood; the half page image of the Joker becoming the Joker for the first time; the first panel of the last page when Joker begins laughing at his own punch-line - and Batman joins in!<br /><br />Yes this is an origin story of one of the most interesting villains in fiction ever created, but I choose to believe it isn't, that it's one version of Joker's origin, one of many swirling around the calliope of his deranged mind, in the same way that the ending could be seen as imaginary. I mean, could you see Batman laughing with the Joker? But I loved Moore's choice of ending the story on a joke, that was a master stroke.<br /><br />Bolland writes the afterword and he makes an interesting point about Moore, that \\"The Killing Joke\\" is never mentioned among his great works (Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Swamp Thing, From Hell) and I think that, while Moore is a tremendous writer (especially in the 80s), the writing here is not his best. Sure he does a decent job but it's not his best work. No, the real reason this book is so revered is the artwork. Really, I can't praise it enough. And it's a damn shame that Bolland hasn't drawn another Batman comic since then, or any comic really, instead illustrating book covers exclusively.<br /><br />Any Batman fan will already have this on their \\"to-read list\\" or else already own it, but I think comics fans who don't usually go in for superhero comics will find plenty to enjoy here too. This is the book that influences a lot of things that follow it: Tim Burton's 1989 Batman movie (Jack Napier in the factory being chased by cops), the Batman games \\"Arkham Asylum\\" and \\"Arkham City\\" (see the fight sequences between Batman and Joker and tell me you don't recognise a few moves there), but most of all what happened to poor Barbara Gordon and how her character would develop over the years.<br /><br />Also, if you can, buy the Deluxe Edition as it features the colour work of Bolland himself instead of John Higgins the original colourist. Bolland's approach is markedly different particularly in the flashback sequences of Joker-before-he-was-Joker. It also comes with an introduction by Tim Sale (artist of Haunted Knight, The Long Hallowe'en, and Dark Victory), and an afterword by Bolland along with a bonus strip written and drawn by Bolland of a murderous delusional fantasising about killing the Caped Crusader.<br /><br />A wonderful achievement by two talented artists, taking an iconic figure in an iconic series and making him seem new. Nearly 30 years later and it still reads fresh. Even if you've read it before but it's been a few years since you last picked it up, go read it again, you'll find little bits you missed all those years ago, like me.<br /><br />I've got one: so, a bat and a clown go to the fair and....onal fantasising about killing the Caped Crusader.<br /><br />A wonderful achievement by two talented artists, taking an iconic figure in an iconic series and making him seem new.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was thinking about buying an app like this, and saw it for free!  For a phone (htc evo) the screen is obviously too small.  To use my laptop anywhere to do simple tasks, even open documents, is amazing.  Makes me want to buy a Kindle Fire so I can have a tablet version of my laptop.  If you have a big screen, I very highly recommend it.  If you have a small screen, it's still an amazing app.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use my note taking app like a word document, I have even used it for a project at school and it worked perfectly. I love it, you are able to Color code each note so that it is in a category.I was able to copy and paste entire articles from the Internet so when I went to a place with out wi-fi, I could still finish research.  This is a great note taking app and I absolutely love it, I tried many, many others, but none worked as well. If you have to take notes, I would highly recommend this one. Ps. I have a kindle fire.
0307949486|4.0|I have to admit I passed these books up plenty of times at the bookstore in the time that they've been on the bestsellers lists and it wasn't until I discovered Fincher was making the movie that I finally picked up a copy. I'm glad I did. I have never read through a series of books in the time I did after reading Dragon Tattoo. I honestly don't know that i would have ever read these if it wasn't for Fincher's interest because a long time ago it was Fincher that introduced me to Chuck Palahnuik who is also a phenomenal writer. This book certainly isn't for everyone with its complexity and violence and overwhelming cast of characters but if you're looking for a rich and intense crime thriller that's different from the rest its definitely here in Dragon Tattoo.
0439023513|3.0|What started as elation over a great first book, really riveting and totally something new has quickly turned to disappointment in this, the last of the Hunger Games Trilogy. My biggest problem with this book was character assassination and feeling that the author completely changed someone's traits to tie the book's loose ends up. Gale, who once passionate but a good person turns into a complete jerk most likely so the author can get us not feeling so torn between Gale and Peeta.<br /><br />Second, Peeta, who has been strong turns into this bumbling weak kitten with almost no personality. He looses his entire persona in this book and is a non-character. Katniss becomes something she never was. The ending is horrible, wrapped up in two pages when it should have taken so much more. Explanations for the ending events are thrown together. I feel like the author got bored in the middle of the second book and the writing and plot died there. So sad because I was really rooting for this trilogy. The movies may be better than the books which I NEVER would say under normal circumstances. Hopefully a great screenwriter can leave me with a better taste in my mouth.
B005GVF95O|2.0|When I tried to solve the puzzles in this app, all the pieces locked in to the wrong place. The developers need to add some sort of calibration, or something, because NONE of the puzzles in this app worked for me. All of the pieces were overlapping and off center by about an quarter of an inch, which is quite signifigant on a screen the size of my Droid2. Don't be surprised if this app doesn't work for you.
0446547654|4.0|I love Nicholas' books and this was a very good story.  However, one thing that bothers me is that in ALL of his stories they revolve around death.  This story had several disfuncational subjects.  All in all it is a good read, but sad.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love this show.  I now have the first three seasons on DVD and am looking forward to buying the rest.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm a little bit of a book nerd, and tend to get caught up in stories...I definitely did that with this one! I can't believe this is her first novel! The characters and story line were so realistic, I felt part of it. I literally laughed out loud and cried more than once in this one. I couldn't put it down and read it in one afternoon =) I have recommended it to all of my reader friends, and can't wait to buy the hard copy! Looking forward to more, Colleen!
B005FITIIC|5.0|No blood, no assassinations of those who \\"know\\"... and no doubt- this is how the world unravels. The atmosphere in the firm is eerily sereene-not wild with emotion, screaming, or fighting. The truth, the unavoidable disaster, of what is going to happen the next morning works away at each of the participants. Blame is not the issue now- at least not tonight. The \\"asteroid the size of Texas\\"  is hitting regardless... the only question is what to do about it. (spoiler alert-) Virtually every participant jumps on the few life boats available. The decisions are made to sell out there clients and survive.This is the world of business at it's worst.    Is there a better actor on the planet than Kevin Spacey?  WOW- what a performance! Thank goodness his character has a soul- and we get to see that... but does he sell out? Watch the movie!
0439023521|5.0|This is a riveting story from the very first page. You fall in love with the characters and really feel their emotions translated through the writing. The story is original, fast paced and action filled. I really enjoyed the first book in this series. Read my other two reviews for my thoughts as the series progresses.
0399250395|5.0|I bought this book for my 1 yr old niece, and while she can't read it herself, the colors and pop-up aspects immediately caught her attention.  As she gets older, it will be a great story to read to her, and the message is one that any child should know.  I highly recommend this book for any young child!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Works well but seems to bog down my phone at times and may be shortening time between recharges. Very handy otherwise.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Great colorful addition to my kitchen; and they work well too. We are remodeling a 1950's green kitchen and these utensils add a bright splash of color; in addition they are very practical for everyday use.  Do note the warning about handles not being heat proof, I already put a small mark on one piece. Oh well, I still love the set.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I am so glad to finally have her CD....listened to Jar of Hearts for months, waiting for this CD. I LOVE the songs, which are written and sung with such heart. Bang, Bang, Bang-----is my favorite----insisted that my friends listen to it....any girl who has dealt with a liar and cheat with relate to this!! Cant wait for the next CD....highly recommend this CD!!!!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Very underated, very sweet and funny movie.  Definite \\"chick flick\\" but very tolerable to men.  Way better than those sappy Tom Hanks offerings as the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock seems real and natural.  My wife and I have actually watched this a few times which is rare in this age of DVR and new programming at our fingertips!  Have a great date night.
B005I6EU48|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend. I bought him a Kindle Fire and wanted to disguise it so he thought he was getting a book for Christmas...success. It came quicker than was communicated and in the stated new condition.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|I used to have the vhs tape of this.  Our family played it every christmas till the tape failed.  Love the DVD and the comentary.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I was skeptical at first about how it will look on my 46\\" Sony TV. I expected it to show just as a small box on the big tv screen. It wasn't. I played an HD free program from PBS web site. It showed on the TV with HD resolution filling the whole TV screen. Good one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is okay but it is pretty hard. I like the concept of earning points to be able to continue.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|The only problem with this app is that the PC being controlled is running at 100% utilization whenever I am connected. This makes the remote PC very difficult to control and impossible to run other processor intensive applications. The home machine is running Windows XP, so maybe it is time to upgrade.
B000001FY9|5.0|Awesome...Bob Marley was a genius and these songs really hit home whether or not you have any shared background with him.  Just put it in, relax and enjoy.  \\"Three little birds\\" is one of my all time favorite songs!
B004BSFC6Y|4.0|These are adorable and were a total hit at a recent office baby shower.  I wanted something cute and somewhat unique, the latter to minimize the risk that someone else would get a similar, duplicative gift.  Mission accomplished.  No similar gifts and none of the moms had even heard of them.    I haven't heard yet whether they encourage reaching or are otherwise interesting to the baby.  Either way, they sure are cute!  I'd definitely get another pair.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|The Movie was great I truly enjoyed it. My family also loved it too. I had a problem in the being . My son got it to work.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I do not read many books of this kind and when ordered it on my Kindle I didn't pay attention what kind of book exactly it was. Just saw the name of the author and said, why not, I use a lot some of his tools (and some others less), saw some videos of Mark, so I took the chance ;-)  It was a nice \\"escape\\" from the pure technical reality ! @Mark, when are you planning the next one ? Thanks !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion is great!  It is handy (being available right on my phone), easy to use, easy to find specific scripture passages quickly; many different versions available.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I just tried it, and it seems to work well. Full screen programs (like games) require window mode. Controls seem easy, no problem finding computer (doesn't work in sleep mode, but that's not a big surprise).
0062082353|4.0|Chris Kyle thinks he's a real bad-ass. Which is fine, because I tend to agree. American Sniper provides a look into what goes on in BUD/S and other SEAL training, but without much depth or detail. Instead, we're told more about the field action, the camaraderie of a SEAL team, what kinds of hazing the new guys receive, and a host of other things more interesting than BUD/S.  As far as the sniping record, the author is proud; he reminds us of it frequently and is unapologetic, even saying of killing someone, \\"It's no big deal.\\" However you may feel about that statement, it's probably the appropriate attitude for someone who needed to kill so often. There are war stories here of varying detail (some, I felt, not detailed enough) and anecdotes aplenty, some almost unbelievable. It's easy to feel proud of American troops when they're doing their jobs this well.  The combat action was gritty and vividly explained. Other times, we're shown that even a SEAL has droughts of boredom, which to them seems to be whenever they aren't on their guns. The book provides interesting insight into the gear an elite soldier uses in combat, with a particularly good segment in which Chris identifies the rifles he used and his typical load-out. The heart (but not the majority) of this book lies in the candid confessions of Chris and his wife Taya about the toll the life of a professional soldier can take on a family.   The first editorial review on Amazon describes the book as 'eloquent.' I wouldn't say that; this isn't lofty reading. It is however, a unique first person account of the war, exciting and emotional, occasionally funny enough to make you smirk, and a quick read. I had a few minor formatting issues with the Kindle version, nothing serious. I'd recommend it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|enjoy the tap to make your selection - simple and easy to use. some of the games are hard enough, they have to be played more than once to win.
B004ZQBP3Q|1.0|the only decent song is party rock anthem. The rest is bad. Sexy and i know it is just bad, and the music video should be illegal, i mean how do the people in my school listen to this crap, it is a disgrace to music!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent game, very customizable.  Smooth card motions, looks very lovely on the Fire.  Ads don't get in the way, which is nice.  Highly recommend this one.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|good game when your bored at work. a must have for people who like puzzles. absolutely love this game. good for keeping kids busy too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is ok it could use some better games and activitys but over all I think it is a good game to get so you can play it when your bored!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|been an evernote user for a while and the kindle version is awesome. 5 stars for sure. seriously use this program for everything in life
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I received this movie for christmas and I have already watched it 4 times. I hope it wins best  picture and also the characters nominated win. The story is well written along with the movie. The actresses playing their chosen parts were done wonderfully.
0307719774|5.0|This book is awesome! It has some really unique questions :D I'm already having fun with it. It's a smaller book, ....it's only about as tall as my hand is long. It LOOKS really cool :) ....there are only 4 lines to write on for each question, but I think that's just about all I need :) definitely happy with this purchase.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Great buy! bought in android market for more, and worth every penny! Need to transfer files over wifi? This is all you need - combined with virtually any web browser.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I downloaded the app just to see what I can do... and that is everything! I have a 5 year old son who skypes with his mother, thank god I don't have to sit in the room anymore...lol. I can start a computer from upstairs and let him talk away and monitor the conversation without being in the room. just to play around on and stream your music from home its great.
B000002LCB|2.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, and the soundtrack WITH the movie is good.  However, alone, there are just too many \\"weird\\" and disconnected portions of the music that are not necessarily pleasant on their own.  There are some instances of \\"oh, I remember when\\" while listening, but overall I was disappointed with this soundtrack. So was my wife for who I bought this as a gift.  Gets overall good reviews though so that's just two peoples opinions.<br /><br />Try listening to the samples available and downloading the MP3's of just the songs you like; I wish I'd done that.
B0045LSIRM|5.0|We really enjoyed listening to this CD because we attended the Bare Bones concert about 3 weeks prior to ordering the CD. Bryan Adams has never sounded better! There's even some humorous parts where you can hear some of his conversations with the crowd during the concert. If you like his music, you'll really enjoy this CD.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really have enjoyed this entire series. Honestly, I was sort of dreading the third book, Mockingjay. It never fails that the last book in a trilogy loses it's way, some authors seem to just be worn out by the 1200th page of a multi-book story, you know? However, Mockingjay flowed really smoothly from the first two books, no stumbling to find the pace or tone of the previous two books. The ending is not what many people wanted, judging from some of the other reviews. Personally, I don't think there could have been anything different that would have been true to the characters or their world. They lived in a world with unrelenting horror and trauma, there was no way a fairy tale ending would have felt authentic.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving this book a full five stars is because Katniss never really seemed to learn anything about the consequences of some of her choices - being selfish hurts, maims or kills others around her and yet it never dawns on her to slow down at times. Beyond that one nitpicky item, I have truly loved this series and I'm off to order her other books now!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a great app.  It has a solid set of softkeys the gestures are intuitive and the sound streaming is pdg.   You would be foolish to overlook this app today.
0060839872|4.0|i liked it, but my wife was pulling her teeth out trying to read it.  there are some pretty heady long philosophical tangents in here. Like acid?  You'll like this book.
0783240287|5.0|Excellent!!! Shipment arrived quickly and as promised. Very happy with this product. Purchase for my disabled child whom, has enjoyed this prodcut on VHS. Would purchase in a blink of an eye, again.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|CD is great, but the DVD is in PAL format and unable to be played on US DVD player. Not the end of the world.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I have not finished playing this game , but it is so,so,so fun so far.Even thow it was $0.99 it was totally worth buying. The graphics are so cool to look at. In away it looks like your in the mansion. You need to find the clues and figure out the mystery.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|exactly what I was looking for my kindle fire.. has enough mini games to keep me interested. some of the games are frustrating because it is hard to move quickly but overall very fun.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|OK this is the type of movie you watch for sheer enjoyment. If you try to fill the holes in the plot or rationalize it in anyway you will miss out on the fun. It is silly and stupid and has every stock character you can image. It is full of good actors performing for a fat pay check. Don't waste your time if you think you are going to be moved or walk away thinking you have seen another sci-fi parable. Simply turn off your brain and enjoy.
B004A8ZWXS|5.0|Not too many films come along that possesses the traits of classic films of the past.  However, Steven Spielberg's direction for War Horse comes close to becoming a semi-epic film, especially with its running time of over two hours.  But what is notable about the film is the meticulous production and exceptional cinematography and multiple storylines interwoven almost like a short story anthology centered upon a horse named Joey and his faithful owner Albert (Jeremy Irvine) about the time that World War I erupts in Europe.  The film grows and grows as it proceeds with each separate encounter that Joey meets, but the horse is merely a backdrop and the people that happen to have him within their possession help to contribute to the care and compassion that they show towards Joey.<br /><br />War Horse builds upon the various relationships that are established between man and horse.  Viewers will see about seven separate encounters that are finely intertwined within the film that will eventually reconnect when the movie concludes.  Indeed, one cannot deny the cinematography and the soundtrack that are compatible with each scene.  They are highly effective in invoking emotion and sincerity between each character.  And as viewers follow along with Joey's journey, especially during the beginning of the film, it is the symbolism and metaphors that are identifiable - the special emblem that Joey carries with him that is symbolic of Albert's father's heroism doing the Boer Wars in South Africa that happens to come into the possession of each new character that adds much sentimental value in terms of remembrance and memory as well as Joey finding his way back home; being this is a film that resonates much camaraderie during wartime and fellow man, Spielberg has much experience within that department having produced Saving Private Ryan. His drive for authenticity are clearly evident in War Horse, but not to compare this film to a list of other wartime depictions, there is also an inkling of Legends of the Fall that shows within this film that extremely tugs with the emotions; catch the scenes of the no man's land at the Battle at Marne or Battle of the Somme that captured the ravages of war wound with barbed wire fences that even a horse gets entangled but not succumbed to the challenge.<br /><br />Overall, it was a delight to have watched War Horse.  And not to dwell on other comparisons, but one more footnote comes to mind that relates to films or depictions between man and all living creatures.  Before deciding to watch War Horse, be prepared to carry along tissue because by the last hour, think about films such as Black Beauty, Lassie Come Home, Old Yeller, or even E.T.g of Legends of the Fall that shows within this film that extremely tugs with the emotions; catch the scenes of the no man's land at the Battle at Marne or Battle of the Somme that captured the ravages of war wound with barbed wire fences that even a horse gets entangled but not succumbed to the challenge.

0553801473|2.0|I have been waiting impatiently for this book for a LONG time, but I feel like it is taking me twice as long as I spent waiting just to plow through this book.  The characters are still very interesting, but not a lot is happening in Dance of Dragons.  I'm about 85% of the way through the book, but the story line hasn't been advanced by much at all, and I'm pretty sure that this series can't be concluded without a lot more books, if they are all going to be this slow.  And, sorry, Mr. Martin, I don't want to wait as long as it would take for you to write that many more books!<br /><br />Also, the book has a lot of typos - especially the word \\"then\\" when \\"than\\" should have been used.  Sloppy editing, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been so irritating if I had been less bored.
B005HXGE9G|4.0|This is nice listening music.  I've enjoyed it a few times through each disk.  Of course, its not rock and roll.  Spare orchestral settings and tasteful vocals make for a different - but nice - listening experience from Gabriel's progressive rock roots.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I love this and rely heavily on it but since the new update it wont open without force closing right away, please fix I can't wake up without you!

030788743X|4.0|I devoured this book in three days! Ready Player One is a classic quest story mashed with a fun romp through 80s geek culture. If you liked video games, D&D, Rush, Blade Runner, and computers growing up, you will adore this book. 80s pop culture factors in here and there, but it's the geeky details that make this book really shine. The plot itself, with Wade searching the enormous OASIS computer simulation for an egg, is engaging on its own, but the 80s overlay adds a lot of fun and humor to, at its heart, a serious story. I'm in awe of Ernest Cline's encyclopedic knowledge of 80s trivia. The book is worth reading for that alone.  The tiny issue that kept this from getting five stars? The last quarter of the book jarred me out of my reading trance a bit because I kept wondering how such sophisticated technology and corporate wrongdoing could co-exist with the supposedly strict privacy laws. It seemed like the rules and loopholes in the world were a little too convenient for the plot. It doesn't matter much, though. Ready Player One is a rollicking good read that I'm sure most people will love, even if they aren't 80s geeks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it so fun would you thonk so but it is a bit hard but so fun try to get all the games I did
B004WR125O|1.0|I bought this to go with my Onkyo 360.   I tried to play mp3 music's stored in my PC through wifi dlna . The music playback got stopped from time to time. For a song with three minutes long, The signal drops could be as many as 10 times at worst.   While this adaptor showed bad signal reception,  my laptop and blue ray player next to the receiver could stream HD movies without any issues through the same router. Save your money and do not buy this.
B0012GMUI6|5.0|I'm a huge Roger Waters fan- not just for Pink Floyd, but his solo career. Amused to Death is my \\"deserted island\\" album. If you read along with this record, it's like reading a play. The actors are hilarious and let's not forget the amazing musicians involved. The late Michael Kamen on piano, Andy Numark on drums, David Sanborn on sax, and Eric Clapton? Holy crap. One of my favorite songs is \\"Go Fishin'.\\" No one really talks about it, but it's epic and sounds a bit like In the Flesh. Amazing songwriting and lyrics throughout.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I am not a high dollar watch guy, but I do like a durable watch that will keep good time. My taste in watches is pretty broad, but not overly expensive. I have a Casio Pathfinder Fishing watch. For dressy occasions I have a titanium Skagen Ultra Slim from Denmark, and a Swiss made Raymond Weil. Heck I have a Mickey Mouse watch I love. I have used other Casio watches for daily use and worn them out, and have been getting tired of replacing batteries on watches lately. I really wanted a vintage looking watch for everyday use that was visually reminiscent of the WWII pilots watches. I had bought one at an auction site that turned out badly and I gave it away. I kept looking and after reading about this Seiko, I thought I would give it a try. The fact that an automatic watch was available at this low price, from a company like Seiko is amazing. I have been very pleased since it arrived last month, and have in fact worn it daily. It is very accurate, and I have not had to reset it once. The green color dial and matte finish housing (vintage military appearance) works for me. The band looks fine and is comfortable. I enjoy watching the large sweeping second hand with the red tip. The dial markings and numerals are so clean and perfect looking, I still wonder how they do it. This is my first automatic self winding watch, and I have been very pleased with it. Unlike some buyers, I can't feel the movement on mine when I am wearing it, until I take it off. I do look at the movement through the rear glass sometimes.  I have skipped a day wearing it without it running down. The watch size and weight is good for me,  and don't like a watch that is too big to fit under my sleeve. The watch has a quality feel and heft to it, and looks like an expensive watch, to me anyway. I only wish it were waterproof, but you can't have it all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|decent game. could use instructions. as others have said you need to work to open other games and get points for fling things like writing a review.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I purchased the Kindle Fire & case for my husband for Christmas.  He is THRILLED with both items.  They were both a GREAT deal and I would highly recommend either and/or both!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This product makes a great tablet even better.  Download this app right now , you will not regret your decision at all
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! it has daily devotionals to choose from many different evangelists and preachers and plans that will take you through the Bible in one year any way you want like chronologically historically or a mixture and much more!!! definately worth a free download. easy to work and you can highlight favorite verses
B003ELKNH2|4.0|Sheen, Brando, Duvall, Hopper and the others are excellent here in an anti-war story of a captain who must track down a renegade colonel who has created a death cult in Cambodia during the Vietnam war in 1969.  Along the way, Capt. Willard and the boat crew encounter a number of strange or deadly situations, culminating in their arrival at the \\"poet warrior's\\" temple of death.  The actors do a superb job under Coppola's direction, and the film lets you see the destruction of war without being too preachy.  I wish there were more features here, though; trailers are just not enough.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its very mind crunching at first but fun to play. I was able to pass easily without any problems :-) :-)

B00000EF8E|4.0|I did that because I didn't want to write an entire new review!  Hey Jude, also known as The Beatles Again, is an interesting \\"album,\\" really more of a compilation, that features many of the group's single sides that didn't make it onto any of the British or American albums (\\"Paperback Writer,\\" \\"Rain,\\" \\"Lady Madonna,\\" \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Revolution,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" \\"Ballad Of John & Yoko,\\" and \\"Old Brown Shoe\\"), as well as \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"I Should Have Known Better,\\" which originally didn't appear on any of the (Capitol) albums in America. After many, many years, this beloved \\"Capitol album\\" has finally been legitimately released on CD in the U.S. (I've even added a star to my rating, partly because I dig the \\"miniature LP\\"-style packaging!)  This is a good collection, though \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" (both from '64) sound very odd alongside a bunch of songs that are of '66, '68 and '69 vintage, and I'm not particularly fond of a few of the other songs (although I like all the songs, or most of them, to certain degrees). Also, all of the tracks can be found on other Beatles CD releases, so this \\"album\\" is no longer necessary in order to have all of the group's songs and to have all the songs here in stereo. But, many Beatles fans will probably want to get the CD anyway ---this one got it as a birthday gift, which was cool!  I do like this album, and I think it's one of the most interesting Beatles releases. However, it is too \\"scattershot\\" --- two songs from '64 and eight from '66-'69 --- to have the \\"feel\\" of an album of Beatles songs recorded during the same time period; thus, it works better as a compilation.  By the way, the cassette release of the album (which was the one that this review was originally for) was even more interesting (at least in my opinion), as the songs that were on side one of the original release, and the ones that were on side two, were flip-flopped on the cassette, making it even more \\"scattershot\\" thanthe original vinyl (and this CD)!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I first fell in love with this app on my android phone and I still love it. it's gotten me into a reading almost daily habit.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I adore zombies and every now and then, I find a great tale, that literally causes me nightmares!This book did just that! It takes a lot to disturb me, Max Brooks book made me, laugh, worry and has a realistic edge to it! Read it, before you see the movie, its so worth it!
1592400876|5.0|This book is made for the well spoken and the colloquial alike. For the former, it will reinforce practices cultivated by steady discipline; or, if you are a greenhorn of words properly punctuated, this book should inspire you to a functional familiarity. What's better is this little rag does not attempt to overreach but builds a new foundation on a stunted beginning by keeping it to the essentials.
031261246X|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. The plot is good & timely. A few months ago a virus was reported hitting US Drones(google \\"Computer virus hits U.S. drone fleet\\"), viruses can and have attacked dams, factories and nuclear power plants - this type of stuff happens. Mark writes well, covering technical topics in a way that I believe would be clear to someone with no technical background. However, because of his background the tech is real. There is no magical CSI-style make-believe tech here, it's all quite possible. I am looking forward to a sequel that I've heard is in the wind.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like what I 've played so far.  Games aren't very time consuming.  But it will take a while to unlock them all.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I would definitely recomend this game to anyone who likes a nice, medium-hard puzzle game. overall, great game, there are a few tough ones in there, but most of them are fairly easy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Downloaded it a few hours ago and already hooked. There are lots of games to play, all on one app. Perfect if you tend to hey tired of an app after a short while.
B006PKQQJS|2.0|I'm getting annoyed with this all because it wont install even over night!I wanted to play it and I couldn't because it was only 37% loaded and it still only 37% even over night.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I was sad & at the same time glad to get to season 5.  All I can say is \\"kudos\\" to the cast &  writers of Dexter and am waiting impatiently for season 6!! Hard to imagine a better season,  but I'm sure it will be.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|on the kindle fire ... the graphics are nice, but there are less options than the free version. update please!!
B006FTCH2E|5.0|This is one of my favorite scifi movies I've seen in the last year. It seems to have been filmed with very limited means but the writers and director seemed to have used that to their advantage and made a unique film that expressed all they wanted to without using the common methods using standard techniques requiring a large budget (special effects, props, exotic, location, etc). The end product has a unique and poetic feel which takes considerable skill to pull off and the film makers deserves credit for that.   Its theme is the discovery of a twin earth that is almost a mirror reflection of Earth. The paths of the two twin planets soon begin to diverge upon the mutual discoveries of each other. The film makers use the concept of a twin earth as a vehicle to explore issues of existential crisis, forgiveness, tragedy, human relationships, regret, the random contingency life's course and a host of other important issues all skillfully weaved together in a memorable film. I also thought the lead actress (also one of the writers) Brit Marling and the lead actor did a good job of acting. Explaining the plot will not do it justice because it ends up sounding contrived and a mishmash or it may sound boring to some people. But if you're into thoughtful movies exploring deeper subjects than the usual sci-fi fair and appreciate well-crafted scenes that are both complex and flows with ease, I think you'll enjoy this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought this game was surprisingly really except for the fact that to pass a game you needed 4000 points other than that it was really good!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|the Easter pigs are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute!you should get this app right now! it would most likely have your favorite season on it. Get this app.nnnnnnnooooooowwwwwwwww!

B005HSG3VK|4.0|Adorably small and sleek. Fits perfectly into my purse without occuppying too much space. Durable cover, but does not stand as well as they make it seem. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase,
0545265355|5.0|I bought this set of books for my 14 year old son.  The price was excellent and he has really enjoyed the books.  But then he gave the first book to me to read - I couldn't put it down!  What a great book!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have been using this alarm clock for about 3 months now and I love it. The ability to create multiple alarms is great, choice between ring tones or music rocks and the advanced options are extensive. I never knew I could actually like my alarm clock.
0062103377|5.0|A wonderful and worthy read! Bobby talks a little about his history, how he got into hunting and how it changed his life. Bobby's tongue-in-cheek humor keeps me turning pages and while I've not finished the novel just yet, I know the rest of the read will only get better. I love the occasional jabs he takes at Sam and the over-all 'hillbilly' voice... he even uses the word 'critter' a time or two. The book fits nice and snug with the series and it makes me wish they'd do a 'guide to hunting' both from Dean's and Sam's point of view. :)
B005GVF95O|5.0|My two year old loved it! Ran smoothly on my HTC Incredible. Wouldn't pay more than $1 for it, but very great app for FAotD!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|One of my favorite romantic comedies of all time.  All the stories are sweet and romantic and keep you interested till way after the credits have rolled. The soundtrack is also worth getting.

B003YUC2FE|5.0|My son is a Toy Story fanatic and was thrilled to receive this for Christmas.  Was a bit disappointed at Amazon at playing with the prices.  Had it in my shopping cart and it went up in price quite a bit.  Shopped around at the stores and couldn't find this set so let it sit in my shopping cart a few more days and the price went down lower than originally posted.  Nice set and the shipping was good.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got this when it was free, but I would absolutley pay for it. it's an awesome app. I'm using it to put my MAC on my kindle fire. flawless app.
0099503921|5.0|Wonderful literary mystery which I read last year and loved! Bought it this year for a niece as a gift. Book arrived in time in perfect condition at a reasonable price! Couldn't have asked for more.
B004VGGYT0|1.0|What a disappointment this pressing of Ken Russell's wonderful movie this is. It is supplied without the necessary red/green glasses and all the pairs that I have with other films refused to give me anything but the most minimal 3D effect. The film remains out of focus throughout and is unwatchable - so back to the standard print. This 3D version is an absolute disaster and should be avoided at all cost.
B004P2CQM4|5.0|My 10 year old daughter really wanted this for Christmas and I really didn't want to buy it.  We were pleasantly surprised with it's quality and the fun she had with it Christmas morning.  It took 2 adults to put it all together and we were very careful with it.  The fish itself is made of Mylar but it's pretty durable.  We were able to remove misplaced tape and stickers throughout the assembly process without damaging it.  I recommend only using the tape that comes with it because it worked out well and to read the directions completely before starting.  We had to remove and redo a few things. You need to buy a Helium tank to fill it which we got at a party store for $30.  My daughter had it mastered and was flying it around the house in no time.  Also it is way bigger than we expected it to be.  It's about 3 feet long or more.  The helium tends to run out a bit and needs a refill occasionally. I'm glad we gave in an got this for her.  It is pretty cool when it swims across the room.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a fun, easy way to past time. It has lots, and lots of great games.Hope you get this time passing game.
1451629184|5.0|I gave this to my sister as an \\"End of Semester\\" gift so she would have something to read while on break. Not only did she read it, but so did my 15 year old niece and our mother. All said that while it was honest, it was disturbing the things poor Jaycee went through. The all commended her courage for even one sentence about her experience. I hope that writing this memoir was theraputic and brought some sort of closure for her. I will be reading the book mext!
B001IB6374|4.0|GoHastings has TERRIBLE service! I bought this album from them and got a freakin' Wii! Then I had to reorder it, which took absolutely forever. Like I said, this album is unbelievable, but you won't have a good experience with it if you choose goHastings.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I have had this app on my ipad and love it. I almost actually paid for it on my droid razr a couple of weeks ago, so boy was I excited to see it as the app of the day. Anyways, every time I try to connect to my computer it knocks my 4G connection drops out. Very strange. Maybe it's a Verizon thing or app thing. Not sure. Hopefully it fixes itself but we will see. This is a great app though. Recommended
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I just installed this on my HTC Evo and it works flawlessly. I can view my computer and manipulate it as if I was in front of my screens. The only drawback is if you have more than 2 monitors. I currently have 4 monitors on my computer this app always you to switch between 2 of them. Other than that this is great :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed the reading of the Old And New Testament.  I like the way this app helps you keep up with your reading and the calender is especially helpful to let you know if you missed any reading over the past several months. I have perswaded several friends with smart phones and other electronics to download this app and start a self study of their choosing. I have mentioned on facenook and in my adult Sundayschool class. I occasionally enjoy your dramatic reading from my desktop on your website. I appreciate your ministry.
0805092919|3.0|Uh oh! Baby Bear has been separated from his mother, but as he journeys to reunite with her, he comes across all kinds of other animals!<br /><br />Baby Bear, Baby Bear is a super cute children's picture book. With colorful full-page illustrations and easy words in large print, it is the perfect book to engage and delight your young ones. I was glad that a blue heron was featured in the book. I see them all the time at parks and they are amazing creatures. Along with a variety of animals, this book teaches young children colors through rhyming. At the end of the book, there is a recap of all of the animals to help refresh the young reader's memory. The fourth in a collaborative series with Bill Martin, Jr. and Eric Carle, it is a delight for the eyes.<br /><br />Google \\"The Musings of ALMYBNENR\\" to see this review in its original format and to follow my book review blog.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun collection of games. if you're bored or just need to pass the time, this is great. I also like that there are so many games to choose from. I would def recommend!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The app works really great. Really cool seeing and hearing just like I would from my laptop. Easy to setup and install. Responds really fast. Not lagging.
1401232590|4.0|This was one of the three Batman comics which influenced the making of the movie BATMAN BEGINS. The sequel to that film THE DARK KNIGHT grabbed heavily from this particular graphic novel. It's something of an early years of Batman's time as he deals mostly with the mob and an avenger named Holiday who kills people during almost any holiday. There are some good connection setups between Batman, Gordon and Dent. Film noirish style as to the murders some would say.<br />ARTWORK: B; STORY/PLOTTING; B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN READ: early January 2012.
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly was the core truth I was missing in my years of failed attempts to control my appetite and leave the ranks of the obese.  The truth is that the wheat we eat today is not the wheat of our ancestors--it has been dramatically altered.  The wheat and wheat products of today cause intense, irresistible cravings for many people.  Once hooked, we get stuck on the blood sugar roller-coaster that demands we eat even more to sustain feelings of satiety, and it is absolutely everywhere in almost all the foods mainstream society eats.  The only way to break the cycle for people like me is to eliminate wheat entirely, a \\"wheatectomy\\" as Dr. Davis calls it, and replace it with fresh vegetables, nuts, seeds, and healthy oils.  Despite dozens of very sincere attempts to lose weight, I had decided I was incapable of controlling my appetite or my weight and that I should just accept that I would always be obese.  Then, I happened to catch Dr. Davis on TV describing his book and decided to read it.  To describe his approach to eating as a breakthrough for me would be an understatement.  It has been a revelation.  For me, the process of losing weight means eating less food, pure and simple.  That has been impossible in the past when I was consuming wheat products.  Using the principles in Wheat Belly, I eat dramatically less food and can manage the cravings.  Yes, I still have cravings and still often feel hungry.  However, it's doable on the Wheat Belly plan.  So doable that I lost 38 lbs. the first 3 months and feel confident I can lose the additional 40 lbs. I still need to lose over the next 5 months.  And, while I don't work out, I stay active.  I do simple things like take a 45-60 minute walk with the family dog, play around with my kids at the park, and take the stairs.  Wheat Belly can change your life. It has mine.

1401200605|4.0|In this tale Batman suffers a grievous injury that takes him out of Gotham and into Superman's territory where he touches base with an old childhood friend and deals with several major villains of his past. I like how Wayne's character was established. That isn't something done very well in a lot of the other Batman graphic novels. There's an obvious shades of gray as to how matters are resolved a la The Batman Way or The Superman Way. Hardcore critics will take issue with how Batman was injured and how Godlike the men and women look but isn't this a superhero graphic novel? Purist DC fans may be turned off by certain liberties taken by the author as well like an appearance by Superdog. IGN Comics ranked Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 of Batman: Hush #10 on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, saying that \\"there are some truly unforgettable moments\\" and \\"Jim Lee's artwork is unbelievable.\\" CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus (first half so I suspect this is a setup); ARTWORK: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN READ: early January 2012.
B006LS7DQE|2.0|I have been enjoying the gameplay of Puzzle Quest 2. However, it has \\"Unexpectedly Quit\\" repeatedly. The issue is happening so often that it makes playing the game impossible.

B000XXGMS8|5.0|I looked at numerous different boots before choosing these.  I wanted to replace an older pair of Timberlands that I had.  Love the color and the fit.  As many others have said, you need to order a size smaller than your size in sneakers.  I wear an 11 in Nike and Brooks but a 10 in these.  I wear these for casual wear and have no idea how they would hold up for working in.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|Just got this little case for my iPhone 4s. It is pretty cool and I was pleasantly surprised! The case itself is a flexible rubber that fits snugly over the phone and has all the properly located openings in all the right places. It is clear with a little spiral effect on the back. The interesting part is the screen protector. This is not just a piece of plastic that fits inside of the case and over the face of the phone. This is a super thin protector that has an opening for the ear hole and the personal camera opening, and the button on the bottom. The protector comes sandwiched between two pieces of plastic and you peel the first plastic piece off of the protector and then apply the protector to the face of the phone with a little squeegee to get the air bubbles out (yes, that's how slim the protector is), then you peel off the other piece of plastic that protects the protector. What you end up with is like a friction fit of the protector shield, kind of like when you use plastic wrap on a microwave plate or something. Note, make sure everything is \\"hospital\\" clean, as a small speck will seems like a mountain if it gets underneath the plastic, and taking the plastic back up may not allow it to \\"stick\\" smoothly at the edges again. Once it's on, it will be pretty secure, so don't take it off if you're taking the case off for something else, you'll never know it's there. I was impressed with this system, and I don't impress easily, if you know what I mean. I don't see any glare or distortion of the screen either. I ordered another one for my teenage daughter, it's that cool!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have used several of these remote desktop type applications but so far this one has impressed me the most. Very easy to connect my Iconia tab and very little lag between actions. Great FAOTD.

B006BDHAX0|1.0|I downloaded this game for my kindle fire. It could be a fun game if it would stay open. There seems to be a few bugs in the application causing it to shut down during game play. I have also noticed the game freezes sometimes and locks up as a running application requiring a &quot;force close&quot;.
0062082353|5.0|This book takes us right along side Chris Kyle as he grows from an adolescent in Texas to a Navy Seal Team Chief who fought through some of the most ferocious battles in Iraq, from toppling Saddam Hussein to the follow-on battles to clean terrorists out of their fortified strongholds of Fallujah and Ramadi. Kyle takes us through every aspect of his soldier's life from the painful separation of leaving his family during his multiple combat deployments to the difficulty of transitioning to civilian life when his military career finishes.  Kyle tells many colorful anecdotes about his tough Navy Seals training, such as being attacked by dolphins and sea lions that the Navy had trained to protect our harbors from being attacked by other countries' Special Forces. His undercover operations training included mock burglaries on the streets of New Orleans and hazardous night parachute jumps. He was trained to withstand waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods that would be used against him if he was captured by Al Qaeda.  Of course the heart of the book is combat in Iraq. Kyle minces no words about war. The fighting he describes is as vivid as the scenes in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACKHAWK DOWN. He talks about being surrounded by the enemy, being wounded, and thinking he's going to die. He talks about having to make split-second decisions on whether to shoot a perceived enemy or whether to hold off on shooting a target that could not be confirmed beyond all doubt to be a combatant. He talks about losing his best friends in combat and of coming across the dead bodies of Army and Marine comrades who were captured then murdered in cold blood.     He also gives a solid account of Iraq and the  enemies he fought after Saddam Hussein's removal --- the diehard remnants of the old regime, criminal gangs, and foreign Islamic terrorists who came into the country to fight their Jihad.   Kyle conveys the intensity of his desire to fight for this country that drove him to volunteer to put his life on the line in four combat deployments. The larger message I took from his story was:  1. Those of us in civilian life have nothing to complain about. Our struggles at home and on the job are as nothing compared to the sacrifices that our military people make to protect us. We hear that said so many times that it sounds like a cliché, but this book totally brings home the reality of what our warriors go through in training and deployment to combat.   2. He explains the essence of the evil he fought against in Iraq. The insurgents not only killed American soldiers in ambushes but tortured, murdered, and raped Iraqi civilians who opposed them. They were every bit as evil as those World War II Nazis who herded peoples of conquered countries into gas chambers. After reading this book I have come to appreciate more than ever how much we rely on people like Chris Kyle to prevent this evil from ever reaching our homeland.   3. He captures the essence of a warrior in combat. He and his men won by being aggressive in killing the enemy before they were killed. He conveys the depth of a warrior's feeling of duty to his/her comrades and to our country.   4. He explains his view of the mission in Iraq. We can argue about whether we should have gone into Iraq in the first place, but this book makes clear that once we did commit to the intervention that it was essential to carry the effort through to victory over Saddam Hussein's regime AND the follow-on war against the insurgents who followed him. If we had pulled out of Iraq prematurely the country would have become a terrorist nest. Besides endangering the rest of the world, the terrorists would have exterminated the civilized people in Iraq who opposed them.  Combat veterans are disarmingly humble about their service. They typically say, \\"I just did my duty. It was a privilege to serve my country.\\" While Kyle also conveys that sense of humble obligation to duty he is courageous enough to tell the rest of the story about the war that he fought to defeat the terrorists who wanted to make a nest in Iraq.   Kyle embodies the warrior spirit that defends us --- not just our free and easy-going way of life in America, but those of the civilized people everywhere else in the world. He doesn't boast about his deadly military skill in any bragging sort of way, but he does make it perfectly clear to our potential enemies that they'll be introduced to hell on earth if they ever again try a repeat of 9/11.
B005GVF95O|5.0|Come on now, you can't expect every app to be just for adults. Get over yourself! This app is adorable! I love hire its slightly complex, but not too hard for young ones. I'll keep this for when my son is old enough.  Nothing wrong with having apps for kids as the free of the day. Imagine this...the world isn't just about you...there are others out there. And they just might have kids. Heaven forbid they actually want an app meant for their kids.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great app... I enjoy playing spider solitaire on my kindle using this app. graphics are nice and overall the app is very easy to use! recommend it to everyone!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|First, I would like to start with how much I loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. I read them both in the span of 36 hours, which is saying something since I'm not.really a big reader. I'm a sap for good love stories and especially good love \\"triangles\\" which is what got me hooked in The Hunger Games and all the way through Catching Fire.  After I finished Catching Fire a few days ago, I couldn't wait to download Mocking Jay onto my kindle. I began reading it and not too far in got a bad taste for it. The connection I had felt between any of the characters was gone, even Gale and Katniss (I'm team Peeta all the way, but I would have even taken that!) Everyone seemed to be cold to eachother, and in a trilogy you often see character development, the relationships blossoming, but in Mocking Jay I felt as if they had all made a regression in their relationships.  The Katniss and Peeta storyline kept me interested for a little while, until she became a complete jerk and shut him out, without even the effort of trying to help him out of the scary, lonely world he had been thrust in to by Snow and the Capitol. I know that I had known from the beginning, when I read the story about the boy with the bread that Katniss loved him. If a consistent storyline wanted to be kept, especially after the development of their relationship in the arena during the Quarter Quell when Katniss said Peeta's kisses evoked a longing inside of her, they should have kept the same longing mot a hatred for Peeta when he needed her to comfort him, and protect him the most.  Throughout Mocking Jay, I found myself depressed and mourning for the loss of the relationships that I was now longing for from the writing. But, when major characters were killed off, I wasn't the least bit moved. Prim's death took all of .043 seconds to figure out once the medics uniforms were mentioned. And Finnick's death wasn't mourned hardly at all, by the characters or myself! (Which, by the way, did I miss the part where Annie was announced pregnant? Because Finnick died, and then Peeta and Katniss are making a book with a little Odair in it...)  I feel like the ending was tacked on, and the epilogue was just atrocious. I can't even think of another way to describe it. I closed the \\"back cover\\" feeling depressed, confused, and angry. What happened to Gale? Are they still living in an ash covered 12? What was the political state of Panem after the rebellion? So many things left unanswered, and so many characters left alone. Haymitch?   Collins wanted us to experience the war and the feelings and long term affect of the rebellion in Panem. But I honestly didn't get them, they were too jumbled up in the what seemed like constant drug induced haze Katniss was in. If not on morphling, she was asleep or numbor aboutto sleep.  I get too attached to the characters in the books I read to have them given a halfway-okay-but-not-really ending.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I think it very good and easy to use. I really like the app and I think people should download it

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is hands down the best blade i have ever owned. Good weight and feels indestructible. Razor sharp out of the box. Great \\"do it all\\" knife
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was a little worried about this when I read some of the reviews online, but thought, Oh well, I can always return it.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the cover.  It is very lightweight, fits great and keeps the Kindle very safe without adding a lot of bulk.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool games..hours of play..great for people of all ages..over 100 games and lots of hours to play..love it love it love it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|oh my God its like a dyminte when it rings to Wake up lol I love it some much don't worry it works lol
B004RJZA1E|5.0|It was exactly what I was expecting and looking for from this band. I had seen the \\"Hunger\\" music video and listened to a few other songs, although none of them were played where I live in the US. Great vocals from all three singers, especially Elize Ryd. I also enjoyed the slight electronic fusion into a metal band. Not really unique in that respect, but done very well. I will be buying their next CD when it comes out.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A Shepard boy has a reoccurring dream about a treasure hundreds of miles away in Egypt. So he finally goes see a psychic to see what the meaning of his dream means. The psychic tells him only to follow his dream, and to find the treasure in Egypt. The boy, then has to make a decision of following his dream, or settling for a life as a Shepard Boy.<br /><br />The Shepard Boy takes the chance, and makes the leap of faith, to find himself in a journey that would take him years and years to accomplish. Throughout the years, he meets different people, grows stronger as a person, and finds the love of his life.  There were many times where he was happy and he knows he can be very happy with his love, with his money, and what he has learned. He is faced time and time again to make the choice to settle and give his dream up or continue on his lonely, self-driven path. Follow his destiny?  Or Fall for comfort?<br /><br />I would recommend this Book to everyone. It's incredibly entertaining and empowering - so many lines and quotes in this book that make you feel that you are the Shepard boy and that you have to follow your dream out here in the real world. When I have kids one day, I would want them to read this book, and I would tell them to follow their dreams and their hearts; and then love and money will find them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|For a free game this comes with a lot and I like that you have to earn enough coins to buy a new game so it makes this game last
B0054JZC6E|2.0|It is a good time waster, but I definitely would not choose to play this over some other games. It is ok for being a free game.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Update:<br /><br />AccuWeather has rolled out a new app which I consider to be terrible.  Although loaded with lots of weather information;  it is way too difficult to navigate, the graphics are too small to be useable, and the app is not user friendly.<br /><br />One of the frustrating problems is the app allows a user to add locations;  but makes it almost impossible to delete locations !  Even the Kindle tech people couldn't figure it out.<br /><br />I will look for alternative weather apps.....AccuWeather ruined a good thing when they revamped their site.<br /><br />Nice graphics along with good weather data.<br /><br />But the app does not allow User to remove cities once entered.  Since I travel a lot, my list of weather locations is annoyingly long!<br /><br />If Accuweather tweaked this problem, then I would rate 5 stars.<br /><br />Another suggestion: add \\"Dewpoint\\"  to the weather data.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was about to buy this a couple of days ago, but felt that it was more of a luxury than necessity, but now that it's free, I've no qualms about getting it :)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I couldn't put it down and finished the book in a few days. Ive been searching online for a good romantic mystery and this book topped off what I was looking for. Must read!!
B00243FQFA|5.0|Excellent quality and packing from Amazon..   The last season is excellent ! I was hoping that Atlantis would go for 5 more seasons.. but unfortunately it had to end here.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are really fun games. 116 of them acctually. You earn points so you can. Cash them in to buy games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this resource. a little hummed I can't use it without wifi, but its on my iphone so I'm good to go! love lifechurch.tv and all of their resources!!!
0374275637|5.0|This is perhaps the most interesting book I have ever read.  It has changed the way I think about thinking. It's a beautiful thing when science is written about, by the person who conducted the research, in a clear and insightful manner. This book is even better than it looks based on descriptions and reviews.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty good. could be a little better setup though but for the price who could complain. I would recommend this to anyone untreated in passing time, without spending money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is not actually not bad, it shows how good.games now a days are played by people like me
B0058VW36U|1.0|This app should be free and cost money because some people can't afford to just. Pay for something fun like this.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The Alfa AWUS036NHR has outstanding performance.  I went from 1 bar to all 5 bars - with almost zero link errors. This is definately the best adapter that I have used - and I have several so called high performance wireless adapters. KUDO's to Alfa for making such a great product!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A wonderful book by a true American hero.  I highly recommend this book.  Gives a great insight to the mind of this great man.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game so far. Doing pretty well, cant wait to see what the other 107 games are! I suggest you to download it right away!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a awesome game that is awesome. endless play time. one hundred seventeen apps in one. I recommend this game to ever one person on earth.
0062060554|4.0|Watson artfully crafts a thoughtful yet suspenseful narrative. The protagonist is fleshed out beautifully: flawed, yet sympathetic. The novel addresses how precarious written knowledge--especially knowledge concerning someone's life--can be.
B0055Q5F36|2.0|this was not for the regular samsung galaxy s II as i thought bec i was so excited to order it for my bf i did not pay attention the i9100 really is something different..lol..so i had/have to return this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome for time passing. I got this game two days ago and it is great. I played it theehole time while traveling.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|it just didn't work!  Another person reviewed this product who had the same problem.  I would tell anyone who is thinking about getting this (because it is cheap) to seriously reconsider.  Spend the money and get something that is actually going to play a tape!
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|They Could have done a lot better then this. It drags on and on and then turns to crap. It also left the story wide open like all of The Avengers movies. It doesn't have a good story and is not the Captain America it should be. Hopefully when they pull all these stories together it will satisfy until then we are left with open stories.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. I found the mood and the story to be very romantic - even with its romantic disappointments. All of the cameos from the 20s are really fun, and Owen Wilson is surprisingly charming in his portrayal of Gil. It's a short story with a succinct message, which I found to be sweet and melancholy. The filming is beautiful and golden. Very romantic. Would watch again.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|A little cumbersome on a phone, but excellent app.  Simple config and start up.  It is great to have the ability to remote from a highly mobile device.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Force close on mytouch 4g, at least once a day. Otherwise I love it! Very useful and intuitive design, and helps me keep up to date with the widget.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A few of my cousins recommended this book so I decided to try it out and I am so happy I did! the book grabbed my attention and kept it the entire time! I could not put it down and cannot wait to read the second and third books!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|eBay is cool. I like the app... it's pretty easy to use and shop on once in a while. I think the UI is laid out nicely - and it's free, so order it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|After pouring over tons of reviews for Kindle Fire covers I settled on this one. I wanted something that would not add a lot of bulk or weight since I tote the thing around in my purse. It's only been about a week but so far it's exactly what I needed. The stand works well enough for reading and basic use but not for anything too crazy and I have a feeling that over time, as the cover material wears a little, the stand be less sturdy. The cutouts for the speakers are a nice touch. Still, could have been a little cheaper, maybe $5-$10 less.
B005KELR3A|2.0|I was mostly disappointed with this product although I have purchased several Belkin products previously and had come to expect good value. For the price (about $25) I expected a nicer sleeve, but this one is very minimal, having exactly enough room for my Kindle, and no frills. It is functional, but I think the pricing should have been about $15, so I felt it was definitely over priced.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This makes no sense to me. Yes, it is the AotD, but there is no need for this when perfectly good, free, proven alternatives are out there. I've successfully been remoting into my home PC for over a year from my EVO.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Kind of slow, but good. I think the battle between the main characters is interesting, especially when they are trying to sabotage each other. Good movie.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Ive always been a fan of the Matrix. But this takes the gold..... I bought this set for myself , and a friend.I love the crisp HD Blueray on the TV , and all the extras make it even better. Your a fan? You'll love this set!!!
B003G4W49C|1.0|Ok wth I downloaded this book on my kindle and it wont let me read the book at all. All I am able to view is the title page. This is the first book I actually payed for and not got for free or used my prime account for and it doesn't even work...
B000641MB6|5.0|Years ago we bought a 50th anniversary VCR tape of this movie, the B&W version. We are in the process of replacing all our tapes with DVDs. We had looked for this one, but found only the colorized versions. We were excited to find this one. I was a little disappointed that it didn't start with the movie trailer like the tape did, but when I checked out the extras there was the trailer. Love it!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Thank you Kindle Fire. I watched this movie on the plane and could zone out for a few hours. It was a really good movie - I was super impressed and really liked the story. .. not overdone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a great variety of games, some are more challenging then others.  definitely worth the price, free.  works well on kindle fire
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have only just begun this book,[[ASIN:1451627289 11/22/63: A Novel]] but it captured my attention right away. I recommend this book to King fans and non-fans alike.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I only installed this because they claimed you could play Warcraft. I will be darned if I wasn't playing warcraft on my Kindle Fire. Not the ideal setup but it would be fine for check auctions or chatting.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|This is one of the apps that you should have if you find yourself being thrust into regular travel. A few minutes of research after you land in the plane, and you're off to the best pancakes and strip clubs the area has to offer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game.  It was free, and I play it the most. You need Internet access to deal a winning deal, but other than that it's great!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works well in my home Lan. But does not work on PCs without a real ip, such as office server, client, etc...
0060873027|3.0|At the best this book can rate an okay.  AS a Crichton afficiando for years i own everything he has ever written including the Psuedonyms like case of need in original hardback.  I like several of you was destined to read this book despite having grave doubts about any ability for it to be good.  I was a little thrown off after Pirate Latitudes and im always hesitant when a book comes out from a writer who has been dead for over 3 years, lets hope hes not the tupac of word processor.  You can get a blurb from the back of the book but if your wondering whether the book is any good or not and not what the story line was then here it goes.  lets be honest 3 stars is the best it can go.  The writing is incredibly predictable at times and other times it seems that it was written for pure shock factor and not because it advanced the story any.  The end was to quick and the climax was weak, i never once found myself having to read another page.  I of course finished it and lined it up in my library with the other Crichtons but Jurassic Park it is not.  Also i found the fact checking in this book to be off.  Normally Crichtons book are go to when facts are involved and im not talking about the premis that people can be shrunk, its a novel i can suspend disbelief for that, im talking insect facts that just arent true.  I will give only one example, about halfway through the book Preston speaks of the black widow being the most poisonous spider in the world.  While i believe that title goes to the Australian funnel web spider i do know for certain that black widows are only fatal to the very young, the very old, or the very allergic and most people can survive without the antidote.  I hate to say it i hope this is the last book that tags Crichtons name.  Still i didnt hate it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app! Fun and easy to figure out. The ads can be annoying between each deal, but the game is worth it.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|I haven't seen anyone mention it yet, but the digipak version of this album includes one of Epica's best songs...Replica (a Fear Factory cover/remake).  This is not a typical Epica song and it deals with a controversial subject (child of a rape victim), which is probably why it was left off the regular version of the album, but it is a great song that all Epica fans should have.  Some parts of the song have Simone's voice being digitally altered, kind of industrial sounding, and other parts have her voice clear and beautiful.  I was really shocked at first to hear an angry sounding Simone singing \\"I am rape.  I am hate.\\", but she does a great job with it.  If you don't already have this album, be sure to get the version with this bonus track!  If you already have the album, the song Replica is also available on the single for Chasing The Dragon.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|singing for change lifts the soul great to watch or listen to highly addictive got to sing along with highly recommend this to others to purchase
B003L77G6A|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of the best shows of all time!! and I got it on a great deal on Black Friday.
141690977X|3.0|I loved the movie so I thought I should give the book a chance but as soon as I finished this book the only thing I could think was, 'This is ridiculous.'  Sure, some parts were cute and did make sense but for the most part I thought it was wrong. Yes, obviously, you shouldn't date a married man or a guy who only wants you at 3am. But that doesn't mean you should think that every guy who isn't constantly calling you or begging for your attention isn't into you. Just like girls, some men are afraid to look clingy or desperate, you have to show that you are into them also. If you follow all the rules/guide lines in this book most guys are going to end up thinking; She's just not that into me. This book will leave you thinking that no men get scared, that all men are insanely confident and that he isn't nervous to call you after that date, he just doesn't like you. The real truth is, some men are shy and need the validation that you like him too.  You don't need this book to tell you if some guy likes you, all you need is your common sense and how he makes you feel.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is great works just like it should. Setup was easy and quick and it has a nice interface. Makes my kindle fire even more useful.
B000001GBK|3.0|I may have made a mmistake, but based on the photo I expected a CD, but got a tape...and have nothing to play it on................oh well............hope it wasn't my fault as I do business here constantly  Diane
B00689ILQC|5.0|This CD is fabulous and it was a great deal of only $2.99 on Christmas Eve. Who could pass that up? :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok but trying to get all the games is hard. I mean it is also pretty stupid. but it is good forbpassing time.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I installed this app on my phone, and downloaded the desktop version for my PC.  Later that same day I came home to find a nasty bad root-kit Trojan installed on my computer.  I had installed no other software besides Splashtop, and had not browsed to any websites.  I have been building computers for over 15 years, and I have never gotten a virus/worm/trojan before.  I run Microsoft Security Essentials, and Windows Defender.  My firewall is up at all times.  This application leaves a port open on your computer listening for a remote access request.  Believe me someone other than you can exploit this.  I had to format my drive and re-install Windows 7 to keep my computer safe.  I would not install this software again if you paid me.  If you look through reviews carefully you will find I am not the only person to have this experience.  I have nothing to gain by telling you this, I'm just hoping others don't go through what I and others have gone through.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|My husband and I both got Kindle Fires for Birthday / Christmas gifts of which he bought a cover from a chain store while I ordered mine off amazon accessories for kindles. We both agree that the Kindle Cover from Amazon is much better quality than the competitons.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Pretty responsive. I have Team Veiwer Free which is pretty good, but Splashtop allows me to watch videos and other things that require a fast refresh rate. It could you use a better desktop client. I'd also really like a way to send files to my phone.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|One of the best apps on the amazon market. I'm fiffteen so I have tons of music and my only complaint is I wish you could put music from your computer to your kindle fire. Or just copy anything from your computer to your kindle/aneroid device.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|the app force closes after install, won't load at all, this twenty word minimum is silly, just so totally silly optimus s
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I can watch these episodes over and over. Sheldon is the geek some of us wish we could be, and some of us are afraid we are.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I've had trouble getting to sleep for the past few months, and since the very first day I bought this app for my kindle fire, I've slept like a baby! I fall asleep every night to Beach 3! Must buy app!

0689835604|5.0|My toddler loves lift-the-flap books, and this book got us hooked on Karen Katz!  When I firstread the book to my son, I'd stop on the page where you lift the shirt to look at the baby's belly button, and I'd lift my own shirt to show him my belly button.  Well, for a while my son wanted to look at everyone's belly button!  He went around lifting up people's shirts to see if they had belly buttons!  Of course, sometimes he checked their backs instead of their bellies, so he didn't always have luck!    My son loves to have me read this book to him, and also loves to \\"read\\" it to himself.  He's even played peek-a-boo with the baby in the picture, by lifting the flap up and down!  We now own a number of Karen Katz's lift-the-flap books, and this is my favorite because the flaps are harder for my little guy to rip out.  I think this is because some of them fold down, instead of up, and because the flaps are smaller.  The Karen Katz books that have whole-page flaps had the flaps ripped out of them pretty quickly, even when I reinforced them with packing tape.  Bright colors combined with a sweet, simple story-- we love Karen Katz!
B000002KHH|5.0|These dudes have a reputation for being plodding, but this (and their first) records prove that stereotype wrong in spades.  The instrumental action behind Mr. Osborne is fabulous, and should be recognized as such.  The plodders who think that \\"Sweet Leaf\\" are all that Sabb is all about are sadly mistaken.  There's sprightliness afoot, damn ye!
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I've been using remote access software daily for 15 years, starting with pcAnywhere and Timbuktu over dialup. I've been using mostly VNC and RDP in the last few years, but thought I'd give this one a shot. I remembered the Splashtop name as a company who made a quick-boot Linux built into your BIOS.   Despite their origins, though, they neglect to mention that their &quot;PC&quot; server software requires Windows. I discovered this after purchasing the app and going to download the server on my Ubuntu laptop, only to find many people asking where the Linux version was without a response. Glad it was free today; sorry that Amazon allows this kind of misleading ad copy in their store.   Guess it's back to AndroidVNC for me, but I'll hang onto this in case of the unlikely event that a client of mine uses Splashtop as their remote support solution.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love how there are so many games to choose from! You can never get bored! The games are challenging and fun.
B005N0C0JQ|4.0|The much publicized break up of Oasis and subsequent fueding over the last several months have done nothing to diminish the place of the band in the hearts and minds of legions of fans. The only question was: who will make music first, and whose will be better? Was Noel really the brains behind Oasis? Was Liam just the singer of his brother's words and melodies?  Liam and the rest of the boys from Oasis were the first out of the gate with their new band Beady Eye, and I think the album \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\" is a fantastic offering. Full of classic rock tunes and swagger. But, it is missing something, and that something is found on \\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.\\"  Noel has made it clear that he is a songwriter and does not want to be viewed as a guitar player or vocalist. That said, the songs are this album's strentgh. In fact, the guitar playing is beautifully understated which gives room for piano and strings.  The songs are what make this album special. The instantly recognizable melodies, song structures, and that inexplicable good feeling that comes from listening to a Noel penned tune. A good portion of this album is classic, and by that I mean no one else working in music today can write a song that feels timeless. All of Oasis' records, including the few that were sub-par, have these classic songs on them. Noel truly is the Paul McCartney of his generation.  Now, the bad news. This album is missing something vital, and that is the energy and aggression of Liam's vocals. Don't get me wrong, Noel is a competent singer, but several of these tracks beg for the younger brother's voice.   Secondly, the music is more subdued than I would have liked. It feels as though Noel knows he is not in a rock and roll band anymore and has put together a collection of mid-tempo tracks with not much to get your heart going. I'm not saying that it isn't energetic, it's just a different kind of energy.  Basically my conclusion is this: Noel is an amazing songwriter. Liam is an amazing singer. Gem, Andy, and Chris are amazing musicians. Together they were, in my opinion, one of the greatest bands of all time. Now that they've split it has become obvious what each of them brought to the collective.   I'm thankful to have albums from each side, but it only serves as reminder, a nagging thought at the back of my brain that wonders what they could have made together.

B004VUP8WK|4.0|If you are a hardcore death metal fanatic you won't like this album. If you approach it with an open mind you might just think it's awesome. I haven't listened to Morbid Angel since Blessed Are the Sick. I even saw them on that tour. After that I thought most of their stuff was too generic sounding. Now, many years later I stumbled across this release on Spotify and gave it a listen. I've listened to it 3 times in the last 2 days which is extremely unusual for me. It really has something different about it that makes it worth listening to. People are complaining about the lyrics but I for one like that they are not your typical death metal crap. This is without a doubt the best new death metal album I've heard since In Flames last release.

0312641893|4.0|New Beijing is under threat. The King is lying on his deathbed, his Queen already dead and his son, Prince Kai, feeling utterly unprepared for what the next few days could bring ... because plague is ravaging earth. A plague called Leutmosis, with a high mortality rate and no known cure.<br /><br />Above the earth, the Lunar planet looms large and foreboding, and Queen Levana has her sights set on Prince Kai for a political marriage. And as part of her bargaining, Levana is dangling a cure to Leutmosis before Kai's eyes.<br /><br />Down in the dregs of society works Cinder, New Beijing's most talented mechanic. Cinder is also a Cyborg - a hated faction in this world, where the human/machine hybrids are considered monstrous and given few rights. And while the plague ravages the city, Cyborg's are being drawn like a lottery for cure `experiments', whether they like it or not.<br /><br />Cinder is owned by wealthy woman, Adri, whose husband bought Cinder and then left her in his family's care when he tragically succumbed to Leutmosis. Adri has two girls, the egotistical Pearl and lovable little Peony. They are not sisters, but Cinder loves Peony like she's family.<br /><br />Cinder works to pay Adri's bills and clothe Pearl in pretty dresses. But when Prince Kai arrives at her mechanic stall one day, she is tasked with a new job that will have repercussions for everyone around her ...<br /><br />`Cinder' is the debut sci-fi Fairytale from Marissa Meyer, putting a new-world spin on the old `Cinderella' story ...<br /><br />I have been looking forward to this book, ever since I fell in love with new ABC show `Once Upon a Time', which puts old Fairytales in a kooky modern small-town setting. If vampires were 2009, angels so 2010 and zombie pass&eacute; by 2011, then Fairytales is definitely the new theme du-jour of the paranormal/sci-fi scene. And Marissa Meyer's `Cinder' is jus the book to scratch this new itch!<br /><br />As the title suggests, `Cinder' is a reimagining of the old `Cinderella' Fairytale. Except that out princess is a Cyborg, plague is ravaging the kingdom and the closest thing you'll get to a fairy godmother is an adorable little android called Iko. A few footnotes of the traditional fable remain the same (if a little futuristically skewed), like Cinder's `stepmother' being her owner. A glass slipper is more likely to be a new detachable mechanical foot. And the pumpkin carriage is actually a (vintage) gasoline car!<br /><br />Meyer has done wonders with twisting and modernizing the old `Cinderella' tale, and with each modification and story adjustment comes new delights. Cyborg Cinder is ingenious - not only is she the downtrodden worker to her owner, Adri, but she is apart of a detested segment of society. I loved the ramifications this has on the story, Cinder as a minority in New Beijng, whose Cyborg `race' is so discriminated against that a lottery has even been created to force them to be guinea pigs for cures against Leutmosis.<br /><br />The setting of `Cinder' is a future one not dissimilar to Joss Whedon's TV series `Firefly', in which the future had heavy oriental-influence (presumably because China and the like had become the new world power). Androids are servants, and Cyborgs are discriminated against. Above the Earth looms the Lunar planet, inhabited by beautiful people and ruled by an insane, vain, mind-bending Queen.<br /><br />And since Meyer is sticking to a few Fairytale conventions, there is still a handsome prince (phew!). Kai is still reeling from his mother's plague-death, and is now looking at a similar fate for his father ... which would make Kai king. The crown holds even less appeal since Queen Levana set her sights on Kai as her husband. Levana has a particularly horrible history - there are rumours that she murdered her husband, scarred younger (prettier) female royals and organized an arson attack against her baby niece.<br /><br />But when Kai requires mechanical assistance from Cinder, their crossed-paths has ramifications on the kingdom that neither of them could have ever imagined.<br /><br />I did really enjoy `Cinder'. It's a dusting off of an old Fairytale, and Meyer has customized her new imagining with much-needed updates. Like how Cinder is less `woe is me' and more stubborn, take-charge. I would even say that the `evil' stepmother is given a bit of heart in this new tale, and she's all the more interesting for not being so black and white.<br /><br />There are a few things that didn't work for me in this book, and they have been touched on by other reviewers. Meyer isn't great at in-depth scene setting - I got the `Firefly' reference from other readers, and it's only because I'm a devoted Browncoat that I was able to flesh out this futuristic oriental city in my mind. I would have liked more atmospheric writing on the city of New Beijing, beyond Meyer simply offering up the `Beijing' name and expecting readers to add flying cars and androids to the City as we know it. I also think there were a few missed moments between Cinder and her `family', particularly Adri and Pearl, the traditional `villains'. True, in Meyer's new version the step-family aren't the focus of evil, that's much more Queen Levana, but I still think it would have been nice if Meyer had delved more into Cinder's home life. Pearl, the rotten sister, is awful but doesn't get much page-time and comes across as a little one-dimensional because of it. Adri, on the other hand, started out typically-villainous, but towards the end I wanted to spend more time with her since grief and circumstance fleshed her out with new dimensions...<br /><br />But there are minor complaints about an otherwise breathtaking story. I was a little surprised by the ending, only because I thought `Cinder' would be a stand-alone novel (I was under the impression that Meyer would be updating all the Fairytale princesses - `The Little Android'? `Beauty and the Robot'?). But I was pleasantly surprised to discover that `Cinder' will be a continuing saga ... and it makes sense, since so much of this first book is about building political upheaval and winding a royal mystery.<br /><br />`Cinder' is a delightfully modernized spin on the old `Cinderella' story. Marissa Meyer's new Fairytale is a dark delight - about a plague-ravaged kingdom, a royal conspiracy and the Cyborg mechanic at the heart of it all. Brilliant!ly enjoy `Cinder'.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|nice app. would be even nicer if amazon would make the tablet (HD) version available same day they make the \\"phone\\" version the FAOTD. have seen both versions a few times on FAOTD and would like to see consistency. all that said, great app, and how can you complain too much when it's free...?

B004O3YGMC|1.0|I can understand how they left encryption for their Pro version.  I don't understand how they can leave the remote computer unlocked when you sign in to it.  Even the Windows RDP client will keep the remote computer locked when you log in.  With this program, the second you log in, someone walking by at the remote computer has full access.  There should also be an easy way to turn keyboard prediction off from within the program, so you can easily and securely enter passwords. If you forget to turn prediction off in Android (which means exiting the program and going through some menus), your Android keyboard will end up remembering your passwords as you enter them. Splashtop should just let you treat text boxes on the remote computer as password vs regular text boxes with a simple toggle.
1451648537|5.0|Having read Isaacson's bio of Einstein, I knew he was a good writer. This book is his finest. One can only hope that every CEO and every member of every corporate board will read this. I kept wanting to mark pages where profound thoughts emerged but couldn't bring myself to mar the text. Guess I need to go back thru and put notes on a separate piece of paper. An incredible read!!

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. never heard of an Indian named mark benson or a windows call center were if you call it back you get the same location and someone who knows exactly who you are talking with other than having it noted in their system.

It's not a family movie or one for kids so be sure of that, but for an action R picture had quite some meaning to it.

B005D51JQQ|1.0|Bought this as a last minutes gift for the holidays and paid the full price.  I was so disappointed that it was only 3 CDs of \\"remastered\\" songs and a rather short DVD of a concert.  Compared to the Springsteen and other artists box sets (that cost a fraction of the $ when first released) I feel that I have been taken to the cleaners on this. I know he has 6 kids to support but really.
1883398088|5.0|This was my first introduction to the artwork of one of my favorite artists in the world, H.R. Giger (Geeger, not Geiger).  This book is a perfect blend of a fascinating look at the creative process of moviemaking and a first rate art book.  Most people are familiar with Giger's art through his Oscar winning work on Alien.  This book tells it all, from how he was discovered by the filmmakers to the final product and all the twisting alleys in between.  If this is all you know about Giger, check out this book to see some truly groundbreaking work in cinema (remember, this was the mid 70s) in sci-fi and horror.  There are gorgeous reproductions of Giger's finished art from his production designs as well as showing the creative process of bringing the world's scariest special effect into existence.  This is not an exhaustive exploration of the movie Alien.  Start with the Alien Vault for that.  But this is a great telling of the story of the central character, the Alien.  You will learn a lot.  Check it out.

1400069181|5.0|If you're an entrepreneur, Start Something That Matters will inspire you to start or grow your business in a way that can make a truly difference.   If you've become numb to the business world because we're always bombarded with companies doing the wrong thing, this book will give you a refreshing feeling that some people really are trying to do the right thing.  And if you just want to read some heart-warming tales, I guarantee your eyes will well up at least once throughout the book as you hear about TOMS first shoe drop, the way passionate TOMS fans are getting involved, or even the story about a girl who walked across a restaurant to introduce herself to her now husband, just because she knew if he was wearing TOMS he was a good guy.  Author Blake Mycoskie (founder of TOMS) shares his own stories about growing a business out of what was once just an idea in his journal during a trip to Argentina. Don't be fooled, the book goes far beyond the TOMS brand. Start Something That Matters includes profiles on other companies and non-profits that are truly making a difference.  Every time I picked up this book I felt inspired to start pulling together ideas for my own business. Now that I've completed the book, I plan on reading biographies of other creative entrepreneurs (as Blake suggests), and gathering information so I can start my own something that matters.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|I'll admit, I bought this after seeing his Christmas special. This looked like it would be a fun and yet at the same time classic Christmas record, but wow, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you're actually listening to it closely while doing something else, it's so boring you might fall asleep! The songs are lack any personality. If you're just using this album as background music while you have friends over, that could work much better.
B001AW156U|4.0|Easy to install snaps right on. Fit and finish are good, look to be good quality. Makes the L2 R2 triggers a lot easier to hit and keeps your fingers in place. Great for FPS games, and seems to ease a bit of fatigue. Overall for the price I'd recommend them.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|So I was eagerly awaiting this movie as i remembered seeing the trailer in the theatre.. After watching the film, unfortunately the movie did not live up to the hype. So here are the pro's and con's  Pro's   All star cast!!  Some suspense at times   kept me thinking   Con's   Weak acting  It was of the movie was developed on a shoestring budget   Cheezy music   Just did not keep me on the edge of my seat   Would I recommend someone renting this movie?  If you have some time and don't mind spending several bucks sure..  But be warned you will be watching a B movie with A actors....

B002ZG98UA|2.0|big guy with the ax was cool but part four was a big disappointment. The game part four was way better than the movie. The big guy with the ax reminded me of the game more than the movie did. The beginning of this movie could have been erased completely. The ending sets up for yet another sequel....that is destined to fail. They should drop the whole storyline that they have and make a movie based off of the video game....Resident Evil 4. The movie was too Matrix like and didn't really have a definite plot. They tried to play up the special effects but I have seen enough of the Matrix and wanted something different. The movie skips in the plot and doesn't make sense. It isn't real life like the Walking Dead. This movie has definitely gone away from making something that could happen in real life to something that they just want people to be amazed with special effects, which really aren't that great anyway. We have seen this all before. The next Resident Evil movie should be made as the game, Resident Evil 4.

This app blocks them from doing that and from accessing anything else on my kindle I don't want them too. All the programs and games they are allowed to play are placed in this app, like its a seperate room and they can't leave the room without a password. Its great! I'm very happy with it.

The protagonist is a surly 16 year old girl, fighting to better her family both figuratively and literally. I have rarely enjoyed a character so much.
B005ZUR724|5.0|They lowered the price from 6.99 to .99!! This is a STEAL people. My theory for why they did this is because of the low rating. Don't be fooled! It was getting some bad ratings because of an update issue (don't believe me? google it!). This game was exactly what I was looking for. It's pretty much a WoW clone. Fantastic graphics and solid gameplay this far. Only took me about an hour to hit level 5 when you get your first talent point... the talent tree looks lengthy (good thing!!). Haven't gotten into the story yet but this game looks amazing! Super cheap subscription too!   If you're looking for a great mmorpg then look no further. $.99 for 3 months of this is a steal. Take it from me. I've played all the blizzard classics and many more including all the elder scroll games. This game is a freaking steal at a measley dollar!! - ANameYouCanTrust

076115678X|5.0|I am so pleased that I bought this book as recommended to me from a friend. when I received it I read through it immediately to begin \\"living\\" as a curly girl! There is so much information provided within these pages to get you started along with a very useful section on FAQ's and an excellent DVD is also included. To start, you have to find out which type of curly girl you are and you are set from there. I love that the author offers homemade hair recipes and even those too turned out to work great on my hair. Mind you, you have to be patient if you really want to yield those curly results as your hair has been used to be brushed, colored, and most likely overly processed. I have to also say, that when I read the section on tossing out my combs and brushes that I was more than a bit apprehensive to doing so, however, I did not hesitate and threw them out same day and have not regretted it at all! My hair is stronger and more healthy then it's ever been! I highly recommend this book to anyone!
1451648537|3.0|I loved the author's prior work, his short stories, compilations and especially his complete biographies of Franklin, Kissinger, etc. But in the end it seems Jobs' life simply is not as deep and interesting as these other people.  People like Franklin and Einstein will endure for generations while Jobs' legacy will be, at most, a mere footnote. Not even Walter Isaacson can change this.  The book starts out slow and tedious, with all sorts of obscure and largely irrelevant technical details about computer case models, power supplies and processor architecture. I suspect this is because there simply is nothing more interesting that could be uncovered. It goes on to detail important moments in Jobs' life, but the majority of these moments are important to Jobs and no one else. There re a few moments that lead to dramatic change - the iPod, etc., but not much that really inspires.  I am disappointed, not by the author but by the shallow and repetitive nature of the subject. After reading, I feel less inspired by Jobs - knowing his life was spent repackaging the work of other people.

B004JMSIRC|5.0|Okay, so I'm following the whole super hero thing primarily because they are great action films that allow me to use the full functionality of my 3D TV along with my 7.1 surround sound system.  I almost never go to a movie any more.  After taking my grandson to the movies to see super 8, I may never go to a movie again unless it's an IMAX movie.  Super 8 was way better on blu ray in my living room.  I kid you not. By the way, that is also a very good movie that is full of nuance.I just wait for the Blu Ray release, make some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.  It's way cheaper.  That being said, this movie well made the grade for such an endeavor.  The storyline is tight, well told, well paced and well acted.  About the only complaint that I can make has to do with the sound.  I found myself using close-caption since some parts of the movie was inaudible.  This tragedy...yes I said tragedy is found in alot of movies now-a-days.  What the heck are the producers thinking when they know that great technology is at their fingertips.  What's all of the mumbling about?  I'm sure that I'm not the only one screaming about this.  Why mumble when you can speak. Clearly. Decisively. With intent. So that you can be heard. Through one or eight speakers.  Nonetheless, this cannot be blamed on the actors. Weight must fall on the directors and producers.  If the mike can pick up the slightest sound, then have the actor stand back a little to match the mike. How hard is this?  Fortunately, movies made since the time of the release of this one seem to be made better and with more attention paid regarding spoken voice audibility.  If you are going to see the avengers this year then you must see this movie since it is an integral part of that storyline. Not withstanding the crappy audio, I still highly recomment this movie because it is a great storyline with stellar action.
B005HMHPGI|5.0|Although the giftset doesn't indicate it, this does have both Black and White and Color copies.  If you are used to watching this on DVD or even VHS you will be amazed at how sharp and crisp everything is.  The color rendition is much improved from the way it was when it was done back in the 80's on TV (before a copyright law changed and made that version illegal to display).  The box has a velvet exterior which is kind of neat, and the bell ornament is better than I expected it to be.

0767827716|3.0|I'm a Stephen King fan (well, a fan of his early endeavors, at least); and in his heyday John Carpenter could craft an impressive \\"Boo\\" flick.  Accordingly CHRISTINE is one of those films I always wanted to view, yet over the decades our paths never crossed until recently (thank you, cable).  So I watched this macabre, metaphysical tale about a 1957 Plymouth Fury's demented affection for a high school nerd.  And?<br /><br />Seen better.  Seen worse.<br /><br />No complaints with the scenes depicting the car's violent dysfunction; no telling how many old Plymouths the filmmakers totaled as Christine mangles and mutilates her lover's enemies--and subsequently gets crushed, squished, and burned in her own right.  I'm a guy; watching stuff get torn up is how I roll.  Yet antiques going on rampages do not a horror film make--give me some character development, conflict, angst, turmoil. . .even a character remotely empathetic.  None of the above happened in this film--from nerd-turned-psychotic Arnie (Keith Gordon), to his jockster chum Dennis (John Stockwell), to mutual romantic interest Leigh (Alexandra Paul, whose bizarre facial expressions via close-up still have me scratching my head).  Throw in some high school bullies (who look like they're 3 years away from drawing Social Security) and a gruff garage shop owner, and not one, count 'em, not one character is likable or vaguely identifiable.  So following the climactic Christine vs. Bulldozer grudge match, with the former's rock 'n roll radio going dark, we get the slightest impression the now-compacted '57 Plymouth might be beginning to stir once again.  Was that a wiper blade starting to move on its own?  Alas, I'm too indifferent to care.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|ok... it needs work but its good. 1st I have a kindlefire and the app is pretty good::: flaws: when I click &quot;watch the video&quot; it wont let me watch it, ever. and second when I download the video I only can download it on mp3 player and 90% of the time it would say download complete and I go to the mp3 to watch it and its not there. anyways its good but need work

B003ZSJ212|3.0|I purchased this DVD collection and played Episode 1.  The default sound type is set for 6.1 sound.  I do not have 6.1 sound and the sound was silent so I selected 5.1 sound but it is only available in English with commentary.  The commentary is for site challenged persons.  I am hearing challenged so I also like to have closed captions turned on.  I spent an hour trying to get the commentary eliminated with no luck.  Why would Lucas make the DVD with no 5.1 un-commented version of sound on the disk given it is probably the most prevalent sound system.  So please don't tell me to throw my 4 year old $1000 Audio equipment away and buy a new system.  Also apparently my audio equipment is not firmware upgradable to include more decoders.  I am very frustrated.  I will not buy more BluRay disks again because of the probability of having more audio problems.  BluRay is apparently not ready for prime time.  Buyer Beware.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This LED upgrade works as advertized offering bright while light compared to the stock incandescent bulb.  (30 lumens) offers a good balance of illumination and extending the battery life (25hrs).  The upgrade is as simple as removing and replacing the tailcap/switch and the reflector housing/lamp. (Remember that the LED is polarized +/- so if it does not work, rotate the lamp 180degrees in the holder).  This LED upgrade is worth the price and a great way to refresh your little old MagLite and also allow the batteries to last longer. The tailcap switch also works fine and you will enjoy turning on the light and not have to adjust the beam focus...

B004LWZWBU|5.0|This movie should have flown up the box office lists. Sure, it's about birds, *and*, really, it's about what lengths people go to when they are crazy for something. Could be birds, could be comic books, could be orchids. Everybody has something in their lives this film could relate to, if the marketing had been more astute.<br /><br />Besides, the birds are gorgeous, and the three stars are all great comedians. They chose to do these roles for a reason!<br /><br />Tip -- if you don't want to buy it, rent it. But do see the closing credits for one of the most beautiful sequences in movies.

B0034G4P94|5.0|Friends,this movie was not about the MMA or the fighting. The fight scenes were unbelievable real with every move they made and in every scene. But the inter-family feud, their conflicts , emotions with the true to life drama and the love within the tragedy was always foremost in this great epic.  I watched it, I bought it and it is to great not to share with all my friends.  All who see this movie will remember it always.

0062082353|5.0|My business partner is a former Navy SEAL and a close personal friend of Chris Kyle. I have been hearing stories about him for the last couple of years and I am now glad to see he got a book deal so his story could be published before someone else wrote it and messed it up. You'll find most SEAL warriors have a conservative view being they are never appreciated by the LIBERAL AMERICAN MEDIA. But we Americans sure appreciate him and thank him for killing the 255 terrorists! He probably saved thousands of American lives. Thank you Chief Kyle!

B004O3YGMC|1.0|In their user agreement, they state that they will track you on their website, and with their software. Since this is their software, that means they will be tracking everything you do on it.  Tracking, no matter what form, or what actual information is collected is wrong.  Due to their agreement, I hit decline, and it exited the software, so I didn't actually get to test it.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app, and all the translations it has to offer. It's easy enough to use, and has all the features that I would personally use in a Bible app. One thing that I would really love, though, is the ability to download the NLT translation for offline use. Other than that, I have no problems with this app.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|I have had the case for a month.  I thought a clear case would look cool with my new 4GS. The case fits very well, however it is not easy on and off because of the hard plastic construction.  Since I don't take the case off very often this is a never mind for me.  Haven't had any problems taking flash pictures.  The case is very protective, while maintaining good access to all the ports and controls. Haven't tried it with a docking station, but the opening looks plenty wide.  The screen protector works very well and the case covers the edges of the screen protector so it doesn't start to peel like my 3G protector did.  It took two minutes to get the bubbles out.  Use your thumb, not the useless scraper provided.  The only reason I gave this case a 4 star was the edges need to be a little more rounded.  It's a little uncomfortable to hold.  With the case on, the 4GS fits in the leather case I bought for my 3G.  Not the most fashionable, but considering the low price, I'm glad I bought it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great game although you have to earn all of the fun games. it is worth it to get it
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game for older kids and adults.  There is a fair amount of strategy involved, so it tends to frustrate our younger children.  Teens love it.  This set is a little on the flimsy side.  A friend has an older version and the game pieces are thick and click together well.  Not so with this set.  It is fine, but thin cardboard pieces.
1594744769|3.0|Because of the hype, I had high hopes for this book.  I just finished<br />it last night, and was rather disappointed.  The book had a couple of<br />glaring mistakes in the timeline, and it seemed the author spent more<br />time finding interesting old pictures than working on perfecting the<br />storyline.  It was interesting enough to finish, but not interesting<br />enough to recommend, or take up space on my bookshelf.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it! Its very easy to read, there are many different versions to choose from and you can even take notes and highlight as you go
B001B6PBBK|4.0|When you're looking for something light and easy to watch this is a good pick.  I had never heard of this movie and don't often care for Brittney Murphy but took a chance and really enjoyed this chick flick.  I would recommend to a friend.

B004AYCWY4|1.0|Other reviewers have written regards Professor Dawkins' superb ability to capture the wonders of nature in his writings.  This book follows the author's tradition of presenting lot's of interesting information regards the natural world.  Unfortunately, the organization has much to be desired.  Also included are the author's now typical emotional rants regards theology and, by inference, religion.  Such interjections add nothing to his arguments but rather demonstrate the futility of arguing with oneself.  I will limit myself here to the disagreements I have with Dawkins' understanding of science and thus my reasoning in assigning the book but 1 star in an otherwise 4 star endeavor.  Creationists have, in recent decades, made much of \\"evolution is only a theory.\\"  Dawkins, like other natural history writers in recent years, makes much of that now common cliché of his primary antagonists and thus takes that as the title of his first chapter which becomes, \\"Only a Theory?\\"  But it occurs to me that any exact scientist interested in the subject matter of natural history and already familiar with the now common Evolutionist's mantra that \\"evolution is a fact\\" ---  meaning that common ancestry is a truth certainty ---- any such exact scientist would appropriately take pause, beginning with the subtitle of Dawkins' book.  Most certainly, even assuming acceptance of the misuse of scientific \\"fact\\", such an exact scientist would thereafter be, or at least in my view ought to be, totally disconcerted by the end of Dawkins' first chapter.  In my view a chapter or book that some exact scientists might do justice to would be appropriately titled \\"Only a Fact?\\"  We thus begin with the subtitle of Dawkins' book.  It has been reported (Amit Goswami 2008) that the zoologist Julian Huxley, in a 1960 paper titled \\"The Evolutionary Vision\\" made this declaration:  \\"The first point to make about Darwin's theory is that it is no longer a theory, but a fact.\\" (Phillip Johnson 1991 also reports that at about the same time Huxley also enunciated \\"evolution\\" as a cosmic religion. Other authors indicate that such assignment of meaningless to \\"evolution\\" began even earlier with Herbert Spencer.)  Thus began the now common idea among natural historians of equating evolution (defined as inclusive of common descent and what I capitalize as Evolution) with \\"fact\\".  However, at least in my view and one would expect in the view of many professional exact scientists, the zoologist's idea of providing evidence (as opposed to verification) for a scientific fact is nonsensical.  Thus, even if one were to assume the bizarre notion that \\"evolution\\" is a scientific fact, the subtitle of Dawkins' book is inappropriate, to say the least.  Facts are facts and no evidence is required.  Rather, \\"facts\\" are verified and thereafter become the essential ingredients of science from which other scientific truths are based.  Observed facts, for example, might be used as inputs for laboratory experiments from which data, i.e. additional facts, result as experimental outputs.  Thus we come to chapter one of Dawkins' book where he very nicely provides us with the appropriate scientific definitions of theory and fact as taken from the OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY.  From Dawkins:  \\"THEORY, Sense 1:  A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed.\\"  Dawkins also provides the alternative O.E.D. definition used in everyday language, often used by Creationists, that equates theory to a mere hypothesis.  Dawkins next provides O.E.D.'s definition of \\"fact\\" as used in science:  \\"FACT: Something that has really occurred or is actually the case; something certainly known to be of thischaracter; hence, a particular truth known by actual observation or authentic testimony, as opposed to what is merely inferred, or to a conjecture or fiction; a datum of experience, as distinguished from the conclusions that may be based upon it.\\"  Unlike my own experience with the exact sciences ---- physics, chemistry, even high school biology --- Dawkins seems to turn the science on its head by playing up the first part of the definition.  Dawkins thus does the Creationists one better, or I should say one worse, and essentially adopts the secular, everyday notion of \\"fact\\" as something supposedly known or believed to be true.  This rejection by Dawkins, and his fellow natural history book writers of similar mindset, of the entirety of the above definition of \\"fact\\" allows these natural history writers to continually argue their case and present supposed evidences for their belief regards the supposed \\"fact of evolution\\", i.e., common ancestry.  I suggest that an exact scientist would not present evidence for a \\"fact\\".  Rather, facts, as the last phrase of the O.E.D. definition indicates, are either primary evidence towards confirming a theory (i.e., reaching conclusions) or else useful as inputs into laws which can then produce additional data (facts) useful in making predictions towards suggesting even additional facts that indeed are considered to also be facts once they too are verified by observations.  Facts additionally are often also of interest in themselves.  In my view, facts constitute the essence of science and are the primary subject matter of science. Discovering facts thus is a primary goal of science and, as the O.E.D. definition indicates, not conclusions to be endlessly argued for or against.  In the exact sciences facts, and I tend to believe that most exact scientists would agree, once verified, don't require evidence in support of themselves but rather stand on their own.  Facts based on direct or indirect observations generally ARE the evidences that are relevant to theories or which are of interest in and of themselves.  Contrary to Dawkins' understanding of science, for exact scientists, the remainder of OXFORD'S definition, beginning with \\"hence\\"' is inherently included in the consideration of 'what is meant by \\"scientific fact\\".  I suggest that for most exact scientists and even for naturalists as Dawkins and certainly Darwin, \\"actual observation or authentic testimony\\" is crucial to defining what it is that science is about.  Most scientists and science educators would additionally include the idea of repeatability or verifiability of observations (especially of those observations received as testimony from others) as being important.  A caveat with the O.E.D. definition is that \\"a datum of experience\\" might be better explicated as, or at least include, a datum resulting from experiment.  Dawkins doesn't end with the diminution of observations but rather goes even further in attempting to displace the scientific notion of \\"fact\\" with his own views and, seemingly, that of other zoologically trained natural historians.  Dawkins wants his readers to believe that \\"proper scientific inference\\" ought to take precedence over \\"fact\\".  Thus, for example, he believes that we ought to be able to accept that some organic beings share a common ancestor by mere inferences of the evidence presented --- e.g., similarities, samenesses, known shared ancestry, variations in descendants (microevolution), etc. --- and that such inferences take precedence over \\"actual observation or authentic testimony.\\"  I strongly disagree with Dawkins preference for inferences over observations and thus I disagree with his basic epistemology.  Rather, I accept the O.E.D.'s understanding of scientific \\"fact\\" with only minor improvement possibilities as indicated above.  Regards \\"testimony\\", Dawkins makes much of the common understanding that eyewitness 'accounts such as may be entered into evidence in jury trials have often been shown  by modern DNA evidence to be incorrect.  But in so arguing, Dawkins misses the point that included in the O.E.D. definition of \\"fact\\" such testimony must be accurate.  Eyewitness observations and testimony do not equate to scientific observations or to experimental evidence without the authentication of repeatability and thus verification.  I thus disagree with Dawkins' fundamental epistemology.  Space and time limit my ability to enter all such refutations of Dawkins' arguments here regards his certitude of common ancestry, i.e., Evolution.  However, to demonstrate the weakness of Dawkins' bluster, let's at least take a look at one or two of his arguments.  First, I do applaud Dawkins who, unlike many of his colleagues, fully recognizes the difference in definition of \\"homology\\" as used by Darwin who considered common descent as his hypothesis and the definition used by his successors who have generally included the idea of common descent within the definition of homology itself.  Dawkins at least has that right.  But Dawkins nevertheless goes beyond hypothesizing when he compares the human skeleton to that of the bat.  Dawkins writes (p.287-8):  \\"Our own skeleton is familiar enough to need no picture, but look at this skeleton of a bat. [A sketch of a bat is so provided.]  Isn't it fascinating how every bone has its own identifiable counterpart in the human skeleton?  Identifiable, because of the order in which they join up to each other.  Only the proportions are different.  The bat's hands are hugely enlarged (relative to its total size, of course) but nobody could possibly 'miss the correspondence between our fingers and those long bones in the wings.  The human hand and the bat hand are obviously --- no sane person could deny it --- two versions of the same thing.  The technical term for this kind of sameness is `homology.'  The bat's flying wing and our grasping hand are `homologous.'  The hands of the shared ancestor --- and the rest of the skeleton ---were taken and pulled, or compressed, part by part, in different directions and by different amounts, along different descendant lineages.\\"  So there you have it.  Dawkins' argument from homology could have been taken from the pages of Darwin long ago or from D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's ON GROWTH AND FORM (1942).  Indeed, here is what Charles Darwin did write in his ORIGINS OF SPECIES (1859, p.415-6):  \\"MORPHOLOGY:  We have seen that the members of the same class, independently of their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their organization.  This resemblance is often expressed by the term `unity of type' or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of the class are homologous. The whole subject is included under the general name of Morphology.  This is the most interesting department of natural history, and may be said to be its very soul.  What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions? Geoffroy St. Hilaire has insisted strongly on the high importance of relative connexion in homologous organs: the parts may change to almost any extent in form and size, and yet they always remain connected together in the same order.  We never find, for instance, the bones of the arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed.  Hence the same names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals.  We see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects:  what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of a beetle? ---- yet all those organs, serving for such different purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and twopairs of maxillae.  Analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans.  So it is with the flowers of plants.\\"  So far, so good.  But Darwin (and Dawkins) went too far, and in the view of Naturalistic Parallelism which this author proposes, Darwin chose one of the two incorrect explanations, the only naturalistic explanation available at the time, when he continued his thoughts in the next paragraph:  \\"Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine of final causes.  The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the `Nature of Limbs.'  On the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can only say that so it is;  ---- that it has so pleased the 'Creator to construct each animal and plant.\\"  But one need not invoke the supernaturalism or teology (\\"doctrine of final causes\\") of a William Paley, Louis Agassiz, or St. George Mivart to arrive at a more parsimonious and naturalistic answer.  One need not invoke the independent instantaneous creation of current day organic beings as was the view of Creationism of years past or as with current versions along the same lines.  Rather, the correct view is that of Naturalistic Parallelism.  Darwin could have stopped at \\"We see the same great law[s...]\\" and would have been fine.  The necessity of common ancestry is not a requirement in terms of producing samenesses, i.e., homologies and parallelism is the more parsimonious, naturalistic view.  Evolution (common ancestry) doesn't fit with what we now know of the fossil record, especially concerning global biogenesis and what we now know in regards to biochemistry and from the many authors who are beginning to come to the forefront in these areas.  Darwin's contemporaries, Louis Agassiz (1857) and St. George Mivart (1871) --- minus their supernaturalism and teology --- provided the more correct view regards biogeography and globalism of organic beings and their parallel developments.  I only add that it is quite certain that in the beginning of cellular life a light beam was a light beam was a light beam just as it is so today in these non-biogenic days.  Or, I should better say, gazillions and gazillions of light beams were then just as they currently are and with all the samenesses that they brought to developments.  Dawkins thus provides nothing new other than the PR bluster and implication that every sane person must agree with him that \\"two versions of the same thing\\" must necessarily share a common ancestor.  But all such arguments can be refuted especially when taking into account modern biochemical reasoning and the various mechanisms by which samenesses can be and have been achieved throughout the eons.  Indeed, carrying Dawkins epistemology to chemistry in general, it is a wonder he doesn't believe that every water molecule had a single common ancestor or that every water molecule shares a common ancestor with carbon dioxide molecules.  After all these molecules all share the sameness of having at least one atom of oxygen.  But just as this argument is silly, so too is Dawkins' argument that just because all living things share the great similarities and differences inherent to DNA that there is no other option than that all thses molecules and thus life is related through common ancestry. That is his hypothesis but even if it were true, which it isn't, suct a hypothesis would not qualify as a scientific fact. Further, the more rational and more parsimoneous answer is to recognize the reality of probable global biogenesis and the gazillions of parallel developments thereafter trimmed and culled continously by Natural Selection.  Thus it is that more parsimonious naturalistic hypotheses can be offered that better represent the reality of the fossil record.  Evolution is false.  I will leave it to others to perhaps write, so that science mightbetter progress, a long sought after book perhaps titled \\"Only a Fact?\\"  I would most certainly look forward to reading such a book. Perhaps such a book could be one of a three part set to also include \\"The Many O.E.D. and non-O.E.D. Definitions of Evolution\\" and \\"The Relevancy of Assumptions to Theory Formation.\\"  And finally, someone must certainly also write what would surely become an all time classic, \\"Exact Science verses The Zoologists' Delusion.\\"

B002BSHWUU|4.0|I have a good stereo system, certainly not audiophile, but not low-end either. Years ago, I bought some of the Sony ES series components and married them to a nice pair of Magnat German speakers. I bought this system to work well for classical music, as well as for anything else I wanted to listen to. A nice, clear-sounding system with no emphasis on the bottom end.<br /><br />I bought the Beatles mono box set the day it came out and picked up the stereo CDs individually over the next couple of weeks. I also have all of '87 CDs.<br /><br />Only recently did I take an interest in going over what I own with careful study, and I must say, I have been surprised more than once by what I've found. The crux of my conclusions result from my listening to all these CDs with headphones on and comparing them side by side--old releases with new, mono with stereo. Listening through headphones will change your perspective on your Beatle CDs.<br /><br />Until recently I had never listened to music with headphones much. One reason I wanted to listen to this music with headphones is because, despite their unwieldiness, headphones do seem to allow one to pick out things you don't hear through even good speakers. Of course speakers also have their own benefits, but it's a different experience. For one thing, headphones can show up differences in how voices and instruments are centered, especially in stereo mixes.<br /><br />Mind you, I know very little about the album-making process. Nor do I know anything about the tools some technical types use to &quot;listen&quot; to CDs through computer software in order to display their quantitative output on graphs and the like. I offer my observations merely from the point of view of an avid music lover. I am in no way expert in how music is made or evaluated by any instruments other than my own ears.<br /><br />The first surprise for me in all this was to discover that, of the CDs that came out in '87, the first four were all in mono; that isto say, PPM, WTB, HDN, and BFS were mono releases. I didn't realize this until I started listening to them with headphones. Don't get me wrong; I think these four CDs sound great, and when compared with the first four CDs in the new mono box set, I don't hear much difference at all. I do hear some but not enough to warrant buying the mono set as an upgrade to the first four albums alone. If you were to blindfold me and ask me to identify which version I was listening to, I'd have to think about it every time. I might be wrong a good deal of the time. If I had a super system, maybe I'd have a different opinion. But, as I said, I have only a decent system, as I suspect most listeners out there do.<br /><br />Now for the stereo remasters of these first few albums. Through speakers, the new stereo versions of PM and WTB are preferable to their corresponding mono counterparts. The mono is good, too, but it's a different vibe. For me, the stereo separation adds a bit of clarity and sense of space within the performance, and the instruments seem to have more depth.<br /><br />Through headphones, on the other hand, the stereo versions are annoying. As others have said, the voices are all in one ear while the instruments are all in the other. Others have made this point about the voices being all on one side, but I don't think I've seen the point made with reference to headphones or ear buds, which is where problem is most egregious. If you want to listen through phones or ear buds, I'd suggest mono for the first two albums. This means you could keep the '87 versions and not have to spring for the whole mono remaster box set. The mono box set is an all or nothing proposition; you can't pick and choose individual CDs from the mono set. If you want to listen through your speakers, you might pick up the stereo remasters of PPM and WTB individually.<br /><br />I just can't imagine anyone, especially kids being introduced to the Beatles for the first time, wanting to listen to these first two albums in stereo through ear buds, as wonderful as the music itself is. It's just disconcerting the way they've mixed them.<br /><br />I'm surprised the engineers involved with this project didn't try to center mix the voices better, the way you find on other records of the same period, such as Bob Dylan's Freewheelin', which was also recorded on two tracks. If part of the goal of the remasters was to expose new generations to the music, why not make the music user friendly to the targeted users? The ear bud users? By the way, I assume that the stereo mixes of the first two Beatle albums are new for the 090909 release. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong. If they were made in 1962 and 1963, maybe it explains why less care was taken to make them more accessible to headphone/ear bud users. But I don't recall these albums having been available in stereo until now. Maybe pieces of them were available in America through Capitol.<br /><br />The next two albums are a different story. The stereo remasters of HDN and BFS are everything you could hope to ask for from four track mixes. Even in headphones, the voices are centered, and the instruments are well-balanced. Needless to say, they sound great over speakers, too.<br /><br />As for the new mono versions of these albums, I, again, don't see enough difference between them and the '87 versions to warrant an upgrade. Again, you don't have the choice to pick and choose individual mono discs from the remasters anyway, so that question is moot. As an aside, it would be interesting to know where the stereo mixes of HDN and BFSI came from since they were not released in '87 and it is my understanding that no new mixes were created for the '09 project.<br /><br />Help! is the first of the '87 releases that came out in stereo. I have the same question about where this mix came from as I do for the previous two albums. Was the stereo mix made in '87 and then remastered in '09, or was the '87 version remastered from the '65 mix? This last possibility I doubt because the '65 stereo mix of Help! lacks the centered voices the '87 version has. If you don't know, the new copy of Help! in mono also comes with a stereo mix of the whole album done in '65. But the voices are all off kilter.<br /><br />I don't see much difference between the '87 version and the new stereo remaster of Help!; they seem to be the same mix. I prefer either of them over the new Help! mono because the stereo is well-done, and, all things done right, to me, stereo is superior every time. This is a matter of taste, of course, and in the cases of Help! and the previous two albums, both the mono and stereo versions are are well-done and pass the headphone test. Whether you prefer mono or stereo, here you can't go wrong.<br /><br />The next four albums mixed in stereo is where I experienced the biggest surprise of all and by far the most heartbreak. Again, this is mainly a problem when listening through headphones; if you listen through speakers, they sound okay.<br /><br />The problem again is that the voices on these four albums are all off center. It makes you wonder how, when they had gotten it right on the previous few albums, they managed to stray off course on these later albums. I just don't get how the engineers could have done what they did, especially in light of how songs from these albums were mixed later on Yellow Submarine Songtrack.(More on that CD later.)<br /><br />In short, the stereo remasters of RS, Revolver, Pepper, and MMT suffer from the same problems PPM and WTB suffer from, that is, bad voice centering. Sometimes, this is a mixed bag within either album because the technology here is more complex, as are the songs, but for the most part, the problem of off-centered voices is pervasive. The lead voices on almost every song are over your right eye, half-way up the frontal lobe. Again, this is primarily a problem when listening with ear buds. Over speakers, it's okay, and whether I listen to the stereo or the mono versions of these albums over speakers, it's a a toss up. They are different listening expereinces, and they are both good.<br /><br />To get a hint of how these &quot;golden era&quot; albums could be handled, you just have to pick up a copy of the Yellow Submarine Songtrack. The songs on this CD were remixed for the movie and are glorious. There are songs from Yellow Submarine, Revolver, Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, and MMT on this album--all remixed! Everything is crystal clear and centered perfectly for both headphone or speaker use. My hope is that this is how all of the albums from RS through MMT could be remixed and one day will be. I, for one, say let the remixing on these begin tomorrow, while Paul, Ringo, Geoff Emmerick, and George Martin are still alive.<br /><br />As for the White ablum, I have to admit that I haven't really looked it over yet. Many have said, and I concur, having listened to both the mono and stereo versions casually some months ago, that some of those songs are better in stereo where others are better in mono. A truly mixed bag. I don't know that either version is a marked improvement over the '87 release.<br /><br />The Yellow Submarine remaster is available only in stereo. Frankly, I don't see much difference between it and the '87 release. Again, some minor improvement hear and there but not worth the upgrade. It too needs remixing to get the voices centered. It's disconcerting through headphones. Many of these songs are also redone on YS Songtrack.<br /><br />As for Let It Be, of which there is no mono version, I don't see much difference between the '87 and '09 releases. Again, unless you go audiophile, I don't think most people will be able to tell on average systems, no matter how badly they might want to be able to tell.<br /><br />Let It Be...Naked, on the other hand, is a beautifully remixed version of Let It Be, with some revised content. It is the only version of Let It Be I ever reach for any more and is one of my very favorite CDs of all. I never said that about the original Let It Be.<br /><br />As for Abbey Road, the remaster of this masterpiece is one I can say is a marked improvement over the '87 version and is worth buying anew. It never had a mixing problem anyway, but now it is sharper, crisper, and richer. I assume it is a remaster of the '87 master.<br /><br />Well, that's my basic take on all this. For years now, I've wondered what all the complaints over the remasters were about. Now I see why some are disappointed. My disappointment stems from the lousy stereo mixes of some of the most important albums of the Beatles, a period I consider their golden age. Of course, the music is great no matter how you hear it. To a large extent, we're straining over gnats here, but for new generations who will be exposed to Beatle music through ear buds, I just wonder what the masters of the universe at Apple were thinking when they put these new stereo remasters out. Some of them could be so much better. The proof is in the Songtrack.<br /><br />In short, if you have the '87 CDs, you're in pretty good shape, unless you just have to have mono versions of titles you've heard only in stereo until now (Help!, RS, Revolver, Pepper, MMT). If you don't care about that, you couldn't go wrong by keeping what you've got and picking up the White Album, Abbey Road, and Let It Be Naked in remastered stereo. I'd also recommend the Yellow Submarine Songtrack to have a look at what could truly be done in stereo with some of middle and later albums. Some of these later albums could even be remixed for surround sound, a la the Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas!

The entire series concludes in Dec of 1919--and already there is production for series 3, a continuation but in the 1920s. There are plenty of cast members back so it is advisable to watch the first prior to the second, but not mandatory for entertainment.

0307946711|5.0|his book was brilliant in so many ways. The writing was funny, witty and engaging. Nicholls captures the full range of feelings and phases of life that happen post college; the exciting sense of \\"what's next?\\", the quarter life questioning of direction and the middle aged desire to start over. It's all written so effortlessly and convincingly, I found my self shaking my head in agreement because the situations were so relatable. Throughout the book, whether they are together or apart, Dex and Emma seem to be two people at opposite ends that were meant to be together, whether as friends or something more. The author does an excellent job of writing about the small opportunities that pass in and out of our days that could have changed our lives profoundly, had we noticed or been ready for them. It is that theme off missed opportunity and even inconvenient opportunity that gripped me the most about this book, because as much as I love the quick and funny dialog, this book is about every relationship you've ever had. It's beautiful and heartbreaking and my only regret is that I didn't read it sooner.
0394818237|4.0|My daughter (3.5 years old) loves this book.  It's very cute and allows us to talk about a lot of different things and expand on what is going on.  I like this one better than the Richard Scary word book since this actually allows you to read, not just go through vocabulary and come up with ways to make things interesting.
0385534639|5.0|I absolutely love this book, but I find it so hard to explain.  First of all, the writing is visual and beautiful.  It is set in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and the clothing is so well described that it becomes one of the characters.  There is a definite color scheme to the book because while the circus is entirely black and white, the people who follow it (Rêveurs) wear red scarves to identify themselves.  In this setting, we get to know Celia and Marco, who are magicians taught to compete with each other without knowing who their competitor is.  Although they are the main characters, the reader meets all of the people that were integral in the formation and continuation of Le Cirque des Rêves and you are just as attached to them as the star-crossed lovers at the center of the story. It is an engrossing book with twists, turns and a certain sadness that makes it one of the best books I've read this year.

B000EXZI1O|5.0|By the time of the release of this wonderful album in February of 1979, The Bee Gees were on a creative streak of historic proportions.  Quite frankly, they were doing things as a band that hadn't been done before or since.  They were already riding the waves of tremendous success brought on by the worldwide acceptance of the soundtrack to the film, \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", where they were the primary performers, writers and producers on what would become  the biggest ever selling movie soundtrack with over 40 million copies sold.  It was also, at one time, the biggest selling album of all time until 1982 when Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" LP would surpass them.<br /><br />They were on a creative streak seen only a few times in history dating back to their \\"Mr. Natural\\" album in which legendary producer, Arif Mardin, had begun to help them shift their style of writing to the R&B, Soul and Funk that was then dominating the charts.  The bands tight 3 part harmonies and incredible songwriting were a natural fit for this mode of expression and with \\"Spirits Having Flown\\" they would reach a creative peak few, if any, has achieved before or since.  This album's first 3 singles were all #1 hits and continued a string of 6 straight #1 hits which was a record.  They also dominated the charts worldwide from 1977 to 1979 like no other band before or since.<br /><br />How's this for chart dominance: During an eight-month period beginning in the Christmas season of 1977, six songs written by the brothers held the No. 1 position on the US charts for 25 of 32 consecutive weeks--three of their own releases, two for brother Andy Gibb, and the Yvonne Elliman single, \\"If I Can't Have You.\\"  In March 1978, The Bee Gees held the top 2 positions on the US Charts with \\"Night Fever\\" and \\"Stayin' Alive\\", the first time this had happened since The Beatles.<br /><br />On the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for 25 March 1978, five songs written by the Gibbs were in the US top ten at the same time: \\"Night Fever\\", \\"Stayin' Alive\\", \\"If I Can't Have You\\", \\"Emotion\\" and \\"Love is Thicker Than Water\\". Such chart dominance hadn't been seen since April 1964, when The Beatles had all five of the top five American singles. Barry Gibb became the only songwriter to have four consecutive number one hits in the US breaking the John Lennon and Paul McCartney 1964 record. These songs were \\"Stayin' Alive\\", \\"Love Is Thicker Than Water\\", \\"Night Fever\\", \\"If I Can't Have You\\".<br /><br />This was but a sample of the almost unprecedented streak these guys were on and in the midst of all this, they released this wonderful album!  It would go on to sell 30 millions copies worldwide and help solidify The Bee Gees as band of mythic proportions.  It is truly a wonderful display of their musical prowess, great songwriting, vocals, production and composition.  This was the soundtrack of the late 1970's and early 1980's and music would truly never be the same again.  This was the time this band, who had been through so much, would get their chance to shine and obtain the full praise for what they had been doing since the 1960's.  No longer were they in anyone's shadow, although I felt they never should have been, they were now squarely at the center of the music world and deservedly so!<br /><br />This is truly a work of art and an album that has stood the test of time.  It is one of the best of all time and should be treasured by fans for many more years to come.  It seems that in the last several years, The Bee Gees are in the midst of being reevaluated by so called \\"critics\\" some of which are finally starting to give them their due.  It's about time too!  This band suffered such an incredible backlash in the 1980's and radio stations refused to play their songs on air.  There's no telling how many more records they would have broken if not for such blatant hateful actions by the many in the music scene at that time.  Here's to you Barry, Robin, Maurice, Vince, Colin, Geoff, Allen and Bluefor all the wonderful songs and memories you shared with us all.for all the wonderful songs and memories you shared with us all.

B005BJ7Y54|5.0|Listening to a lot of what constitutes indie rock can be an exercise in frustration when I'm looking for new sounds. So many bands borrow so heavily from different sources that it's hard for me to figure out where the line stops between irony and sincere homage to past eras. Girls, whose first album was refreshing to me for feeling far removed from the new wave and electro of many of their contemporaries is a band who create very somber and heartfelt songs that never quite reach the histrionic depths of what one would normally consider a ballad or love song, and for this I give them a lot of credit. I imagine it's hard to write songs like these. Ones that touch upon love, heartbreak, general sadness and other parts of our human condition without going into emotional overdrive with the vocalizing.<br /><br />A lot has been said of Chris Owen's talent for capturing the essence of 60's pop songs, but there's far more to the heart of this record than repeating past triumphs. There's less emphasis on the peppiness that was often the spirit of their first full length and here the band infuses recognizable arrangements from many different genres of pop and rock. The first couple songs are decidedly lighter in tone. The next track is the first detour, featuring screeching guitars while the sense of melody remains 100% intact. Later standouts like \\"Vomit\\" find the band employing some fine dynamic songwriting craft, starting its journey like a slowcore song from the early 90s, building with gentle verses before its pure-Floydian crescendo.<br /><br />The rest of the album goes between charming pop and ambitious multi parted suites that sound like they `re as equally fun for the band to play as they were to construct. All in all I'd recommend this to any rock music lover. The songs never get too dark nor too irritatingly cheerful yet there's one thing they have in common in that they don't lack in depth nor feeling. Good job, Girls.

B004LWZWBU|4.0|\\"The Big Year\\" is a pleasant movie, but one that absolutely found no audience at all at the box office.  Let's face it: a movie about competitive bird-watching?  Tough. Sell.  With Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin, it had a chance on paper.  But the marketing seemed tepid (I saw one commercial) and the film's generic name - through relevant in the story itself - meant nothing to people scanning movie listings.  I remember staring at the paper: \\"Big Year, Big Year...what was that about?\\"  Our prime time audience featured the three of us...and four other people.<br /><br />As a result, Fox got a $7m gross for its $40m investment...the very definition of a bomb.  Which is a shame, because it's a fairly good movie.  It's not Oscar category fare, nor is pretending to be.  But, it's enjoyable.  Owen Wilson continues to mature as an actor.  His 'Kenny Bostick' is supposed to be unlikable...until we find out - to the surprise of Steve Martin's Stu - that Bostick is a man of honor and, ultimately, likable.  It's the kind of thing that Owen Wilson can pull off.  He has that charm.<br /><br />The loser here is Steve Martin.  That's unfortunate.  I've been a fan for 30+ years (big club), but when you're the big draw in a bomb like this, your [[ASIN:B00386EZKE Father of the Bride 1 & 2]] days are long since past.

0143116738|4.0|I enjoyed this book. The author does a great job of finding specific people who would have been out of place in the normal realm of an educational system but instead found their passion in life. The examples I preferred were people that I could relate to, the ones with a 9 to 5 but then also were doing something that they loved on the side. A great example was a car salesman who took surfing photos on the side.  I agree with the polemic the author puts forth against the current educational system, especially here in the States. The frustrating thing is that he is right but how does it change. At least he puts forth a few ideas of what to do with your kids, types of schools, activities. I wish some of our politicians would read this book before they just put in place the next standardized test.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|After I downloaded the Splashtop Remote Streamer from their web site and installed it on my PC (setup was a breeze), I tried this app out.  This can be a very useful application, allowing me to operate my remote PC from my Kindle Fire. However, it does NOT handle high speed video very well, at least not over WiFi (802.11n).  Trying to remotely play a video clip on Windows Media Player or run a game like StarCraft II simply does not work, not that I really expected it to.  I suspect the same would be true of anything video-related.  Basic PC operations work quite well except for the obvious limitations of the Kindle Fire (touch keyboard and small size).  Seems to be a well behaved app, and while the link isn't encrypted there IS a security password on the PC end to prevent others from accessing your computer.  I will definately have to play around with this some to see just how well it works, but I like what I've seen so far.

B0068FYZIO|5.0|I was thinking recently about films that have lingered in the mind and heart. An avid movie buff for years, there is simply no other film which has had the same impact on me as this utter masterpiece by Spielberg. I will never forget seeing it the first time in the theater. I was so stunned that I could not cry during the film itself. About 20 minutes later, while dropping my girlfriend off at her house, I simply lost it. It was as if all the impact of the film hit at once. I cried for 15 minutes straight. What a testament to the power of this film. That feeling has never left me. I am 41 years old and have no family relation to the horrors of the Holocaust, but Steven Spielberg made me feel, deep inside, the unspeakable anquish of this uniquely evil event in history. Simply put, every person on earth should see this film to truly understand the evil that is possible on this earth. \\"Schindler's List\\" is a testament of remembrance to the 6 million Jews and others who died. May there never be the need for such a film as long as life exists on this planet.
B000FC1192|3.0|When I first started reading this book, I really struggled with how creepy it was. I could only read a few pages at a time and I even had some nightmares about my own son encountering his \\"other\\" mother. When, the Coraline discovers that her parents are missing through the magical mirror, it felt more like a scene from an episode of Criminal Minds not a scene from a children's book. But once, Gaiman introduced Coraline's challenge, the story transformed into an adventure and I was then able to root for Coraline. The guidance Coraline receives from the talking black cat reminds of Binx, the talking black cat from the movie, Hocus Pocus. Coraline is most definitely a memorable piece of literature. Coraline has a distinct honest voice that readers will be able to relate to. The book reads almost like a fairy tale, the language is descriptive enough for readers to visualize the unfolding tale, yet simple enough for younger readers to understand. The creepiness of the text is in part due to Gaiman's amazing ability to make this \\"other\\" world seem possible, which is a critical element of quality fantasy. Coraline's story is full of action, believable characters, creativity, and extraordinary elements which paired with Gaiman's language and McKean's black ink sketches makes a captivating realistic fantasy that interests readers.
B000002GBK|5.0|I am very satisfied with the purchase of the CD \\"The Myths and Legends ...\\" of the Master Rick Wakeman. It is one of the best exponents of symphonic rock works. In addition I have received within the agreed.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I enjoyed getting to know Cassia and Ky on a deeper level and the new characters were also intriguing to meet. I have many unanswered questions and would have liked to see Xander more actively involved in the story line. I am very eager to read book 3.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I believe this collection of games is awesome, if you get tired of one game you've got more to choose from.
0525422943|5.0|\\"Where She Went\\" is written from Adam's perspective. He never recovered from the accident the killed Mia's family and he is tormented by the fact that Mia left, leaving him behind. His voice is full of pain, readers' hearts will ache for him (mine sure did). The ending brought back all those tears that I shed in the first book. It is very emotional and somewhat surprising. If you read, \\"If I Stay\\", you must read this one, it changes everything.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game!!!At first it might seem boring but then its so addictive. I would have gave it five stars but the pet coins are so hard to get.
014241543X|5.0|I am still crying...review to come.<br /><br />Updated review:<br /><br />A tragic accident changes Mia's life forever and leaves her in a coma. While her body stays in the ICU at the hospital, Mia is in some sort of halfway state while she decides whether she will leave or stay. It is not an easy task and readers are sure to feel Mia's pain and agony as she ponders this decision and as she considers how her choice will impact her friends and family.<br /><br />The story is beautifully written, absolutely perfect, the characters are real, the memories are real and filled with emotion. I cried throughout the entire book (even while riding the bus and sitting in class). This story really touched me and will stay with me for a long time to come.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the sequel (after I buy more Kleenex).
B00008MJ8H|5.0|I love this movie and the soundtrack makes it all the more to watch. Now I can listen to music anytime I wish.  I am a lover of beautiful music!
0062112430|5.0|I loved this beautifully written dystopian novel. After reading it, here are my initial thoughts: I am in shock. All I can say is: Alex!
B006QKJQM6|4.0|There is no doubt that the original Kung Fu Panda is an excellent movie.  The story, as a whole, is better.  The story develops more organically and the humor is excellent.  But in many ways the second is better, even though the story is not as strong and the humor seems forced at time.    The production value are top notch.  The visuals and animation are stunning.  The story really grows on you; certain parts really moved me.  The voice acting is superb.  There are several moments of brilliance no one can deny.    The movie has a few more lows than the original, but the higher peaks more than make up for it.  There is something for children and adults.  Brilliant film.
0060254920|5.0|Max is sent to bed early because he was being naughty and his room transforms into a forest. Max travels across an ocean and becomes king of where the wild things are. The text has a rhythmic flow and Max's speech and emotions are true to that of a young child. At the end, Max is in his room and it is up to the reader to connect his adventure to a child's dream. Maurice Sendack's illustrations are bright, bold, detailed, textured, large, and the warm colors and rounded shapes are comforting to the reader. Sendak skillfully uses his lines to illustrate motion in his pictures, as well as to guide the reader to the next page. I love this book, it is fun and engages kids and encourages them to keep reading, which builds confidence in young readers. Children are attracted to the large round faces of the monsters and even create dances and songs to go along with pages illustrating the monsters' chant. They also can relate to wanting to escape after a bad day (or getting in trouble), adults can too :-). If it's not completely obvious, this is a favorite of mine.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love how easy it was to set up, unlike other apps that require you to make a new account &amp; other tedious setups, this uses the account you already have!
B005NGKMOU|4.0|-------------------------------------------<br />\\"Blackthorn\\"<br />(Magnolia Pictures, 2011)<br />-------------------------------------------<br />Note: mild spoilers below<br />-------------------------------------------<br />Sam Shepard stars in this moody \\"what if\\" western which asks, what if Butch Cassidy had actually survived the big ambush in Bolivia, and lived as a free man in exile? In this film, an old and grizzled Cassidy lives a humble life tucked away on a small ranch in the mountains of Bolivia.  Twenty years later, when circumstances arise, he is called back to the United States and cashes out his loot in preparation of the journey. Of course, with a man of destiny such as Cassidy, nothing is ever that simple and he is soon drawn into a new adventure, involving a younger outlaw with problems of his own. The pace is pretty slow and perhaps overly-deliberate, with a notably understated performance from Shepard, and a nice appearance by Stephen Rea. Includes some gorgeous landscape cinematography of the Andean mountains and plateaus.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
1906694176|5.0|the book arrived and was in terrific condition. I've finished it, my wife is now reading it.<br /><br />I thought the first book (tatoo) of the trio was a bit contrived but the characters were very interesting.  Book 2 (Fire) was much better but there was no ending. Had to get #3 (Hornet) to end the story.  This tale was much too cluttered.  Should have just wrapped up #2 and called it quits.  Still, an interesting, if quite long read.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|YOU HAVE TO GET THIS APP IT IS AMAZING I LOVE IT!!!!! ITS AMAZING I TOTALLY RECAMEND IT!!! GET IT TODAY!!!
0738212415|5.0|I am about a quarter of a way through the book and I LOVE it.  I have always wanted to draw since I was a kid and believed I had no talent, so I have been afraid to pick up a pencil. This book is definitely for people like me. In just a few lessons I feel confident that I know about shading, perspective, and light sources and how to think about what I am drawing. These are all things I knew of intuitively but never knew how to translate to paper and make a confident shape. In the past few days I have even been showing my drawings to other people! This book has been a great motivator to finally realize my dream of being able to render a sketch or drawing with confidence!
0446547654|1.0|This book was a total disappointment.  Nicholas Sparks must be stuck in a rut with his creativity because it was all so predictable.  Some of the characters are so stereotypical while others are just figures that fill in space to the story line...(such as Tuck who seems to be a silent sounding board for Amanda and a mute father figure for Dawson!)  In addition the other characters seem to be too unbelievable to be true.....like Dawson.  He is such a lonely, tragic figure with his lost love past that it boarders on annoyance to read about the chaste life he lives mooning over his first love from 20 years ago while he was still a teenager!! (Grow up and live life a little!!)  I was able to tell where the whole storyline was going by the time I got half way through this pathetic novel.  Amanda was the only character that I was able to believe in and draw something tangible from.  I don't think I will read anymore Nicholas Sparks books again. He uses the same formula and the message is always the same.......life is too short, be thankful for what you've got.  It just is becoming a waste of my money and time to invest in anymore of Mr. Sparks novels.
0062082353|1.0|This guy is an immature, lying thug. This \\"man\\", brags about killing 150 people from long range with a sniper rifle, and wears a skull hat on national tv. This piece of trash needs to grow up. My father killed many people in Vietnam, and never once bragged about it. This is truly sick. Anyone who gets off on this garbage, is the reason America's image is declining worldwide. Now this lying clown is bragging about sucker punching Jesse Ventura, and running from the scene like the true coward he is. What a scumbag.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I obtained this 3 disc special edition for my granddaughter's birthday.  Her mother could not find Titanic anywhere because I guess they are recalling and  putting out a new 3-D version this upcoming year.  When I found this on line, I was ecstatic.  When I gave it to my granddaughter she said I was the hero of the day!  She loves it.  It came by mail in a timely fashion, I believe two days. So.. that also was very exciting.  Thank you, Amazon, for saving the day.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have had no issues with it and I have used it a lot today. Was told about this and it's worth 5 dollars. Though I did get it for free today. No issues.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the first game that I played on my kindle fire and it was worth the money!! I can't wait for the update with new levels!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|You should offer HD version for us tablet users.  Good app.  Been looking for an app like this for a while now.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|one of the best apps i have seen. best $4.99 I've spent. it is the best thing I've seen this year so far.
0547260695|5.0|I had purchased this for my nephew, as my son has a copy and loves it.  Brilliant story and beautiful execution.  The only problem was my nephew was sent the version in French.  I thought I ordered the version in English.  Since he had already opened it and looked through the pages, they did not return it.  I guess when I get around to it, I will need to send him another copy, this time the translated version in English of this classic book since he does not speak French, yet.  But someday he will . . . .
B004O3YGMC|5.0|it is great to start out with and can replace some apps due to it being able to access to your computer but better yet if you get it today its free!!!!!!!!!! I love this app!!!

B005T87QCI|5.0|best deal n tha history of mankind. so fun btw if u read this u should try out the impossible game
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I truly enjoyed the artistic folds of this beautifully written story...it allowed me to escape into a world of fantasy reminiscent of fairy tales handed down through generations. Details described within the book embrace the reader, producing the impact of being a \\"spectator\\" as the story develops. Thoughtful, imaginative and engaging.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this game, not too hard or too easy.  Helps the time go by and is relaxing for the mind when I just need a break from life 's hassles.  Plays well. I have not run into any problems or glitches in this game.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|As someone with a love/hate relationship with the snooze button this alarm is great.  I use the advanced settings to make sure I have to put enough effort into shutting it off and snoozing that I am awake for good before either happens.  Also using the full version to launch my pandora station as the alarm makes sure that I don't get bored with the alert.

She heads to Pairs to win him back. She get's help from a french theif, who is actually hiding a diamonds necklaces in her purse. With out her knowing. Great movie to watch.
1451627289|4.0|Stephen King's newest book was, in short, a wonder to read. The story took off in the first few pages, creating a world where time-travel is possible only through a pantry in an old man's diner. Down this \\"rabbit-hole\\" is where English teacher Jake Epping falls, landing in the 1958-version of his 2011 small Maine town, with the sole purpose of preventing Kennedy's assassination. For the most part, the book takes place in the early 60's, watching Jake as he embeds himself deep within this hostile geography. Going into this book, I was exciting. After \\"Under the Dome,\\" (what I like to think of as Stephen King's return into literary greatness), I expected this book to carry on his legacy.  It most definitely exceeded my expectations. I could not put it down, and was so invested in the characters that I regretted finishing it as soon as I did. My only complaint was the ending; as sweet as it was, I feel as if it was too kind compared to the morality of Jake Epping. He made severe mistakes, and in the end, karma only lets him off with a warning.
B005PXXDP6|5.0|Nevermind (pun) this is one of the best all time music recordings.  This iconic remastered CD is well worth the upgrade.  I  bought the 2CD Deluxe, and Honestly it was a waste.  A friend of mine bought the SUPER DELUXE, and now he's shooting himself in the foot for buying it, a bigger waste!  This has the B-Sides that ARE GOOD, and the few live songs are good too.  The Actual LP side, is TOP QUALITY.  I stumbled upon this listing, and actually got it used for $12 after shipping, why not it's $12.  Plus, I sold my 2CD Deluxed for $12 so it was a wash, and honestly it was a fair trade, cuz this recording has everything needed so you don't get sick of Kurts nasaly whine!  A Perfect balance!  I hope Nirvana and company DO NOT re-release their OTHER GARBAGE, cuz I WILL NOT BE BUYING THOSE CD's!  This Record is it!  AND BUY (PUN INTENDED) IT I MEAN THE BEST THEY (NIRVANA) EVER MADE!  So For a bit of Americana....worth the buy!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Just received my Kindle MicroShell Cover. I was a little alarmed at how light it was...didn't seem like there was much to it. However, given the weight of the Kindle I am glad. This product delivers exactly what it is supposed to! Provides excellent protection at a great price. Very satisfied.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Well, what can i say its an ABC Family Series, but what i can tell you is my girlfriend was pretty happy when she opened it up from under the Christmas tree. Ive only seen a couple episodes but she swears by it. I can't really comment to much on the show, but from what Ive seen and what Ive been told, its gotten pretty solid reviews, and it seems like a watchable show for really any age range.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and knew I wanted to have a copy of it as soon as it was available. The acting is superb and this movie was excellent. Many people criticized that the movie did not follow the book and I totally disagree, I read the book and the movie did leave a few things out but it did not take away from the story at all. The movie would have been way too long had they done all of the actual book. I have enjoyed watching it again and will do so in the future and so glad I have a copy that I can lend to friends that didn't get to see the movie when it came out. I would recommend anyone to get a copy for their dvd library.
B000QGEB12|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  I bought this for my Dad, but now I'm planning to buy one for myself, lol.  It's a crazy story, but oh so funny!!!
B0053JJLLC|2.0|Somehow, someway, I believed that combining the literary forces of these two greats - Richard Preston (\\"The Hot Zone\\") and Michael Crichton (\\"Jurassic Park\\") - would create a masterpiece greater in total than the sum of its individual parts (or authors).  Wrong.  \\"Micro\\" amounts to a predictable, banal attempt that might as well have been titled, \\"Honey, I Shrunk The Graduate Students\\".  Sure, there are a few grotesque insect-ridden attacks to make you cringe (or grin), but that's about all you're going to get with this totally predictable piece of hogwash.  Skip it and instead journey back to the days when Crichton and Preston actually had unique plot ideas peppered with intelligent social commentary.
B005H29GSI|4.0|This toy is a lot of fun. Children young and old are quite familiar with Angry Birds on their smartphone, tablet, or whatever else. This is a great way to have your kids take a break from the technology and actually interact and play with their hands, instead of just their fingertips on a screen.<br /><br />The concept is relatively simple of pulling cards of different set-ups to build and then launching the Angry Birds at the structure.<br /><br />Parents might need to step-in to help little kiddos assemble the structures or provide some guidance on how to work the catapult. Assembling the structure exactly to the picture on the cards takes some doing, but it's not impossible. It's pretty difficult to hit anything with the catapult, but it's fun to try and try again. If you're actually trying to win, it might be good to bend the rules to allow enough tries to hit something, particularly if you have young children. For us, we take turns building it, while the other keeps trying until it gets knocked down. Simple.
B004AM5QT4|3.0|\\"The Third Twin\\" is an intriguing, quick read that is full of genetics, mystery, and, well, twins.  There's nothing ground-breaking or earth-shatteringly ingenius here, plot-wise, but it's a fast-paced, fun read.  Think \\"beach read\\" for the nerdy, scientific thriller-type.  (One item of note: whomever edited the Kindle Edition should be shot!  There are a TON of gross errors throughout the text.)
B00204AA0O|5.0|One of her best albums! Wish she was on tour or had a new album! But by far this album is the best!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun games and a great way to spend your time I'm in grade five and i love this game i hope you do to
0195073401|3.0|My professors at NC State recommended this book. I generally don't like to use it because it's so big, but if I need more information on a topic its my go to book. It's very detailed and has most everything an economics PhD student needs to read.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|Take your time and do the advanced Calibration several times to tweak it perfect. It takes several games to get the feel just right.. but after you get it calibrated it is pretty close to a PC experience.  The major difference is the linear action of a PC mouse and the analog action of the Eagle Eye mouse, you just can not trun around as fast as you can with a PC mouse. It is impossible to replicate it exactly but you can get close. When you set up your keys dont forget the long blank space below the controller that sets your scope mode button for calibration. And after you do advanced calibration for non scope mode, do it again with your player in scope mode. This really allows you to fine tune the players actions while scoped and can make it like shooting fish in a barrel. I played MW3 campaign first and got the feel down then you can go online and it is amazing how most of the controller players look like they are in slow motion. Well worth the 50 bucks if, like me all your friends are scared of PC games and you still want to own them..
B0054JZC6E|3.0|passes time but nothing special some fun games but Also some boring ones will be nice for the children to play around with

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love the gps feature for setting an alarm when I have to go to another building at a set time for my work.  You can set it so you are moving at a minimum speed before the alarm disables.  Very useful for me.
B006C45MRE|5.0|If you love Alien movies and you love Western movies, you will love this movie. It combines the best of both worlds. I loved it! Very entertaining - never bored - felt engaged the whole time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have had many people suggest the hunger books for me. I don't like reading much, but my mom inSisted I should get this trilogy. So I got it. Loved every second! It was a little volgar at times but those kind of things do not bother me much. I read all three books page by page in less than 5 days! It was impossible to put down! Every time I ended a chapter (which always seemed to be a cliff hanger) I cant help but read a few more! Very great series! It got me into reading more books and I encourage all of you to purchase if you haven't already! I had no problems with the format (mine being with the kindle fire) and PLEASE ignore all 1 star reviews! Put away all those second thoughts that you might have been having and GET this trilogy! Again I say: VERY well written series!
0439023513|5.0|I read all these books because they were free with Kindle. They were really good and I'm sad I'm finished. I really liked the characters and the games. Loved the apocalyptic world Collins created. Very entertaining. Thanks!
1849162743|5.0|If there is one author I would like to autograph my books, it would have been Stieg Larsson. What an amazing trilogy he had with \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest\\". \\"TGWTDT\\" is one of the best books I have ever read! it holds you to the pages until there is no-more to read. It is Stunning! It's unique the way the story sets in and holds your interest and you never want it to end. It is unique and fascinating with the true to life darkness of raw violence and gripping suspenseful adventure that Lisbeth Salander takes you on.<br />We all wish we could be as original, dark and thrilling as Lisbeth.<br /><br />All three books are a MUST to read

B00650SSWG|3.0|This movie was OK. I thought it was going to be better, but generally speaking I usually have higher expectations of movies. This movie was predictable, but I figured it would be going into it, so I really didn't have that big of a problem with that, It was just the same thing on and on and on, OK we get it, you two can have sex anytime with each other, go into a little more of the back story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because I am always busy. I listen to the audio everyday on my long commute to work. This feature keeps me in the word even when I don't have time to sit and read.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I purchased The Pacific as a Christmas gift for my son. He watched Band of Brothers earlier in the year and commented about how much he would like to watch the next series about the pacific. He has really enjoyed watching this series. I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in that time period. The series is well made and is very realistic.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I think that this app is really FUN! although I did not purchase the paid version, even the free trial is worth it. very entertaining app.
1843794411|5.0|I really enjoy reading, at any time I'll have at least three books I'm reading at the same time. So for me to say an audio book is good that's saying a lot. I like Richard Armitage, he's nice to look at and he's got a very pleasant voice. But I think in this case Richard's reading of this book is what makes it wonderful to listen to.<br /><br />I've listened to it three times and each time I am amazed that the range of voices is just one man. There is one part of the story where there are three men having a conversation and it sounds like there are three different men, two of the men are nobles and one a highwayman. Richard's ability to change voices from one gender to another or social status with out a pause is just amazing.<br /><br />If you like Georgette Heyer and Richard Armitage this is good a combination.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is really nice. It has all of the books in a nice list and it's easy to find what you're looking for. It's also really nice if you're new to the Bible, like me, because you can bookmark passages that you can look at later to further comprehend them. It also has an option to share them to Facebook or Twitter, which is very nice.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a very good product. The Kindle fits nice and snug but when done properly, the Kindle can be removed from the shell easily. I am very pleased with this product and glad I purchased it. It also provides a nice stand for the Kindle.
B001AFF25W|5.0|What amazes me is the few negative reviews on this excellent book.<br /><br />This book is a gem!  It is an easy read which covers the issue of time management in a delightful way.  The \\"secrets\\" to end procrastination are really not secrets and Brain tells it like it is. To end procrastination you need to take action on the small time wasters, get clarity on your personal goals and take action.  The miracle of getting things done and stop procrastination has it's roots in one thing: taking action.<br /><br />Eat That Frog is a delightful book with tons of practical tips to manage time i.e. managing yourself and how to get into the habit of taking action on the things we all need to get done.<br /><br />I agree fully with one of the reviews stating \\"Those giving it less than 5 stars are missing the point\\"<br /><br />Willem M Strydom - author of [[ASIN:B005MLJ9A4 PROCRASTINATION: The Dream Killer - Foolproof Strategies to End Procrastination Forever (Bestseller)]]

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great. way to keep. your mind young. Enjoy the changeling different games all in one place. New to this type of playing.
B004X80QNG|4.0|So far this is my favorite calendar/task manager app, and I've tried several. I use it daily to keep track of all the craziness in my life and to remind myself of important tasks & events I don't want lost in the blue haze. I really like the user interface and all of the customization options. The one thing I really miss is the ability to journal, I've been using a sort of work-around by creating a Journal folder and adding undated tasks with the date in the heading and journaling in the Notes section, but I would really like another tab along with the  Today, Calendar, and Tasks tabs that would allow a journal entry tied to the calendar date. And as long as I'm wishing, how about another tab to keep track of lists? I've tried the same work around, but Out of Milk is easier.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|you get what u pay for.  not bad but not great either.  still nice for free.  worth downloading and trying
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This is NOT rdp. It seems to be some sort of vnc viewer with a proprietary server.  It adapted my computer resolution to fit my thunderbolt. However,  because I use a 46&quot; 1080p television as my primary monitor,  the image became blurry and disproportioned. Was planning to use this as an alternative to my mini keyboard controller but this is obviously not gonna work.  Also it seems it can only be used over WiFi?  Why not just use normal IP for us 4Gers who can handle it? Thankfully, it was free today.  Thanks Amazon.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Enjoying watching this all over again.  Unfortunately I don't have a massive tv or quality surround sound to truly benefit from the bluray, but I enjoy this series so much that even on a small screen I'm happy to watch it. The combination of drama, humour, adventure, romance, is blended in just the right doses, and the characters are written, and portrayed so perfectly, that one can almost class this as the perfect tv series. The only negative is that Fox pulled the plug to quickly to give us a complete taste if what this show could give us. Oh well, at least it gives me more reason to watch this dvd set over again (and maybe in a few years, I will have the massive tv and quality surround sound to truly benefit from the bluray)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|perfect app no problems workings just the way you want and easy to use.  word word word word word word word word
B004O3YGMC|4.0|They should have made the HD version FAOTD as well...cop out.  The HD version is $10 and from the reviews that I read...it is WAY better than this version for the Xoom (which I have).  So...although free...I want the HD but not paying $10.
1466401885|5.0|OMG, such a fantastic book. Normally I hate to start a new book, the first chapters are introduction, you have to get into it. But with this book I was hooked from the first page!  I really, really loved this book. It's like several readers said, addictive like crack! I have not been able to think about anything else for the past week except this book. Every free moment I was reading!!! The romance between Pigeon and Travis was so hot. The story was great! I recommend this book to everyone!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book within a day. I don't usually write reviews, but I just thought this book was so outstanding I felt motivated to do so. I couldn't put down the book!!! I wasn't sure how Collins could write a sequel that was any good after the Hunger Games (also outstanding) but she absolutely pulled it off, and then some. Highly recommended.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|Love the concept, as I have a lot of files at home I could access; video, pics, music, etc.   Samsung Galaxy S2, fast and able to handle the load.  - Works GREAT on the WiFi in the house, not a hick-up at all.   - T-Mobile network works alright, but was a little slow to load.   - Work WiFi is a freakin' SNAIL! It's internet, 30Mbps down and up! Yet, it takes forever to see what is going on, let alone click, or double click, something.   Not impressed enough to keep this for actual use, WAY too sow for me to even open a folder. I could understand a cellular network, but working over a WiFi connection should be faster than what I'm getting.   Otherwise, I like the UI. The screen tap and keyboard are nice. Set-up was a little tricky, but I figured it out when reading, yes READING, the information INSIDE the app. IT does tell you how to set it up to access remotely over the internet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I loved this book so much I felt I should. Certainly one of my all time favorites, as is her second book (just starting the third now). Parts are brutal, parts are touching, always emotional. I went through so many series of emotions reading this book, including anger, sadness, and happiness. I highly recommend this book.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I saw this was for the Kindle fire, but all the reviews stated that it fit too tight so after looking at the size difference I decided to take a chance and get it for my Kindle touch.  Absolutely perfect fit!  I have the tan version and it looks awesome, every bit as good as the pictures.  The only thing I don't like is the inside of the cover tends to attract dust and dirt and it would be really nice if it had an elastic strap that held it closed.  It closes, but it flops around like a book and I'd prefer something more secure.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this has games that are good for passing the time by. I kinds like that you have to.pass s few games so then you can play other ones
0307888681|5.0|This book was so amazing and smart to read. I keep telling people about it and they think I'm nuts!!! I say \\"This book, it's great!\\" then they say \\"Oh, whats it about\\" and I say \\"Zombies!\\" and they kind of look at me like I'm out of my mind:) But it's a great read for anyone who is wanting to read a good book, not just about Zombies.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|This tripod is kind of difficult to get an iPhone in and one of the supports doesn't hold very securely and blocks the hole for putting an external mic.
0307408833|5.0|This book has brought so many smiles to my little guy's face. My youngest son is autistic and on a gluten/dairy free which is extremely effective. The Babycakes cookbooks are my go to books for any baking needs for my little one......and they are well used.  The best part is everything is amazing! I have even had many people say that they can not believe certain things are gluten free and vegan and actually taste better! Our favorite is the double chocolate chip cookies. Thanks you for making my kid feel a bit more normal is his own little world. Now go buy the next book.....the donuts will blow your mind!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I was skeptical of all the 5 star reviews before I read Ms. Hoover's book. She deserves every one. Her writing style reminds me of Jonathan Tropper who wrote the Book of Joe and other funny novels that pull at your heartstrings. I look forward to reading more of her work in the future.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have to admit that I was weary of this app when I first saw it, but after testing it out I admit I love it.  I actually had EverQuest 2 open on my PC and albiet wonky controls, controlled from my hptouchpad (running android)   The only complaint I would have is the resolution my desktop was set to when I logged in.  This did cause some issues when I logged out as icons got moved all around.  I would also love to see a better control scheme so games that use different keyboard layouts work easier.  Before anyone says it, yes I understand this app is not geared towards gaming.  None the less, great app.  Worth the money if you do not get it as the app of the day.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Great movie, this movie was better than the last movie that was made in the nineties. I would recommend everyone to watch this money when they get the chance. [...]
B003JTHESA|5.0|This was my very first Iron Maiden album that i bought initially in 2010. Initially when i listened to to it i only liked a couple of songs like Satellite 15... The Final  Frontier and Mother Of Mercy.   They after keeping an open mind i started to like all the songs on this album! I was expecting more of a faster paced songs but i do like the slow intros and how they pick up tempo.  I think you should not skip this album becuase all their songs on this album are great. Sure some of them may start off slow but theres no reason why you should hate them as they do pick up tempo quite fast and have interesting guitar solos.  Ok, I will admit most the songs on here are long but they are still interesting to listen to :-)  With that i will say enjoy the album if you have it and if you dont, then what are you waiting for? GET THE ALBUM! You wont regret the purchase...just keep an open mind about the album and give it time to sink in and you will realize how great this album is.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great fast service, with product exactly as described. Made my nine year happy to get it. Will definitely buy from you again.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I gotta admit, I'm pretty impressed with Splashtop. As an IT tech, I use remote software every day of the week. This was straight forward as far as the install on the phone and pc. It's kinda awkward if you have a normal screen res of 1920x1080, but I think for most people thats not a problem (hehe). All in all 5 star app, and definitely worth havin. Finally for those of us who stream media from our desktop PC while bed,and don't have a remote to shutdown end of the night... finally our prayers have been answered!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Great fast service, with product exactly as described. Made my nine year happy to get it. Will definitely buy from you again.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|As usual, Ken Follett has hit a home run with this book.  He makes you really care about the characters, and I learned a lot about the details of WWI along the way.  I can't wait for the next in the series to come out.<br /><br />Keep them coming, Ken!
B004O3YGMC|1.0|should state that it does not work with linux and it should be made to work with linux android is linux based so where is the open source lov
0060873027|3.0|At the time of his death in 2008, Crichton had written a substantial portion of this novel. Richard Preston, a bestselling author in his own right, was chosen to finish the manuscript. The novel is about groundbreaking technology that allows the shrinking of objects and even people to explore the forests of Oahu, Hawaii in search of new drugs and applications for humanity. Preston does a great job of capturing the painstaking technical details of micro life - complete with all its wonders and dangers.  What starts out as a recruiting expedition by seven graduate students at Cambridge, Massachusetts soon evolves into survival on a micro scale - with this unlikely band of young people shrunk to a size where facing a wasp or an army of ants is a life-or-death situation.  The students face not only natural enemies - but full-sized humans who are out to kill them before they can report how this technology is being used for destructive purposes.  Micro was an entertaining read. But I kept thinking about the novel that Crichton is known for: Jurassic Park. No offense, but after the thrill-ride of being chased by dinosaurs, it's kind of tough to get all worked up about being stalked by insects.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|such a fantastic app! The best Bible app out there. A must have! It helps encourage more Bible study and with all of the versions and audio content... Makes me say WOW!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Sorry but I just don't understand how this book gets such high ratings.  I thought it was extremely poor writing and content.  Would not recommend this book at all.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun to play and addictive.  I reccommend it. More fun than the original. Hours and hours of enjoyment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've used this Bible app for several years on iPhone ans Android.  I love the wide selection of translations, the note keeping and note sharing functions, and the audio option for some translations.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is definitely one of those apps that makes me glad i own a tablet.  It is supper easy to configure and within minutes I could access my desktop from anywhere.  In short, buy this app because it is a must have for android and ipadowners.
B0063GORYU|5.0|definitely one of my favorite games of all time. have to make a point of not starting this game when there are things to do as I get lost in it and the day can become a total loss!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The app is no where near as bad as the other reviewers make it out to be... Is it good for being free? Yes. Is it better then the default fire app? Yes. only because if you can not send the document you can view it locally. :)  However if you tilt the device you will get a 1 second blur which will then subside and work very well. But if you load large documents be warned pixelation will continue as you go from page to page
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I know beggars can't be choosers.... but most other FAOTD offer the HD version free the same day the regular version is offered for free.... the HD version today at least is still listed at full price... oh well, would have been nice
B0058VW36U|4.0|Before leaving a 1 star review, please learn how the Amazon App Store works! Apps go through a review process on the Amazon app store whereas on Google's market apps are updated nearly instantaneously. The review process is very similar to that of Apple, the goal is to provide the highest quality app store possible. Calm down, be patient, and you'll get your update.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I purchased this set of DVDS for my husband for Christmas.  We are very pleased with the DVDS.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys history of WWII.  It has alot of action and drama.  It really gives you a greater respect to our vets on what they go thru in a war. I give this a 5-star.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|this game is perfect to pass time with. it makes you think which a must for me and after playing the free version I'm definitely buying the full version.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|it is a great app. it could use some more drawing utensils and different sizes but otherwise it is a great app I would recommend it to anyone else :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is a great way to have fun on the go! Not only are the games fun, but some of them help with their logic. 5/5 for educational fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|like the variety of games and the challange of getting  points to get more games some games are easy while others are very challenging
B005HSL626|4.0|hey peeps I luv the game and all, but I couldn't get it. I have 2 use my freinds now
0307891372|5.0|I ordered the book for my son-in-law for Christmas and he loved it.  He starting reading it while we we still opening presents ignoring the rest of his gifts.  It was a fair price and arrived very quickly with no problems so I am quite satisfied.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I am not trying to sound mean but this game is not as fun as it seems. I got it for 5 hours and was boring. The first two hours was fun and I would recommend this game for 10 - 13 year oles.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like all the variety the game has. the sushi game is my favorite so far and I love the point system
B0054JZC6E|2.0|At first glance, this game looked amazing.The problem is that most games feel stiff, difficult, and just not fun. Stiff games are the bane of my existence, digitally speaking. this game claims that you must earn points by playing old games to get more. However, they do not mention that after you buy a set of twelve games, you have to beat a certain score for all twelve to continue. And when you wrangle with controls, things can be quite stressful. I mean, one game you &quot;bounce&quot; a soccer ball by tapping it. but the engine makes it land anywhere it feels like! it's not really your best interest to play this game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works and looks great on kindle fire! very good graphics and smooth game play.  It is well worth the cost.
159102594X|5.0|My husband recommended this book to me, and while it was slow to get into (for me) I really did enjoy it, and have read others in the series. Great author!!
B004X80QNG|1.0|no google no install. I read that calengoo has google calendar sync ability. so I emailed amazon that calegoo should be a free app of the day since the fire doesn't have a native aneroid calender.
B006QLH7O4|5.0|Really good 3D effects. The entire movie is pretty much 3D. The deaths are amazing to watch because they pop out at you. The movie itself will never compare to the original 2, but it held up and was enjoyable to watch with the 3D effects. I bought this movie for that reason. The graphics are also really good as deaths come. They don't look animated or fake like some of the other Final destinations. Definitely but this. I feel its better than Lion King, Nightmare before Christmas, Tron, and Drive Angry in 3D.  I got this for $25 at BestBuy also when it came out.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|I was excited to try this until I found out I had to install another app on the remote PC.  Boooo.  *Uninstalled*  I already have RDP configured on my remote computers so why would I need another app?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun and challenging. I really enjoyed this game. great for killing small ammounts of time. I cant stop playing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is amazing and I can play it all day long. this games is so fun that I haven't played another game all day
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|What a horrible ending to a great begining. The book was bla at best and then its toped off with a stupid ending. The first two books were really good though.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am used to running on the treadmill and doing circuit training strength routines 5 days a week. I would say I am moderately fit--I'm definitely overweight, but I have muscle tone and I can keep a good pace. I thought this DVD would be fairly easy, but oh man, was I wrong.  Level One kicked my butt, and is still kicking my butt. Jillian gives you no breaks in between fairly simple to follow but really hard to do moves. If you have bad knees or don't know how to do a lunge/squat properly, DO NOT DO THIS DVD UNTIL YOU HAVE GOOD FORM or you will hurt yourself. My quads always always are in a state of pain from doing this DVD and that's what makes me endurance actually a bit less than I thought it would be on Day 5! I am sort of surprised but gratified to see my body has not quickly adapted to this workout and can still feel deathly tired and fairly sore after! And even now, on Day 5, I can already see changes in my arms and my quads, and feel them in my abs. IT WORKS, believe me, but you have to not make any concessions, and follow a good diet while you are doing this workout regimen.  Cons of the DVD? Not being able to skip the tedious intro, the crappy music, and Jillian herself, after a while. I actually told her to shut up during my workout, lol. She just keeps TALKING, and she's vaguely patronizing when she isn't trying to be encouraging. If you can, definitely mute her by Day 5 once you start anticipating the moves.  All in all, a great purchase if you can't, like me, go to the gym or even if you need a change in routine for a month!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I LOVE this book, I am writing this reveiw from my kindle but I got the actual hardcover book so I dont know about any typos or anything. Anyway, This book has such a great storyline, ( typical Riordan) , Percy is the main character, so happy!<br />I think this is better than the Lost Hero, and a great sequel to it. I love the ending, but it only makes me want the third book even more! ;)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|having a good time playing all the games! can't wait to unlock more games.  wish some. weren't so hard to figure out how to play in the first place.
B001992NW4|5.0|it's amazing to get this collection .. it's extended. Aspek ratio large full at my LCD makes IMAX for me. very scary look this movie .. great transfer with a luxury edition make me happy. with audio transfer DTS HD 6.1 makes room like in exorcist room.
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I had come to the point in our marriage where we'd grown apart, had no friendship basis and were planning our divorce when we both realized we DO love each other, we just didn't know how to fix what was wrong. Each thought we were right. We were very tit for tat in our marriage. \\"You didn't meet MY needs so I won't meet yours!\\"   I went and got me this book and him the men's edition which are almost the same. Neither of us are into counseling or self help books but I was desperate and soooooo many of my friends had recommended this (MALE friends) so I figured it might be worth a shot. I gave him his copy and we started reading, agreeing to meet for 10 minutes each night to talk.   Both of us realized we'd been very tit for tat and that was didn't speak each other's love language. For instance, my husband does a lot of cleaning because that's something HE would appreciate. But I don't do that for him - I hug him a lot and he's not like that. I don't care if the laundry is done - I'd rather have a 5 second embrace. So my love language is physical and verbal and his is more action.   All this time we realize we've been speaking our OWN language to each other and the other just didn't know what to do with that and got resentful that the other person didn't TRY to learn our language. This book helps you implement things. It's changed us so far. Hasn't been long but we're both happy so I don't see it going backward.  ie: I asked him to go on a walk with me because I knew he'd appreciate seeing me make an effort to look good for him and spend time with him. He stopped a phone conversation to walk to the door and give me a kiss goodbye when I left one day.   This book is all about doing things out of LOVE, not demand, which is what we were doing.   I'm so relieved this exists.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|this first time i buy blu-ray book because it's cheap. i am happy with this edition because look luxury but i must still use plastik to keep this book form dust. movie it's self very amazing. Brad with Morgan makes feel this movie so good. Transfer movie so shrap with alternate ending that Morgan kill the enemy not Brad.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|The Invicta Speedway chronograph is a great watch but a true chrongraph it is not. If you're looking for a timepiece that can register 11 hrs.59 min. and 59 sec., this is not it. I dont' believe Invicta makes any watches that can do that. If that function is important to you, you should look elsewhere. I do, however, consider this a fine watch, comparable to the Rolex Daytona at a fraction of the price. It's not a large watch (approx. 38 mm),but it is just large enough to stick out from under a shirtsleeve for you to show off!. I knew it wasn't a real chrono going in, but I bought it anyway. I'm happy with it.
B001LF2WCC|4.0|i have already have this reguler edition. But i buy agaian because it's promo prices.  I have one disc because this new print don't have digital copy makes price lower. i see this edition is similiar with reguler edition. New only at features The Complete 300: Comprehensive Immersion and Bluescreen Picture-in-Picture Experience. So if u like this book may be u think twice because there's no much a lot different with picture and sound.
0143117564|5.0|Personally, I think he's been waiting his whole life just to write that book (y'know: \\"PLOP! Here ya go!\\").<br /><br />It's simplicity is elusive & pleasurable & manages to not \\"shy away\\" from any of the darker elements of the '60s w/o being a bummer (hence the quote used on the paperback ed., calling it a \\"throwaway masterwork\\").<br /><br />It certainly has some of that \\"marijuana humor\\" he & his Cornell pal were so \\"tickled by, in inverse proportion to the availability of that useful substance\\" (to quote from his \\"Introduction\\" in \\"Slow Learner\\").<br /><br />The three consecutive paragraphs where the reader follows Doc in his \\"spacing\\" what had just recently happened (\\"No, we just ATE the food, Doc!\\" \\"No, it's o.k. to leave .. we DID pay!\\") just killed me!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am very pleased with this game. The ads are very small and I forget they are even there. Great way to pass time.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works great is it too good to be true?  Nice and smooth and no lag!  Nice job Amazon and the maker of the app.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is amazing! The picture just doesn't do it any justice. It is truely beautiful. I expecially love that it looks like an actual leather book. Very beautiful. Couldn't be happier. Well worth the cost of this item.

1451627289|5.0|I just finished reading Stephen King's latest, 11/22/63.  I gave it a 5-star rating, which in my view is more than richly deserved.  Had there been more stars in the rating system, I'd have given more.  I've long been a Stephen King fan, even early on when sometimes his work had a little too much gore and frightening evil for my taste.  But his ability to pull me in, compulsively turning pages, is nevertheless unparalleled.  And as any devoted reader of his work will tell you, with passing years his skill has become even more finely honed.  The better angels of his writing nature (in my humble opinion, at least) have gradually taken control and nurtured the real heart of his talent.  In truth, I believe there is no better wordsmith in American literature.  He himself puts it best: \\"I tell a good tale.\\"  That modest description is a pale implement for describing 11/22/63.  This is a beautiful, evocative story, told with the early sixties and the JFK assassination as a backdrop.  It is perfectly seamless, flowing like quicksilver from one haunting, bittersweet scene to the next.  Like many of King's books, it begins rather quietly - and if you're not acquainted with his work you might think, what's the big deal?  Keep reading.  I promise: within a very few pages, you will be hooked - and then some.  If you share my passion for science fiction and fantasy - well, this story will blow you away.  If you're a tad squeamish about murder and mayhem, again...keep reading.  Although some violent scenarios are included where they enter into the story, they aren't overused or utilized for pure shock value.  They're an integral part of the story and it wouldn't ring true without them - and the darker details are, in fact, not numerous.  I believe that the best writing touches and teaches us with the use of certain important tools: first, through the creation of interesting, complex characters about whom we come to care a great deal; and secondly, with a plot device that becomeslike another character.  (That's not what they usually tell you in writing seminars and classes.  The more commonly accepted view is that plot and character development are more or less separate, created along different tracks and whipped into line by the writer's skill at making them blend into acceptable credibility.)  11/22/63 is a book that sets a new paradigm for those diehard professors and creative writing gurus who insist on such arcane rules.  Here, the plot device is time travel; but the real story is the characters' lives who inhabit those times.  It is a deeply touching love story as well as one of friendship and personal journey.  The people you meet come to feel like old friends, neighbors, colleagues.  It's the kind of book that leaves you sad when you read the final page.    For this work, Stephen King did years of research about the JFK assassination, Dallas and Texas in general.  The result for a reader is that there isn't one false note in the 850 pages.  Somehow the story is woven in, around and about the facts, figures and minutiae of that awful day - and events leading up to it - without losing a single beat.  It all rings clear, true and infinitely readable.
B0063IH60K|4.0|easy to use. Smooth action. hours fly by. renewed my love of solitaire. heartily recommend the app to folks who have limited experience with apps.
B000274THQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  Don't want to ruin it for anyone.  Take my word for it, the reversals and twists keep me laughing just thinking about it even a month after viewing.  A keeper.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Love this app on my ipad. So glad to see it here so I have access on my phone as well. Of course the smaller screen presents challenges but it is still useful. There does seem to be a bug with inputting text though. When trying to log in to EvE Online, the keyboard would only input one character at a time. I had to lower the keyboard for it to enter anything and only one character input typed in worked. I am using the SwiftKey keyboard which is a very popular 3rd party keyboard.
0596805527|5.0|I was looking for a book a couple of years ago that explains JavaScript in detail. I don't know how I missed this one.   Anyway, I need a book that covers all aspect of the language in great detail. It looks like this is the one. I wrote some simple JavaScript code. But I alway came acrose some code that I did not understand why it worked or not. I think this book will solve that problem.
B0052U59F4|2.0|I didn't like it, and wish I hadn't wasted my money. I was hoping for an enjoyable, 'curl up and relax', sort of story but found myself getting bored after the first hundred pages because I had the feeling the main aim of the author was to produce a story that would sell itself through the multitude of explicit sex scenes. The hero was creepy, even if his pyschological status is grounded in a disturbed past.   He is rich, complicated, and a control freak who wants total command in both his business and personal dealings. She is a young student whose understandable fascination with power at close quarters hinders her ability to think about the consequences of getting involved with someone who initially is only looking for someone new to provide him with his dominant/submissive sex games.   If the author had taken 90% of the graphic sex out, developed the storyline to show that romantic love can emerge from a relationship that's initially based on sheer sexual attraction, perhaps I might have liked it.  I'm sure the author worked hard on producing the book, but I'm not impressed with the result. I have the feeling the main aim was solely to keep the cash tills ringing with enough sex scenes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book much more than Catching Fire. I think I enjoyed it because it didn't feel like the love triangle was just added in as filler in this book. It seemed like it all had a purpose.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME ITS CHALLENGING BUT ALSO EXCITING I DONT WIN TOO OFTEN BUT ENOUGH TO KEEP ME INTRIGUED
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game play.  ads at the start of game, but not bothersome. its a free game! challenging and fun! hands dealt are different and sometimes difficult.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|mucho fun, yes. I like how there all spinoffs of older games. I like the sushi game even though I suck at it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use both the webOS and android version of Splashtop Remote on my HP Touchpad. Splashtop is able to stream netflix, both audio and video, on my home wireless network with zero playback issues. I run Splashtop streamer on both Windows XP 64 and Windows 8, inside a virtualbox virtual machine atop Ubuntu 11.10. This software works well and adds a ton of functionality to my tablet. My only (slight) disappointment is the lack of linux support for the streamer.  Best product of its type.

B005YVTHT0|4.0|Hi. Always wanted a wheel for my racing games that was a breeze to use. Well the sim racing wheel certainly is that, with the sim racing game. However, in other games there are some problems. Setting it up in F1 2011 is very difficult. The wheel has a life of it's own until a lot of effort is put in to try and configure it properly. And with my favourite game. Grand Prix 4, it just won't work at all. Now this may be due to the fact that the wheel has stopped working altogether due to some fault or other. Regarding customer service....I have found NONE better. The company has bent over backwards to help in any way they could and have now suggested sending the wheel back in exchange for a new one. AND...Hopefully that will fix all the other little problems. I will certainly let you know.......
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds it's the best game ever ads dont bother me n what the heck was that person talking about yes at first I thought u needed wifi to play but u don't look more closely!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like how simple it is to bookmark where I last read. I read early in the morning so I especially like using a digital version because it makes it more fun (I'm not a morning person but believe it is the best time to read God's word).  I think the other features such as the  translation option is great.
B0023ZLMHK|2.0|Whilst Lawrence wrote an astounding book for the time, this version needs serious editing. The number of typos destroys meaning and reduces parts to drivel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game I can do whatever I want when I want...and so can u if u get this app.

0062082353|5.0|I am a married Mother of 1 Son and 2 Step-sons. I have never served in the military and honestly do not have any close ties to the Military, other than my Father who served in Korea and a cousin who was killed in Vietnam during the TET offensive. Though I would prefer the world was all Love and Light with no war ever; that is just not how it is. I have strong feelings about the war on both sides of the issue, I respect others thoughts and opinions as their own; but  no matter what I respect and support the courage, strength and patriotism of each and every member of our Military. I begin this review this way so that you can see I am a regular Jane.<br /><br />This book is written from Chris Kyle a Navy SEal's perspective. It is about his life growing up in Odessa Texas and follows him through his life as a Navy SEal, from BUDS training to the war in Iraq and life during and after from his POV. If you are looking for fluff, BS and watered down opinions this book is not for you. Chris tells it like he saw it good, bad or indifferent from his POV. During the reading of this book I cringed, I smiled, I chuckled, I felt uneasy and a bit queasy, I cried and felt sad, but I was completely engaged the entire time. At no point did I feel lost or feel like I did not understand something. (Keeping in mind I am just a regular Jane); Chris explains acronyms, procedures and operations as the story moves along and talks in plain \\"Texan\\". Peppered throughout the book, Taya, Chris' wife gives us a heartfelt view of life with Chris. My heart could only bleed for her, Thank you Taya and \\"God Bless\\" you for all that you sacrificed for your country. And Chris for the record though you say (several times I might add) throughout the book that you do not consider yourself a \\"Bad Ass\\".........Uh Chris, you were a FEARLESS BAD ASS, period end of subject.<br /><br />I am glad I decided to read this book; as honesty goes, Chris does not pull any punches and truly seems sincere in all his accounts of how things went down. I am not by nature one to believe everything I read and use quite of a bit of discernment as a rule, but at no point did I feel that anything but the truth as Chris saw it went from pen to paper.<br /><br />Thank you Chris and every single person at home or deployed who Stand and Protect our great country. And thank you to all the Mothers, Fathers, Sisters, Brothers, Wives and Children who sacrifice so those brave men and woman can do just that.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who wants to read a firsthand account of the sacrifices the men and women of our armed forces endure on a daily basis.nt down.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Same with quickoffice both apps give me problems with my excel check register by giving me value errors for my balance portion of the spreadsheet. The forumla for it is pretty simple but neither can figure it out. Only app that works with it is documents to go. Will still keep for other needs though
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is easily one of the most amazing apps I've ever seen. Thank you so much. This app will make my life at school so much easier since I don't have to drag my big laptop with me now. I can just leave it at home connected to my wifi and access it from school via schools' wifi. Even if I need a file I can just log in and email the document from my computer. A+++ on this one guys.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Out of all the free office apps this is the only one that doesn't give me an error or value problem with my excel check register. And seeing as I have it stored on my Google docs it makes it so much easier to edit whenever with no problems.
B001V9LRV0|1.0|This DVD didn't play on my player.  These DVDs apparently have Region Codes embedded in them (didn't know that) and this was made in a country other than the United States.  Got a refund.
B005K2XP6Y|5.0|Bought this for my new Kindle Fire - it's exactly what I was looking for. A durable sleeve with sturdy velcro to keep the device secure, and it looks good. Inside flap / inside pouch is all cherry red and looks great.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|great app totally awesome a must have easy to use free for today only happy you guys shared it thanks!!!!!
B001NXDIMK|5.0|I like this series.  It keeps you so intense and you can't wait to see what will happen next.  I will be odering the Third Season.

B005J3IEZQ|5.0|No matter what you have read, and know about Steve Jobs, there is always more!   What I loved most about this biography, was how it was written, and that the author was asked to write this story with freedom to depict all points of view, as opposed to being commisioned to write purely Steve's viewpoint, and that the story was driven by Steve not an author desperate to write Jobs' story. These elements give credibility to the book, and Isaacson's style makes for a fascinating yet easy read. Jobs' personality is clearly depicted, with lots of funny, quirky details revealed which in my opinion give you the best feel for a person. Jobs' unwavering passion and refusal to accept 'no' as an answer for anything, came across strongly in this book. After reading this, you will have even more of an understanding of Jobs and despite his negative traits, I now apprecaite his impact and successes even more and am thankful to be living in these exciting, changing times.  I felt highly motivated after reading this book, we all want to do something great and Steve succeeding in doing great things, time after time.  To add credit to Isaacson's writing, this book made me desperate to pick up another great biography right away, and I struggled to find an author who made his subject's story as exciting to read.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Quality - great!  Timeliness in arriving - mediocre.  It was a great price, but mailed from England.  Supposed to be a Christmas present, but arrived afterwards, taking about a month.   Also, label taped to jewel case somewhat marred the item as a gift.
B005BQNC44|4.0|Jaycee's story is one that is very tough, scary and hard to digest, but I could not put it down! This story is not for the faint-hearted, as it is quite descriptive in terms of Jaycee's experience following her abduction, and the abuse she is subjected to. But knowing what she went through, survived and lived to tell the tale, shows the true power of the human spirit and Jaycee's inner strength.
B00005MP58|5.0|I am happy to have this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" a part of my library.  The finest, quality viewing and the story is informative and truly enjoyable.  I watch the DVD often and never get tired of it.  It is also enjoyed by my family of ages 28 to 65.  I highly recommend this to everyone.  The acting is supberb and believable.  I can't say enough to promote this movie.  The romance is handled beautifully and respectfully.  Just buy it!
B004KA9VGA|4.0|For all those who love stories about vampires and werewolves, and other magical creatures, this story is for you. This story encompasses all the great key ingredients to a vampire and werewolf story, but succeeds in creating a much better read than the successful Twilight series. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend it, you won't be disappointed.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3CRFV1O2K25WC]]I thought this would be a great way to transfer pictures and even documents back and forth between the iPad and my computer, but it turns out that there are some tricks to getting SD card reader to actually transfer pictures.<br /><br />There isn't anything about this in the manual, but your pictures have to be named exactly what they would have been when named by your camera. The pictures have to be placed in folders just like your camera would place them in.<br /><br />I tried a lot of different naming conventions to try to get the iPad 2 to read the photos, and here's what worked for me using a Nikon D60:<br /><br />Two folders:<br /><br />DCIM ...and inside this folder another folder called... 100NCD60<br /><br />Inside the 100NCD60 folder, my pictures had to be named like so:<br /><br />DSC_0001.jpg<br />DSC_0002.jpg<br /><br />Raw file formats (NEF) worked as well.<br /><br />I tried transferring pictures that were not named like those above, and the iPad didn't recognize them. Renaming the exact same pictures to the convention above, and they worked.<br /><br />My iPad was running iOS 5.0.1 at the time I tried this. Hopefully, there will be an update down the road that will make it easier.<br /><br />You could always use iCloud to transfer the pictures, but that's not as fast or easy as just plugging them in.<br /><br />For the USB connector, the camera was able to transfer pictures just fine (again, that were filed and named like those above).<br /><br />I've got a USB microphone that I wanted to use with the Garageband app, and it works great. The trick is that you have to have a USB Powered Hub to give the microphone (or if you've got a keyboard or other USB device compatible with the iPad) enough power.<br /><br />I bought the Belkin 4-port F5U304 powered hub, and it worked great. Plugged the microphone into the hub, and then the hub into the iPad camera kit, then the iPad (I know, clunky but it works).<br /><br />The hub had to take a moment to powerup, and then it worked fine.<br /><br />So if you're having trouble with the images transferring, make sure that the folders are correctly named from what your camera uses by default including the folders and subfolders.rrectly named from what your camera uses by default including the folders and subfolders.
0439023521|5.0|I'm not much of a reader and its hard for me to get interested in most books but right off the bat I was hooked on The Hunger Games. The action starts right away and it kept me wanting to read more. Its an interesting series of books and an easy read.
B005H0IW6W|3.0|I really like Michael Buble, but not so much this time.  I like the standard Christmas songs to be done like standards.  On some songs, that's how he interpreted them and that's why I gave it three stars.  But jazzy renditions of some of these songs turn me off.  I should have listened more closely before I bought this.  It's near the bottom of my Christmas music collection.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Bought this as a christmas gift for a friend.  She loved it.  Well, aren't all girls supposed to like this movie?  Great price.  enough said
B004GXL8GC|1.0|WOW there only 2 inchs in size if that, an the brand is german ,not labled for kids three an up on listed price an info. The shipping was ok... just not what i would have bought if I knew the an age limit !
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Once again, Dan Brown shows us why he's a masterful storyteller. He grabs you from the beginning, and it's breathtaking action from page to page. Every time you think you've figured it out he proves you wrong.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Although fairly comfortable with home computers, I'm a bit network challenged.  The comments from other reviews that this is an easy setup is true.  After downloading, the program instructs you to download a pairing program from their website.  After you download and install on your computer(s), it gives you a DNS number.  You simply enter that with the password of your choice and the program is ready to use.  I've already called my son and told him to check this program out.  It's a real \\"WOW\\".  Mirrors your computer screen, mutes your computer, and transfers sound to your device.  Using on the Kindle Fire and it works GREAT!  Don't know how it would work on a small phone screen.  That might be a bit of a chanllenge.  This is a keeper.
0439023521|1.0|This is Survivor in a fictional world where one competes to the death. There is no humor to be found, the writing is very straightforward and bland, and the characters had nothing that held my interest.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|love the way they show you how to do it and you can read how to do it too. you can hit pause if you need to. other then that my abs are hurting i need to lose this belly thanks for making this app.
0805017593|5.0|We love this one and Brown Bear Brown Bear.  After just a couple of times reading it to my kids, they can 'read' it themselves.  It helps them learn names of different animals...great for toddlers learning new words....even colors and sounds.  They want to read it so often, to change it up, I'll ask them what animal it is, the next time through ask them what color it is, the next time ask them what sound it makes, etc.
0307463745|5.0|The writers of this work are correct in their introduction: They are a fluke! ReWork is full of seemingly simple thoughts and practices, and they should be simple to implement. They make perfect sense and as an individual have greatly enriched my life, my work, my thought processes. As an agency manager, change is slow. Bureaucracy doesn't do simple. If you're just starting up in a business - READ THIS NOW! Before your organization gets to engrained in how things are \\"supposed to be\\". You will not regret it.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|Item as described.  On time delivery.  Thank You Very Much for making the transaction easy, quick, affordable, and a pleasant experience!!!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|this is a pretty good app.  it is a little slow and there are no commentaries or concordances.  if it had those two, I would absolutely love it.  they do put the text together very nicely though, and its very easy to read on phone or on tablet.  If you want bible and concordance and commentary, try cadrebible or mysword bible.  great three core together.  use 'em al the time.   God bless
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was surprised at how fun these minigames ended op being. sure, there are a few tires, but the variety and the speed of each play really creates a constant &quot;just one more round&quot; mentality which I think is the mark of a good little time waster.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is such a great package of games! I love the fact that when you play games you earn points to unlock more games! all the gamesare fun and not difficult! I love this app!
B00650SSWG|4.0|Friends With Benefits is a refreshing romantic comedy. It has witty one liners and a believable plot. Way better than No Strings Attached. Entertaining for both men and women. Would watch it again.
B005974C94|5.0|We listened during dinner on Christmas it was better than old fashioned Nutcracker. I asked if we could burn it so I could have a copy? He stated such a good CD and you want to burn it?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game. played it a bunch.. it was cool. so yep. you could play it too I think. download it. .
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Its not the ultra sharpener that makes your blade so sharp that it can slice the hairs clean off your arm. However it does give it a razor sharp edge, all i was expecting and more for 10$. For such a low price this is well worth it. People are complaining about how the \\"Tapered diamond rod for sharpening serrated and standard edges\\" breaks off, use your head of course plastic wont hold the pieces together. Dont follow the picture exactly he is just posing... I push my finger on the rod so there is no tension on the plastic therefor it wont break!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Just had to leave a quick review for this product after seeing all the bad reviews it had garnered. I don't know what people's gripes are with this case. It's exactly what I was looking for. Light, slim, and fits snug. Has a nice texture. Easy to snap on. The stand works fine.   Only issue is that when you're reading, sometimes your finger hits the power button on the Kindle Fire and turns it off, but that's an issue with the Kindle Fire itself, and not the case. I've taken to turning the Fire upside down (since the screen rotates), and opening the cover as if I were reading back-to-front in a book.  Truly an excellent case.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun app that is very enjoyable for me my friends my cousins and my very loving parents so yay for this app
B004P98QZ8|5.0|My nephew was extremely happy when I gave him this for xmas.  A fantastic challenging LEGO that represented hours of fun for him.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|It has less games and it is slow and ad supported,  trust me I was foolish enough to get it!!!!
1451648537|5.0|really a awson book!  Best content, nice cover and good paper quality.  love u jobs!  We will miss you sir!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is great because of all of the various translations and its easy to use, the only downfall, however, is that on my kindle fire you have to have wifi to use.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I absolutely love my kindle's cover! It's light weight, folds easily into a stand when you want it to and flips neatly all the way back when you want to just hold it. My kindle snapped easily into the case without forcing it in. It also leaves space at the bottom for the charging cord so you don't have to take it out to charge it. I got the pink case and my brother got the black and we are both very happy with it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love it! I love having all of these games neatly in one app! I would recommend this to anyone!great way to pass time for definitely!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I had considered purchasing this book since its release but just didn't want to pay the price.  Kept telling myself that I'd wait for the publisher to mark it down and pick it up in a year or so.  However, my son gave it to me as a Christmas gift.  Though I know it sounds very cliche-ish, once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  Strong story line and great character development.  So to any of you reading this and debating whether or not to purchase at full price, let me say, \\"buy it, it's well worth the price!\\"
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Why is the title 101 games in 1?  There are 117 games so why not call it 117 in one. Either that or you should not have developed the random 16 extra games.
B005GVF95O|4.0|From the mouth of my 3 year old, &quot;I love my puzzles. Can I play them insteading of you reading a book when we go night nights?&quot; Not sure we would've ever bought  this. Works great on kindle fire. Will probably look for other My First apps for the kiddo.
1451648537|5.0|was very excited for this purchase. the book was offered at a great price and was shipped to me extremely fast. as someone who is a big fan of apple products i could not wait to read the book.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app is awesome I freaking love ot u can choose the Colorado u want ur note to be and it is awesome every body in my family also says its amazing!!! so get :) :) :) &lt;3
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a very well written story, I can't say anything about it that hasn't already been said. However I will say that you will be doing yourself a favor if you decide to give it a try.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game because it gives you a variety of very interesting games to play plus it gives you a challenge by making you earn enough coins to buy new games.
B0055SWM08|5.0|.<br />love this game its relaxing and fun definitely worth it<br />wish you play with a friend that would be perfect
0439023521|4.0|This story is exciting and fast paced and hooks the reader from the start. The novel is not exceptionally well written, but includes enough twists and turns and is easy to understand and follow and has thus appealed to readers young and old. It kept me reading and I was entertained throughout, but it is fairly predictable and the characters other than Katniss are shallow. If you're looking for an airport/airplane book, this is a good choice. If you're looking to do some fictional heavy lifting, I would keep looking. I am, however, interested to see how the movie turns out.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I just received my cover and I really like it.  I don't feel like it is cheap - on the contrary.  I think it will protect my Kindle Fire very well.  I have had no problem with the stand.  Don't know how much I will use it.  However, I really like that it folds flat.  There are no sharp edges whatsoever.  I even put the Fire in the cover by myself - it was that easy.  Didn't have to ask hubby for help.  I highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just like solitaire on the computer! easy to figure out and offers a variety of solitaire games. this is a must have if you like solitaire!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The pro version has 128 bit encryption. With the streamer client, one has access to all connected pc, desktop or laptop, wired or wireless from a mobile device or even a pc. Very useful for media streaming of audio and  video files. In fact I am able to play  blu ray disks and 1080p video on my 1024x768 tablet at the moment. The more I play with this app, the more I see the power and potential. Love it, thanks Amazon!!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|2011 was a year that left me very empty, when I consider the blockbuster films (and other, more intelligent films)that could have/should have been so much more than they turend out to be. \\"Drive\\" was one of those rare films that turns out to be so much more that I could have immagined. When it was released, I read the blurb with very little interest, it was low on my radar, and if things hadn't happened as they did, I might not have seen it. There was another film that was at the top of my \\"To See\\" list, and now, I can't even remember what that film was.  \\"Drive\\" excelled at so many things, and after seeing it, it was all I could think about. I'm eagerly awaiting the Blu-ray release, so that I can experience it again, at home, where I can comfortably cheer each and every event in the film.  As a very high level synopsis, suffice it to say, this is a film about a person who is mostly good inside, but is strong enough to be very bad, when he needs to be.  One thing that initially kept me from putting this on my \\"Must See\\" list, was the main plot base, where the main character was a criminal. Too many films intentionally make criminals out to be the \\"Good Guys\\", and this turns me off, as I'm a John Wayne kinda guy. But only minutes into this film, Ryan Gosling was my hero for the night.  If you can deal with someone who uses violence when it needs to be used, this film is a \\"Must See\\".
B0055Q5F36|4.0|I love the case!<br />Protects the phone really well, the double layer (silicon + hard plastic) works great.<br /><br />Only issue:<br />Is not as good as my sister's ATRIX Otterbox.<br />Her Otterbox connector covers have small silicon parts that go a bit into the connector, making them fit better and hold great.<br />On the Galaxy S2, the earphone cover does not stays closed, its really easy to open it and I bet it will en braking or falling over soon :(
0439023521|5.0|This is a great book, especially for teen girls maybe 14+. I'm so tired of heroines who just whine & cry about why some boy doesn't love them enough! Katniss is a great role model - a young girl who can take care of herself, and wants nothing more than to help and protect her friends and family.  Yes, there's lots of violence here, but it's not gory or gross at all.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Hard to find anything bad here. Great functionality, options, and execution. Best keyboard I've tried. It's a keyboard, but soooooooo well done. (seriously a word minimum?)

The author does a very good job of telling us what makes us fat. There is conviction and compelling arguments behind his words.<br />6. Thought-provoking quotes abound, \\"we do not get fat because we overeat; we get fat because the carbohydrates in our diet makes us fat\\".<br />7. The apparent use of the best scientific research to back his points.<br />8. He tells what we can and shouldn't eat or drink. In short, stay away from carbohydrate-rich foods.<br />9. Makes some statements that make perfect sense to me, \\"If our beliefs aren't supported by the evidence, then we're encouraged to alter our beliefs\\".<br />10. Uses science to provide the facts about nutrition, \\"the science itself makes clear that hormones, enzymes, and growth factors regulate our fat tissue...\\"<br />11. Interesting look at genetics and its impact.<br />12. Fascinating and troubling disorders.<br />13. The fallacy that thermodynamics can tell us why we get fat. \\"But thermodynamics tells us nothing about why this happens, why we consume more calories than we expend\\".<br />14. How the body burns fuel...at an accessible level. And how to think about fat tissue.<br />15. The differences between the genders regarding storing fat.<br />16. The relation between carbohydrates and insulin.<br />17. The worst foods for us indentified and most importantly why.<br />18. Diseases associated with Western diets.<br />19. The three primary arguments against-carbohydrate diets...interesting.<br />20. A look at triglycerides and the correlation to heart attacks.<br />21. The results of some interesting studies were revealed. Such as the Stanford researchers.<br />22. The contention that the fear of saturated fat does not hold up in the light of recent research.<br />23. Why sugars are so addictive. And the need to eliminate sucrose and high-fructose corn syrups from ones' diet.<br />24. Links worked great.<br />25. The \\"No Sugar, No Starch\\" Diet.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. This is not so much a negative on the book but on the science community dealing with nutrition. I look forward to the day where the scientific community can provide to the public a consensus on what truly is the best approach to nutrition. It's one of the main factors that keep me from endorsing this book or any book on nutrition wholeheartedly.<br />2. You will experience some cognitive dissonance, that is, some ideas and concepts will go against your preconceived notions. For instance, is exercise overrated? The author quotes Hugo Rony, \\"Vigorous muscle exercise usually results in immediate demand for a large meal\\".<br />3. It's very hard to accept the diet proposed without reservations due to the fact there isn't a well known reputable organization that I personally trust supporting it such as the National Academy of Sciences. BTW what is their position on this? I would like to know.<br />4. It's a very hard diet to follow. Carbohydrates are ubiquitous in our society and if you have a sweet tooth even more so. I'm going to give this diet a try under medical supervision.<br />5. In the appendix, the author provides a diet in line with he has postulated throughout the book but doesn't really prepare you on what to expect while on the diet. I could be wrong but that's what I recall from reading it just once.<br /><br />In summary, this was a very difficult book to review. I rarely read books about nutrition and dieting but was compelled to do so because of the New Year and my goal to lose some weight. What makes this topic so hard to \\"digest\\" is the bottom line...does it work and is it a healthy diet or lifestyle to follow? Also it's a book that causes a lot of cognitive dissonance. It goes against a lot of preconceived notions that we all have about what we perceive to be a sensible diet. As an example, the author recommends high fat foods and even alternative sweeteners including the controversial Splenda or Nutrasweet (I recommend Stevia). The author for all I know may be right but it's amazing that with everything we know about science today we don't have more conclusive data, one in which can be endorsed by the Federal Government (another story for another day). All that being said, I will follow this diet with some minor adjustments (I will exercise and not go haywire on the fat) and be under doctor's supervision to see how it goes. I recommend reading the book because it is well written and provides thought-provoking ideas regarding nutrition. A lot of the data is compelling to me while I have some reservations about some things. The book is a worthy purchase.ise usually results in immediate demand for a large meal\\".<br />3.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game...very addicting. some of the games are a little difficult but gives you point for continuing to try. haven't had any freeze up but has not updated yet.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|A very, very good movie.  Makes you think, which is not a bad idea.  For those of us who are older and remember some of those days, it is signifant.  I highly recommend this movie.  Everyone did a superb job in the acting.
B004XWLN20|2.0|Smallville is a great series thats not why i give this product review 2 stars it due to the fact that whoever had the idea of packing 64 discs in a tight cardboard book wasn't really thinking. The idea was kinda of cool but that fact every disc gets scratched no matter what, unless you cut each disc out it is inevitable. If you are planning on buying this entire series just buy all the discs separately.  Hope this helps!!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Artic Silver's packaging makes it easy and clean to apply thermal paste to a processor.  Combined with their cleaner and prep solution, taking a processor from fan cooling to water cooling was a snap and gave me an assurance that I provided the best thermalconductivity possible by using Artic Silver.
B005YDLJ76|1.0|This product still hasn't arrived. I am still awaiting the arrival of this product. Please give me an update of my purchase. This was meant to be a christmas present, but it is well overdue.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Out of the almost thirty apps that I've downloaded since I've gotten my Kindle Fire Quell has to be the one I enjoy the most. Complex, relaxing, thought provoking, and simply fun, Quell seems to capture each of those aspects of an app game and add to them. From the almost hand painted look to the musical choices this game is dripping with style.  I can go on and on about this game, but in the end the best thing I can say about it is BUY IT. This. will be the best 1$ you'll ever spend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Youversion is such a great application. I really like how it incorporates all the different options,  such as highlighting, taking notes, and especially the scripture audio. As a Bible student it helps me to multi-task when I'm studying.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works great, very smooth. Don't notice any delay between what I do on the phone, and what happens on the computer, even over a mobile connection! The stream is smooth, video, audio, even video games, all perfect.   Note, you must disable predictive text on your devices keyboard, otherwise text entry will not work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very easy way to kill time, I like the variety of games,  especially the puzzle ones. I play on my kindle fire, no lagging really,
0439813786|5.0|This book is wonderful. It is very imaginative, very creative with its use of extensive artwork, and extremely well researched (due to real facts presented). I bought it for my  10 year oldgranddaughter, who loves to read, and she loves it. I will probably buy a copy for myself to read. Brian Selznick, the author, is amazing!!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Just excellent service, nothing else to said about it. I ordered because of the price and got great quality and fast delivery.
B005GVF95O|5.0|my two year old loves this app. she has done all the puzzles and she still loves to do it over and over again. great app for the little ones!
B005UBNKZG|5.0|This processor was a great choice.  I'm running Server 2008 R2 and have 3 linux virtual machines in Hyper-V and everything I do is still faster than any other computer I have.  I'm not sure whether I will overclock in the future but for now, I don't need to.  I'm not using the stock cooler but this thing runs very cool and quiet with a Xigmatek Gaia.  Forget the benchmarks, real-world use has great performance.  Highly recommended.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|Cute movie. My four year old loves it. The Christmas movie was cute too. I was a Smurf fan as a little girl so it is fun for me to watch my daughter enjoy them as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My favoriote part about this app is that I could use an audio reader to read it to me for free.  The audio my mom wanted buy a $40 audio series for her Bible and it was on sale too.  But When.she saw this she was a very happy mother.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Not really ready to review this app, but don't want to be nagged in the app, so this is what they get
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app.. ive been playing.solitaire since I was s little girl. now I just don't need the cards!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a puzzle game that starts out easy and gradually gets more complex.  Better than playing solitaire.  Great graphics also.  The only con is that it will ask you to upgrade if you need a &quot;hint &quot;... and you eventually will.
0062060554|5.0|this is it.  But be forewarned that you will not be able to put it down until you have finished this amazing book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|got my kindle fire for Christmas and love it,  but with this splash top remote app.  Its over the top. I can now assess my business or personal computers from anywere . amazing and today it was free.  this app has blown away what I thought my kindle was capable of doing. all my music and videos and files are just a touch away. my printers are also wireless and I can print also WOW!
B00664AM5C|4.0|It's very difficult to create an effective, engaging and good drama about a disease. \\"Outbreak\\" is an example of what can go wrong with these type of films. Steven Soderbergh does a really good job of introducing a wide variety of characters (casting well known actors helps us to keep track of who's who)into a story that takes place on a global scale but still impacts humanity on a small, local level.<br /><br />The script by Scott Burns nicely sketches in even minor characters and casting the roles with well known actors helps to bring additional depth to the characters in a largely incident driven script.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" provides us with a much more realistic presentation on how medicine and science do battle with a deadly virus that suddenly comes to the forefront. A team of scientists (Kate Winslet, Marion Cottlard, Elliot Gould, Jennifer Ehle)try and crack the genetic code for this virus in a dramatic effort to save lives as pressure is applied to the head of the CDC (Lawrence Fishburne)to come up with a workable vaccine as it becomes clear how deadly the disease becomes. The introduction of the subplot involving a blogger (nicely played by Jude Law)<br />advocating the use of a natural herb and his belief that the government and big Pharma are suppressing the information adds suspense to the story and provides a nice contrast to the main story.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good with a sharp presentation with nice skin tones. Black levels and contrast are quite nice. This is an exceptionally nice looking high definition transfer.<br /><br />Audio moves from little to high activity within one scene to the next depending on if the scene is more dialogue or action driven.<br /><br />The special features are quite good as well if a bit on the meager side. We get an 11 minute featurette on the reality of \\"Contagion\\" where prominent scientists discuss the reality of what we see. \\"The Contagion Detectives\\" runs a brief 5 minutes focusing on those who decode the DNA of these often lethal virus and help figure out a plan of attack for developing a vaccine or disabling the virus. We get a 2 minute PSA and a DVD edition (for the 2 disc edition)of the movie and the dreaded Ultraviolet streaming option as well.<br /><br />Although the film would probably have worked better as a mini-series allowing us to see more detailed, developed characters, \\"Contagion\\" still manages to be a suspensful ride that shows how a virus can decimate humanity with relative ease in our globe trotting world and how myth/rumor can easily spread like a virus on the internet (and lethal in its own way)that can impact our decisions.<br /><br />I'd suggest a rental because as riveting as this film can be I doubt you'll watch it more than a couple of times.who decode the DNA of these often lethal virus and help figure out a plan of attack for developing a vaccine or disabling the virus.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Quiet, relaxing gameplay, great facade. A very nice game to play while doing something else Xp Hopefully morevlevels sometime soon?
1416550550|5.0|I look at 500 page books and cringe!  However when I started this book for my book club, I could hardly put it down and then later didn't want it to end!  So, there you go.  Authors do sometimes surprise their audience with spectacular yarns and well crafted plots.  The story of Nell being left behind after a ship docks in Australia caught my interest immediately.  But, the characters are plentiful and exciting as they are woven into the mystery that begins during the early 1900s.  One can't say too much about this book without giving away the shocking twists and turns that will pull the reader through.  All I will say is that this a most satisfying novel and will become a true classic.  Hurrah to Kate Morton!  Lovely!
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is very easy to play.  it has very good graphics and a quick play time.  i recommend for ease of play.
B004U52VPS|1.0|I returned this toy because it was missing parts. I wanted to give it as a gift  and I was very disappointed!!!!
B005GVF95O|5.0|Great app for kids. My 6 year old loved it enough to turn down a bedtime story to continue playing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire and love it. The game works very well with no delays. The graphics are clean and easy to look at. Settings allow you to increase the difficulty of the game as you progress. It's very easy to let time slip away as you challenge yourself to win faster and with less moves each time.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Simply engaging, absolutely maddening!  I'm brilliant one second and an idiot the next!  Beware - you'll get hooked on this game'

B005I6EU7U|4.0|I love this cover! It has a somewhat strong smell, but I've never met a leather product that didn't at first. It fits my Kindle Fire perfectly and looks so cute! The hard cover seems plenty sturdy for everyday use (definitely not the product you want if you're going to take it out of the case a lot though). I sort of wish it had some kind of closure but I don't really mind that much.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I got this app for my Kindle Fire when it was the free app of the day, and it really is pretty cool! It makes your Kindle look just like your computer!  I'm enjoying it!

0446582778|4.0|Having read a number of the books in the Harry Bosch series this one was by far the most entertaining and mysterious. The reader is taken on a roller coaster ride of suprises and twists in the story of the slaying of a black attorney who is about to light off a bomb in court about an accused murderer. Unfortunately the attorney is killed and Harry Bosch and his team get the call to investigate. The storyline has a number of uneventful turns and dull points as the team is set up and starts to work. Some personalities enter into the story too from past Harry Bosch adventures.   However the reader is led through a number of pieces of clues and points that seem to confirm that a cop did the killing. As the book concludes in the last hundred pages the action gets heavy with a discovery that the case of a murdered child, which is the lynchpin for the murder trial where the black lawyer was to defend the murderer, opens up a broad number of things as to what was happening to the young girl before she was killed and subsequently the black lawyer's death. Harry starts from square one as Los Angeles's population begins to get uneasy about the black lawyer's demise and the lack of a suspect when he cracks the case and runs to prove it and prevent the city from going into a full riot.   The end of the book is very action filled and has a number of suprises that lead to the actual killer's unveiling. Although the reader may suspect who the killer is at several points in the book, the author has cleverly stears the reader in other directions until Harry Bosch puts the pieces together.   This is a very good read and keeps the Harry Bosch series as one of my favorites. If you enjoy a good mystery this is one you should pick up and read.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love it so do my kids. It is fun for the everyone to in joy at work or in the car.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I must say it's worth the money. Oh wait, it isn't any! You get tons of games and they're all free! The games are amazing. If you're looking for GREAT games, this is the best choice.
0307269752|4.0|I think this book is one of the greatest that I read in a long time. It kept me going, and Steig Larsson's ability to create wonderful suspense - it would be hard to find someone who can master it the way he does. The beginning of the story was great, because the reader had no idea how the Vanger family operated. As you read through the book, you start to realize that the family has some deep dark secrets, and you the reader want to find out what happened to Harriet Vanger. Lisbeth Salander - the brilliant, genius character of the story operates as a sleuth to help Blomkvist find out the truth about the \\"murder/disappearance\\" of Harriet Vanger. She was by far my most favorite character in the story. The way that Larsson describes her, her reasonable hatred for men is pure brilliance. And, all the questions in the end regarding the Wennerstrom scandal all come together. At times, as a reader, I wondered whether this would be at all possible - the hacking that Lisbeth and Evil Fingers does - but her character is so believable that I think that this girl is invinceable. Of course, the ending - I would've wanted Lisbeth to be happy w the man of her dreams, but who was I kidding? She is too insecure and still has some deeply emotional problems within herself that she has not solved yet. The Girl Who Played With Fire will be one amazing story because we now know Lisbeth....she can be vulnerable yet extremely brutal because of her past experiences with rape, sexual assault and harassment. I feel for this character and am definitely rooting for her. I can't wait to see other projects that she will get her hands on next.
B000001GXF|4.0|Make no mistake: this album features playing from outstanding musicians. Gilels and the Amadeus Quartet play with vision and the utmost of clarity. There's something wonderful about hearing musicians interact on an intimate level, and what chamber music is as delightful as Schubert's \\"Trout\\" Quintet\\"? Certainly Gilels and the Amadeus Quartet understand each other, both having a pleasing richness in tone.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I acquired this disc after becoming familiar with Emanuel Ax and Yo-Yo Ma's recording of it with several of their friends. (From now on, I'll refer to the two different interpretations as Gilels and Ax, respectively). I was strongly pleased with that version, but thought that the Gilels deserved a listen as well. And it certainly does. Both interpretations are markedly different, Gilels favoring a more laid back approach. Gilels is slower than Ax, taking 39 minutes to Ax's 37, but Gilels feels even slower than the comparative timings suggest. Gilels seems to take a resigned approach, one that strikes me as being more suited to Brahms than Schubert. Ax rides on the clouds, glorious and without a care in the world. You have to smile listening to Ax, but Gilels can border on sounding ponderous. Sound quality doesn't determine everything of course, but Sony's sonics on the Ax are out of this world; naturally Gilels' 70's analog isn't on the same level.<br /><br />In closing, this is a fine disc. Personally I prefer Ax's sunnier lyricism to Gilels' resigned approach, but both are sure to please the listener.<br /><br />[This was copied from an issue that featured only the Trout and one movement from the Maiden.  I obviously can't make any judgement calls for the Maiden, but the movement I heard sounded more involved than the Trout.]
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I actually bought this a couple of week's ago when it was on sale.  This has worked flawlessly for me using SG2, Xoom, Galaxy tab 7 and Galaxy tab 8.9. I have only used through my home network so encryption not a negative for me.  The speed is amazing and the implementation of the mouse works well. Easy to setup on the PC and automatically finds. Switched from TeamViewer and never looked back.    It is fast, it works, and it is free, what more could you want?

B001UV4XIS|5.0|If I couldn't find any other books I would always buy a Harry Potter to read but Deathly Hallows is the best one movie wise. I am glad Hermione chose Ron Weasley.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie. Superb acting, wonderful script, and the direction is at a good pace. The inter-woven stories touch on all different kinds of love: between friends, couples, family members... and from different ages, backgrounds, classes and nationalities. There is both humor and drama. And it never gets predictable or corny, in fact the ending for a few of the stories is quite sad. But most of the stories do end happily, and you walk away feeling full of joy.

1451629184|5.0|Thank you , Jaycee, for writing this book.  I hope it has been a catharsis for you and a freeing from such a troubling time, allowing you--and us--to analyze and try to understand a man so twisted that he sought to enslave your soul as well as your body. I think it is true from reading your story that \\"what does not kill us makes us stronger\\". I wish you and your children and family the peace that comes from having overcome such an inhuman ordeal. God grant you peace!    from the author of 'Graffiti On My Soul', the survivor of another horror

B004O3YGMC|2.0|tired it out as the free app of the day, not very impressed actually.  after connecting to my pc the program was very slow and unresponsive and eventually claims to have lost connection.  although it is quite pricey for an app i still do not regret dropping the cash for LogMeIn Ignition, it is a far better app
B0054JZC6E|5.0|while some of the games aren't great, overall a good time!  great time waster.  and both my children and the wife found something to enjoy.
0375851569|5.0|What else needs to be said.  All the Dr Suess classics in a bundle.  Got this for me niece for Christmas.  I almost wanted it for myself.
0062014951|2.0|Excited to start reading this book after 2 glowing reviews from spouse and good friend, I found I couldn't relate to the content.  Patti's life felt fictitious and she seemed unenlightened (especially about Mapplethorpe's sexuality).  Doesn't mean it's not for someone else, but I find the idea of birthing and surrendering a child to adoption at the age of 20 worth more words than the subsequent description of a tiny apartment.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is seriously one of the best games that's ever been made.  It is a must-have game for every family.  It is a brilliant game of strategy, odds, and economics.  It is a tile-laying game, so the board of the game is different every time you play it.  I have played this game for years and rarely get sick of it.  There are also several expansions to the game to make it more complex or just simply different and I recommend most of those as well.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. I've used it now for over a year on different devices and have had little proplem with it.  I wish it had some more reference books with it, but that is a minor detail. I recommend this app to lots of people.  Thanks for making this available!
0385738773|3.0|I am so glad that I read the Maze Runner trilogy.  It was a very exciting series and I always looked forward to reading more.  The Death Cure however was my least favorite of the three books.  I suppose it's difficult to wrap up a series that has been so myesterious throughout without having some letdown.  The ending wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't great either, simply good.  But, this is the first book I've ever been so excited about that I pre-ordered it.  And I do not regret that decision.  I think the series wrapped up well.  My only gripes with this book was the lack of character development and the action was just too over the top.  I mean you didn't really care about the fate of most of the characters in the book because they weren't developed enough.  The author did not make me as a reader invest emotionally in most of the characters, hence I didn't care about what their fate ended up being.  But the story itself is great and it was a great idea for a series.  If you've read the first two books, then this is a must.  If you haven't read those, then start there and I definitely recommend all three.  Enjoy!
B00005JLWN|5.0|This film, although a recent purchase, has been a favorite of mine for quite a while now.  I like action movies.  They are fun escapism and easy amusement or gratification.  They are not a one size fits all genre, but when you want to watch that type of story, there really is no substitute.  I also, however, appreciate a depth of story.  Especially a story that asks, or at least looks at, real questions.  Things that matter in the bigger picture.  This film is a rarity in that, in my opinion, it does both of those things.  Well.  The action is fast, violent, not so absurd as to totally break suspension of disbelief (an important factor), and also beautifully artistic in it's choreography.  Those scenes are the frosting on a cake of deep questions.  What is it to be human?  Are feelings required?  Would you trade them for safety?  Is that even possible or is it just lying to ourselves?  To what extent can we solve our problems with chemicals and social engineering?  Set in the not-too-distant future, a totalitarian regime preaches against emotional extremes and requires timed-interval drug dosage for the entire populace to prevent them.  The given theory being that elimination of those strong emotions is the key to peace and the survival of humanity in the fallout of the third world war.  On the surface, it is dull, but successful.  No murder.  No rape.  No crime at all is suggested, but not specified.  By trading in the highs of joy and passion, we have eliminated the lows of rage and misery.  Yet, this same governing body views anyone in violation of thier dosage, or worse yet in pursuit of those emotional extremes and all the things that provoke or inspire them, to be criminals of the worst sort.  They are viewed as collectively trying to undo the peace and drag humanity back into the pit, so to speak.  So what does the regime do?  It finds these people.  Labels them \\"sense offenders\\", and murders them.    So did we really find peace and escape killing each other?Or are we just protecting ourselves from the dissident few, that would bring us all down?  Good stuff.  Splendid acting and exposition, and the action movie frosting to boot.  More movies should be made that can achieve this.
B003L6KNMK|5.0|I think this may be my favorite episode of the underrated series, \\"Community\\".  This episode was hilarious and was a brilliantly made spoof on dystopian stories.  I hope this show stays on the air for a long time to come.
1423136802|5.0|This series of books was a Christmas gift, and it was a great gift. My daughter is on the final book and she can not put them down! This set was priced right, and was delivered before Christmas as promised. There great!
B0055SWM08|4.0|I was tired of words with friends and solitaire but didn't want tetris. this was a great solution.  calm music soothing graphics.
B000HT3P7E|1.0|When I was younger and it first aired it was good for a couple of laughs, now that I've grown up a bit and watched more television and discovered what my humor is and what type of shows I enjoy, I can safely say that I cannot stand this show.  Some of my friends are huge fans, and I will admit that one thing that puts me off the show even further is the hypocricy of them going off at me for not enjoying it while it's suddenly a taboo to ask them why they do not even try the shows I like, rather than just outright saying it's a poor series.  I really wanted to enjoy this series. It has an actress I really enjoyed in Buffy, a show I was really into before I found the show again after a few years and decided I didn't like. I wanted to find the jokes funny, and I wanted to enjoy the story.  But I couldn't, I found the jokes cheesy, I felt that the creators were just trying to make another \\"Friends\\" and the continuity of the show was one thing I could not let past, I cannot enjoy a show with as many continuity errors as this. I have been reffered to as one with a case of OCD and I will not disagree, which might be why the lack of continuity is just so painful. I can accept that others enjoy this show but I cannot get myself to enjoy it.  I admit that I have not sat down and watched a DVD of it, but I have seen enough of the show to have seen repeats on television multiple times. I just think this is a poor quality of television.  You can get angry in the comments and call me stupid for- god forbid I don't like a television show- or you can tease me for what I enjoy.  Go Ahead, Buffy, Weeds, Monk, Anime and much more, I don't care as I realise that posting this will upset the people unintelligent enough to be hurt that I don't share their opinion.  I suppose I can see why people might enjoy this for a laugh at some silly jokes, I admit I've giggled once or twice while watching it, mainly often due to my brother not allowing me to watch anything else and me waiting to pounce on the remote to put a DVD in. But the story I cannot see being enjoyed. I feel that the premise has been made redundant to the rest of the show, there is no reasonable storyline due to the disgusting continuity issues and I have only enjoyed 1 show with canned laughter ever- that of course being Friends. I feel the jokes are stale, and the bad jokes are blown over the top while the decent ones are shoved down and hidden around and I find it way too easy to dislike the characters. And the acting- no, don't get me started, I only enjoyed Alyson Hannigan's performance but that might just be a bias from Buffy  In conclusion I think that this show is wildly overrated, and I feel that from the original premise it probably could have been a truly great show, but it has far too many faults to get to that point, and I believe it's gone past the point of being saved.  And I apologise for any people who I may have offended in this, and I apologise for anything that may have not made sence or the high chance of one of my points in here being half completed, I'm running on no food and very little sleep.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar has always continually put out a fantastic array of movies for children over the years, but this one stands out amongst the throngs.  Finding Nemo, unlike it's Pixar predecessors, is set almost entirely in a watery environment and it certainly feels that way.  Down to the last speck.  Even the characters, heavily anthropomorphized, move like the creatures they represent.  Their personalities reflect their shape from the slightly crazed, bubbles infatuated tank dwellers to the hippie inspired sea turtles with their 'chill-out' grace of movement.  A wonderful assortment of personalities, memorable characters, and phenomenal layouts that represent everything from coral reefs, to dirty docks, to fish tanks is represented and delivered with utter excellence.<br /><br />The story unfolds when an overprotective but dedicated father, Marlin, loses his son, Nemo, to human divers looking to populate their fish tank naturally.  Marlin, consequently, goes on a quest to find his son where he meets up with Dory, a fish with short-term memory loss.  To reach his son he will have to battle the dangers of the ocean to find his courage and to learn that love has a limit when it become stifling.  It's a delightful story that is suitable for all ages.  High adventure, drama, comedy, and action come together as seamlessly as the oceanic environment we are introduced to.<br /><br />The musical score is, also, in of itself, brilliant.  It compliments the subtle quality of the film that makes it so grand.  After so many years of Pixar being in our lives it's difficult to be wowed by their talents anymore.  However, this is certainly wow worthy!  The musical score coupled with the subtlety of genius and talent are what we take away from this movie.  We feel as if we have really spent the last hour and a half in the ocean, getting to know the characters, their personalities, and the lessons they must learn.<br /><br />A crowning achievement with a heaping amount of 'feel good' on the side.
1451627289|5.0|I have been a fan of King's for a long time, my favorite books are The Stand and It and 11/22/63 takes me back to the style of those times where you get into the storyline and characters and can't wait to see what happens next.  He also brings back some favorite characters from other novels which is one of many reasons I love reading his books.  It doesn't take long to get into this book and once you do you're hooked, the ending does a good job of wrapping enough of the story up.  The premise has been done before but the detail in this book is so well done it's worth a read, especially if you are already a fan.
B004RKXNDU|1.0|I have read a lot of Le Carre books, but this one confused me nd I could not get into this book.  I did not finish it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I 'be been a born-again Christian for 15 years now and always had trouble digging in to God's word. The Bible app has been fantastic motivating me to read. I love the one year Bible plan I'm working on. It's s a good mix of scripture. I also like the inspirational devotional I signed up for. I love having a ton of translations at my fingertips instantly! This app has truly changed my Christian walk. :)
B004LROUNG|5.0|Read all of his books and never disappointed.  This was different, I did not expect this type of book about lawyers,but it turned out to be a good read.
0307593312|2.0|Like many others have said, this book needed an editor. Extremely repetitive. 400-500 pages would have been perfect. Perhaps someone out there should take a stab at trimming it down?
B0002XMKYE|5.0|Came in early. This was a Christmas/Birthday gift for my dad I have to get him a new copy every few years since he wears through them. Thanks.
B004QHU74M|5.0|Easily my pick for Best Album of 2011. This masterpiece of sound and lyrics takes its listeners through a variety of emotions while telling a story of love and regret.
0553582038|1.0|I will not purchase any more used books in the future through Amazon.Com. The book that I ordered was based on a picture [shown on the website] of the original cover from the first printing, at least that was what I thought I was buying; perhaps I did not read the small print. As a first time buyer I thought I was buying from Amazon directly. I am very disappointed.

B00002N9ER|4.0|Hi folks,<br /><br />These clips are great and do exactly what they describe.  It takes a hefty pull to get the flashlight out when using both mounts and that's exactly what you want.  I would warn fellow knuckle draggers like myself, that when the flashlight is removed from it's clips, the clips can be broken with a bit of pressure in the wrong direction.  I'd recommend installing the clips where there isn't a chance of them being rubbed or pushed up against by anything else.<br /><br />I installed my clips near the stickshift of a Jeep Wrangler on the passenger side and I've ended up going through 3 sets in 11 years.  As far as I know, there's nothing else out there that's as cheap or as good so I'll stick with them but wanted to offer up some placement advice.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />NORCALROOTS
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved this book!  It was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I would recommend anyone who is planning to see the movie to read the book first.  I think you will get a lot more out of the movie if you read the book first.  I highly recommend this book.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|I had really high hopes for this movie. It has a unique theme that sounded like it would be an interesting movie to watch. Somehow they managed to ruin it with poor acting and annoying characters. Seriously, the only believeable acting was from Harrison Ford's characters son. He played a spoiled brat very well.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|The DVD didn't work unless forced along the time bar on a computer.  Won't function at all in a DVD player.  The cover looked to be home printed so I doubt this is an original.  I will be sure that future DVD orders are sold directly by Amazon. They did promptly refund my money.
085786078X|5.0|Simon Tofield is a great observer of cats.  He has their actions and reactions down to a \\"T\\".  Made me and the folks I gave some of the copies to roar with laughter.  Buy one, you won't regret it.
0545265355|5.0|This series of books are great! A friend loaned me his copies, I couldn't put the books down. I think I read all 3 books in a month or less. The Hunger Games got me so hooked I had to buy my own copy and re-read them again. This is an excellent buy and a great gift for anyone who loves to read.
0307593312|5.0|What a brilliant book from Murakami. Well worth the wait. Its the usual dive into magical realism with reality and and a parallel universe morphing into each other. His style of writing, even though this is a translation, is so very readable. I love his desciptive style and the way he unpeels his characters. It is complex, clever and at times confusing, but this very long volume is well worth taking the time to delve into and enjoy.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|Rihanna released her debut studio album 'Music Of The Sun' in 2005 and quickly followed up with 'A Girl Like Me' in 2006. Both were great albums, she had an innocent image and her albums had fun songs with a reggae and R&B sound. In 2007, she did something different and released 'Good Girl Gone Bad' which had a different sound and changed her innocent image, this album has a more dance-pop sound but still has some R&B, but it was a nice change to her sound and image and it wasn't inappropiate, it was just kind of rebellious. Then in 2008, instead of releasing a new album, she extended the era and made the 'Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded' re-release, which had 3 new songs that I'll review later. If you bought the re-release, you'll notice the new songs sound more mature and show Rihanna's growth as an artist. Now I'll review the album songs:  1. Umbrella - The opening track and the album's lead single. This song features Jay-Z but just at the start of the song, then it's just Rihanna. It was a hit in 2007, it was played on the radio all the time and still continues being played. The song is great, it has a great beat and shows Rihanna's vocals are strong. This song made Rihanna consolidate in the music industry and was her second #1 song in the Billboard Hot 100 (The first being 'SOS' from her album 'A Girl Like Me'). I give it a 10/10  2. Push Up On Me - The second track on the album. It has a good beat, but I don't really like it, I just don't feel it very much. I give it a 7.5/10  3. Don't Stop The Music - The third track and the album's fourth single. This song interpolates MJ's 'Wanna Be Startin' Something', and that song interpolates Manu Dibango's 'Soul Makossa', so it's a song interpolating a song interpolating another song. Anyways, it's a dance song for sure and was the perfect choice for a single. I give it a 10/10  4. Breakin' Dishes - The fourth track and a promotional single from the album. It's kind of rebellious, it totally fits the 'Good Girl Gone Bad'theme and is an upbeat song. I give it a 9.5/10  5. Shut Up And Drive - The fifth track and the album's second single. It's kind of a rock song, but it's still pop. It was kind of a flop when it was released back in 2007, but it was still in commercials and had it's success. I give it a 9/10  6. Hate That I Love You - The sixth track and the album's third single. The song is a duet between Rihanna and Ne-Yo (he previously worked with Rihanna for her second album 'A Girl Like Me' with the ballad driven 'Unfaithful'). It's a cute song and has a deep message, but it's not one of my favorites. I give it a 8.5/10  7. Say It - The seventh track on the album. Since I recently bought the album, I haven't listened to it a lot unlike the singles which I already heard before I bought the album, but I know I wasn't very surprised by it and maybe that's why it easily gets out of my head. I give it a 7.5/10  8. Sell Me Candy - The eighth track on the album. When I saw the title, I thought it was a very cheap and cheesy way to say she's agressive, but I was partially wrong (it's still a 'bad girl' song if you see the lyrics). Not much to say about it. I give it a 8/10  9. Lemme Get That - The ninth track on the album. For me, this song had power to be a single and could have been a better choice over 'Shut Up And Drive', since it's catchier. I give it a 9.5/10  10. Rehab - The tenth track and the album's eighth overall single (fifth if you don't count the re-release singles) and final single from the era. This song is so beautiful and has a deep meaning, sounds like it could have belonged to the re-release since it's much more mature than the other songs from the original release. Justin Timberlake collaborated with lyrics on this song. I give it a 10/10  11. Question Existing - The eleventh track on the album. When it started, I thought it had a 'Music Of The Sun' vibe (at least, similar to that album's lead single 'Pon De Replay'), then as the song progressed I actually liked it a lot, it's upbeat. I give it a 9.5/10  12. Good Girl Gone Bad - The twelfth track on the album and the closing track on the original release. It has the same title as the album, but it doesn't explain her change of image, it just talks about bad girls in general. I don't like very much, just like I didn't feel 'Push Up On Me', I don't feel this one either. I give it a 7/10  13. Disturbia - The thirteenth track and the second single from the re-release (the sixth single overall). Since this one is a new song on the 2008 re-release, it has that sound of a more mature Rihanna, but in this case it's a 'totally evil Rihanna', if you watch the video you'll know what I'm talking about. It still is catchy and upbeat, I really love it and it makes you take Rihanna's bad girl image more seriously. I give it a 10/10  14. Take A Bow - The fourteenth track and the lead single from the re-release (the fifth single overall). Another song only on the re-release. This goes away from the bad girl image and instead we have a mature Rihanna, that seems to realize her man is just doing a show and is being unfaithful to her, so he can go on a take a bow. Interesting song. I give it a 10/10  15. If I Never See Your Face Again - The closing track on the re-release album. This is a remix of a Maroon 5 song featuring Rihanna, and it belongs to the re-release of his album 'It Won't Be Soon Before Long' but it was also included on Rihanna's re-release. This style doesn't really suit Rihanna and I think it shouldn't have been remixed, it should have been kept in its original form only with Maroon 5. Weak closing track for this re-release (it shouldn't have been added, 'Take A Bow' was a great closing to the album so just 2 new tracks was enough). I give it a 5/10  So, Rihanna's third studio album re-release 'Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded' is a great album and the bonus tracks make the original even better (even if I actually didn't buy the original). It still had a few weak points so that's why I give it 4/5 (it would actually be 4.5/10, but you can't rate like that on Amazon).
B006FPFTMS|1.0|the same problems as with nook review above. opens all pdfs to a mysterious grey screen. cant read anything from my documents!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Got my Kindle Fire for Christmas and new I wanted this cover based on how it appears on-line...It's actually even better \\"in person\\"...I am using it with the 'Decalgirl Kindle Fire Skin - Fleurs Sauvages' by DecalGirl and am very happy with how they look together.  A friend commented that it looked like an old witches spellbook when I pulled it from my purse....loved that comment!  The quality is great, the feel of the binding is very rich.  It is very tight as mentioned in the product description, but I agree that this is a good thing...I don't worry about my Kindle Fire slipping out..one note of caution if you use with the 'Decalgirl Kindle Fire Skins...you must be careful when placing the Fire in the cover because it will push up/scrunch the skin.  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  :)
B001MYIXAC|2.0|In my opinion, there is no contest between \\"Let The Right One In\\" and \\"Let Me In\\".  Hammer Films \\"Let Me In\\" is the better film.  It maintains interest throughout.  The English script changes are all for the better and the CGI use leaves no doubt that Abby is dangerous.  I had absolutely no emotional hook to the children in this Swedish version.  After all the hype, I expected much more that the film delivered.  The little girl, Eli, looks like an Italian World War II urchin.  The type that ran behind American tanks asking, \\"Hey Joe, you got chocolate?\\"  Definitely not vampire material.  I never once felt that Oskar had the deep feelings for Eli that Owen displayed for Abby.  I will say that the scene with Virginia and the cats was a shocking mouth-opener.  Also,the main bully in this version is nowhere near as menacing as the one in \\"Let Me In\\".  The Matt Reeves film, \\"Let Me In\\" is the one to own.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|an alright ap. ads are pretty annoying. they permeate every bit of the ap. the games are very simple but some of them are actually fun.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Derek Trucks is well known to be an extremely talented guitar player. I'm a big fan from the Allman Brothers.....combine that w/his wife's great voice and song writing skills = FAB TUNES!!  Saw them twice on tour as well - this is a great album.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I purchased this cd for myself and a son, who is also a huge fan of theirs. After listening several times to it, in its entirety...I still love the music!  Definitely one of the best cd's ever made.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Florence and the Machine is increasingly becoming my favorite bands. Florence Welch's hauntingly beautiful voice coupled with phenominal lyrics and brilliant music is nothing short of perfection. I cannot think of a track on this album that is not a favorite. I admit that I have spent lots of time dancing like a complete moron in my living room to Dog Days are Over and Drumming Song.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|NCIS is an AWESOME show! The movie box was bent when it arrived, like something really heavy had been put on top of it but other than that, everything is great.
B005I0BR0E|3.0|I'm not really a huge Rihanna fan, but I do like this album for the most part. I'm not in love with every song on it but most of the tunes are catchy, upbeat & fun.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Hidden object games are my favorite but this is a challenge on the smaller screen.  The graphics were a little fuzzy too.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I absolutely love this album. You can pretty much dance, run or workout to every song, so it's in heavy rotation during my workouts. I really enjoy the differences in the songs. From Elton John style piano to house beats with borderline dub step breakdowns to Pop, it really has it all. Even my 54 year old mother loves this album!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have app. I love being able to take my Bible everywhere. Thanks YouVersion! I appreciate your efforts!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app. I can remote in to my home computer from anywhere. So when my wife has problems with the computer while I'm at work, I can fix it from my EVO. Thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book, it's another take on the future, not sure it's completely realistic but hey, what book is?  I would encourage you to read the books first before the movies come out.
0307593312|1.0|I finished it. It took over a month to read because it is way too long(925 pages--it should have been 250) and it is dull as in DULL. A boring story that is written by someone getting paid by the word. It is a simple book to read but I never felt like putting in more than 10 minutes at a clip.   The characters and story could have been interesting if it didn't take so long for things to happen. As it is, the ending is really quick as if he hit his word quota and just got it over with.   After about 700 pages I gave up on waiting for something interesting to happen and decided that since I came this far...
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Not sure how this book hasn't reached Twilight status yet.  Please tell me that this book is going to be made into a movie!  I can't tell you how much I love this book.  Since Twilight, I haven't been able to find anything that would replace it but I have now, I can't stop thinking about it.  In LOVE with Travis!    Favorite line in the book is when Travis tells her that he belongs to her.  It may be chaotic and crazy and probably extremely dysfunctional but it's a book, I can indulge.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|great app I have used this on my pc, ios devices too bad i switch to skyrocket from iphone and this was my first purchase.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is addicting. you can play tor hours or minutes and it never gets old because you can get new games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game, I think it's awesome. my kids love it too. it keeps them entertain for hours. its a fun app.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|my cousin told me about this app and I now have it on my phone and my kindle fire wouldn't live without it now. it has minor bugs which I admit are probably User errors but I still love it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Love this app with the kindle fire...works great.  The only thing that took me some getting used to was scrolling within the screen...aside from that it is one of the best free apps that amazon has featured!
B002JODV3S|5.0|Steve Vai is one of the top guitarists in the world today, and this lengthy concert DVD doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The musicianship is top-notch from the whole band, the Asian chick is hot (sorry, it has to be said), the sound quality is good, the filmwork is good, and you do get a decent sense that you're there at the concert.<br /><br />Really, it comes down to whether you're a Steve Vai fan and appreciate his distinctly \\"alien\\" style of rock music.  If so, this DVD is a must have.<br /><br />Also, be sure to check out the bonus material, which gives you a sense of Steve's personal side, as well as making clear that being on a concert tour is far from glamorous when you look behind the scenes.
B000002A46|5.0|This is by far one of the best Christmas cds of all time! I've wanted this for awhile.  I checked and the price was simply irresistible
B005LJITS0|3.0|Fun but flawed. Pretty much everything that works is balanced by something that doesn't. Some of it works pretty well and I did like how casually competent the CGI is. Even when my interest in the story sagged there was often cool stuff to look at.   The standout performer is Peter Sarsgaard who gives his character a lot more nuance and flavor than anyone else in the movie - he's fun to watch until the makeup starts getting in the way.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Have both this app and the HD version.  Fast on my home network, not so fast on 3G through Google. Use it to watch HDTV remotely ( from the tuner on my desktop  PC) to my xoom and thunderbolt.  Also use it to control my media center on my home theatre PC.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Not bad. Not the original X-Men I knew and I think there were some poor choices made as far as who to include, who to invent, and who to leave out but, even with that, it's a pretty good superhero/action film. It doesn't have as much heart as it needed to be outstanding but has more than it needed to make money.
0062060554|2.0|This book fell short...........I bought the book, because of all the great reviews but story was typical not original at all.  Suspense in the book was lame; this book comes in the category of thrill and suspense well not even close.  Please, don't waste your money on this book.  I don't know why i was keeping reading the book; i guess because i wasted my money on it i was like may be something will develop but nothing happen.
B005F3XV62|3.0|The previews for Kevin James' movies always look stupid; focusing on pratfalls and juvenile humor. The movies always exceed the previews, revealing heart and grace the previews never hint at. A great movie? No. A movie I enjoyed? Yes.   Plus: Rosario Dawson!
0307593312|1.0|This 926-page book was 3 times longer than it needed to be.  If the reader is awake and aware, he doesn't need to be reminded of the events that took place a few pages or chapters ago.  I found the plot to be very contrived and obvious.  Of course, an author does have the luxury of controlling the plot and his characters, but I  prefer those authors who create the characters, and then let the characters write their story.  Besides being a waste of paper, reading this book was a waste of time, in my opinion.
B005UKJX4E|4.0|Astonishingly beautiful meditation on life. You may respond with a reverential \\"Oh, my god\\" or with a bewildered \\"What the f***?\\" or, likely, a combination thereof but this is undeniably a master filmmaker at ease and in love with his medium. The ending of the film, unfortunately, is a bit hackneyed and does more to obscure than to clarify but, even with that, this is formidable achievement of cinematic art which should be seen on film on the biggest screen you can find.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I'm really impressed with all of the positive reviews with the app. They are what motivated me to give it a try. I was perfectly happy with AndroidVNC. And I guess I will have to continue using it.   I installed the app on my Samsung Prevail. And I was impressed with the easy to wizard that it had. but once I tried to connect the app would crash.  I'm really itching to try it on my higher end Android device.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|Surprisingly effective entry into the \\"found footage\\" monster film oeuvre (and also seeming to owe a little bit to [[ASIN:B00006FMCS Man Bites Dog]] which preceded the supernatural/monster films). The trolls manage, astonishingly, to be both goofy looking and credibly threatening.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is good just some levels or games you cant beat because they are hard and the leveles cost so.much money so yes I.would recommond it
B005UG542S|4.0|Well enough made but kind of unsatisfying. [[ASIN:B001UV4XHY Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1]] managed to rise above the weaknesses of the final book and make one of my favorite Potter films from my least favorite portion of the books. Deathly Hallows - Part 2 must focus more on plot than character in order to wrap things up and suffers as a result. Still, quite an achievement.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so far so good. haven't played it too much yet but it seems like a fun time killer! I like the way you can play for points...it makes it more of an ongoing challenge
B0068TJLSY|4.0|A beautiful, nostalgic film capturing a more innocent style of filmmaking along with a more innocent view of adolescent adventure and romance than we generally see in movies now. And yet it also feels more truthful than the jaded, pessimistic, and self-indulgently bombastic threat-escalation that pervades most modern adventure films. This film trusts the threat it introduces to be sufficient without unnecessary multiplication.  The performances by the \\"kids\\" in the cast are spot-on believable as actual children just beginning to mature. Elle Fanning in particular is a revelation and definitely looks to be an actress to watch for.
0385341008|5.0|I didn't want this book to end.  The characters were real, funny, brave, and loyal.  They handled the heartbreak of their situation with with unbelievable courage.
B005LJK3AC|3.0|Hit and miss, but a bit more hit than miss. Great cast given some funny material to chew the scenery with, but the movie always seemed to be holding something in reserve that it never delivered. And Jason Sudeikis seemed to be playing two different and incompatible characters at different times.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works good on windows 7 . On windows xp it seems to have audio problems, probably due to out of date drivers. All in all the programs works great with windows 7.
B005QYKE2Y|2.0|Some really nice animation and some segments that held my interest for minutes at a time, but mostly disjointed and tiresome. The talented cast improves the quality of the film, but not a lot.

B005DF2QMC|4.0|My husband bought this for me for Christmas.  My computer would not recognize the unit.  After looking at Amazon reviews I decided my best option was to email customer service.  They responded quickly and politely, offering some slightly better instructions (to wit, make sure batteries are in the unit), but my computer would still not recognize the widget.  In just a couple of days, the company had shipped a new unit.  My computer recognizes this one and it works like a charm.  I have seen some customer complaints about the quality of materials of the unit.  Yes, it is cheap plastic in some parts, but since its primary function is to dupe tapes, it should be sitting on a desk or counter and not be subjected to a lot of horseplay anyway.  If you want a tape player to carry around, go with Sony, but if what you want is something to duplicate old cassettes into WAV or mp3, this is your gadget! I give it four stars because of excellent customer service and ease of operation.  I took away a star because of cheap materials and the fact that there seem to be quite a few lemons coming from the manufacturer.
0545265355|5.0|If you are looking an intense series, look no further.  Everyone I know who has read these books has loved them.  The first movie comes out this March.  The books came quickly and they are first edition.  Great deal!

B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app which I snagged for $0.99 in mid-December during all the app deals Amazon was running for the holidays. Happy to see it's a free app of the day now though so that more people can get onboard. Really easy way to access files on your computer, especially when you're at home. Makes watching videos on your computer through the Kindle Fire a breeze. The connection isn't encrypted. For me it isn't a big deal. Stay smart and stay off websites with sensitive information and you'll be fine.

B006SV2LWA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this film and the ending should give us all pause.  It is has been theorized the transmission of H1N1 from Pig/Duck to Humans was only possible through overpopulation, deforestation, and factory farming.  May we learn from our mistakes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think the games are alright. something to do when I'm bored. it could use an easier points system. but fun.
0786955570|5.0|I just got this and played it a few times solo. If you are looking for good games to play when there isn't anyone to play with, this is a great one. My current favorite solo game is Arkham Horror and this game is almost as good.<br /><br />The gameplay involves creating a random dungeon from a large selection of heavy interlocking cardboard tiles. You need a good size table. Your band of up to 5 heroes co-operate to explore the dungeon on a set quest adventure. 13 are included in the adventure booklet. After a few games making up your own quest won't be too hard. The dungeon is created as you go so the layout will be different every time you play. The rules are fairly simple and should be easily picked up by even young kids.<br /><br />A nice selection of miniatures in different colors for all the heroes and monsters are included. Each of the adventures requires different unique items, monsters, tokens or cards that are all provided giving the game a large selection of props to create adventures. The card selection is good, I used about half the decks during the first couple of adventures.<br /><br />Everything in the game is well made except the cards. The edges of these were roughed up after the first game. They are cheap cardboard stock and not as well made as what most other game manufacturers use which are more like playing cards.<br /><br />Bottom line: great single or multi-player co-operative board game with good replay value for 1 to 5 players
B004JPJHME|5.0|The topic is serious and scary, but the movie is so funny.  Johnny Depp is great.  I would and have recommend the movie to all of my friends and family.

0439023483|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is by far one of the best books I have ever read in my life thus far (Harry Potter will always have first place in my heart.) We're introduced to one of the most awesome heroines of all time; (and this is from a guy's perspective) Katniss Freakin' Everdeen. She's an intriguing character: she loves her little sister, Prim, she hunts in the woods with since-childhood buddy Gale Hawthorne, and she seems to go against all of the Capitol's rules. For example, hunting is punishable by death, as is simply leaving District Twelve. See, a world disaster of some sort occurred, and civilization crumbled. The water rose, and humans fought over what land was left causing nuclear warfare. After this war, The United States, presumably, was replaced by the country of Panem, consisting of an extremely wealthy Capitol and thirteen far poorer districts. The districts rebelled and lost. The Capitol destroyed District 13 with nuclear bombs and instituted \\"The Hunger Games\\", an annual competition where two \\"tributes\\", a boy and a girl from each district between the ages of twelve and eighteen, are taken to the capitol to fight to the death in an outdoor arena. The arena can be anywhere, from a frozen wasteland to a never-ending desert. On reaping day, the day on which the two tributes are selected, Madge, the Mayor's daughter and longtime friend of Katniss, gives her the mockingjay pin, which becomes Katniss's symbol. They all go to the square, and Katniss's little sister, Prim, is reaped. Katniss fights against the Peacekeepers and volunteers to take her beloved sister's place, the ultimate sacrifice, since twenty four tributes come in and only one comes out. The male tribute turns out to be Peeta Mellark, who gave a loaf of bread to Katniss when she and her family was starving, at the cost of him being beaten by his mother when they were younger. From that point they meet Effie Trinket, an eccentric lady from the capitol whose job is to represent District 12, and Haymitch Abernathy, a drunken fool who somehow won the Hunger Games earlier, and is in charge of keeping Katniss and Peeta alive in the arena. They go to the capitol and meet Cinna, their stylist, who makes Katniss become \\"The Girl on Fire\\", a title that is carried throughout the remainder of the series. They are beautified by a team of freakish people with their skin dyed, their hair in rediculous styles and the like, who actually become quite lovable and make for some of the only funny moments in the book. Katniss, Peeta, and the other twenty two tributes get three days to train for the arena, and then they are sent off.   \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a thought provoking, brutal, and very dark story. It makes you think whether something like this could ever happen in real life, and honestly, it isn't all that far-fetched. It's already happened, hasn't it? Think about the terrifying cruelties done to citizens in the arenas of ancient Rome, like the Colosseum. People were tortured and brutally murdered for the entertainment of the rich, messing about with their own hair and clothing and other luxuries. We watch television programs like \\"Survivor\\" and such where we see people, real people, become miserable. Then there's the possibility of global warming, which could melt the icecaps causing the water to rise, just like in the books. Democrats throw dirt at Republicans, and Republicans throw dirt at Democrats. Who knows what will happen? Could the government, one day, control out children one day? Because if we kill our children, who's left? I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, except it's not recommended for younger children. I'd say the reader should be twelve at least, if not older. This is anything but a kid's book. There are gory, bloody deaths and some terribly heart-breaking scenarios. I read this book in a single day, because honestly, it's torture in and of itself to put it down, especially when she gets into the arena. As a sidenote, I recommend you buy the other two books in the series, although this one is still my favorite after reading it for the first time two years ago. Catching Fire's first half drags a bit, but the second half makes up for it. Mockingjay has a much different tone, but it's still just as thrilling as the other two. Overall, I'd say this is a must-read series. If you want action, romance, torture, death, emotion, suspense, and a book that really makes you think, this is the book for you.
B0055SWM08|5.0|entertaining and challenging...addictive! one of my &quot;go to&quot; games. well worth the buck. I will definitely buy the next game in the SERIES!
B0067AC5KA|2.0|Could not get into this book.  Droned on way too much. Couldnt even finish it. So hard to try to get into a book when it does not hold your interest.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Amazing art design with ingenious puzzles and a perfectly fitting soundtrack. How much more has to be said? Just get it.
B006R6ZP6U|5.0|WATCH THIS MOVIE!! this movie is phenomenal!!!! although still not the biggest matt damon fan, heath ledger really makes you falll in love with his quirky innocence through out the whole move. i love fairy tales and this....this is just brilliant.

B000068QKT|5.0|Just wanted to own a copy on DVD! Wonderful movie for this romantic movie lover. I didn't really realize what I was ordering would be a special edition that had a separate disc with all sorts of extras. Good price for what I actually got.

B0063IH60K|4.0|if u don't care about flashey cards or trick moves this app is perfect. its easy to use and easy to change settings.
0307891402|4.0|this guide was a great help. it was really helpful at to build information about the game and different game styles or play types that are abnormal but sound like a lot of fun.  If you are already well into the game it really will not be very helpful. but for someone just starting out it is a book of great information.  the quests are pretty detailed if you need help with any of them, but if you just activate it in the game's quest log, the game will tell you where to go.  but for me the book was worth the Amazon price but its not worth the full price you could end up paying.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some really fun games to pass the time some are really hard and some super easy the only down side is you gotta earn more games but I still really enjoy it.

0064430227|5.0|I loved this book as a child and ran across my 1955 copy while de-cluttering my library.  Of course I kept the original and immediately ordered 5 copies from Amazon to give to  all the small children I know.  It is also a great gift idea for any grandparents you may know.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I must say that I was apprehensive going on and I only got it because it was free, but this turned out to be a very good story.  The plot as a whole was unpredictable with several twists.  Perhaps my favorite aspect was how I felt like I really knew the characters.  Even though I finished the book I still find myself thinking about them.  Perhaps my only complaint was that some parts seemed ALMOST too sappy.  All in all it was a very good book that I highly recommend.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Excellent quality and live performances of her hit songs along with great songs inspired by new musical influences...  Get this if you think you like Adele, she's the best vocalist in some time and should be around for a long time...
B006QKJZMW|1.0|All I have to say is they really cheezed this movie out to the max!!!!  Maybe go back and take notes on Hostel 11 which I thought was excellent!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Most of the games are fun to play but some of the controls are really terrible.  Moving a character is way to slow and just doesn't follow as as it should!  I can not get the snake or the singing man to move hardly at all therefore I am stuck on the second level of games!  I gave it a three but would give it more if I could get the objects to move faster!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|My wife and I have been fans of the musical theater for many years with Andrew Lloyd Weber productions among our favorites..... until we saw and heard Les Miz (2010 production with Alfie Boe et al). The 2010 presentation so far surpassed anything we had seen before that there is hardly any basis for comparison. Everything about this musical was outstanding but the standout, clearly, was Alfie Boe. This man has the best voice I have ever heard and his performance as Valjean (gestures, movements, expressions, etc.) was top notch, better than any predecessor I've seen.  I could go on and on,e.g., the man who played Javert was perfect for that role, but suffice it to say that I don't expect to see a musical better than this if I live another 70 years.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Great movie. The story is good, and so is the 3D. Some parts you want to watch over again because of the 3D. And I loved his little helpers, whatever they were. This is one of the few movies I am glad I own, as opposed to renting............Phil
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I had a fun time playing the games but I had a hard time figuring out how this apt worked.
B005D0RDKW|4.0|In my opinion Rush is the greatest power trio ever. I have seen them live numerous times and they never disappoint. This new offering is great. Just hearing all of Moving Pictures is worth the price.  The blu-ray transfer is good but not perfect. The show starts off a little slow, the band has some tempo issues, and one of the cameras used on Geddy is not as sharp as the other. I don't remember what song it is but you notice Alex talking to Neil about the tempo being too fast or slow and you clearly see Neil say \\"I know\\". The surround and stereo mixes are very good. Great set-list and the comical videos are a bonus. The video editing at times is too abrupt for my tastes and some of the overhead shots of Neil are out of sync. Also, do we really need to see Neil's feet? Not much on bonus material but how often do you watch bonus stuff anyway?  For me, I still like Rio the best. Yes the sound was not as good but the band was on fire and Geddy's voice held up better. Overall, this is a must for any Rush fan and I hope they continue to rock out as long as they can.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I thought this was one of the best love stories that I've seen on film!  It wasn't sensationalized; it developed along a natural consequence of two boys developing a love for each other that transcended the norms of the social environment. The fault I find with it is the gaps in the storyline It goes from the suspicions of their parents, re: their bonding to each other, to their denouement after their biological parents die. There is nothing known about their life from preadolescents to mature men! We don[t find out if they explored their sexuality, as teenagers (apparently not) and know nothing of their ambitions in life whether or not they pursue their careers (only made known, in Francisco's case, near the end of the movie) and what occupations are they in (if any--again only learn that Francisco is a doctor--but near the end) Is Tomas in a career (it seems he is not), so we must assume Francisco is the 'provider'?  Then in the final scene (spoiler!) when Francisco surprises Tomas by visiting him in Russia, the enthusiasm is all Francisco and the reponse of Tomas is almost tentative (at first).  As a gay person, I can't imagine Tomas not having a fling with a kindred spirit while over there!  They are both at an age when their hormones are raging nand both being HOT hunks (especially, Tomas),  the possibility of him (Tomas) being celebrate while in training, to me, is unreal! Therefore, I think the surprised and somewhat tepid response of Tomas was a hint he might have an ongoing fling with a fellow athlete.  But, unfortunately, this is the storyline of the screenwriter of this film and it is his take on their relationship, and what he wanted to explore is what we are left with!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|JJ Abrams is a force to be reckoned with. Based on his work on Alias, Tom Cruise handpicked him to direct Mission Impossible 3. Getting his start with Taking Care of Business, he went on to write Regarding Henry, Gone Fishin', Armageddon, and Joy Ride before going on to create his first TV series Felicity. Taking his pedigree to another level he opted to create the series Alias, and because the studio was so please with the results they asked Abrams for a show they could practically tag: Survivor/Castaway: The Series. They had worked with another writer, and they didn't care for what he came up with, so with Abrams success they asked him.  To give Abrams all the credit for Lost isn't really fair. Abrams brought in Damon Lindeloff and they went to work creating something of a long term plan and a pilot. In the end, Abrams wouldn't have had anything to do with the show beyond the season 3 premiere of the show. Early on Carlton Cuse came on as show runner, taking Abrams place. Lindeloff and Cuse still worked with the template that Lindeloff and Abrams set and that template created a global zeitgeist. Until the end of the series, Lost remained a highly watched show and a critical darling.  I have to be honest and say that I didn't jump on to the Lost train until late into the show's run. After the 5th season a good friend of mine lent me all five seasons to help me catch up. Needless to say I was hooked from the start. The pilot episode alone was made for $10-14 million (which happened to get ABC exec Lloyd Braun sacked), when most pilots are made for $4 million. If it weren't for that the story of the characters would have hooked me instantly. In all honesty, that's what kept me coming back and what satisfied me in the end.  Lost gets a lot of recognition for its mythology, but Lost remains brilliant because it is rooted in humanity. Through every Sci-Fi, fantasy, and religious twist of the series, there are always the characters that help the audience to ground itself. The brilliant performance of Matthew Fox (who plays Jack Shepherd), Josh Holloway (James Sawyer), Jorge Garcia (Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes), and Evangeline Lilly (Kate Austen) among others help you to connect to each of these characters and follow them through the series no matter what they face. In a series that is full of mythology that can seem `otherworldly', that is very important.  As much as Lost is a human story it is also mired in aforementioned mythology. While season one is almost practically straightforward with the plight of the passengers of Oceanic 815, even season two doesn't deviate too far from the path of season one, we as an audience begin to see the cracks in the lining. This isn't meant to be a bad statement it's just that Lost jumps far beyond the typical TV show. The first couple of seasons are strictly drama before the latter four seasons delve into fantasy, Sci-Fi, and even religion. With its religious tones, Lost isn't overbearing, nor is it sacrilegious. You can tell that the writers have taken religious idealism seriously and they don't opt to trivialize it or pick a particular religious affiliation to align the show with.  A lot of people were disenchanted by the last season of the show, feeling that the show runners never really had a plan for the show and came up with the least satisfying ending they could think of. I'm not part of this group. Lindeloff and Cuse have admitted that they had a broad outline that allowed them to expand on elements of the Lost-verse through time; also they were pressured to expand the series beyond their initial intentions. Even with those admissions though, the ending they came up with I found extremely satisfying for the purpose of tying up the loose strings where the characters are concerned. While they might not have tied up all the strings of the mysteries of Lost mythology, I feel that doing so was unnecessary for what the series was initially going for, which was a human story.  5/5  Be sure to check out: [[ASIN:B006K7WZ7S Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work]]!

B003E48AYC|3.0|Adaptations can be difficult to pull off. Even if you're not adapting a work that is particularly well known among the masses you have to look at how the source material speaks to you and what you want to say to the audience with your film. Beyond that you have to consider what you possibly might need to change in your adaptation to make the source more cinematically viable. If you're working on a project that is ingrained in the public consciousness, or adapted previously into a universally adored film, then the line you walk can feel like the green mile.   Tim Burton has had a lot of experience with film adaptations, making massive hits with Batman, Batman Returns, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which is not a remake, but that's a discussion for another blog post). He's also at times shown a capacity for not really understanding the source material. For his adaptation of Alice in Wonderland for Disney Burton said, \\"It's a funny project. The story is obviously a classic with iconic images and ideas and thoughts. But with all the movie versions, well, I've just never seen one that really had any impact to me. It's always just a series of weird events. Every character is strange and she's just kind of wandering through all of the encounters as just a sort of observer,\\" but such observations ignore that this was Lewis Carroll's intention in his writing. In the end though, Burton's film became only the sixth film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide.  Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is 19 years old and on the verge of getting engaged to a man she doesn't love. But when she sees a white rabbit she feels compelled to follow it down the rabbit hole (so to speak). When she arrives in Wonderland, a place that she has been to before but doesn't remember, she's confronted by various creatures telling her that she's the wrong Alice. Soon she learns that on the fateful Frabjous Day she is supposed to become the champion of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and slay the Jabberwocky to restore the kingdom from the clutches of the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).  Tim Burton has a tendency to view the world through dark shades. If Armani made a pair of gothic sunglasses they would belong to Burton. For a film like Alice and Wonderland which is known for its bright Day-Glo colors he might not seem like the right choice to direct, but in the end his style works well for his interpretation of the source material. You still have the bright colors and Burton retains some of the tones of outrageous zaniness that were present in the Carroll stories and in previous incarnations of the tale.  A relative newcomer to the Hollywood stage, Wasikowska is the biggest acting surprise of the movie. She adds a certain gravitas that grounds the flick when it could have easily been lost in its excesses, and it could serve Wasikowska far beyond films of this nature. Helena Bonham Carter (whose casting in Burton films has been blamed on nepotism) steals every scene that she's in. She's typically brilliant and the choice to not hold back in this particular performance allows her to reign as an evil queen should. I must make a note here on Johnny Depp who more than a few people have made a note that he seems to be unable to properly act anymore without donning crazy makeup and disguises. Here I feel that the Mad Hatter he plays was taken in a hopelessly dark direction that should have been lightened up quite a bit more. Although watching the film I did look forward to his \\"Scottish\\" freak outs.  There's a certain detachment from the material of the movie though. I don't really feel that Burton actually invested much of himself into this flick the way he did with, say, Nightmare on Elm Street or Ed Wood. His view of the world here, that imagination builds confidence, feels generic at the end of the day as if he were a hired hand who felt the need to put his stamp on the film out of necessity rather than artistically. The animation borders on ironic,which in 2D works quite well, but didn't hold up as well in the initial 3D viewing. Also, I felt the end was compromised slightly by the Mad Hatter's Futterwacken which seemed a bit too modern styled to fit with the rest of the narrative. In the end it just ended up being corny.  Critically, this turned out to be Burton's third least enjoyed films among critics. (Planet of the Apes being his critical worst and Mars Attacks! which I think is underrated, not being far behind.) That's interesting considering Tim Burton only has three films that are considered by Rotten Tomatoes to be rotten. In my humble but honest opinion this is far from Burton's best film, but it's also not that close to being his worst film. I recommend you give it a try if you haven't already. It's a fun flick even if it isn't quite as perfect as I, or even some of you, wanted it to be.  3.5/5  Be sure to check out: [[ASIN:B006K7WZ7S Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work]]!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been looking for something simple to use in order to be able to access my desktop while away from home, and this app has worked great so far. I can now get stuff done and transfer files without having to be tied to my desk.

I'm sure there is a down side, but haven't found it in the last eight hours of use.
B004RE29PO|5.0|It's become common practice in Hollywood to create sequels/prequels/remakes of long dead in Hollywood for the past decade or more raising the ire of moviegoers all over America, and the world. A lot of cinema goers view this as a fairly new money making trend that the studios use to make money from audiences through brand name recognition. It's often forgotten that Alfred Hitchcock remade his own film The Man Who Knew Too Much, and Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 The Ten Commandments was a remake of his 1923 The Ten Commandments. Even more egregious in some viewer's eyes is when a sequel to a film gets green-lit years after the fact. Such was the case though with James Cameron's sequel to Alien, simply called Aliens.  While in preproduction on The Terminator, James Cameron turned in his initial treatment for Alien II to Fox in 1983. Initially, the executives liked the treatment, but then a regime change at the studio occurred, and the new management felt that Alien wasn't profitable enough to warrant a sequel. Undeterred, and free due to Arnold Schwarzenegger having to delay filming due to commitments to Conan the Destroyer, Cameron went into a self-imposed exile to further flesh out his treatment for Alien II. The execs were impressed with his treatment to grant him a green light on the condition that The Terminator did well in theaters. The rest, as they say, was history.  For 57 years the Nostromo has wandered aimlessly through space; its sole survivor, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) still held in stasis. Ripley is nursed back to health, and due to perceived negligence on her part she is stripped of space flight license. Furthermore she learns that a colony has settled LV-426, the planet her crew came across the derelict space craft harboring the alien that killed her crew. When her employers, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, find that they are unable to contact the colonists on LV-426, they request Ripley to accompany Representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and a platoon of Colonial Marines to determine the cause of the radio silence.  Wisely, James Cameron opted not to follow the same format as his predecessor. As Cameron put it he wanted to focus \\"...more on terror, less on horror\\". As a result, his entry into the Alien franchise ramps up the action. Where the first film took place on a space ship and the acidity of the creature's blood rendered shooting at the alien an unwise choice, all-out war on the surface of a planet that has been terraformed for human survival is not out of the question. With that in mind the bullets and explosions rain freely down on the creatures of Aliens pumping an action thrill into the proceedings.  That's not to say that Cameron's film is simply a mindless action flick. Cameron chose to draw parallels between his film and the Vietnam War by looking at the idea of a seemingly superior and far more technologically advanced force fighting an adversary that is far more primitive and finding themselves out of their league. We see this in the cockiness of the Colonial Marines, but finding themselves utterly decimated by the unarmed but stealthy aliens. Also Cameron finds an emotional center in the relationship between Ripley and Newt (Carrie Henn). Having been missing for 57 years, Ripley finds out upon return to earth that her daughter has died. In Newt she finds a young girl whose family has been killed by the creature that needs nurturing. In a way they need one another and their relationship offers the emotional core of the film.  For Aliens Weaver had nicknamed Ellen Ripley \\"Rambolina\\" due to the fact that the film was heavy on action, and here she became more of an action star as opposed to Alien. Ever the consummate actress though, rather than using that as a reason to take it easy on her duties as a thespian she opted to use Henry V and classical Chinese literature with women warriors as a template for her performance as Ripley. Opposing her this time is Paul Reiser, who I never would have expected in such a role, but he's sufficiently sleazy as the Corporation representative who must at once ease his way onto Ripley's good side by must ultimately do whatever works best in the Corporation's favor.  While many people take sides in determining which is better, Alien or Aliens, I find such an argument for either film moot. While they may follow a timeline and contain the same characters they are still totally different films. With that they truly are masterworks that demonstrate how to properly make a film of their respective genres.  5/5  Be sure to check out: [[ASIN:B006K7WZ7S Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work]]!
B003L77G8I|5.0|Bones is a show that only gets better and season six did not disappoint!! Got it for under 20 dollars and it arrived with in a week of purchase in perfect condition!!
B004RE29WW|3.0|Vincent Ward was the fourth screenwriter/director to grace the Alien³ screenplay with his presence. All previous drafts of the screenplay had been scrapped due to producers or studio execs not being happy with the concepts. Ward's screenplay found Aliens' Sulaco spaceship crashing on an archaic wooden planetoid occupied by refugee monks. Once the creature stowed away on the Sulaco begins to make his presence known the monks believe that the titular alien is Satan itself, and Ripley is a test of their faith and purity. As a result they lock Ripley up in a sewer and ignore her warnings and advice on how to deal with the alien.  The thing that seems to stand out for most people who have read the screenplay and who have seen the concept art is just how astonishing it would have been once it had been pulled off. Sigourney Weaver called Ward's concept, \\"...very original and arresting.\\" Empire magazine said of the concept that it was \\"...undeniably attractive - it would have been visually arresting and at the very least, could have made for some astonishing action sequences.\\" David Hughes, a former journalist for Time, included Ward's version of Alien³ in his book The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made. Ward ended up leaving the project over disagreements with the producers.  After leaving LV-426, Sulaco's emergency sensors detect a fire on board the Sulaco and jettison an escape pod occupied by Ellen Ripley, Corporal Hicks, Newt, and the remains of Bishop. The escape pod lands on Fiorina 161, a prison planet occupied by all male inmates imprisoned for histories of sexual and physical violence. When Ripley is awakened by prison doctor Clemens (Charles Dance) she finds out that both Hicks and Newt have been found dead. Worried she asks Clemens to help with an autopsy on Newt to determine her cause of death despite prison warden Harold Andrews' (Brian Glover) protests. It is determined that Newt died of natural causes, but that doesn't mean that the alien hasn't found a different way to invade the planet.  Alien³ is a master-class in how not to make a film. After Ward walked away from the project, producers Walter Hill (who was one of the first choices to direct Alien, but gave it to Ridley Scott instead) and David Giler began the uneasy task of tidying up the script. They were given final say on the script by Weaver's contract, as Weaver felt that Ripley was a hard character to write and apart from James Cameron they were the only ones who could her correctly. With Fox ready to begin production with or without a finished script, they couldn't waste time hiring a new screenwriter or even coming up with an original concept. Instead they incorporated elements from each of the screenplays that had been turned down.  The end result is a hackneyed mess that suffers from too many cooks in the kitchen. A further egregious error in the development stage was made in killing off Hicks and Newt. The lack of an emotional core that could have easily been dealt with through the bond of Ripley and those to characters can be felt throughout the flick, what's left is a cold emotionless shell. While I would argue that this film isn't the utter and complete disaster than many have made it to be, the lack of anything with which the audience can connect to makes it seem much worse than it is. In the end, though, you can see flourishes of the director that David Fincher would become, even if the studio did try to suppress his vision by editing the film without his approval.  I can't say that I really recommend this film. If you haven't seen it the only real reason to watch it is because you're a huge fan of the franchise and have to watch all of the films in the franchise, you're a cinephile who must see it to fulfill your cinematic urges, or you're a huge David Fincher fan who wants to see where his cinematic journey started. I don't think this movie is as bad as it could have been, but it still could have been much better. Coming after the brilliance that was Alien and Aliens I would say it needed to be much better.  2.5/5  Be sure to check out: [[ASIN:B006K7WZ7S Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work]]!
1455510319|4.0|Told in the first person. Michael Connelly's latest Mickey Haller novel THE FIFTH WITNESS is a treat for lovers of courtroom drama and anyone familiar with the mortgage foreclosure fiasco and the flagging economy.  Like everything else in the country the criminal law business is on the ropes and Mickey (ever the survivor) has taken his practice in a new direction - helping people caught in the mortgage crunch fend off the banks by seeking loopholes in contract transfer documents.<br /><br />Mickey's new endeavor is humming along and he's cranking out clients at five grand a pop when one of his customers, an unemployed single mother and protest group founder named Lisa Trammel is arrested for murdering the banker responsible for her foreclosure problems, thereby returning Mickey to the criminal law business.  Lisa insists she is innocent of the deed but all the evidence points to her as the perpetrator.  Mickey returns to the criminal defense side of his business and takes on the case of the woman who turns out to be \\"the client from hell\\".<br /><br />Quite the opposite of the usual picture of the swaggering machismo protagonist prevalent in most books of this type, Connelly's Haller vacillates between torch carrying ex-husband and devoted father to cynical, anything for a buck mouthpiece willing to exploit the legal system. Adding to the intrigue are some pretty interesting characters ranging from a B-movie Hollywood producer trying to put together a deal that will \\"make him\\", to organized crime types, and biker gang ex-clients to Mickey's new young associate (a woman with scruples no less) and his trusty old office staff who continue to add their expertise to the mix.<br /><br />The bulk of the story has to do with the intricacies of Mickey's building a defense strategy (or in Mickey's words \\"gaming the system\\") and the courtroom scenes make for great reading as he attempts to stay one step ahead of the prosecution..... and his client.<br /><br />Connelly is one of my favorite authors.  Some of his offerings are better than others but for the most part his books are well paced, the dialogue is snappy, the plots are filled with great twists and the overall reading experience is as satisfying as a hot fudge sundae.  The great thing is that unlike those hot fudge sundaes Connelly's books are non fattening.ings are better than others but for the most part his books are well paced, the dialogue is snappy, the plots are filled with great twists and the overall reading experience is as satisfying as a hot fudge sundae.

B0036EH3UC|5.0|Science Fiction is my favorite genre. I love the genre because unlike a lot of other genres it's able to speak to the world's problems while giving us awesome gadgets! Fantasy can try, but it's not quite the same. Science Fiction often has major scale, amplifying our own circumstances in a futuristic age allows us to distance ourselves from the action on screen but recognize the similarities within.  Of course a lot of Science Fiction these days throws out the subtext in favor of popcorn flavoring. While I'll watch some Sci-Fi that lacks subtext, it's always better when it means something. Battlestar Galactica automatically had subtext built into its core. The Cylons, man-made machines who have gained awareness believe in one god, and they are trying to eradicate the polytheistic humans. Ah, yes, proselytizing starts off what becomes many instances of grand subtext.  The thing about Battlestar is that it doesn't prize one side over the other, recommending in the end that each side come to grips with the other; learn to live with one another. It touched on a lot of other issues we find prevalent in the modern world though: genocide, terrorism, the role of the military, diplomacy, etc. It did all of this in such a way that it never felt preachy nor did it particularly ever really choose one side over the other in certain cases, it just presented the options. In others it opened up about the atrocities, reflecting a light back at us showing society as it is, warts and all.  The writing on the series was always brilliant, and as cheesy as using words like \\"frak\\" to replace modern day curse words may have sounded at first the replacement curses feel organic and are used to great effect. The tension throughout most of the series is palpable, and the writers and creators walk a fine line between sci-fi and fantasy, but they do it masterfully. Special effects on this series bear out the brilliance of the writing, even on a SyFy budget the series looks amazing for an epic space-set series.  Battlestar also has an amazing cast that unfortunately always seemed to get looked over when it came time for the Emmy's. Mary McDonnell does a spectacular job as the Secretary of Education who recently found out she has cancer and is thrust into the position of President when everyone else in the government is killed. Edward James Olmos is perfection as a nearly retired General Adama who finds himself back in action after a massive Cylon attack. For my money, though, Katee Sackhoff tops the cast as the tortured, reckless, and brilliant pilot Starbuck. She hits every note of her nearly bipolar character with utter passion and conviction.  Unlike many I had no qualms with the way the series ended. Many felt that it copped out in its ending, but I felt that it greatly expressed many themes of the series. In the end the humans feel as though they're finally able to start over, but then there's a moment that gives us all a sense that this happened before and it will all happen again. There's a sense in there that if we do not learn our past, do not pass down what we see now, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. They did this with a bit of fantasy play, and not all of the questions are answered in the end which turned off many viewers, but in the real world not all questions are answered.  Battlestar Galactica lands on my top 10 list for these reasons, and because in the end it's still a story about people trying to survive. All of this from a show that is also a remake. I also appreciate the fact that the producers of the show did this on their own terms. While the show was still popular and a critical darling they opted to end the series after four seasons, something that's unheard of in American TV that prides itself on profitability over creativity.  5/5  Be sure to check out: [[ASIN:B006K7WZ7S Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work]]!!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a terrific game. Once you start playing you won't get much else done. Nice graphics, enjoyable gameplay. Worth the price.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Superman has had a tough history leaping off the page onto the big screen and onto the small screen. On top of that small screen adaptations of comic book characters, as well as attempts to create shows in comic book molds, haven't been very successful in recent years. Shows like Birds of Prey, Heroes, The Cape, Aquaman, No Ordinary Family, and Wonder Woman all suffered a grisly fate by the ax of the networks. The fact that Smallville lasted for ten seasons in an era of failing television comic book adaptations is quite surprising.  It's even more surprising considering most filmmakers working on the previous Superman movie wanted to shut down production on Smallville. This would have been the fate of Smallville if Tim Burton or McG had their way, and even JJ Abrams was working on a screenplay that rebooted the series and Tom Welling was one of the top choices to take the big screen role. In the end, though, Bryan Singer was cast and allowed the show to remain on the air.  This is one of those shows that I remember the first episode I watched. I originally wasn't going to watch the show. The WB, as it was at that time before changing to the CW, was full of preteen and teen melodrama. I didn't expect this to be any different, as a matter of fact I thought it was going to irreverent to the source, so I never tuned in. Then one day when nothing else was on I caught a season 3 episode called \\"Velocity\\". It was with that episode that my perception of Smallville changed.  While it has its moments of teen angst (\\"Velocity\\" itself deals with teenage rebellion) and romance, it does try to remain faithful to the comics. It's even become revered by comic's artists who have added a few of the characters created for the show to the comic's lexicon, and a few writers have even shown up to pen episodes such as Geoff Johns. Even when hitting the moments of teen angst and romance the choice of using a young Clark coming to grips with who he is makes since.  What really caught me with Smallville, though, was the handling of the mythology; in this aspect the 2nd and 3rd seasons remain my favorites. The show delicately handled the growth and development of Clark's powers (in an interesting use of metaphor, \\"Heat\\" sees Clark developing his legendary heat vision at the sight of a beautiful woman). It was the handling of Clark and Lex Luthor's relationship that I found really interesting though.  They're relationship starts in the show when Lex drives his Porsche over the edge of a bridge narrowly missing Clark. Clark dives in after him, rips the car open, and saves Lex from drowning. What comes of that is an uneasy friendship. Lex suspects Clark of being more than a farm boy from Kansas and Clark constantly has to cover up his powers. Eventually this turns into a game of suspicions and betrayal before finally diving headlong into abject hatred.  All of this worked because the casting was impeccable. Tom Welling grew as an actor throughout the series, taking the helm to direct a few episodes. He also had that quality that embodies the qualities of the character we've grown to affectionately call \\"the big blue boy scout.\\" Michael Rosenbaum oozes duplicity as Lex, making you question his every move and motive. In my opinion, even over Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey, Rosenbaum has portrayed the best version of Lex Luthor to hit the small or big screen.  Unfortunately, after the third season, the producers felt things had gotten too dark and felt the show needed to lighten up a bit. The result was that the fourth season became easily the weakest season in the series taking more cues from Charmed than the Superman canon. Luckily, they bounced back in the fifth season and the show remained strong for the rest of its run (although I'm sure I won't get any arguments when I say that the season 8 finale was quite anticlimactic).  5/5  Be sure to check out: [[ASIN:B006K7WZ7S Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work]]!

1451648537|5.0|It seems like the few bad reviews here are from people expecting something other than a biography, maybe something more techy, or possibly someone else's biography more focused on his personal life. But Apple was the center of Job's life and Walter Isaacson is a biographer not a tech writer. So you should expect a biography of the man who brought Apple to its current pinnacle over the past 15 years. Expect a lot about the gadgets Steve helped to invent, with his personal life weaving in and out of that. Fortunately, that's exactly what I was looking for and its exactly what I got. The story of Steve Jobs is truly inspiring. He took big risks in his life and reaped bigger payoffs with everything from his life at Apple, NeXT and Pixar to his personal life. It's truly a shame we didn't have him for longer. I'd rather have waited a couple of decades more for this book. I didn't want it to end for two reasons- 1. it inspired me and I enjoyed reading every page, 2. I knew it had to end because Steve died. An unavoidable side effect of the book- it's probably best testimony Apple could ever have for its products. Jobs put his heart and soul into everything Apple makes and it shows. This is the story of how he did that and why.

Sean Bean was perfect for his role as Ned Stark however that is \\"short lived\\" He was one of the main reasons I watched...oh well.  It seems like every episode is full of what I call \\"fluff\\" up until the very end. It's like the writers were thinking hmmm, let's see how much we can shock people with gay and taboo sex scenes all mixed with violence and gore and then during the last 5 minutes of the show let's make something actually happen that goes with the story line. It's almost like you don't even have to watch the first 45 minutes because it DIDN'T GET ANYWHERE !!! No Thanks...TRUE BLOOD has spoiled me !<br /><br />01/12/2013  Update for all who commented on MY comment  - NO , I DID NOT READ THE BOOKS AND NEVER HEARD OF THIS UNTIL IT CAME ON HBO.My comment above was based on the DVD of the TV series Amazon is selling. Geez  Trust me ...I'M NOT A PRUDE AND I CONSIDER MYSELF A VERY OPEN MINDED PERSON... but I just wanted an actual quality story for each episode. I don't mind sex in a premium cable show every now and then but it was very frustrating that the most important things to happen in each episode took place in the last 5-10 minutes. I enjoy more fantasy supernatural type stuff which is what I thought this show was going to be when HBO was promoting it therefore my expectations were high. Ha!  I'll admit ...SEAN BEAN was a major reason I wanted to watch. I grew to love the wolves, Ned Starks and his bastard son John but they didn't show enough of these characters to keep me 100% interested in being a hugh fan of this show. ( ;  It's definitely not my favorite show but if there's nothing else on worth watching we'll put this on. I've seen both season 1 and season 2.<br /><br />It was just my observation people of what I viewed. Get over it.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|Love this cover - holds my fire really well. I went to a few different stores shopping around for a cover/sleeve and this one seemed the most protective as far as cases go. I was worried that the sleeve wouldn't provide as much protection, but acted more as a storage option. I did notice that the case seemed to have a magnet closure when I initially opened it to place my kindle, but of course that closure becomes obsolete once the kindle is in place. It also seemed a bit stiff, as if it wouldn't close all the way. But like another review, after a few days the leather softened a bit and now it closes just fine.  I don't think the elastic will give out, seeing as I don't plan on removing and replacing the kindle once I have placed it in there.  They are a tight fit, but that's what I want... to make sure my kindle doesn't move or budge or fall out of the case.  ((Also, my hubby did install a zagg screen protector on the kindle - and it did not affect the fit or the security of the rubberized elastic holdings))

0307272702|5.0|If you are a skeptic of low-carb \\"Atkins\\" diets, you owe it to yourself to read Gary's book.  He discusses what makes us fat and backs it up with plenty of evidence.  The bottom line: carbohydrates (starches and sugars) drive insulin; insulin drives fat storage.  It's not about the calories.  Since adopting a high fat, moderate protein, no-starch / sugar diet, I dropped 30 lbs of fat in less than 90 days and feel great.

B005V2EVBQ|2.0|The pros:  Lightweight  The cons:  Flimsy stand function - should have some sort of clip or a slightly deeper grove to hold the folded cover/stand in place.  I suspect the elastic strap will break within 6-8 months, even with careful handling.  If you're holding the Kindle, with cover open and held open with the slim elastic, the unit is too \\"slick\\" in your hands.  Needs another strap (like the one on some leather Marware Kindle Fire covers) to slip your fingers through so that you have a solid grip on the Kindle.  A tad pricey (even at $29.95) for what you get.  Come on Marware, you can do better than this!
0061122416|4.0|A little treasure...I can't believe this book had escaped my eyes all these years. Very simple in style and form, The Alchemist hammers home the power of patience, persistence, and positive thinking. It is a bit overwhelming and preachy at times, particularly in the mid-section, and the journey from Al Faiyum to the Pyramids seems to take forever. It was heartwarming to see the character evolve from a simple shepherd to a wise young man that boldly risked his life to not only follow his dreams, but also conquer his inner demons. Thank you, Paulo Coelho. The Alchemist makes a great read.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app does exactly what it says it does for my Fire.  Set up was easy and I do not have to worry about what may happen as they play. My favorite feature is the auto relaunch. That is a life saver and tantrum saver. Thank you for this app!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its an amazing app that I'm so glad exists on many platforms that sync. its very easy to use with many Bible options. unbelievable its free. big blessing!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is my first e-reader Bible. I have really enjoyed using it on my Kindle Fire. I am currently doing two of the included studites and a word study. I find it easy to use and very practical.

B0050KU3IY|5.0|When I first saw there was a sequel to 'something borrowed' I was so excited, I LOVED the first book. But as I read through the description I was disappointed, because it was from the view of Darcy, who of course in the first book I didn't like. But I decided that I would try it anyway, and I'm so glad I did! I loved this book so much, just as much as the first one. I was so happy with the ending, and how Darcy turned out, I just couldn't put this book down. BUY THIS BOOK.  Emily Giffin, I love your books.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Haven't gone beyond home network but it works with old windows XP system running home automation. Easy to get it set up.
B001I82RVS|4.0|I bought the two-disc Blu-ray release of this movie and I was a little disappointed with the picture quality. I am watching it on a 32\\" LCD TV, and maybe I don't have my adjustments right but I think it could be better. The blu-ray comes with several extras; I haven't perused through them all yet, but there are several trailers. The audio options are for both English and Japanese, in both 2.0 and 5.1 digital sound. Not anything spectacular, but definitely not a bare-bones release either. The second disc, which contains a \\"short film\\" collection comes with several shorts, so no shortcomings there, but the picture quality is worse here. I can't say to stay away from it, but be careful.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, here goes: I never really was a big fan of the excessive gore and violence on film; I always found it distasteful and ridiculous. That being said, I loved this movie. The movie doesn't have much of a plot or character development, but the point of the film seemed that it was trying harder to be disgusting and bizarre than to be a great film. And it delivers rather well, in my opinion. The music, while nothing special, was at times quite eerie, and lent to the gruesome feeling of the movie.<br /><br />I've seen several complaints from uppity film snobs who believe that every movie in existence should be of nothing less than pristine quality to be enjoyed, and if otherwise, they have no business being made at all. Pfft. Then stay away from stuff like this. If it's a slap to your face when something like this comes on the market, you need to grow up. These movies aren't meant to win academy awards; they are meant to be bloody and gory and freakish, which they do quite well. Broaden your horizons; it'll be a lot easier to be entertained.<br /><br />I hope this review helps everybody; I was moderately happy with both the disc and the movie itself, and if you are capable of viewing films on levels other than \\"pure greatness or nothing,\\" you might just be happy with this one. Now, off to The Machine Girl...to The Machine Girl...
0307586901|5.0|Being a mother of three children brings me numerous opportunities to desire projects for them.  In this particular craft book of Martha Stewart, there are a variety that appear to be a wonderful choice to use with my girl and two boys.  In particular, as we are now past the Christmas and New Year holidays, I am enthralled with the presentations of Valentine's Day and spring creations!  As is typical of the style from the publisher, the projects, materials, and how-tos are presented clearly, with eye-catching photographs and a classy style all around.  It always inspires me to see a collection of things which are threaded together in themes-  there are several of such sets of projects to complete.  Be inspired and delighted with all the ideas in this book as my children and I are!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is good as far as variety in boredom, but there are other games i would rather play. I like that there are points and such,  but honestly there are other free games i play much more often.
B005N95JA4|5.0|Long time fan here, seen them maybe 40 times since 77.  There have been some disapointments through the time, but this is not one of them.  I knew some of the bonus tracks from bootlegs, thought they were OK, but when I first listened to the bonus tracks on here, I was amazed.  I kept thinking, wow, that was great, then the next song would come on and I was impressed even more.  The Great Lost Stones Album.  A bigger Bang is currently one of my favorite Stones releases.  If you are a fan of that, you will love this.  5 STARS
1451629184|4.0|Jaycee Dugard was eleven years old and on her way to school when her life was unexpectedly interrupted, stolen from her at the whim of an obsessive pedophile. She virtually disappeared from the face of her earth for eighteen long years. And when she finally re-emerged into the world once more, she had quite a tale to tell.  Jaycee's ordeal began in the summer of 1991. Only eleven, she had no real idea of the world, and what cruelties it held, and what perversions, until Phillip Garrido stole her and made her a part of his world. He kept her hostage in the farthest reaches of his back yard. The only other person who knew she was there was Phillip's wife Nancy.   It was a confusing world at first, and frightening. She didn't know why she was there, or what was expected of her. She soon found out. Phillip introduced her to sex, and used her for that purpose, despite the fact that she was only eleven years old. He told her that he was sick, and that by having sex with her, she was helping him not to hurt other young girls. His reasoning made no sense to her, and she wondered--why me?  Over the next eighteen years, she bore Garrido two daughters, both born in his back yard, and both delivered by himself and his wife. As the babies grew, a jealous Nancy assumed the role of mother and relegated Jaycee to that of sister.  Over the years, she had a series of cats, most of whom died, but she loved them as much as she could, for as long as she could. And she loved her babies as they grew, wondering if this would be the only world they'd ever know.  Jaycee Dugard's kidnapping and subsequent recovery some eighteen years later are well known news stories. At one time, there'd been speculation that Jaycee had fallen prey to the same man who'd kidnapped and killed Polly Klaas. Of course, that wasn't the case. Phillip Garrido was the madman who stole her life, and this is her story of what that life was, of how she dealt with what she was given, and how she survived. Above all, it'sa tale of survival.  Jaycee describes her days, her feelings, her occupations, and the things that happened to her. She explains to the best of her ability what occurred in this eighteen year old nightmare.   My first criticism of the book itself is that the editing is poor. The language much too formal. If done deliberately, it only serves to distance the reader from the subject, and prevents one from getting close to her. I didn't come away with any strong feelings for the woman she's become, other than to realize that she is a survivor. If the story is meant to be cathartic, I think it fails in that respect too, as I feel no emotions spilling onto the pages, rather an almost clinical detachment. Perhaps that was deliberate on the part of the author and her editor, but it serves to distance one from the story, in my estimation.  Which isn't to say that it was poorly written, it wasn't. However, I didn't come away with the feel for her that I had hoped to find. Her ordeal was horrible. The only good things to come from it were here daughters. Luckily, she is only 29 years old and has the rest of her life to move on and get past it. Hopefully she will. This book is an interesting read, despite the flaws I've picked out. It's not a waste of time, and leaves one with the hopes that Phillip Garrido will suffer in prison for a long time to come for what he did to that young girl.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|All the other reviews are absolutely correct.   -The video annoyingly stays on everyone else more than her. I like her because it feels like she's sitting across from me on the couch comparing old lovers but I don't care about the random concertgoers. Even the behind the scenes video is mostly other people talking about the concert.   -She does use salty language that you might not want your children to hear. But, we love that she's a real person with real feelings that are quite familiar and that's who she is. It's not as bad as some of the other reviews have said and I would just explain it to kids. Don't let the language keep you from the experience.  -She is awesome. The chatting makes it 100 times better than just listening to the songs. You can hear her passion for her music and her true love of her audience. The singing is amazing and she chose a great selection for the concert.  I loved it. You need it!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love that there are a few haters out there...WTH??? Why stay in your seat for 2 hours to watch a movie that is so depressing to you? I find this very amusing. This to me is a good movie and as my mother always says: \\"If you don't like it don't watch it\\" I believe that to be a very good idea :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just as fun as I remember, when playing on the pc. So far I haven't seen any flaws and the click to move cards to a new stack is great.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I'm taking my 13 yr old to see the show next month and wanted to get her the CD to listen to the music ahead of time!  She loves it!!  Can't wait for the show!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|nice colour cover, very easy to use, seems to be very durable and easy to clean. i would recommend to anyone
B004MC8CA2|5.0|okay so you can bookmarks, highlight and underline in this app and its amazing than I don't know what the heck is!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can't believe this is free!  It has great features,  and free versions to even. listen to the Bible in different versions.  Plus all the reading plans that are connected seamlessly, and the notes and bookmarks.  it is so nice!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This was really a great game. It was fun to play, and had a few tricky ones thrown in. Excellent all in all.
0767836324|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW  I have never understood why Steven Spielberg's \\"Hook\\" was so thoroughly reviled in the media upon its release.  It is a charming, intelligent, and creative reinvention of J.M. Barrie's \\"Peter Pan.\\"  Granted, it disregards whole swaths of Barrie's original story, and plows on heedless of Mary Martin or Walt Disney.  But, in daring to be different from those predeccessors, director Steven Spielberg puts new creative drive into the story.  Starring Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman, the title implies the story is told more from Captain Hook's point of view, and that is somewhat true.  Bubbling under the surface thematically is a more realistic idea encompassing the need to stay youthful in one's mental, emotional and psychological outlook despite the inevitability of growing up.  In essence, the message of \\"Hook\\" is that all children grow up, but it is in a complete melding of our experiences from youth and our approach to adulthood that determines the tone of our lives.  Robin Williams is perfect in a sort of dual role as a businessman named Peter Banning, and the restored Peter Pan.  Dustin Hoffman is marvelous, offering a modern definitive live-action Captain Hook.  Also starring Bob Hoskins as Mr. Smee and Dame Maggie Smith as 'Granny Wendy' Darling, Steven Spielberg's \\"Hook\\" is a very, very good creative reinvention of a classic tale.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so addicting and fun!  its fun for all ages, from young to old! plus its free, so if you don't like it, you didn't waste any money. c;
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not bad. Some of the games are hard to win, and the controls on some are awful, but it provides some decent mindless entertainment.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoyed this game.  It's easy and fun when you don't want to think too. much.  I would recommend this game if you just want to relax and not have to work to hard.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great bible many versions available will read to you easy search for book chapter and verse.wish could be accessed offline.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a very addicting game to play. enjoy playing it. has all games in one, its definitly worth trying out.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow!  A move from Texas six months after the unexpected death of her beloved dad is difficult enough.  However, just when she feels as though new life in Michigan is going to be okay, she gets handed another blow.    Life slams hard into 18-year old Layken.  And she keeps getting slammed.  She meets Will and things don't look so bad.  In fact, Michigan might be okay after all.    Then third period of her first day of school in her new surroundings and wham!  Slammed!    Her feelings are now somewhat under control and then again.  Slammed.  I absolutely love Eddie!  What a resilient young lady!  (Yes, Eddie is female.)  The title is fitting.  This story will cause you to choke up.  Grab the Kleenex.  What a beautiful story!    A sequel?
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|A movie about Hitler invading Poland shouldn't be this funny but Jack Benny and Carol Lombard make this both a comedy classic as well as showing what war was like in Europe. The Mel Brooks remake retains most of the original but expands a bit here and there. Both should be in your film library.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|This gift was an off beat hit for the young adults. Didn't know about it until my grandson asked for it.  Others enjoyed the weird premise.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I gave the CD to my sister for Christmas and she loved it.  She's a big fan of Enya so it was perfect for her.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Essential for your DROID. This makes typing speed and accuracy much better.. One of the few applications i would deemed worth of a purchase.
B000002LEE|5.0|The lead singer of this band, Perry Farrell, is known for his flare for the dramatic hence the album cover for \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" and the album cover for the next Jane's album. Don't let that scare you off because this is a really good album and stands on it's own feet very well. I just want to point out a couple things:<br /><br />1. The sound and approach to this album has a rawer sound and works to it's benefit.<br />2. This album in my opinion is the weirdest/quirkiest Jane's Addiction put out which enhances it's coolness factor.<br />3. On the majority of this album, the songs have an almost punk rock attitude and feel to them while still having amazing guitar solos and breakdowns.<br /><br />That being said, I believe this was a glimpse of the band's greatness before their masterpiece, \\"Ritual de lo Habitual\\". That was the album that followed this one and was the last with their original bassist.<br />I'd also like to say I don't think that the version of \\"Jane Says\\" found on here is as good as the live version on \\"Kettle Whistle\\" with Flea on bass (\\"Kettle Whistle\\" is a live tracks/rarities album).<br /><br />Buy this album though because with Jane's Addiction, a glimpse of greatness is something some bands try for in a lifetime and never reach.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love this cd sorry the holidays are over, but will still listen to - Michael is a class act. The remakes of White Christmas and Jingle Bells bring me back to what good music is.
B0055PMJMW|1.0|I love the Harry Bosch books....became a huge Michael Connelly fan because of Harry Bosch.  This set of three stories was a waste of my time and money.  It is really sad to me that Connelly would even put these up for sale...they are like ideas that never bloomed...like something you would see in  a high school lit paper.  They are too short more like ideas than stories...
0439023521|5.0|I will start by saying this is one of my new favorite books. I lost count of how many recommendations I received to read this book, and it did not fail me. The book stars and is narrated by Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who is entered into the bloody event that is the Hunger Games, an event that takes 1 boy and 1 girl from each district of what remains of North America. I will stop the spoiling here, and I will leave you with one single comment: BUY THIS BOOK!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|great way to waste sometime I usually play it in the car on long car rides or just waiting around in doctors offices not to complicated for a kid to play either.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds rocks!!!!! I have all the golden eggs!!!!!!!!  I'm finished with the levels and I am starting angry birds seasons and angry birds Rio!!!! go go angry birds destroy the king pig!!! Good luck people and keep destroying the pigs!!!
0060531053|5.0|Great book for a new homebrewer.  I have a buddy who has taught me a lot, and this book just reinforced everything.  It goes really into depth as well if you want to get that deep into brewing!
B004MKM8L8|5.0|Just what my wife wanted for Christmas, Only wish that there had been a gift set with both parts 1 and 2 included!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is great!  It's fun, yet challenging.  It's made me dust off my brain \\"cob webs\\" and really think about how to conquer each challenge.  Although, initially, I wasn't sure that I'd like it, I've become addicted to it.  The only frustrating thing for me is when I've used up all my hints, and I have to really think to reach the goal without being able to use any hints.  (Kind of hate that you have to earn your hints).  Also, you cannot pick a different/new challenge without completing your current challenge.  You can, however, go back to one of your previous rooms and play it again. All, in all, this game is great!  So glad I bought it!!!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|wont play videos on kindle fire unless i download them which im not going to do that defeats the purpose terrrible
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I have many of these albums, CD's and downloads in stereo. We played them side by side vs the mono versions here. We like the Mono versions MUCH better. Of course that is what we owned, and had and listened to in our youth. The sound is true and clear, I love the packaging and memorabilia, I am no expert, just a music and Beatles lover. I am very happy with this set. I was a child when they were introduced to America, 8 years old with my first Transistor Radio, yes I cap that! LOL My mom let me sit up to watch the Beatles on Ed Sullivan and it is a fond memory since my mom just died, to remember the fond moments, the parents sitting on the sofa, making comments as parents did back then about the Beatles, although Elvis was just great! LOL Thanks.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I purchased this set as a gift for my brother-in-law for Christmas.  He had been wanting it for quite a while and I thought it would be a good set to add to his collection.  Neither he nor I could have been any more pleased.  I read quite a few of the reviews prior to purchasing and noticed that some were not pleased with the picture quality.  As another reviewer noted, this restoration is not something that you want to use to show off your Blu-Ray player and new high definition TV.  It is for the movie buff who still wants to see the film grain in their classic film, but also see all of the minute details that were missing from the original due to the resolution.  We have watched the first two and they are excellent.  Hopefully we will have time to sit down and watch the third soon.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS ALL YET, IF THE FACTS EXPRESSED ARE ALL CORRECT, THE SHOW IS EYE-OPENING. IT IS CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT DON'T WORK IN THE HIGH FINANCE WORLD. I AM GLAD I PURCHASED THIS VIDEO AND WILL WATCH IT SEVERAL TIMES.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I love this CD.  There are only two songs on here that I like slightly less than the others, but I definitely don't feel the need to skip them.  \\"Louder than Ever\\" is so awesome.  It's a song to sing at the top of your lungs with the windows rolled down.  It's no wonder Daughtry fills my MP3 player and is always the CD playing in my car.  Huge fan!!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Please update on par with Android Market...current version there is 5.3..Other than that the app is awesome ...Really works great on the galaxy nexus
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app! it will even remind you to read your daily plans which I think is awesome! it also has a lot of versions and will also read passages to you. I use that in the car all the time!
B005GVF95O|4.0|I don't have any small children, but I think this app looks fun for little ones. I just wanted to say that Superman 75's review was hilarious!! I read it to my sons (minus the fake breast part) aes 7 and 9, and they even got a laugh! really people. you thought he was serious? Great and witty review! Keep them coming!
B000UD08HW|5.0|All I can say is that I have been a Floyd fan for 30 years. this Blu Ray is so dang nice, sonics and musicianship are unbelievable! Bowie, Manzanara (form Roxy Music) Rick Wright...a mix of my fave artists as well. Comfortably Numb with David Gilmour, Rick Wright and David Bowie singing will never happen again. Thanks David for a night to remember even if I wasn't there.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|After I finally got the table I wanted I remembered this app and thought I would try it. To my delight it works like a charm and I can easily and effortlessly access my computer with BOTH monitors. It took a little getting used to but I quickly got the handle on it and it is wicked fast (on my network I haven't tried out and about yet) Thank you for such a nice little app and making it FAOTD all this time ago. Best of all, Unlike Log me in it doesnt send my computer to the basic aero theme. It does change the resolution though but that's minor. I have a high resolution to begin with because I value my space. :P<br />------Old Post! Was 2 stars--------<br />I own the lg optimus q LGL55C from straight talk, and it force closes on me. After submitting a ticket I found out that the ARM version was a tad bit too low for the program. Despite me having no idea about ARM and stuff they were very helpful and apologetic that they couldn't help me. I suggested that they consider the slightly older phones like mine, which is just shy of the required specks, even if they have to drop a few features.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the individualized reading plans and various versions of the Bible. it has been a stimulus for me to read more.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have searched high and low for an app on my kindle fire that would be similar to programs I already have on my computer. for example, my desktop budget worksheet. Now I don't have find an app because I can easily access the program I want right off my computer! Very easy to set up and IT WORKS!  Everything on my desktop and laptop, I have remote access to anywhere I have Internet!  I am so happy.  Thanks to Amazon's. free app of the day, I discovered this.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have seen so far. This is the reason we have smartphones and tablets!
