B009RX7IX8|5.0|This is a review of the 5th Season.<br /><br />So, Castle and Beckett are now a couple.  Cue the doom.<br /><br />Well, it didn't happen.  Beckett, who has not been my favorite, has really grown on me this season.  The pairing has really worked.<br /><br />Strangely, it's Castle who seems a bit off to me at times.  Does he really believe in everything crackpot idea?  And would he really be saying \\"Shoot Bigfoot?\\"<br /><br />The final episode gets us to two big events which could lead to huge cast changes.  Very curious how this will work out.
B0098460O4|5.0|If you have never heard Jonathan and Charlotte, do yourself a favor and purchase this cd.  I am not an opera fan, and although Jonathan has been compared Pavarotti, this cd is a different venue.  This has both the power of Jonathon's soaring vocals paired with Charlotte's amazing pop voice for beautiful  songs that any music lover would enjoy.
B0000019PA|5.0|This album was not love at first sight for me. I was rather skeptical of it. As I started to listen to In the Aeroplane over the Sea more often, it was almost scary how the music grew on me. I can now say that this is one of the most beautiful albums I have ever listened to- if not the most beautiful. If you are listening to this and are unimpressed by what you are hearing for the first time, I am begging for you to give it another chance, and many after the second chance, if it doesn't hit you.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I enjoy every song on this cd, but especially the duets with Donny Osmond.  Susan really sparkles in the duets.  She has been blessed with an amazing voice, and you will not be disappointed with this cd.
8866135771|2.0|A little too small for my liking. The monthly squares are a bit too small for me & I also don't like how they start the week out on Monday. I wish I could return.
B00025E1UI|5.0|I enjoyed the game, it is in my top 5 FF games ever (in order FF6, FF, FF7, FFX, FF4) so I always wanted to get the soundtrack to add to my growing FF collection.  When I did I popped it in and got lost in the memory of the game, from the blitzball opening, to the meeting of Yuna, from the escape from Seymour - to the romantic scene between Tidus and Yuna it is all there.  I am glad to have this in my collection and can not wait for the remake to come out next year for this game.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I enjoy twitter much better then Facebook they have improved it over the year and now it is great. I was very leery at first about trying twitter but I am so happy now that I did. If you have not tried it or it's been years will give it a second chance or first I think you to will be happy with it.

B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Another amazing album by Janelle Monae. This is what a real artist sounds like!  Janelle weaves a compelling story through her exploration of different musical genres.  My favorite album of the year..
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This was a cute movie with a nice story for adults and the kids enjoyed the cartoon aspect. I would recommend. We watched it a few times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg this game is soo awesome! its way better than temple run because there are more power ups and you can unlock diffrent characters. on temple rum there are only 6 characters and not a lot of power ups. it is actually boring compared to this game. I reccomend it to anyone. 5 stars
B007N85POS|5.0|Challenging without being difficult, good for all ages, all of the graphics are done very well and the story line is good
B003VVAE4W|5.0|This show is very smart. I am sad I missed it when it was first on the air. Can't wait for the movie.
B0053TMP24|5.0|i just love this book.  my whole famiy does.  we all love rick rordan books.  i love this book very much.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|It is fun but a pain when it takes 5 or 10 tries to connect to a game. Just gave up on this thing. Funny how before it was difficult, but then once I purchased some diamonds for $1.99 then I found it almost impossible to connect to the online multiplayer games. Wasted my money!! Argggg!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'm enjoying reading the Husband's Secret - just your everyday &#34;family life&#34; - only in Australia - lots of different little &#34;crisis&#34; going on and all the characters are eventually getting tied together.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Joan Crawford is never bad to begin with, but the story/plot in this movie is so detailed and each character seems to come to life. I can't reveal much of the story without the worry of being a spoiler, but it is great story and I loved it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Play  it with my grandma and cousin. Lots of fun an love the horses. Wish it did not cost so many gems for the pretty stuff.
B006G2ZEV6|1.0|I loved this game and beat it a year or so ago on my droid bionic. Tried playing today and no text in the boxes is showing. Five stars once fixed. Verizon Galaxy s4.
0307887960|5.0|I surveyed available weight loss books on Amazon, and I chose this one because it sounded sensible and probably doable. It turned out to be exactly that. I bought it 2 years ago, lost 35 pounds in 12 weeks, and have kept it off ever since. I never walked around hungry.

0062073486|4.0|AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is often listed as mystery or mystery-suspense. Actually I'd call it and out-and-out horror novel. Why? Because horror is \\"the anticipation of a terrifying outcome\\" and that's precisely what this book aims to be.<br /><br />The plot is fiendishly simple. Eight people are invited to remote Soldier Island for a party. Waiting for them are a maid and butler, who inform the guests that their mysterious hosts will be arriving shortly. In the mean time, each person is handed a copy of the infamously gruesome little poem \\"Ten Little Indians.*\\" While waiting, one of the guests plays a gramophone, but instead of music the recorded voice announces that each member of the party -- including the maid and butler -- have committed, and gotten away with, some terrible crime, and that punishment is now at hand. The guests believe it's all just some macabre practical joke...until the first one of them dies. And when they realize that there is no way to communicate with the mainland, no way off the island until the scheduled boat arrives days later...panic begins to set in...and paranoia. Are they trapped on the island with a murderer hiding in the shadows...or is the murderer hiding in plain sight among them? Either way, the bodies are piling up fast, and for the dwindling number of survivors, the \\"anticipation of a terrifying outcome\\" grows both more unbearable and more certain with each passing moment. There is, it seems, no way to outrun your sins on Soldier Island...<br /><br />AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is a startlingly good book. Christie uses clever writing technique to introduce a very large cast of characters quickly, and also establish just the vaguest trace of menace from the very first pages; also to create numerous \\"red herrings\\" and to misdirect the reader at every possible turn as to the killer's identity. Despite a shortish length and a lightning pace, the characters -- Lawrence Wargrave, Vera Claythorne, Philip Lombard, General John Macarthur, Emily Brent, Anthony Marston, Dr Edward Armstrong and William Blore, and Thomas and Ethel Rogers -- are finely drawn and, in some cases, decidedly sympathetic because they actually regret their sins, which of course only makes the horror-suspense element of the novel all the more effective. The killer partially agrees, arranging the earliest deaths for those who are the least villainous, and the final ones for those who deserve to suffer agonies of suspense as they wait minute by minute for their own end to come.<br /><br />No book is perfect, and the main flaw here is the last part of the novel, which consists of a large set-up to letting the killer explain their motives. The set-up is quite unnecessary and overly expositive and a single sentence introducing the actual confession, such as \\"The following was recovered in a bottle which washed up on a beach in East Anglia\\" would have sufficed. I feel Christie went a bit too far \\"behind the curtain\\" here, but the flaw is relatively minor.<br /><br />AND THEN THERE WERE NONE was my first Agatha Christie book, but it won't be my last. Minor flaws aside, it's a terrific little novel that not only needs to be read, it needs to be read twice!<br /><br />(* When the book was originally published, the poem was actually called \\"Ten Little N*****s\\"...as was the book. Then it became TEN LITTLE INDIANS. When that too became politically unacceptable, the name was changed once more to AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. Hopefully this is the last change...but you never know.)Emily Brent, Anthony Marston, Dr Edward Armstrong and William Blore, and Thomas and Ethel Rogers -- are finely drawn and, in some cases, decidedly sympathetic because they actually regret their sins, which of course only makes the horror-suspense element of the novel all the more effective.

B00000JLWW|1.0|I hate this movie and it is at least refreshing to find out I am not the only one. It is an insult to the public and an insult to those who died on the actual Titanic.<br /><br />Let's look at the plot first. The premises are stupid. They attempt to turn one of the great tragedies in history into a saccharin sweet fantasy love story but I don't buy it. The sexual affair the two protagonists have is improbable enough - but improbable romances do happen. But the concept that this woman carries a torch for the young man for 70-80 years or however long it was is stupid. That is never going to happen because NOBODY is THAT good looking or that fantastic a lover or that anything, to the extent that you spend a couple of days and one night with them and then pine for them for almost a century. Millions of women lost their partners in the great war that followed, or the next one, or through any number of accidents or events and they moved on. This kind of thing does not happen. I don't recall if the rest of her life was dealt with, but what did she do? Stay a spinster her entire life? Dishonor whatever man she did marry by holding the object of a short affair in higher regard? The final scene where she throws the piece of jewelry into the ocean is the final insult to intelligence and just drives a nail in the coffin.<br /><br />The producers apparently feel no compunction about knowingly slandering the crewmen who also gave their lives in the sinking. I guess they assumed that because those or any surviving crewmen were already dead, there was no reason to not insult their memory or their surviving families and descendants. Because there never was the least evidence that lower class passengers were locked in, and subsequent dives on the actual wreck confirm this.<br /><br />From start to finish this movie is typical of the disrespect that Hollywood has for the public but all I can say a fool and their money are soon parted.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I'm a long-time science fiction reader/watcher.  I'm sick to death of the silly pap that Hollywood passes off as science fiction.  Oblivion is not that.  Oblivion is a well-crafted movie, with a strong story and an unfolding mystery that draws the viewer in.  the characters have depth.  the acting is good and the direction top notch.<br /><br />In general movies and television are dumbed down to lowest common denominator.  Its such a pleasant surprise to find something that rises above that.<br /><br />I enjoyed Oblivion tremendously.<br /><br />:)
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Movie was ok  .But the free part was a surprise. It wasn't .Those movies eat gigabites like candy, boy was I surprised when I got my bill most expensive movie I ever went to, even with popcorn!
B0036S4CTS|3.0|This novel is clever and funny, in parts. However, I had problems with it. The first thing I noticed was (and this may just be in the Kindle edition, which I read) the use of &#34;alright&#34; instead of &#34;all right&#34; -- ALL the time! I mean, in the first chapter, &#34;alright&#34; was on almost every page. Did this guy not have a competent editor? I really dislike seeing errors like that, because they make me disrespect the writer and/or his editor. No excuse for that. What tore the rag off the bush, and when I quit reading, was when I saw &#34;nauseous&#34; used to mean &#34;nauseated.&#34; Another egregious grammar error. No excuse for it, no matter how commonly this word is used incorrectly. The other problem I had with this book was that I really didn't care about either character and couldn't imagine in what universe they would possibly have had a relationship. I could see where Emma might be attracted to Dexter, since he was a good looking &#34;bad boy,&#34; but he was an alcoholic, a cheater, and a reprobate. I can't imagine that Dexter could care about Emma, since he seemed to care so little for anyone else (except maybe his mother). This relationship just strained my ability to understand or accept it. There just wasn't much there, no depth, and that, coupled with the grammar errors, made me put this one down before I finished it. I read more than I really wanted to because it is a book club selection and I felt compelled to keep at it. But I have too many other books that I want to read, and not enough time to waste on stuff like this. Young people, and fans of romance novels, might love it. But if you're looking for good (or even decent) literature, I recommend that you skip this. Meh.
0596009208|3.0|First of all, I want to say that I have studied most of the material presented in this book, and have programmed in Java for a couple of years before buying it.<br /><br />The information in the book is great, all major topics are covered, and they are covered well. That being said, the manner in which the information is presented may not be the most clear for all learners. There are some unique diagrams that the book uses; for the learners who use like diagrams rather than just a written descriptions, this works really well. The target audience seems to be younger students who have not done much programming in the past, but I'm sure everyone who has not programmed too much in java before can learn from this book.<br /><br />Although it's not my favorite style for a textbook about programming, I did learn some new material from the book. If you're not sure if the style of the book is for you, look through it using Amazon's &#34;look inside&#34; feature, and check if you like the style. Like I said, the material is all there, so as long as you like the style of writing, you'll enjoy the book.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|great features love the multiple alarms, blue light,  dimmer mode, has a flashlight app built in and alrams can be set for the days if the week
B0031KE9C6|5.0|I found this TV series to be a pleasant surprise, quality entertainment!  Just the right mix of mystery, intrigue and romance.  I look forward to viewing season 2.  Kristen Bell is perfect for this role.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Avg movie. Nothing to get excited about. Main character tried his best to be like Stallone in the original movie.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT AND DOES MORE THAN JUST THE NON EXPLORER EDITION.  I WOULD TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO USE THIS EDITION.  LOVE IT.
B00DQR26EC|1.0|Can't get past the tutorial on my kindle HD because it freezes and restarts every time. Waste of money. Please fix.
B006JRY2QG|4.0|This is a great show. The characters are real and very interesting. The story line makes you want to keep watching. It really draws you in so that you can't wait to watch the next episode to see what is going to happen.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Google, though usually a very smart organization, created an HDMI streaming device that does not connect to a 5GHZ network, only a 2.4GHZ which is not strong enough to stream HD effectively. So far, I haven't been able to watch much, and everything including trying to watch a trailer from You Tube goes to an annoying \\"Lost Connection\\", it gets stuck mid stream and doesn't buffer, so if it doesn't lose the connection, it skips forward to catch up to what is playing on the computer that its streaming from. I'm usually able to watch most things from Apple TV or Amazon Prime direct from the TV, so no big loss for me. I just wanted to toy with the latest tech, but honestly, this is a big disappointment.

B00DDRKDUO|5.0|Great band great music you will enjoy this music love it with headphones. They are also now touring America. Enjoy
0321334876|5.0|This isn't really a programming book, it's a list of guidelines on how to write good c++ code (and avoid many pitfalls). It's a great way to improve your knowledge on c++ once you have a grasp of the basics. It is nicely written and as close to a page turner as any programming book can get.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Just came out this album is wonderful as all Ghost music is. Ghost is touring the world so check it out.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I like a lot because this movie represent the true love within difficult times. The final speech about the live was very emotive. I think that is a beautiful message for all generations.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Ghost rocks so love this entire album.Highly recommended for everyone who is drawn to it. Has booklet enclosed and cover over CD.
B00BIR381W|5.0|Everything about this show keeps me on the edge of my seat. It never fails to surprise me in the best kind of ways. Pretty Little Liars is by far my favorite show. I cant wait to get the next season when it comes out.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I've been a Neil Young fan for only about a year, but have purchased 14 or 15 albums in that time. Each album was bought on the spur of the moment so<br />the year the album was released really hasn't been a factor in my purchases. I purchased \\"Greendale\\" because the segments I heard on Amazon sounded pretty<br />good. Now I can't get enough of this fascinating album! It's definitely my favorite so far. I love the fact that all songs are related and tell such a great<br />story. The rough edges only add to the charm and showcase the great talent possessed by this artist -and by Crazy Horse -.I'm constantly amazed by the people I meet -<br />I'm from the South- who still hold a grudge for Neil's \\"Southern Man\\". This album is truly a work of art.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The Scorch Trials is a very interesting book. It keeps giving me  more and more questions as to what is going to happen. The author did an amazing job because now I want to read the next book in the series to find out what will happen.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Cool read, dragged a bit at times while waiting for the real story to develop, but still pretty good.  Nice historical analysis.  Keep Wikipedia close at hand so you can check out some of the real life characters and events he brings up.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the minions! When I saw this game I knew right. away that my sowould love it as well.  But after having to download a bunch of stuff i thought for sure he would be able to play while in the car! But no, we need the wi-fi. To play Everytime, I wish they can make an offline version that's just as much fun to play, thanks for listening..MomOfMatt *
B005DJREJS|5.0|Very funny show.  A little racy at times, but still pretty cool.  LOL'd many occasions.  Reminds me of ABC's Suburgatory, but the latter had quite a few occasions of ridiculousness, whereas this one's a bit more realistic.
1401201911|5.0|what this book did was incredible. set the landing of Kal-El in Mother Russia, and you have a great twist of a beloved American icon. any Superman fan that hasnt read this, should.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's entertaining and it makes you think but it's forcing me to review it after level 10 which is kind if annoying.
0470503696|4.0|This is just what I needed!  This book was obviously well loved, but in good enough shape for my use.  Thanks.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|So, its 28 Days Later, but with a \\"happier\\" ending, lots more money, and Brad Pitt. Great special effects - a real sense of scale that 28 Days didn't have the budget for. However, 28 Days seemed more tense and dark quite possibly *because* of its smaller budget. I enjoyed WWZ, but I'm probably going to rewatch 28 Days now too!
0345409671|5.0|its a book that makes you think and i like that. something that opens the mind up and bla bla
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Will share with the whole family. Challenge for the eyes and the mind, memory and recall.  Great family fun too!

B00280LYIC|5.0|My 8 year old grandson loved the movie and is eagerly reading the book. Adventure is a good way to engage a young boy's imagination while learning mythology. Excellent book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the story I never put it down until I finished. it felt so real like I watched it happened. I would recommend everyone I know to read it...
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|Very fun and good graphic.  Easy to control.  Please give us more speed, more tracks and cars. Overall a good game.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Minion Rush would not download to my phone. I tried to download it twice. I kept getting an error message.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is cool cause you can build any thing you want it's a great game.<br />Cause I built a castle and good house it's really really fun to play
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|To be fair - I wasn't in the mood for this type of movie - but it was seriously boring.  The imagery was stunning - but the story was a bit dull.  Not what I was quite expecting.  I was thinking there would be some emotion from me - but zip.  I am sure the book was better.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a really fun game.I like that you can really rack up the coins and other items you need to buy things! Not like others that you have to wait forever to get stuff!
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I love this game! I like the way u battle and take care of them. The only thing is the last battle is a little weird.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I loved this show when it originally aired and I love it now. It is nice, uncomplicated adventure. Richard Dean Anderson is great!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Used this for work and it was perfect. Simple to use. Recommended for anyone. Hoping to get the clip art portion next.
B002N1AF7C|5.0|No gimmicks or extra tracks<br />Just the original album<br />Pristine Clean and Modern<br />I am quite happy that Kraftwerk has finally<br />remastered some of their classics<br />I can understand Tone Float, 1 & 2 and even<br />Rolf/Florian, but why not Computer World and Electric Cafe?<br />Especially since they remastered Tour de France!<br />Oh well, great CD - highly recommended for all Kraftwerk fans.
B002KGEORM|5.0|If you have never watched this show I highly recommend it! Keeps you on your toes at all moments. I watched 5 seasons in less than 2 weeks to be able to watch season 6!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't help it. I haven't even reviewd it for my blog since I read it so long ago, but I couldn't resist not having reviewed it at least here.<br /><br />It has a great plot and timeline, the main characters are well developed (even if annoying at times, but doesn't that make them a bit more human?), the secondary characters are charming and intriguing alike, and the setting takes us to some amazing places and is ever interesting.<br /><br />There is just enough humor to keep the story from being bleak. The vocabulary drove me a little mad at times with the inner and goddess and all that but I'll live, I read book one through three in a matter of 48 hours. The naughty bits were divine. The price was on the higher side of what I typically pay, but I loved it! So, that makes it so worth every penny. And the ending was perfect for the first installment of a trilogy.
B0035G5IOE|4.0|this movie is very funny and I am glad I was told to order this. it came on time so that was even better
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Was unhappy to download this junk. Wasn't what I wanted but who can I complain to? Don't bother this book you read and cannot understand all characters that are described.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|Reading Gilbert's thoughts, musings, and research in her rich appealing voice mirrors the minds of many intelligent women when considering marriage. I think many of us (similarly to Gilbert) interview our relatives, and friends on marriage and its benefits especially as it is known that today, the highest levels of personal satisfaction are found in those of married men and single women. Quite paradoxical. With independence and our own income, the benefits of marriage can be duplicated in a few other legal documents - a will, health care proxy, shared lease or mortgage. So why marry at all? The why or why nots of partaking in this institution seems so often to be expressed as a blend of fairy tale propaganda, go get your man books, and the dread being trapped by an institution steeped in values not representing our own. Gilbert in this book conveys these myriad concerns with her distinctive voice.
0345529057|5.0|I am on my second round of reading these.  I have even ordered a second set for a friend.  Highly recommended.
B009ZRY0IC|5.0|Ben Howard is amazing, first heard him while he toured with Mumford & Sons. Had to get this album after that and Ben did not disappoint!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This software installs quickly and gives an immediate view of wifi signals in your area.<br />I like it because it is simple to use and you don't have to spend a load of time setting it up<br />It works very well. Within minutes of installing it I had moved the channel on my wifi router to a clear space<br />and I'm now having good results in connecting my mobile devices.<br />Recommended.
0061950726|2.0|I really want to love this book. I liked the first half, it had so much potential. I liked Dorothy and Fanny and other characters. It kinda fell apart once she was permanently placed. The author kinda skimmed over the rest of the novel and you really don't have any bond with the rest of the characters or even Vivian. It felt like she was in a hurry to finish the novel and made sure to quickly tidy up all the ends.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is great, it was fun and entertaining. I only gave 4 stars because 10 levels are not nearly enough.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Great movie, loved it as a kid. A little scary for my 3 and 4 year old. Had to skip the bad and mean spots but the loved the end. :)
B007EDYN36|4.0|I recently finished this book and I really enjoyed it- it was hard to put down, but Peter really contradicts himself a lot. \\"Paul & Gene were all about the money\\" Then he goes on about how he couldn't turn down tours because of the money. \\"Gene was a sex maniac\\". Then he goes on about his own vices. \\"Glicksman & Marks robbed us blind\\" And then later he says Paul & Gene fired them to make them the scapegoats! And on and on.<br /><br />He also contradicts many stories that have been told many times over, such as Ace's audition, the time frame in which Bill Aucoin said he would get KISS a deal (I've always read 2 weeks and Peter says 6 months!), the story behind Gene accepting to breath fire, etc....<br /><br />But over all it's a really fascinating read. Much better than Ace's somewhat disappointing bio. Peter really unloads on Paul, Gene, Ace, Tommy Thayer, Eric Singer and Mark St John. Nothing negative about Eric Carr or Bruce Kulick- or surprisingly Vinnie Vincent. Maybe because he never really knew him.<br /><br />Peter isn't afraid to knock himself either. You sometimes think \\"do you even realize you are contradicting yourself?\\" but at the same time you feel he's being honest in his assessment of himself. I would recommend this to any KISS fan- in fact I just lent it to a friend<br /><br />In closing, one thing that bugged me is he didn't mention the Peter Criss Alliance. He goes into a lot of detail about his post KISS bands, but never mentions this. I met Peter during this tour in 1983. I was 14 and it was in Cadillac, Michigan (I still have my ticket stub!) It was a big deal here that a KISS member was returning to Cadillac. The 75 visit is a big part of KISStory and you think he would have mentioned it! But ah well! If you're a fan, buy the book!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The backdrop for the film (a home for retired musicians) could have easily become melodramatic.  However, the amusing one-liners, excellent music score and outstanding acting overcame a potentially depressing movie.  Due the theme of this movie and some of the strong language, this movie is not for children.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a fun game. I have been playing for over an hour, and my niece and nephew like to sit next to me and help find the hidden objects.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|The film started out on an interesting premise.  But about one-third of the way through it seemed to bog down.  It also became more depressing as it when along, till it got near the end.  At that point, the writers attempted to off-set the depressing mood with a relatively happy ending.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I like the full facebook because I thought I would be able to play my games on my kindle and would not have to use my laptop all of the time...I would not recommend it to my friends because of the game issue..
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|I actually bought this set..the sound will pin you back in your seat,...These guys and this set is way above any music made today.....the drums sound full and deep-and Garth..amazing.Danko..have mercy..when i grow up i want to be Levon...I know this is not a cheap set to buy...however....forgo your Miley Cyrus and get this..I knew it was coming and saved up...<br /><br />I have been driving around blastin this out of my truck and it sounds spectacular,as if you were there...no lie......<br />And after playing a few more gigs-and had time....I now went  to disc 4 the DVD and what do ya know..there is video...yep..do not believe rumors that there is still pictures ...O yea!!! It's video and it's great...2 songs..THANKS!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is very fun and addictive. The characters are cool and I never get tired to play. I recommend this game
1476734941|5.0|book is easy to read and the lifestyle is doable- no crazy weight loss claims just health in mind. it makes me realize how little we actually need to eat to stay the same size/
B0084B5TK8|4.0|The book was entertaining I have always thought Bram Stoker Dracula was the best version I highly recommend it for casual reading
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Although I don't use this a lot it really helps! For  example: My first language is Spanish, and when I totally don't understand a word I go here!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|gritty, dark, grounded, spectacular visuals, great acting - lets see another! karl urban made this role his own and brought judge dredd to a whole new level
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Most books usually have a terrible ending or at best an acceptable ending but this book has the best one ever!! I have no complaints, *spoiler alert* I was soooo happy when in the epilougue you see them with their son, its soooooo cute &#60;33 Or when you read Christian's first Christmas!! OOORRR when you read the first time they met in HIS perspective!! &#60;--- I think that was my favorite part!! It is the book ending ever!!
B009LDCZDC|5.0|We were really happy to finally get this.  We are rewatching the first season to really appreciate the second.  What a great show.  Now we have to wait for Season 3.
0345803485|4.0|Loved reading this book. I liked that this book was easy to fallow. I am looking forward to reading the other two books in this series and i hope they will be as great as the first one.
B00BEU19ZU|1.0|very disappointed in this app.  graphics are hard to read .  App just downloaded the Airline web site and transferred to application.<br /><br />Flight Tracker and Flight Tracker Pro much, much, better.  Save your 99 coins.  Could not get some of the features to work especially when tracking the aircraft across country with flight information: altitude, speed, flight path, etc.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It does what it says, once you allow it it to update it's Firmware, which takes place automatically over the WiFi.<br />Until that happens, it may give you intial lagged responses.<br /><br />But I bought more units after I figured out how to install it properly.
1609611543|4.0|I heard Neal Boortz talk about this book and I finally broke down and bought it.  It has been passed around my circle of friends and is still out there somewhere...bottom line is it will not be easy but it can be done...I saw my belly fat disappear in less than 3 months and I have dropped from a size 10 to a 6 in jeans...
B000RUAR5G|1.0|Could not play it on my tv, i have a really good modem, internet speed and player but i had to get a refund.
1559948671|5.0|This book painted a clear picture of what the soldiers saw and felt and did for<br />Our country as a U.S. SOLDIER.
0374214913|5.0|A magnificent read and everyone I have shared it with has agreed.  I reviewed it at length on PatriciasWisdom dot com.  I have give 4 copies away for the last 4 birthday parties and I have gotten 2 local book groups to add it to their list.  Now that it is out in paperback  and kindle  I am hoping it will go viral.  Even the cover is wonderful on the hard copy. I will read it again and again.  Good for ages 12-95!  Robin Sloan is a wonderful word wizard
B00BKTFABE|5.0|I was going to buy a two dollar app for the video camera, but this works awesomely!<br /><br />I have no idea where the videos are stored so that I can put them on my computer.<br /><br />(UPDATE):<br />The videos are located in DCIM > Camera
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|bought this and then realised it would not work on my Kindle - there was a part that did say this but somehow I didn't notice when I purchased it - I was looking forward to this as I love the other temple Run games
B000T9OP7G|3.0|A fun extension of the Terminator series, but far from perfect. What it really has going for it are Dekker, Headey, and Glau, all of whom are worth following in their various performances. Glau steals the show, but catching Headey in a pre-Game of Thrones role is also part of the fun if you missed it the first time through. The show took a while finding its legs and, sadly, just as they were getting it all running well in the second season, got cancelled. We'll never know what might have been, but it was a reasonable ride while it lasted.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a riveting story, written with skill... especially the dialogue between characters.  I can honestly say that I couldn't put this one down... plan to read the author's other work, too!
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|A beautifully filmed and sweet romance wrapped in one of the more intriguing and unique stories to come out in a while. Like Safety Not Guaranteed, this film asks you to make a leap of faith, though in this case that is made literal and is not left in question.<br /><br />This is Dunst 's second foray into a unique genre film in as many releases. Her previous, Oscar nodded performance in Melancholia challenged audiences as well, though in very different ways. She brings just the right level of sweet naivete to support this story. Sturgess (Across the Universe) likewise brings a beautifully child-like, heroic drive and desire to the challenges that endears you to his cause. This sense of innocence and joy is important to the style and in no way weakens the movie.<br /><br />Innocence is important because the script and logic only work if you take it as a fable. Certainly the opening implies you should. Whether that was a fix or an intent, I'm unsure and there was no commentary to fill me in. But be warned, if you are going for a solid science fiction piece, you're going to gnash your teeth at the incomplete logic and plot holes. On the other hand, if you watch as a fantasy or, better yet as I indicated, as a fable, you won't be disappointed. It is a glorious fable of love, life, romance, power, politics, and creativity.<br /><br />Writer/director Solanas made bold choices and had a great time conceiving both the flow and the setting of the story. He has you fall into his world and plays with your perception without apology. It is a rich tapestry with a great deal of fun and thinking that went into it.<br /><br />As a first major release for Solanas, it is magical and shows immense promise. I will definitely be watching for his next project. And, in the meantime, we have this incredible piece of magical romance to feed upon, and it isn't a meal you should miss.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great characters!  I love watching the relationships develop & wondering if Mike's secret is going to be discovered. Only negative for me is some of the language that is used.
B008518MOW|4.0|A fitting sequel and end (?) to the series. The original MIB was a shock to the general system. It was unique in its humor and approach for a major film. It was both silly and intelligent, bawdy and full of heart. And then they made the sequel... which shall go unmentioned. I wouldn't have thought they could return to these characters and this world either believably nor in a way that would be interesting. I was glad to be proved wrong and I would watch it again.<br /><br />14 years after the last movie, we pick up J and K with a new nemesis and, of course, high stakes. But this story is highly personal without ever becoming overly sweet or maudlin. It's still a buddy cop story, but it isn't about J's learning the ropes or a simple standard fate-of-the-world scenario, it is about their lack of communication--like most long term relationships.<br /><br />It is a clever story with some good CGI and, despite being filmed for 3D, there isn't an over-reliance on that medium in the filming. It works perfectly fine in 2D. It isn't quite as snappy as the first movie in its humor, but it is comfortable and fun. And the retro look of the HQ and the design, in general, was really well executed.<br /><br />The most impressive aspect, frankly, was Brolin's performance as the younger K. You will swear they CG'd Jones to simply look younger. It is one of the more remarkable pieces of casting and performances where an actor has to become another actor's younger self. Much like Looper, it was done subtly. But honestly, it was also done much better in Brolin's case. They lucked out with both the physicality and the voice match for sure, but he is also a gifted mimic.<br /><br />MIB3 is a reminder that sequels can be done right if given time and commitment and when they're not just created to cash in on the fervor (can you say Iron Man 2?). Here's also hoping they know when to walk away. Smith and Jones are not replaceable and the story has really run its course in a satisfying way. I'm glad they came back to wrap it all up, but I'm happy now to let them exit the stage.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|For me, the first ten minutes of the film is the best part. That's not to say I did not enjoy the rest of the movie, because I did. It is definitely a solid sequel that tells an entertaining story. It just feels like there may have been too much indecision in the direction, too much build up in trying to keep a secret and too much of a nod to the past (ala Bryan Singer's Superman Returns). That said, it is still a terrific film as we continue to watch the growing and deepening relationship between Kirk and Spock that Spock Prime foreshadowed in the first JJ 'verse film a few years ago.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch is magnificent in the role of John Harrison/?. He really is a multifaceted antagonist. Alice Eve settles in nicely as Carol Marcus, and I can't wait to see her interact with the rest of the crew in a third film. I was honestly disappointed that the other members of the supporting cast did not have more to do, especially Karl Urban. whose portrayal of Bones is uncanny and terrific. I could probably watch a two hour movie of Urban just speaking in character.<br /><br />As for the first ten minutes, it does feature all of the returning characters and shows the promise of the last film when they warped away on their first official mission as a crew. The consequences of their actions in the opening 10 minutes really sets up Kirk's journey in the film, although after an attack on Starfleet, that moment tends to get lost a bit. Still, for my money, those 10 minutes are so much fun as Kirk and McCoy attempt to lure natives away from their home without violating the prime directive as Spock, Uhura and Sulu attempt to extinguish a planet-wide threat that would spell extinction for it's indigenous species. We see another awesome moment of the Enterprise (i.e. Jupiter's rings from the first film) as well as the impact of ignoring the prime directive.
B004D7GU3M|3.0|Theirs already a review up that goes into detail about the sound issues so i wont add much more. I honestly love this album but the quality of the sound simply lacks depth...I have vinyls that are 2x older than i am that sound better than this...unless ur a Dj who needs this or someone who wants the poster and the other smaller pieces of art work u should skip this trust me from one Kanye fan to another
B001GCUO16|4.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine is an underrated offering in the X-Men and hero genre. This one definitely ranks higher than the misstep that was X-Men Last Stand. If you are a fan if Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the brawling, self-healing Canadian, than this film should be in your library. The blu-ray includes digital copy and some nice extras, including a Fox movie premiere documentary. The inclusion of the latter is just the type of special features that all blu-ray discs should be offering fans with the disc's seeming unlimited space.
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|I liked this recording, but it wasn't what I was expecting. It only had one song that I was familiar with and that was Unbroken.
1400052181|4.0|This book was chosen for my book club and I wasn't too enthusiastic about reading it. Once I sat down and started getting into it, I found it interesting and informative. Hela cells is something I'd never heard of before so it was all new to me. The author did a fine job of switching from past to current times, which is not an easy thing to do (although I found it a bit confusing in the beginning). I rather enjoyed the way it was written because it seemed to keep the story more alive. I like the author talking about her experiences with the Lack's family because I often thought she was courageous to go where others wouldn't dare.<br /><br />It is a shame how the Lacks family was treated both morally and monetarily. They need to be commended for (in the end) wanting Henrietta's cells to continue helping others. In their hearts they are truly fine people. It does seem, however, that somehow or by someone they could have been compensated in some way.<br /><br />It was a good book, an eye-opener in many ways.<br /><br />Cynthia Briggs/Cookbook Author<br />[[ASIN:1403381658 Pork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and Reflections]]

B002VPE1WK|4.0|I've only had my Pentax K-30 for a short time but quickly found myself with way more equipment then my little kit bag could handle. This backpack is a little smaller than I thought it was going to be but that isn't a bad thing. If you have something like a 200mm or 300mm prime lens or pro sized monster camera, you might be a little pressed for space if you plan to carry a handful of other lenses, a flash, etc... If you have those problems however, you can afford a bigger bag. I can fit my camera body, 4 lenses, a cleaning kit, filters, batteries, a charger and still have a little space left over. This bag also has straps on the side for a small tripod. While I don't feel like this backpack is a steal, I definitely think you are getting what you pay for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is just great it's free,fun the people who made this app deserve a pat on the back I love playing this app everyone should get it

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app so much greatest thing ever invented. The only thing I don't like is that I can't seem to get anything done anymore.
B003THHIEM|4.0|Looking for a crime drama with a little romance? Castle is the answer. Although, there are only 10 episodes for the season, each is entertaining and leaves you wanting more. I have to admit the first episode is one of my favorites.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Super Fast shipping. Got within a week.my kids were so excited and  love this movie. They watch it over and over again!
B000S559VW|5.0|After all these years it was refreshing to hear this album and be blown away by how unique and special it still is.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|You need to watch Prometheus more than once to catch everything.  I am a scientist and could really relate to Noomi Rapace's character, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw.  Dr. Shaw goes from the thrill of discovery after years of work only to experience what seems to be abject failure.  She still manages to survive, though and renew her pursuit of scientific discovery.  Never surrender, never give up!
B00D3LA71K|5.0|This film really showcases Matthew McConaughey's ability to carry off a different role. He sells this character completely and you're not thinking, &#34;Oh, I'm watching Matthew McConaughey.&#34; This is a sign of acting excellence. When you only see the character and not the actor that is the truest sign of a great actor. There are few actors of out time that achieve this and I hope Mr. McConaughey continues to take on more roles like this. This film, while not a &#34;fun&#34; film to watch, has an excellence of realism to it which I've not seen in a film in a very long time and it was refreshingly &#34;Muddy.&#34;
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This story touched me on so many levels. I'm only sorry I had to come to the end. Beautifully written.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I'm not the type that enjoys everything that one person produces but I enjoyed bruno's greatly. I have told people they need this.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, although parts were hard to read.  I enjoyed the trail stories the most, and although I'm fairly certain I'll never hike the PCT, it did make me envy her adventure.  I envy her guts to do it, too. I enjoyed especially her enjoyment of her solitude.  It seems people don't even go out to dinner without checking this cell phone every 5 minutes.  I think everyone could benefit from some solitary and reflective time.  This book was a borrowed download from my city library, and I'm disappointed I won't be able to just pick it up and reread it some  time!
B004DAV38G|5.0|This was an interesting surprise.  I watched this with my son and my mom and we all were laughing and enjoying the movie.  Three generations enjoying a silent film is unusual but it happened.  Good for all to watch.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Excellent movie, Really cool futuristic wasteland.  Karl urban makes a kick ass dredd. Pretty good story too, I was surprised by hour good it was.

THis book is awful
B00499QUK2|5.0|Benedict is a very sexy and intelligent Sherlock.  Jeremy Brett's was intelligent and that was awesome.  I also love Robert Downey Jrs.  So sarcastic!

B004XVN1T4|4.0|Follett's hero in this tale of Israel's mid-east travails is a Jewish James Bond working for the Mossad.  It's a fast reading spy story that will delight those fond of the genre.

I am glad I read it.
B00006G8K0|5.0|In 1958, i was 12 years old visiting my cousins in a small town.  My  Aunt let us go to the movies as a special treat.  My cousins were 12 and 15.<br /><br />We were traumatized!!!<br /><br />i slept that night with a baseball bat; my 12 yr old boy cousin slept with a hunting knife.  His 15 year old sister slept with a crucifix.  We stole my Aunt Dot's garlic from the kitchen and carefully placed it the window sills.  We are now all in our 60's and love to talk about how scared we were coming out of that theater. It was a great time for us.  I should point out they lived in a wooded area and had bats in the yard at night.<br /><br />Thanks, Drac, for the fun memories.

B00DAXXO98|4.0|Both my husband an I are enjoying this series . . . it gets slow in places and you seldom think &#34;oh my god, I cn hardly wait till next week&#34; but he characters are interesting and the plot intriguing.
B008AYA7WE|1.0|Not only do the ads interrupt your game over and over, but the game keeps going behind the ad. Some ads reset your game so that you have to start over!<br /><br />I can't believe that someone thought that was a good idea.
B0089LOG02|5.0|It's difficult to find a book you become engrossed after the first page, but this one made the cut.  It has a little of everything; tragedy, heartbreak, love, suspense, history, and revelation. This book is a page turner and is one you can't stop reading.  So settle in and enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game can u can ever get!! I love all of the obsticals, and battles u have to go through! SO MUCH FUN!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved how the author connected the characters' lives together.  It makes you think about being in each of the characters' life experience.  Great read for any woman going through any difficult time in their life.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Good value-made in China. Its not the best at sharpening my &#34;SOG Tactical Tomahawk&#34;. It can set an edge but almost incapable of making a sharp blade, at least on my tomahawk. Also there appears to by some rust on the carbide sharpener and the body is a little rough-looking.
B0013ND36G|4.0|I really love the trilogy and although this is not the best one I wanted it. The disc and menus are really entertaining.
030746363X|4.0|I've just read the weight loss part.  I found it very interesting reading, although somewhat uneven--lots of detail and examples in many places, very little in others.  The bottom line, though, is that after 3 weeks, it seems to be working better and to be more doable than other diet plans I've tried.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|This is one of those classic science fiction movies that will always be good, the special effects, the music and the starring.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|I love this series and this was the best episode of the group.  As usual, plenty of action and great acting.
B000YAA68C|3.0|It's a sweet story.  There are several entertaining scenes.  Gerry's accent is not the best but he is adorable anyway.  It's okay....maybe slightly better than okay.
B0023SDQB2|5.0|It's like holding up mirrors of sensibility, reflecting both the artist's seismic awareness that the world is shifting in contemporaneous early 20th C. culture (witness Picasso, Braque, Britten, etc.), quoting actual poetry, and putting you in the mind of the sensitive spirits who question the relationship between honor, individual integrity, the relationship between old wisdom and young perception. Biblical references to the ethic that informs our culture, and the brilliantly honed contrast between a sense of place/memory of verdant, fertile England of memory and the muddy colorless landscape of battlefields stripped of all but gray metal, the stench of sulfurous hell, and the ultimate confrontation between the obligation of the young to carry out the vision of the old...the meter of this fictional prose reads like poetry in and of itself. I loved this book.
B00009NHC5|4.0|I adore Audrey Hepburn.  I'm game for any movie she is in.  When this one was pitched as suspenseful and scary, I had my doubts.  An Audrey Hepburn thriller?  I was wrong.  It's shockingly suspenseful and, as always, Ms. Hepburn is beautiful, classy, and convincing.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Believe the reviews, this is a really good album!  I am a casual AiC fan, but I believe any fan of guitar driven rock with great harmony vocals will appreciate this collection of songs.  I'm listening to \\"Private Hell\\" as I write this and am taken back to \\"Deja Vu\\" era CSN&Y--the verses remind me of that feel--just a great tune!  \\"Your Decision\\" is as good a song as anything AiC has ever done.  If radio wasn't so lame it would be another huge hit for them.  \\"Take Her Out\\" and \\"All Secrets Known\\" are also stellar cuts.  I really like Cantrell's mid-tempo songs, but you make like some of the heavier rockers--there are several on this CD.  One thing AiC does not get enough credit for is the rhythm section.  Both the drummer and bassist have a great feel for what each song needs and play for the song, not for themselves.  Great band, even without their original singer.  If you have ever been even a casual fan of this band, check this album out, you will not be disappointed.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What an amazing series!  I love the characters...upstairs and downstairs!  The storyline draws you in and is ever changing and ever charming.  They do a great job of balancing the story lines of such an ensemble cast.  Every character gets their turn in the spotlight. Each character is treated with dignity.  I can never decide who is my favorite....whoever is on screen at the moment!  Maggie Smith's character makes me laugh out loud in nearly every episode.  Shirley McClain is a fun addition for season 3.  I can't wait for season 4!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This novel is a MUST-read for every parent and teacher.  Auggie has a facial abnormality and his parents enroll him in fifth grade after being homeschooled his whole life. The main character may be a fifth grader, but this is a story about parent, siblings, teachers, and friends.  My tears are streaming ( which makes it tough to write this review), but this isn't a sad book at all.  This is a simple, touching story about love and acceptance. I would give this ten stars if I could!!!
1936719010|3.0|In `Do the Work' Steven Pressfield writes a neat little sermon that will very likely stir you up.<br /><br />Did I say sermon? Yup. Packaged as self-help for creative types this is really a religious screed with lots of yelling and with all the contradictions you expect from true believers. I thought, as I read through the first parts of the book, that the problem for most right-brainers is that the forces of the universe are aligned against you: in Pressfield's religion it's called Resistance. Everything in creation is lined up to fight you. Then, later on, I learned that the answer to the growling cosmos is that, well, the universe is on your side and wants to elevate you above your petty laziness. You have to go with the flow, `trust the soup', and let the universe guide you. Oh well. But not to worry: like any good preacher who has outlined the problem he now offers salvation: stay stupid.  All that rational, logical, thinky, figure-it-out kind of stuff just feeds the fear and resistance. Skirt the mess by staying stupid. It doesn't quite work for me but if it helps you get your first draft done then great.<br /><br />The wonder of self-help is that everyone can find something useful. His hammering manta of Do it! is a message we can all be reminded of and he offers several helps common to much of self-help: figure out the big picture, chunk it down, keep expanding the outline - all good stuff. So it's a worthy book that I enjoyed. It can be read straight through in less than an hour and has a place on just about anyone's bookshelf.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awsome app but there is aweird glich that just happened where a bunch of my places turned in to creative  with no name even if it was on survival which is realy bad please help fix please!

B00915G6MG|5.0|this show is awsome. i like all the characters and its very entertaining. I hope Gibbs never leaves the show.
B00821OX98|5.0|Been watching this show since it's premiere and loved every episode. After the 3rd season, I felt like re-watching the first-and it is nice to revisit the beginnings. highly recommended for sci fi lovers
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have enjoyed playing Mahjong.  The lay outs were great. I was disappointed that it ended so soon and now I have to pay more to play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot say enough about this series.  I had a gift card for Amazon and decided to purchase Season 3.  I loved every episode of it and plan on watching it again. That's how great it is.  The actors in it are wonderful especially Maggie Smith.  It is just so interesting to watch and become involved in the lives of the characters.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Warm, romantic, funny. This is a movie where less is more.  Simple themes, realistic characters, a slice of life that is very special.  You will find yourself thinking about it days later and it will find its way into your top ten.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely amazing show. The last five minutes were not my favorite but that doesn't take away from the amazing cast, writing and cinematography!
B009AY04A8|4.0|My first hidden object game. It was fun to play. I would like to be able to make the screen larger in some of the screens. I had trouble with some of the objects being small. There was way to much dialog, toward the end of the game I just skipped it. Disappointed the game just ended. I would have really mad if I would have paid for it. But I got it free.
0060594896|4.0|Awesome book on how to get a new lease on life with sound principle and applications.this is a great book for anyone.
1452126577|5.0|Best word to describe this book &#34; Hilarious.&#34; Great gift for any cat lovers with a good sense of humor
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed  the intermingling of characters. I wanted to know all about each ones' next step and how it was to relate to the other characters. My first book by this author. Thoroughly pleased.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It's just BLAH. How else can I put this? The story got interesting maybe twice in the entire book and was very short lived. Too much mundane 'we went here and had sex, then we went here and wanted to have sex but then had sex later'. After 2 books, just simply disappointing. Bad writing all around.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It kept you guessing!  I enjoyed it!  I thought it had entertainment right up to the end. Go rent it! :-)
B00E0SX118|5.0|I've been waiting forever forever for this movie to come out. Some people blew this off when they saw the previews. But when I saw it, it was a great family movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it. Best game on FB<br />The VIP leaves a lot to be desired for the cost.<br />As a free game it is great but the monthly fee to play an extra or free tourney is not worth the money. Early. entry to new games doesn't happen often enough to make it worth it.
B005544V6A|5.0|This program is a standard of what good tv drama should strive for. It has great writting, great acting, likeable characters, and great originality. The concept is fresh and the setting, while a little convoluted at times, works in a way all good tv works, it suspends reality just enough to be acceptable, accessible and believable.<br />I discovered this series shortly after it started and now I consume it religiously. Thank you amazon prime for giving me the option of going back and tewatching the first and secon seaosns and catching up on minor things I may have missed. Doing so has also given me appreciation to the shows attention to detail. They have been very conscientious about  keeping a tight reign on the time line and events from the  past and integrating them into the  current season's episodes. Highly recommend it!!!!
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I thought this album was good! :)  I was really blown away with Zac's voice. Taylor better watch out because I think Zac out sang him on this album. My favorite song was Juliet. All 3 brothers are very talented and I am surprised that they are not more famous than they are. I would like to see them do an album with their younger brother, Mac and there 3 sisters. I think that would be incredible and I think that would put them father ahead in all their careers. Another thing, I would like to know where can you buy there beer, MMMM-Hop?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I can listen to this album over and over. There is a  profound maturity to her voice and musical styling that she was still finding and defining in &#34;19&#34; .<br />Adele's  pain and passion come through quite readily. She has a wonderfully powerful voice.<br />Everyone will find something to identify with in this album, from the humor in &#34;Rumor has It&#34;- (I snicker every time I hear it.)<br />To the  Passion in &#34;Rolling In the Deep&#34;, I desperately want to sing along, fortunately, wisdom prevents me from doing so in public.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love this show! :0) I LOVE the caharacter, Daryl Dixon. The whole cast is great, but Norman Reedus's character, Darly stands out above the rest, even though he is not the main character.....Daryl is a true meaning to the word HERO!  I love every part of this show, except the baby's name, Judith...that sound like an elderly librarian name. The could of given the baby a better name, even Lil' Asskicker (Daryl's nickname for the baby) sounds better than Judith.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|It just needs to be fanned into a full flame.  Adele writes her own lyrics, and the pain of betrayal is apparent.<br />However, she hasn't found her full voice yet.<br />I liked &#34;21&#34; much more, and look forward to her future albums.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Not as good as iron man 1, but still a must see!  But you can wait till the DVD release.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great movie i saw it a couple of times on television so the wife and i liked it so much we decided to order it for the price you can not bet it. almost as cheap as renting it. very entertaining
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game to pass time. I highly recommended for ppl who like mental challenges.  It is addictive though so only play it if you have time.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This movie was really good, from beginning to end. I was not sure about the movie at first, but if you like science fiction it is a must see.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|If I had to pick just one thing with me to a desert island, it would be a Hot Fuzz DVD.  Even if I only had an old NTSC CRT TV and a PAL Betamax player.  I could relive the awesome moments in my head until I died of exposure.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Sucked you in the moment you start watching. The period pieces are beautiful. The characters are lovable and not all at the same time. Totally surprised by some of the event that took place this season!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This was a good game choice for me. It was just challenging enough. With a lot of levels and shapes.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|i love the notepad app. i use it for a lot of things. easy to use stoked it was free
B00DWZHTOU|1.0|Very early into it I was frustrated in knowing all of this is a movie and computer generated....it didn't feel right. Granted, lits if movies are made that way but it's not supposed to be felt as you watching it. I felt it was pointless after that.  I don't know why so many people are rating it so high.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Better than season 2!!! Can't wait for season 3 to start in a few weeks!! Hopefully it's just as good!
1909313033|4.0|This is a cute book written by someone who obviously knows the idiosyncrasies of the adorable Pug breed. I laughed while recognizing my own pugs behaviors on each page. I would recommend it to all Pug owners and to dog lovers in general.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Me Before You will give you the feels to match the soggy weather: after all, what goes better with a rainy day than a good cry? In the end, I was left with a warm, fuzzy feeling of hope and well-being.<br /><br />Louisa Clark is stuck. She's stuck in a town with no possibilities, with a boyfriend who ignores her and she's about to lose her job. When the caf&eacute; she's worked at forever goes under, it's straight to the employment center for Lou. She's scraping the bottom of the barrel when she accepts a job caring for quadriplegic Will Traynor - but the gig isn't at all what she expected. Will isn't the old decrepit she anticipated - he's actually not that much older than her, sharp as a tack and gorgeous.<br /><br />Me Before You is more than a romance story - it's about healing and living your life. Lou's determined to show Will that he still has so much to live for despite his condition: but it turns out, he might just be the one to save her.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just another great app. A very smart option if you already own a device that allows you to read online.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|With an enjoyable plot and action-packed adventure, this film was good for all audiences, not just the sci-fi types. Some casting is better than others, but overall, good choices for the characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well written and the actors are pretty awesome too! Can't wait for the next season to come out!!! d b
B00BP4W3WI|5.0|I loved it then and I loved watching it with my kids now. The effects are still fantastic and very believable. I laughed and I cried. A fantastic family film.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer just keeps getting better & better. The evolution of his style is perfection. Love how he infuses blues into his album.
B004WMKXWM|4.0|Glad that Part 2 came out shortly afterwards! The Potter films are always entertaining, and this one was extra dark on top of that.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun game play just a few minutes a day .  It updates daily with new search and find goals.  It is free so I would recommend it.  Basically recharges everyday.
B008469DGY|3.0|I had a 'flick' football app that was fun for awhile so though I'd try this. The mechanics weren't predictable but I guess that's was part of the game.<br />The first 3 'courses' were interesting at the third it has become almost impossible to go to the next with the score required that might be unattainable.<br />I'll play a few more times because has become a bit boring for me.
B00B7NPRY8|4.0|Good read.  Read it for the first time, born in 84, wasn't disappointed.  I also read the bit from the authors son at the end.  Pretty interesting.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Starts a bit difficulty, but keep reading it all comes together for a great story about the secrets we all carry and the impacts they have on our lives.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My husband suggested I use this on my Nextbook tablet and it is amazing. Very easy to use, even if you're not very tech savvy like me. It cleared up a lot of room in just a minute! Love it!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Could not wait til this game came out. My godson and I love it. Addicting. Can not stop playing it.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Great series, shame it had to end. I want more. Please bring it back. Loved the cast reunion. Any chance of a return?
B00DZV15FU|5.0|An extremely interesting and gripping novel. I recommend it to any girl with a favourtism towards romance. Jane Austen's characters are amazingly detailed and extremely interesting to study. Loved this book!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finally an end. Not as great as I hoped but satisfying anyway. Can evil ever be fully conquered? That's it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is a fantastic distraction when things get a little hectic. The background noises that the minions make as you progress through the game makes me chuckle.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|easy and fun<br />just enough strategy to keep you wanting to play.  I have really enjoyed playing this game while I wait for things.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg! This app is awesome! I spend hours of playing this game! And the best part is that it never gets old! (My ten year old made this review. She doesn't really spend hours playing it but she does like it.)
B009YU62H2|5.0|Probably the best new album on the year.  Great, hard rock 'n' roll with a few songs that slow it down a little.  Being a Soundgarden fan since the early 90's, I was scared to listen to this after all these years in case of disappointment.  I was wrong, this album was very good.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|World War Z(released June/13)stars,among others,Brad Pitt,Mireille Enos,James Badge Dale and Matthew Fox.This is a film that seemed to have alot of potential, but it was saddled with a been-there,done-that script and a star who virtually snoozes his way through everything.Pitt has no more charisma or the feeling of a leading man than any of his costars do.He is totally vanilla.<br />The story introduces us to Pitt,his wife and two children.They are stuck in traffic in Philadelphia,when their vehicle mirror gets ripped off.As he steps out to investigate an explosion in the distant goes off.Then a traffic cop on a bike comes by telling Pitt to get in his car.Just then a garbage truck runs the cop over.Pitt follows the truck and is eventually fleeing towards Newark,away from.....? There Pitt contacts the Secretary of the U.N.who will send a helicopter to rescue him and his family.The family is eventually spirited away to a ship off the New York coast.It seems Pitt was a former forces member who the Navy wants to redeploy to help them with this sudden outbreak of a deadly virus on the human population.<br />Pitt takes a team to Korea,with a virologist in tow.The virologist is killed and there is no credible lead there as to the nature of the viral outbreak anyway.What is left of the group flies next to Jerusalem.The city is under siege and has erected a wall to keep the zombies out.They got tipped off by some intelligence just before the outbreak.While there Pitt witnesses a Muslim group,brought into the city,celebrate over loudspeakers.The loud noise attracts the zombies outside the wall who try enmass to enter.(the scene in the trailers showing this human wave trying to climb over each other up a wall,is that moment).The zombies enter the city and it is a mad dash to leave by plane.Pitt and an Israeli soldier make it onto an airliner.The airliner flies them to Wales and to a World Health Organization outpost.During the flight a zombie has got aboard somehow and it has infected just about the entire plane.It crash lands in the Wales countryside.Pitt and the soldier make it to the WHO compound.The compound itself is under siege by some of its own former staff.The ones left figure out that the zombies don't touch those that are lame or sick.Pitt manages to make it to a section of the labs that has some pathogens stored there.Pitt injects himself with some and he is able to walk right by them untouched.This leads to a viral serum being developed which gives the armed forces a big advantage in containing the threat and Pitt is reunited with his family in Nova Scotia.<br />Not only is Pitt so utterly vanilla in this picture,the film has quite amateurish S/FX.Any scene,such as the zombies climbing over each other to scale tall walls,like the Jerusalem scene,are terribly fake looking.On top of this,the film just cannot strike a moment where it can generate any level of excitement or tension for any length of time.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1.There are no specials.<br />All in all this movie is the Pitts,and that's where alot of the blame lies for its feel.He holds any modicum of emotion in check and thus exudes no enthusiasm from the viewers perspective.The film itself has a second rate script(seen it all before)and it fails in its own job to create any excitement.Go watch any Resident Evil film and get some proper zombie kicks,not this RE wanna be.Zzzzzzz.2 1/2-3 stars.infected just about the entire plane.It crash lands in the Wales countryside.Pitt and the soldier make it to the WHO compound.The compound itself is under siege by some of its own former staff.The ones left figure out that the zombies don't touch those that are lame or sick.Pitt manages to make it to a section of the labs that has some pathogens stored there.Pitt injects himself with some and he is able to walk right by them untouched.This leads to a viral serum being developed which gives the armed forces a big advantage in containing the threat and Pitt is reunited with his family in Nova Scotia.<br />Not only is Pitt so utterly vanilla in this picture,the film has quite amateurish S/FX.Any scene,such as the zombies climbing over each other to scale tall walls,like the Jerusalem scene,are terribly fake looking.On top of this,the film just cannot strike a moment where it can generate any level of excitement or tension for any length of time.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1.There are no specials.<br />All in all this movie is the Pitts,and that's where alot of the blame lies for its feel.He holds any modicum of emotion in check and thus exudes no enthusiasm from the viewers perspective.The film itself has a second rate script(seen it all before)and it fails in its own job to create any excitement.Go watch any Resident Evil film and get some proper zombie kicks,not this RE wanna be.Zzzzzzz.2 1/2-3 stars.

B000002U9L|5.0|I enjoy listening to the songs. I enjoy the soundtrack to this movie. I like the cd that comes with a free mp3.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series!! Watched all three seasons in about 1 week! I have to say the finale was gut wrenching. There were some very disappointing parts in the season and you will undoubtably cry a few times. Can't wait for the 4th to air on PBS
B006MW3V6U|5.0|loved this season!!!! It made me cry and that's a hard task to do!! Can't wait to watch season 3
B005USZYDU|4.0|I didn't realize this was written for a young person but it was good.  Then end was rather abrupt.  I thought I was missing some pages.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Absolutely hilarious. The characters have chemistry and the actors are fabulous. If u love to laugh this is for u
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series for history buffs. What a grand lifestyle they lived. But, they still had the same pains and tragedies that the lower and middle classes suffered. I did not like the endinf of the last episode.  What is Mary going to do without Matthew?
B0030V0PEW|4.0|Very fascinating, lots of useful knowledge, much of it can be extrapolated into my own life and way of doing things. A small bit of humor. Could get 5 stars with more humor. I like more humor in my books, but still, still it was pretty darn good.

B00BE97ONM|5.0|\\"Actions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions - it's like a dream.\\" This is a quote from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's famous novel, Crime and Punishment, but it may as well be describing Ben Green, the troubled young protagonist of the novel \\"Son of a Serial Killer\\" by Jams N. Roses.<br /><br />This novel is truly frightening, but not because of the string of murders that are being left unsolved. It is frightening and terrifying because of what is happening to Ben and what most of us are probably afraid of even if we don't readily admit it. Ben is losing his mind and his sanity, and he knows it. He's fighting back, trying to get back to his former self, normal, nice, and balanced, but that goal gets further and further out of reach as the story progresses. Just the thought of watching myself lose my mind and not being able to do anything about it sent chills down my spine.<br /><br />Ben's thinking patterns are placed at the center of this thriller, and it is Ben who largely drives the plot. One of the most powerful recurring images in this book is a mirror in which Ben sees not only his old familiar self but his new self, the personality full of malice and evil, that is gradually taking over his life. \\"What am I doing with my life?\\" and \\"What was I born to be?\\" are some of the questions that Ben asks of the reflection in the mirror. And it takes him a long time to find the right answers. The ending of the book is tragic by conventional standards, but I have to quote Dostoyevsky again who said, \\"the greatest happiness is to know the source of unhappiness,\\" and in that sense, Ben's story ends happily.<br /><br />But it's not just Ben's character that is interesting and multidimensional. So are the secondary characters. Detective Summers is fighting her own demons as she is trying to solve the case of The Phantom killer: not only does she have a personal connection to the case, but she also has trouble managing her stress level and resorts to self-destructive measures but effective to keep herself balanced, ironic and counterintuitive as it seems.  The benefits of counterintuitive thinking is another strong theme in this novel. There's a long-time girlfriend who turns out to be less loyal and less caring than a woman who was supposed to be just a one-night stand. There's Ben's complicated relationship with his parents, both of whom seem to love him and want the best for him, but that also turns out to be not the way he perceived most of his life.<br /><br />The novel starts out with a quote about genetic disorders that are already present in a human being before birth, and it comes full-circle to that same point at the end when controversial questions are raised about life and death. Is it right to end a life if this life is bound to create more death once it is fully developed? Can our minds, medicated, self-medicated, or otherwise, be more powerful than the genetics we have inherited?<br /><br />This novel is deeper and richer than one might think just by reading the sample on amazon. Some reviewers have commented that they were turned off by the graphic descriptions in the first few pages, but they should have kept reading. I believe that the intent of those first few pages is to alert the readers to the idea that this novel will not shy away from deepest and darkest corners of the human soul and the human existence. But despite a lot of the darkness, Ben's story has a lot of hope to it, no matter how counterintuitive it may seem. But counterintuitive is one of the themes here, isn't it? Definitely recommended.n to the case, but she also has trouble managing her stress level and resorts to self-destructive measures but effective to keep herself balanced, ironic and counterintuitive as it seems.

B00DIMXTBO|5.0|\\"Outin\\" is the second book in Brandt Legg's Inner Movement science fiction/fantasy trilogy in which Nate, the protagonist, continues his quest to discover secrets of the past and avoid Lightyear. And the stakes are even higher in this story.<br /><br />The book has all the elements that make is an exciting thriller: there's time travel, loss of friends, decisions that can make a difference between life and death, love, and action-packed scenes. All those elements add up to a fantastic book, but that's what's visible on the surface, on the level of plot.<br /><br />There's much more to the story that many readers will find appealing. What I enjoyed most about this book (as well as the first book,\\"Outview\\") are the insightful philosophical and spiritual observations and beautifully-written imaginative descriptions that are woven into the fabric of the plot and into the lives of the characters. Here are some of them:  \\"...only one thing can steal your powers - fear,\\" \\"the future is a murky place shrouded by fog,\\" and  \\"fear prevents much.\\" The theme of fear and overcoming fear to reach goals is a recurring one in this book, and the readers can't help but question their own ways of dealing with fear in their lives.<br /><br />I love Brandt Legg's use of language. He is a writer and a photographer, so his keen power of observation doesn't come as a surprise. But it still delights. I loved his description of the Rainbow Lake, with its \\"pockets and bands of bright Kool-Aid colored water - reds mixing with yellows, blending to orange, yellow overlapping blue turning green.\\" What a cinematic image, making the lake come alive on the pages of this exciting novel!<br /><br />The language of this novel is precise and descriptive without being overly wordy. Here are just a couple of my favorite phrases: \\"the jumble of yellow cabs\\" (in Manhattan), \\"the joys of Dreams Lake helped disperse the morning's traumas,\\" or \\"time was attacking us from many sides.\\"<br /><br />A great novel that is both entertaining and philosophical. Recommended.hat is both entertaining and philosophical. Recommended.

B007VYQ9G2|5.0|Last year I took my Nephew to see this and I was blown away by the lose of our precious jungles.  Little Oscar was so funny but yet the movie struck a cord with my heart.  Oscar was left alone and what follows next was so surprising.  Jane Goodall is and always will be an inspiration for wildlife.  Her work with the Chimpanzee's is incredible and Disney came through once again with a movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat, making you laugh, smile, cry.  Once again, please either buy or rent it.  You will not be disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Excellent game, really enjoyable, but be warned it's very addictive. I haven't been able to work out all the strategy yet but I'm getting there.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app. I love how easy it is use. The buttons are big so you don't fat finger anything.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game is amazing I would recommend it for anyone. You should definitely get this game. Other is more than 30 characters and is amazing
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Green throws around all the right allusions, so that he flatters you into feeling in-league with these amazing kids. He's a philosopher without religion, so he's missing out on Love's big picture, but I'll soon grab another of his books.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|You can write or type notes, and the writing is smooth and fluid. You can also add pictures to the notes which is a great plus. I cant believe this is a free app, it works so well!
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|i whould rec this to my frends. mostly my mom. i like this alot. i might buy it from lil wane. i think that my mom wont like it that much.  but i love it so so so so so so so much. my brother said \\"that usher is better then lil wane\\" but i dont think so.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Great movie with memorable scenes and characters, having Cindy Lauper on the soundtrack is also a nice bonus for nostalgia.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun each one gets a little more difficult, Yes try it. Love the way the pigs laugh when you fail.
B00632HWOG|1.0|The new version is full of bugs.  Customer support is lousy at best. Standard answer to a problem is &#34;Yahoo does not deal with that go to the forum.&#34;
B00EUVC26U|5.0|I love this show.  Great writing, great directing, great acting.  And the music is perfect.  The scene which has stuck with me so far is the mother of the dead boy realizing that it is her son on the beach.  There is not only dialog but no sound from the actors, just slightly slow motion of the cops having to manhandle her away from the body as we see her scream and cry and attempt to fight her way to him.  Absolutely chilling.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|\\"World War Z\\", watched the unrated Blu Ray, the movie itself is mediocre . Brad Pitt is good but he has aged badly- Sorry. I thought the video quality was poor for a BD, looked no better than a DVD. The audio was excellent, but the BD was not worth buying because of the poor video quality.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Very informative, sometimes tribal and clan references were a little confusing, but having to pay attention when reading is not a bad thing
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|The real mystery for me was why a successful career woman would allow a man with whom she had a brief affair, knew virtually nothing about, and didn't hear from for six months, to move into her apartment just days after he shows up out of the blue.  What?<br /><br />On top of that, the story is disjointed with big gaps about how things got from point A to point B, the characters are shallow, cold and distant, and their actions and reactions to situations are implausible and silly.<br /><br />But, the book was free.  All it cost was time to get to the pretty predictable ending.  Should you read it? Depends on how much time you have on your hands.
B008VZG30M|5.0|Saw this originally many years ago and decided to watch it again after seeing Hunger Games. Although I found Hunger Games entertaining as well and refined, I still feel its a derivative of Battle Royale and I always enjoyed this movie -- original, thought provoking (have to suspend some disbelief) and all-in all entertaining.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|My daughter managed to take pictures underwater with no problem.  It is a really well built case.  Be careful not to lose the screw cap for the earplugs
B004LRNYJW|3.0|Another first for me and originally caught this in Netflix the first time. Watched it the 2nd time with my daughter and still found the storyline refreshing for a different take on vampire movies. Still enjoyed it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Glad it ended the way I wanted  it too. Too sad of an ending in some ways. Needed more depth.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Great tips for preparing and delivering presentations or speeches. Teaches you how to be much more impactful with your message. Easy to read. Better than most books about presentation techniques.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent series, acting, story, etc.  loved the wardrobe, cars etc. Didn't like ending for Season 3!  Looking forward to Season 4
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This book illustrates how the heroic acts of one single personn can changeor alter the out come of huge events.

0321344758|5.0|Steve keeps user interface (UI) or user experience (UX) simple. I guess you could say he doesn't make you think too hard. If you have any responsibilities with regards to UX/UI , this is a classic must-read.
B00EL8I8IS|1.0|I watched this movie through Direct TV before I decided to buy it digital from Amazon. The best parts of the movie are completely edited out. Totally ticked that I bought this crap version.<br />Would appreciate it if it said somewhere that it was the PG version. Wouldn't have wasted my money.<br />GREAT MOVIE, buy it unedited.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|So I've been saying for months that I feel like the only girl on earth who hasn't read Cassandra Clare. I finally remedied that! Yea! Last week, in preparation for the release of the film, I finally read City of Bones, book 1 of The Mortal Instruments.<br /><br />So I'm thinking I don't need much of a synopsis because most people know the gist, but for those who don't, Clary is a normal teenage girl with a guy best friend who obviously has a secret crush on her, and is about to find out about an unseen world she's been part of since she was born, but just never knew about. When her mom disappears and she makes friends with demon hunters no one else can see, let's just say her world gets turned upside down.<br /><br />I really liked this first book of the series. As a writer, my inner editor did come out a few times and I had to remind myself that this is YA, which means certain things are allowed, but mostly that was just me because I'm always editing my own work; not something most people would notice.<br /><br />Jace, the main love interest, was very arrogant, but I could see that it was a charming sort of arrogant, and he definitely grows on you. The twist at the end of the book (which I won't spoil) I actually knew about from hearing others talk about the series, but I thought it happened in later books. I was surprised to find the twist so early in the series.<br /><br />I have no qualms at all with the story or the characters. I probably would have hated that end twist--just like many fans did--but, again, I know something about the story and that it's not the last word on the situation. I'm happy to lay back and wait for the resolution in future books. Speaking of which, while I couldn't continue the series this week (way too much going on!) I will probably pick up book 2 next week. Can't wait!<br /><br />This is a series for anyone who likes YA, paranormal, or just a great overall story. I would highly recommend it. Besides, the film will be out next week. It's always so fun to see great books made into films, don't you think?
B000JCSBU0|3.0|This is a good film, but it is nowhere near 5 stars. The movie is worth your time, though. It is clearly above average.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Great movie!  Kept our attention the whole time!  So many great actors in this movie!  You will be trying to figure out how they do it all the up but the end.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Giving this piece of junk a 1 is too high of a grade.<br />This thing has its pros with the superior sound quality and all the little tweaks you can do with<br />its software.<br />the con is that the driver or the software you download to actually use this product<br />crashes all other drivers and usb ports.<br />Your mouse and keyboard would just not work as soon as you put the software running.<br />So you are basically left with a piece of ordinary head set that costs 100 bucks<br />since you can't use the software.<br />What hurts this product more is that it will not work at all time to time if you<br />don't use the software.<br />It will also make hissing and high pitch noise when you hook it up to charge the head set.<br />Bottom line is don't buy unless you are using Logitech mouse and keyboard that actually works<br />with the g930 gaming software.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|This is a nice piece of hardware that, on paper, does everything right: activity tracking, sleep tracking, heart rate, online integration, long battery life.<br /><br />But in practice, I find it pretty much useless since it requires constantly fiddling. It needs to go into its belt clip for daytime activities (pedometer, pulse), then into its wrist band for sleep tracking, etc. The switch from clip to wrist seems to be mandatory. And nice as the tracker hardware itself is, the wrist band and belt clip are cheap, ugly, and don't feel like they are going to last. There are no third party options.<br /><br />The device does not appear to be water proof, so getting large amounts of sweat on it during exercise might kill it. Accidentally leaving it clipped to the pants and washing them almost certainly will, and dumb as that may seem, given how small and unobtrusive the clip is, that's going to happen sooner or later.<br /><br />I'm quite satisfied with my Withings scale. But to add insult to injury, I can't even remove the useless displays for this tracker from my Withings web panel, so every time I check my progress on body fat, I'm reminded that I wasted money on this device.<br /><br />In short, I can't recommend this device yet; it was a nice attempt by Withings, but they haven't gotten the design and usability quite right yet.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|I like it but way to easy try making it harder it's fun especially if bored lol lol lol lol
0316247545|5.0|Had to buy this for my six-year-old after one of her friends told her about it. She couldn't put it down until she read it from cover to cover. She brings it with her everywhere she goes so it's good that it's a hardbound book. It tells about the different episodes and the corresponding &#34;friendship lessons&#34;, and lists the songs as well.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Unending views of growling zombies. Might frighten a 4 year old, but that's about it. Actually became a comedy. Stupid movie that leaves you hanging in the end. Ends abruptly with no resolution. What was Brad Pitt thinking ???
B005544TRQ|5.0|Well-developed and well-cast characters. Very entertaining. Not much not to like about the show but you have to see it from the beginning and in sequence or some stories won't make sense. After a while you're not sure who's the good guy; you get to like and dislike everyone at some point which creates well-balanced stories.
B007T7MIR0|1.0|A stupid APP.  Can't do anything with it except view docs.  Why even have it? Don not waste your time with it!

B00A285OOW|5.0|I really enjoyed this work.  It was very well written and had so many twists and turns that it was hard to put it down. A really great historical novels and one of the few I have read where women are the leading roles.
B001UV4XI8|3.0|Hello, this is a very entertaining movie. We watch Harry all the time. I marked it 3 stars as it met my specific purchase expectations. Definitely worth purchasing. Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter is playing the game. She thinks it's good. Anything to keep her busy. She is obsessed over it. It's great because it's free.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a great game to exercise your brain, but there aren't very many levels. Please add more!! Very similar to the 100 levels game but requires a little more thinking and problem solving.
B004XBOBCK|1.0|The DVD would not work  -- something about check your 'region'.  When i looked at the package, it states that the DVD was not allowed to be sold or distributed out of the UK.
B0091REZMW|3.0|If you can overlook all of the glitches, force closes, updates that refuse to update and various other bugs than this is actually a great game.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|It's kind of a fun what-if type movie but really just doesn't bring anything to the table.  The number one killer of this movie is the same as practically any kind of horror movie (though this is more action than horror)-predictability.  Brad Pitt does a good job in the lead role, but it's the stereotype of an action hero who can fight anyone and eventually uncovers a solution no one else can.  Watching it you know the end will be Brad Pitt figuring out a puzzle the world's top experts can't.  And that's exactly what happens.  A guy who's basically a glorified cop figures out a medical problem the world's top doctors can't?  There's also a lot of unfilled holes in the plot.  How did Brad Pitt know the people the zombies were ignoring were infected with terminal illnesses.  Why did the zombie in the plane stow away and wait?  Max Brooks himself says a zombie has no mind, it simply acts to spread the virus, and virtually every zombie in the movie acts like that.  Why was one intelligent enough to wait for the right moment?  There's more but I won't submit them all.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's a bad movie, I did enjoy watching it.  But I am saying it's just another superhero action guy main character saves everything, nothing more.  So watch it, enjoy it.  Just don't expect any plot twist you haven't seen a thousand times already.  You WILL know everything that happens before it actually does.<br /><br />One final note, I expected Max Brooks to at least make a cameo.  Let down there.  Would have been cool to see him in the movie based on his book (which I admit I haven't read and other reviews don't seem favorable to the comparison).

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great. Any youtube videos i watch on my ipad i can now watch on my big 55' HD TV easily. The quality of the stream is very good too. looks great!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|As soon as I saw this movie in theaters, I knew I just had to own it. The way it was able to get me to feel for all the characters at some point or another was just fantastic! I ended up seeing it four times while it was in theaters and then had it on pre-order a few months before it came out on DVD. I love the character arcs, with Kirk being is normal reckless self and not taking responsibility for his actions at the beginning, while Spock shows his capacity for self-sacrifice and being so wrapped up in rules. But by the end their roles have been switched, and both of them even say to each other, &#34;It's what you would've done.&#34; I was crying by that point. I even felt bad for Khan when he describes thinking he lost his entire family. I was pretty sure he couldn't be trusted, but I was seriously questioning that for a while there... I like the glimpses we get to see into Spock's and Uhura's relationship, as well. I also love it when Spock finally reveals to Kirk that he was lying through his teeth earlier when he said he chose not to feel anything when he thought he was going to die; that &#34;Vulcans never lie&#34; bit isn't true 100% of the time - *cue dramatic music*! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fiction, science fiction, or action movies; even my sister, the die hard Star Wars fan who found the first Star Trek remake to be only ok, absolutely loved this movie. I went through the emotional roller coaster, what with sympathizing with Khan, crying for Kirk, and then being enraged with Spock. I literally wanted to shout &#34;Kill him! Kill him!&#34; when Spock chases down Khan, but then with one sentence from Bones, I suddenly wanted to yell &#34;Wait Spock! Don't kill him!&#34; I can't think of another movie that has made me do a complete emotional 180 in such a short period of time like this one did :)
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|First, I grew up with Star Trek and I and my family really enjoy the series. For such allow budget production in the late 60s(?), the acting and storylines, humor, adventure, and basic good morale messages of good over evil (etc) all make for a wonderful show. Some shows are fairly corny and bad, but most are great. Absolutely love the acting of William Shatner - what a great presence he has.  The Blu Ray set itself is of high a quality as I've seen especially for show 50 years old. Not sure what else to say. I cannot tell you if the shows are out of order or if they have cut scenes etc. I dont think they have but I just dont know. From my perspective, it is a great buy.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Best book in the series!  Can't put it down after hours of reading...hopefully the new book comes out before I'm done.

0062014536|4.0|Reading \\"Requiem\\" took me through hills, shrubs, and patterns of roses and lilies that honestly I expected from such a descriptive author who knows how to tell a good story. For me, Requiem have so much going for it and then for some reason- something fell a little flat- but I still love Oliver's writings.<br /><br />As I said before, I actually enjoy Oliver's attention to detail and her beautiful action scenes told with ripping verbs and adjetives and the setting is what helps me picture this war between the Invalids and the Cureds. Essentially that is what Requiem is about. Everything is coming to a head now and Lena, the protagonist is stronger, smarter and faster. She hunts and she fights. Her best friend Hana is on the other side, cured and about to marry a heartless mayor.<br /><br />This book is told from Lena and Hana's point of view. This is what made me wary of reading the book in the first place. There is just something about two or more characters taking turns that really just cramps my reading. I think it is because I am wanting to continue the first protagonist's journey and so I suppose I am greedy that way.<br /><br />And it somehow fits into the framework of the story.<br /><br />Then there's the love triangle: Lena, Alex and Julian. I enjoy love triangles in books...if there can be a serious resolution that is. If you read \\"Pandemonium\\", the previous novel- Alex finds Lena kissing Julian and he is mad. Lena thought Alex was dead and so of course she moved on. Then in Requiem, Alex finds himself a little honey to occupy his time, but even still Lena knows he must still love her. Right?<br /><br />Meanwhile, my heart bleeds for Julian. He has fallen for Lena big time and he does everything he can to fit into the Wilds(remember his father was part of Deliria Free America or DFA) and he feels he has to prove himself. But then I wonder even now...does Julian love Lena for real or is it because she has a \\"wildness\\" about her- she is just different. Anyway, I like him.<br /><br />You have to read to find out who she ends up with and if America really does end up deliria free.<br /><br />I wish there was more to the story.<br /><br />I like how the author weaves fairytales and biblical literature in her books as well- clever.y, I like him.<br /><br />You have to read to find out who she ends up with and if America really does end up deliria free.<br /><br />I wish there was more to the story.<br /><br />I like how the author weaves fairytales and biblical literature in her books as well- clever.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought chromecast about two weeks ago from Google play. I have the device and test it thoroughly in my home network system. In my idea if you have any other device which supports Netflix and YouTube the only main feature you might look into for chromecast is its capability of casting from your chrome browser to TV.<br />I have Asus RT-AC66u as router which supports the 1.3 GB bandwidth over my wireless network and connected my PC to it through 1 GB port. This trick helps me to transfer the data close to 1 GB/S without having an Ac Wireless adapter over my wireless network. SO I can communicate with my chromecast well over the N standard speed which chromecast supports. It is good idea to use the HDMI extension cable provided with Chromecast since it acts like an antenna per what it says in manual.<br />Unfortunately still there is a lots of lag between my PC and Chromecast. I can not say I'm disappointed however it is not what I was expecting. so if you are looking for just casting the videos from your PC to TV this device still needs more improvement and based on my experience it will not satisfy you.<br />Please in comment section let me know if you have any other solution our experience to improve the chromecast network performance.

0792846443|5.0|(&#34;I'm your number one fan!&#34;) &#34;Misery&#34; is a perfect Stephen King adaptation. It is second only to &#34;The Shining&#34; in atmosphere, and scares delivered. Everyone talks about Kathy Bates' performance, and rightly so-My God, is she a tour de force of hilarious creepiness-but, don't overlook James Caan. His performance is absolutely pivitol-and he delivers one of his best. His reactions to Bates' character are perfect. Each subtle expression a glimpse of rage and terror. I am not a huge Rob Reiner fan. However, with this dark gem, and the earlier wonderful &#34;Stand By Me&#34;, he has shown an understanding, like few others, of the essence of what's great about a good Stephen King story. With both films, he crafted memorable classics, beloved by both film geeks and King fanatics alike. Anyway, I hope I didn't prattle on and make you feel all &#34;Oogy&#34;. See this film. I recommend &#34;Misery&#34; highly. (&#34;Shh Darling. Trust me. It's for the best. Almost done. Just one more....God, I love you!&#34;)
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|It is fun but after u beat all the missions it's a little boring unless u like killing for fun.
B0000X61XM|5.0|Possibly the very best sci-fi/horror film ever made. What sets it apart from so many other outer space thrillers (including its sequels), is that this is more a &#34;haunted house&#34; film with an Agatha Christy twist -- of the seven crew members, who dies next? The atmosphere created by Ridley Scott, in the spaceship and on the remote planet, is very believable. And the seven member-cast is great, as you get to know them well, which makes their deaths, mysteries and conquests all the more interesting. And scary! The Director's Cut is a nice improvement, adding scenes that give more banter between the crew members, more time on the creepy alien spaceship, and what actually happened to Dallas and Brett. One of my favorite scary movies, made even better!
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Loved it from page 1 and could not put it down until the end....<br />Highly recommendable - I'm absolutely taken in by Marian Keyes writing.

1884883303|4.0|Very informative, well explained.<br />Good photographs, the clearly arranged section in all chapters makes it easy to find important and relevant information purposefully and simply.<br />Some items (brands) are missing.<br />For all string instrument enthusiasts.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|The film was exactly what I expected - a two hour diversion featuring improbable fight sequences and unlikely vehicular chases and crashes.  Definitely not for kids, but an occasional laugh and rah rah moments.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|If you pay attention to where the shadow is, the snap-to function works well. It can be tricky to hover the piece where you want it to go without missing, though. Other reviewers pointed out that it has only a passing resemblance to Tetris, which is correct, but it is still a decent and entertaining game.<br />Overall, the game is fun, can be challenging, and is a great way to pass time waiting in car for kids, or at appointments.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Enjoyable flick and much better than the Stallone movie Judge Dredd. A lot of dark future movies have ridiculous set ups, but the action can be tons of fun. Much better than I expected.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|You can see all Harry's character flaws as starting issues in this book. They are unformed, and incomplete, but not to worry, as eventually all his demons rise to the fore, taking over and guiding the detective unerringly after the killer.<br /><br />We can see much of Harry's future character take root here and know how he will grow into the larger than life character we love in the Leopard, and The Snowman, (among others.)<br /><br />For those of you new to the series, The Bat is a recent release here in the States. It should be your first read.<br /><br />I hope Nesbø comes from long-lived stock. I want him to keep releasing new novels for decades to come<br /><br />By the way, Harry's last name is pronounced &#34;Hoo-leh&#34; according to Harry in this book.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have been enthralled with Tolkien's magical kingdom since I first read &#34;The Hobbit&#34; years ago.  This film certainly does the author credit.  The script has stayed true to Tolkien's story and the actors are superb.  Well worth the cost.  Now, where is the next installment?
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I realize that this version of the Superman saga is a total reboot. The Christopher Reeve stories  do not exist. It is an origin story told in great detail. But it can't just be me. The similarities between Reeve & Henry Cavill are pretty obvious. But there can't be too much wiggle room there. Both are good-looking physical specimens. \\"I've lived in Kansas for the last 30 years.\\" Yeah he's All American. The epic begins of course with The eminent destruction of Krypton. Jor-El is having difficulties with Gen Zod & sends son KAl-El (Clark)  to Earth. That's the short version we all know. Jor-El dies but reappears  to move the story along. Clark hooks up with Lois of course & has an epic battle with Zod, with vast destruction. I guess I haven't told anything yet. This all happens before Clark ever gets a job at the Daily Planet. Lots more of course But I'm out of time. Russell Crowe & Kevin Costner add a bit of class to the proceedings with excellent portrayals of Superman's fathers.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest, however this app on the kindle fire is awful! It crashes ALL the time. Now when I go to pin something I can't even see my boards.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn was the best at what he did. I remember meeting him at Sam's Club in Woodbury a few years ago and he was very personable. Every time he was on KQRS it was amazing to here him talk. Even on Joe Souchery's show on am1500. He was among my favorite authors with Clive Cussler. Vince knew how to spin a yarn!! I will miss him and his books. RIP Vince.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|The Grateful Dead are in their prime element audience for this benefit concert and they blow the barn doors off the place. An amazing show with a very interesting bonus disc of a movie.<br /><br />For me the home movie is a bonus disc because I only wanted to hear the music but I think the film is totally worth the extra bucks. It portrays an honest, interesting place and time in American history. But damn it did they need to keep showing that one hippie behind the band trying to screw that tree stump over and over? Some of these people needed to put their pants back on.<br /><br />With Ken Kesey and maybe too many hallucinogens in the mix what can you expect? A bizarre sight collage / animation during an epic Dark Star definitely caught me off guard as well. Weirdness splashed through some fantastic footage of the band playing their best to their fans and their families.<br /><br />In home movies families can sometimes look dysfunctional, but they love each other.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Thousands of years ago, science and religion separated and took separate paths. As Rabbi Joel Bakst said so well, \\"Because of the collapse of consciousness, spiritual and scientific knowledge split apart. Both these modes of knowing have to come together. In other words, science and technology from a traditional religious perspective is not an extra. It is part of the process by which humanity is going to evolve into its next stage.\\"<br /><br />E-squared is this very merging of science and religion back into one path, albeit in a very young and sometimes immature form. It is a mixture of very positive Christianity, quantum physics, and esoteric \\"think and grow rich\\" information (in the tradition of \\"Tapping the Source: Using the Master Key System for Abundance and Happiness,\\" by John Selby, Richard Greninger, William Gladstone and Jack Canfield).<br /><br />Despite this being a somewhat eclectic combination of subjects, Pam Grout manages to weave them all into one congruent work that is truly inspiring. The main thesis of the book is that, not only can you do anything that you truly put your mind to, but that there is a quantum source field out there that will turn your thoughts into reality. At this point if this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, I would like to point out that the book is worth the price just for the collection of quotes it contains.<br /><br />In science, there are two opposing viewpoints. On one side, there is the chaos and randomness theory, where everything is a product of blind luck and random probability (\\"The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives\\" by Leonard Mlodinow ). At the other end of the spectrum, there are real scientist that saw so much order emerge from the chaos, that they became religious (\\"The Language of God,\\" by Francis S. Collins).<br /><br />Pam Grout would be far on the latter side of the argument. Just as the Nicki Minaj lyrics say so well in a single line, Pam Grout is not lucky, she's blessed (and then some).Well, the purpose of E-squared is not just tell you that you are blessed, but offers experiments in order to prove that your thoughts also create your reality.<br /><br />To a degree, I think Pam is right. I do not consider myself to be psychic, nor do I think I have any abilities that anybody else does not possess. I have had, however, on so many occasions, thought about something, only to have in a time frame of hours to days, have that thought happen. Be it as simple as thinking about a person I haven't seen in forever, and then have that person call or email within a few days of thinking about them, to as onerous as wondering how long a certain household appliance is going to last before it breaks...only to have it break in a few days.<br /><br />In the Newtonian reality we were taught in school, it is statistically impossible that my experiences happened by random chance, time after time. The only logical conclusion is that we do not live in the normal reality we thought we did. However, in the new science of quantum physics, these events start to make sense.<br /><br />Having put a lot of time and study into this area over the last few years, I'm going to put down some of the thoughts I had while reading \\"E-squared.\\"<br /><br />1) In the book, \\"The Field,\\" by Lynne McTaggart, they found that random number generators were influenced by human thought (which again, should be impossible). However, the influence was even greater when more people concentrated in unison on a particular outcome. The opposite was true and they had less influence if the people wanted opposing outcomes. For example, the readings were negligible for a large event like the Super Bowl, where people cancel each other out, but quite remarkable for an event like 9/11 where everyone was in unity.<br /><br />The lesson? Your reality is not the only reality. Just because you create your reality, does not mean you can automatically override other people's reality.<br /><br />2) This subject gets really close into an area of Word of Faithers and \\"Name It, Claim It\\" teachers. If you watch movies like \\"The Secret,\\" one person will say the purpose of this is not to \\"get stuff,\\" and the next person will say if you do this, you can get lots of stuff. \\"E-squared\\" is contradictory like this, as well. In studying subjects like Remote Viewing, those who do it say that they cannot see things that they can profit from. For example, they cannot see lottery numbers from the future, so that they can use them to get rich. There are other indications that the Universe seems to frown upon using it for personal gain, as well.<br /><br />I'm both convinced that we create our own realities, to a degree, and that God isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. I think \\"E-squared\\" struck the right balance here, but I must admit it worried me in a couple of places.<br /><br />3) People have a strong negativity bias. It takes a way more positive event -- or even multiple positive events -- to offset a single negative event. People always say that if they are wrong about Christianity, then at wost they spent their lives with good people and had good times. If Pam Grout is wrong about \\"E-squared,\\" then the wost thing that could happen is that people attempt to remain positive, healthy and happy. Pam has the same Bible that all Christians have, and yet three-fourths or more of Christians constantly think about the world devolving into a Mad Max-like state.<br /><br />As Richard Rohr said in \\"Things Hidden,\\" anyone reading the Bible could make the case for any position they wanted using prooftexting (using isolated quotations from a document to establish a proposition). We have been manipulated with Scripture since it has been written (and orally before that). Through a lot of study, I believe that the orthodoxy we grew up with was partially formulated in Rome to control the masses thousands of years ago, and by our negativity bias in the present. The point is, we focus on all the wrong things in the Bible, as opposed to the things we should focus on. On one hand, to put it bluntly, we have been brainwashed, and on the other hand it's in our negatively-biased nature.<br /><br />We are at a point where if we are going to survive, we are going to have to evolve our way of thinking. \\"E-squared\\" is that evolution. If we do indeed create our reality, then what exactly are we creating when we, as a population, think constantly on wars and rumors of war? On hate and destruction?<br /><br />Our reality is ours for the creating. Are we going to do the right thing, or the wrong thing? This is part of the process by which humanity is going to evolve into its next stage.

B002JXK5VU|5.0|I never watched this series when it was on TV but my sister recommended I take a look at it........great suggestion!  I was hooked from the start and look forward to see how the stories unfold.
B005MVRCU8|4.0|The box was obviously damaged when it was put in the shipping box.  Had I had time to return it I would have.  Again, disappointing.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Stock fan is extremely quiet. The processing power on this is incredible and the integrated graphics are perfect for low end games such as minecraft, cod, ect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the best game that I have played in a long time, I am surprises that it is free, you should get it.
0449009521|5.0|Gripping, well-written, well-read suspense novel. Prepare to not want to do anything else until you reach the end of this adventure.
B0000714BP|5.0|I love this hilarious movie and the hilarious cast.  Amazing that they turned out to be a beautiful as they were.
B00122DF16|4.0|Fantastic remix of linkin parks best album hybrid theory. For best results listen loud and on a good system. Good buy!
1416563156|5.0|Great memorabilia from the movies.  Its too bad they didn't include every written page that was in Indys book.  That was the first thing my son noticed.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Wasn't crazy about the beginning, it was hard to top the last one, but get beyond that and the movie is action packed through to the end.  Funny, scarey, exhilarating.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I heard them for the fist time on one of the morning shows and had to immediately go out and purchase. I listen all the time. Every single song is great.
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|Every song on this album is great.  I do like this album better than his previous solo album, Static Impulse.  James is a fantastic vocalist with amazing musicians surrounding him.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Man I love this song.  I really feel this song is from the future.  These dudes went back in time, and dug up some old style the way they used to do music relics of loves past, and then turned it on its head, and sent this song into the future.  We are who, we are up all night to get lucky, and she's up all night to have fun.  This song will be forever a Gem.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|The book is an interesting read.  The author tells you from the start not to read it cover-to-cover, just read the chapters that concern you.  I have read most of the book at this point, but was most concerned with losing the gut I have developed over the years.  As of this writing, I have been on the diet for 3 weeks and have lost 12.12 overall inches, four of which came off my waist, and 14.8 pounds.  I am still above 30% body fat, so I have a ways to go yet, but I'm trending in the right direction.<br /><br />Mr. Ferris keeps it interesting, writing in a conversational tone that is easy to follow.  He does delve into the bio-chemistry of why his techniques work, for those who are interested.  He does, however, call it out in a way that lets the layman skip it if they lose interest.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Not only well written, but well researched.  Fascinating characters and cultural intricacies.  I would (and have) recommended this book to everyone.  The characters and plot stayed with me long after I finished the book.  Will read it again in the future.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Love it. Best Star Trek film ever. The twists and turns had me on the edge of my seat the entire film.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Loved the show when it was playing. The cast was amazing, and making Starbuck female instead of male, like in the original series, was a stroke of genius. Special notice should be made of Mary McDonnell as the President, Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck, and James Callis as Baltar. That none of them was nominated for an Emmy is ridiculous. Production values were excellent and the storylines were occasionally very hard-hitting. Highly recommended.
B00488SU02|5.0|Really makes you think. I watched this for an ethics course while discussing the death penalty and it made an impression. Besides, I always love Kevin Spacey's movies!
0897500482|5.0|Just what I ordered & just what I wanted ! The book is as described & I recommend this book to any one who wants to be fit, know martial arts, or need meditation.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Keeps you interested.  Nothing spectacular but we enjoyed it for the evening.  Mathew McConaughey really is a good actor.  One of his best parts.
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|Lots of stars in this one but suffers from poor script and weak special effects. Acting was decent, tho. Check it out ONLY if you cannot find anything better to watch and you are desperate for something science fiction oriented.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|I always enjoy Jane Austen books once I connect to her rythmn.  Sort of like a &#34;soap opera&#34; from the past.  A light and enjoyable read at a time I didn't want to think too much.
B0009VJWKY|4.0|I like this CD, like the concept and like the performance. I would prefer to buy the DVD version of content though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this story and the characters.  At times I found it difficult to put down.  Just the kind of book I like, one that keeps you involved and that you feel a bit let down when it's over.  In my opinion, Gillian Flynn is a good thriller writer.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I can listen to this CD hundreds of time. The waterfall analysis shows presence of frequencies starting at 10 Hz - it is awesome for an easy listening source. One can see that it is useful information, not noise.<br /><br />The quality of music is balanced perfectly well, some best hits are present.
1451695195|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and bought this book for my step-mother who is struggling with the pain of losing my Dad last year.  She wants to believe that she will see him again but she has no proof.  I thought this book would stand for proof, as it was written by a doctor.  She found it very interesting and encouraging.
B000301YY8|5.0|Almost the same as &#34;All The Lost Souls&#34;, but with different content. Has some bright hits on it, the quality of audio recording is awesome.
098478280X|3.0|I respect this book for being jam packed with lots of info and no filler. It's very well-written, well-organized, and having authored many documents myself, I can tell you that I couldn't have done a better job! All that aside, I gave it 3 stars (instead of 5) because I had some significant issues with the content. I'd recommend skimming/ignoring everything in this book but the code examples. The code examples/exercises are where you'll find the most value in this book.<br /><br />If you're interested in my personal issues with the content, read on:<br /><br />1. The author presents her claims as if she's worldy, having worked for Microsoft, Google, et al. I simply didn't feel this book was very \\"real-world\\". I've been consulting for nearly 2 decades, have interviewed dozens of people, and have thus been on both sides of the interview many, many times. In all that time, I never witnessed some of the experiences/conditions that this book pretty much guantees you'll encounter. Some of her advice is simply illogical and makes no sense. I'm not saying she's giving bad info, and the material is presented very well. I'm simply recommending you take what she says with a grain of salt.<br /><br />2. The code style isn't the best. I hesitate to judge here because, not only have I seen SO much worse, but because well-written code doesn't always fit nicely into books. Sometimes everything gets crammed into tight, hard to read, crappy code statements with poor formatting. However, this is THE book (if there ever was a case to be made) that should have made space. EIther that or the author simply doesn't care about code style. Then again, she may thing her code looks wonderful. It's all perspective. Just wanted to include a warning that, given 2 candidates and one write clean code vs. the code in this book, I'd probably pass on hiring this author.<br /><br />3. The code exercises are good. My problem is that the material is basic. Any (good) programmer will already understand everything in this book by the time they get their degree (or equivalent experience). Sure, sorting and searching algorithms are fun. We all live for bit shifting and implementing our own stacks. That said, I can't recall every seeing that come up in an interview. Surely, it can come up and probably does. You may be asked lots of basic, technical questions. The issues is that, while some interviews are easier than others and you should definitely know this stuff, it's really not what I think companies care about. I've seen brilliant people fall flat on their face when approached with a real-world problem. I see morons write better code than PhDs on average. Skills are very, very important...but getting the work done (right and on time) is critical.<br /><br />The material in this book only goes so far. Coding is only a part of what's covered in the interview. I'm not saying the book promised something it didn't deliver. It IS named \\"Cracking the Coding Interview\\" and not \\"Cracking the Interview\\". However, the author opened up that can of worms when she addressed issues beyond code in this book. I just wish it had more depth to it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Tons of strategy, social interaction, and things to do.  One of the best on Kindle.  I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|love this game.  I play it over and over.  never gets boring.  just wish the gold levels didn't cost so much golf bucks.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book! And the other 2, just waiting or the last to come out! Can't wait to see how their story ends!
B00F02YS5Q|5.0|I caught wind of Gregory Porter when his song, \\"Hey Laura\\", was the Free Song of the Week on iTunes.  I had no idea who this guy was.  Upon first listen, I was intrigued. His voice just carries so much warmth and soul. There is no tampering with his vocals that I can tell - nothing like the pop stars of today.  It's just him singing with passion; Soul. It made me want to talk to Laura!<br /><br />Once I logged into Amazon, I listened to the sample of the first track and knew I had to buy this album! It only took me 20 seconds of listening to the first song to make that decision. That's how you know someone's music is GOOD! To not know about him at all and just love the sound instantly.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album. His vocals are very soothing. Reminds me of sitting on a patio and relaxing with a coffee or bourbon. His songs are so reflective, too. \\"Wolfcry\\" is a very introspective ballad. The instrumentation on each of the tracks just make you want to nod your head and his vocals make you want to raise you hand and testify.<br /><br />I haven't been THIS moved by an album in such a long time.
B007RFDCQA|4.0|Like so many of us, I've seen this movie countless times, and I always love it.  It's nice to see the director's cut.  I would give it 5 stars, but every time I see it, it kills me when she tears apart that beautiful dress for prom.  She would have looked much better if she hadn't ripped that gorgeous dress to shreds!  The dress she's wearing when she's in the barn with Blane is much prettier than the rag she wore to prom.  Other than that, it's a nice, sweet movie, and one I would recommend to anyone.
B001D7CHAA|5.0|I'm giving this book 5 stars because if you take time to read the title and description you will find that it is exactly what it says it is.  Well done, straight to the point, instructive and entertaining.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|awesome
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|SO - I am an Angry Birds addict - and this new game really delivered with the graphics - I was a little disappointed at the limited number of stages to play, but there is an area that says \\"coming soon.\\" I just wish they would have more ready when they publish these apps.
B004LROMQG|5.0|my husband absolutely loves this Merlin, I have bought seasons 1 and 2 for him, he just can't get enough
1118109791|5.0|Worked for me! It broke down each type of question so that the test didn't seem so overwhelming. Great choice!
1878424114|5.0|awesome
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|Expect your packaging to be partially opened and taped shut like mine. No care was taken to prevent damage to the packaging, and it was partially exposed due to poor boxing as well. If you expect everything to be mint, this is far from it. Great figure overall, just the packaging is destroyed and plastic was even pushed in.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|excellent series
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Fun characters with sharp dialogue. A bit predictable as most of these types of shows are but still worth a view!
B001LF347E|5.0|I also bought seasons 2 thru 4.  My husband loves Merlin!  Looking forward to more future Merlin seasons.  LOVE amazon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so good its sofun I cant stop playing.  I luv my horse. I hope some new things come like more awesome horses
1419703692|5.0|My husband is a Batman fanatic!  I bought this for Christmas last year, he loved it! I always find awesome stuff on amazon.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|If you like Mr. Anderson you will want this in your collection!  It's nostalgia done oh so sweetly. It's right up there fighting to be his best.
B004C7EWHO|5.0|my husband loves this book!  i got it for him for Christmas last year.  I always find awesome stuff on amazon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good calculator app. It is easy to use and easy to see. There are a number of functions as well.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I knew before I read this book, that it was going to be about a tough subject, cancer.  I guess what I wasn't expecting is reading about such young people experiencing a devastating<br />disease.  I really liked the two main characters, especially Hazel. She is a wise cracking teenager facing her own mortality and I find her humorous.  The book is very well written but very sad.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching the show and got hooked...excellent show! Can't wait to finish watching the entire seasons!  I love it!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I was waiting for this season to come out for the longest time and when I got it, it came fast. I was so happy to finally see the end of the series.
0374203032|5.0|A new book with low price. And I love this book for its interesting content. I like this author who has another famous book.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Sometimes you just need a fun read...good guys are good, gals are lovely and ending is happy.  Thanks to &#34;Richard&#34; for another 'good' read.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Apparently my phone had it already installed by default, but it wasn't the full version and you still had to pay for it. Since I didn't want to buy it through the app, I figured I could just buy it through the amazon store. WRONG. I paid for this game, but after it finished installing, it gave me an error message saying it was unplayable. I just wasted my money on something I can't play. Make sure not to make this mistake because it is seriously frustrating.
1476734941|3.0|It is ok. did not meet my needs... to complicated..it showed me a different way to eat.. I it didn't work for me
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this device to do 3 specific things.<br /><br />1. I wanted to catch up on Breaking Bad through AMC's website and stream it to my TV.  Device said it had \\"select web content through Chrome browser.\\"  This was not what they were talking about. Doesn't work that way.<br /><br />2.  I thought it would be great to stream International Soccer games that we don't have access to through our cable provider.  This does not give us access to do that.<br /><br />3.  Thought we would be able to watch The World Finals of League of Legends (e sports) on our TV through this.  You definitely don't have access to their streamers (Azubu and others).  They have a youtube channel though, and youtube is listed as a site that you FOR SURE have access to, so that must work, right?  Wrong!  You can not stream live channels through youtube with Chromecast.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I thought we would be able to move many of the videos and streaming channels that we normally must access on our computers to the comfort of our living room.  Chromecast does not do this.  You get access to Netflix, Google Play, and most of youtube.<br /><br />I am hopeful that they will expand the streaming access soon.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Amazon charged 6% tax.  One click didn't tell me that and I haven't been charged tax on books before.  This State doesn't require sales tax on internet purchases.  Rip!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just finished the game and it was just hard enough to make me think without driving me crazy. I did occasionally think about looking for a cheat, but never did. Will more be coming?
B0054SMIH6|5.0|First all, I never liked this actor but this movie made me love him. A great movie, a great performance!!<br /><br />See it!
B00F91H666|3.0|It was okay. Lots of action but only thing in common with the book is its title. It was okay but was expecting better story behind the movie plot.
1451629184|5.0|Just amazing what this person went through and how she survived the whole ordeal. it makes you realize you don't know what you are capable of until you are given a real life test.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I WAS DISCUSSING MOVIES WITH A COWORKER, AND SHE HADN'T SEEN THIS ONE. I WENT HOME AND ORDERED IT AND BELIEVE ME, IT WAS DELIVERED THE NEXT DAY. I LOVE AMAZON PRIME. THEY ALSO STICK BY THEIR<br />PRODUCTS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING, A REFUND IS GIVEN.<br />THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT.
B001O3UJ8K|5.0|I loved this hardcore and rippin' CD since it's release. This is seriously hard-hitting NIN. A must have for any fan.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This is my first Christina McKenna book.  While I enjoyed her writing style I found the book to be so profoundly sad that I had a hard time finishing the story.  The best part of the book was the final few pages.  It was not a page turner for me because it was so depressing.<br /><br />Since I enjoyed the writing I will take a look at other McKenna books with the hope of finding subject matter more to my taste.
B000VZJUGY|5.0|If you do not have this album, please just stop reading this and go buy it. Brilliant and cutting lyrics with a depth and complexity in sound that really makes this CD a staple in any collection. Strong themes are carried throughout, and it's impossible to take it all in with just one listen!
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is a story about a boy that had a small handicap and all the obstacles that he faced and overcome.  It is an enjoyable film that you will watch over and over.  There is some bad language in it.  But it is a very good film.
B005I547ZG|5.0|Harry Bosch is the best detective ever. Connelly's character trapped my atention completely. Love short stories even I missed the elaboration of the novels.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|This is a very good movie about a bold charismatic freedom fighter driven to exact revenge on those who disfigured him.  It is a very good movie.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|If your a Janelle Monae fan or You just have a love for REAL artistry in music, Janelle Monae's &#34;The Electric Lady&#34; is surely the album, & artist, that you should grab hold too. She will surely take you on a sci-fi R&B emotion-picture space ride. The music and the artistry is seriously awesome and has alot of songs that connect, encourage, and inspire all walks of life. (A must go-getter for the Music Lover)
B003UESJF6|5.0|This is about a baby that came from another planet and about the obstacles he encountered and overcome with the help of his friends.  This is an enjoyable family movie.  There is no bad language in the film.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I am  a fan of all the Star Trek movies and this one didn't disappoint.  I loved the dialog and the emotion displayed by all the characters  The fight scenes were too long for me, but that is always the case with me in action films.  If you haven't seen this, it's worth the ride.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|This is the last movie, so far, of a series about a fortune hunter and teacher who sells what he finds to a museum.  It is a very enjoyable movie.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The show continues to develop the characters and provide excellent story lines.  The acting is good and the guest stars are enjoyable.  I highly recommend this series filled with flawed, but believable, characters.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|This is the second movie of a series about penguins who aren't like the rest, but special in their own way.  The first one was about this penguin's daddy.  Both movies are very good family movies and you will want to watch them over and over.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|How imaginative to take a classic writing and make it into this classic animated movie!  It brings old piece children's literature to life with such panache.  Another feel-good offering of entertainment--what's to feel bad about with these great old Disney cartoons?!  We are trying to upgrade our entire Disney library on tape to DVD, the DVDs being so much sharper.<br />Joyce Corey
B001OGRLOC|4.0|This is good stuff for any metal fan. Good alternative to Metallica. I just started listening to Testament, and found this to be a good sample for the band.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|It was really fun. But it kept on closing and I found myself back to the home screen. It got really annoying so I deleted it.
B002NY731U|5.0|This is a fast paced, high-energy album. Great for working out or getting chores done. Gotta love Megadeth for creating some anger fueled music!
B000PDZHDM|5.0|This was a movie I saw on TV many years ago. I am delighted to have it in my collection/
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good product, great price.  Works well with netflix although chrome mirroring is a bit laggey.  Looking forward it more compatibility with more apps.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Action packed, brutally violent, visually stunning, and an actual reason to watch a movie in 3D. If you like all of the above, you won't be disappointed!
0671449028|5.0|So we like to gift this book to new parents.  Our little one enjoyed it from age one to four as a constant bedtime story.  The rhythm is fantastic, ours thought it was hilarious and they can still repeat the whole story.  Very memorable poem type writing..love it.
B00CHMBQ0C|4.0|Erased centers on security expert Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart) and his daughter, Amy (Liana Liberato), who live in Belgium after Ben left his wife in the States. One day, Ben is presenting flaws in a billion-dollar security system that he plans to work out with his colleagues, but the next day when he returns to work, the office is stripped and abandoned; his entire life for six months is completely erased. Now, on the run with his daughter, Ben works to find out why he's been erased, and along the way, reveals dark secrets about his past.<br /><br />Erased is a thriller that is far from original, but is happily a semi-fresh take on the reworked plot-line. The direction of Philipp Stolzl is actually very well-done, having a some-what calm feeling in this very urgent crisis instead of a constant feeling of impending doom and danger. Sure, the action and intensity are there, but even some action-thrillers make the calm moments feel intensified, as if time is running out by the millisecond. Aaron Eckhart is great, as he is with most of his movies. Here, his character felt like a cross between Jason Statham's Luke Wright (from 2012's Safe) and Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills (Taken); this is a good thing, by the way. Olga Kurylenko was very good as Anna, an old flame and CIA operative who had worked with Ben before, but is now on the other side. Liana Liberato was good as Ben's daughter Amy, but nothing truly gripping or captivating. Sure, we felt for her, but it wasn't tears. If it were Dakota Fanning here instead, then we might have just created the new Niagara Falls (I'm not saying Liana is a bad actress, but she could have done a wee bit better). The script was good, nothing award-winning or really new, but the climax of the movie was just stunning. The way it was shot, the slow-burning build-up, it was just fantastic.<br /><br />Erased is not an original thriller, but it is a damn good one to add to your movie collection if you like action-thrillers, political-espionage thrillers or a good chase film. Eckhart is in top-form here, and gets to show off some really awesome fighting skills. I'm just disappointed this wasn't released in theaters nationwide; I would have paid to see it.<br /><br />4/5 Stars****
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Amazing in all of the ways. David Tennant. The rest of the cast. Cinematography. Music. Locations. Drama. It's a wonderful show and proves once again the Brits know what they're doing.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfers is a great and addictive game. However you need to collect so many coins and items it gets tedious after a while. The missions can also be boring aswell. But the overall gameplay and weekly hunt adds up to give this game 3 stars. Congrats! I recommend you give it a go!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  A little challenging but not too hard.  Looking forward to updates..keep up the great work!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I wish there had been more explanation to start with but once I figured out how to play it was fun. I'm sure the kids are faster learners then I am.
B00340I4KG|5.0|Keep you interested all the way to the end and now with plastic surgery so advanced is not fiction anymore.
0226264211|3.0|I'm about half way through this book. And I have to say it doesn't Draw me in as much as books by Hazlitt, Hayek, or even Sowell. It gets the point across, but he tries to go over some complex subjects in the book that are harder to follow. Friedman is usually good at explaining things when he speaks but he writes in much the same way which doesn't feel like it translates well on paper. I've found reading it with his voice in my head helps.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|Fantastic book, it was so good I bought the companion book right after finishing this book! I can hardly wait to get back home to brew up another batch.
0375500901|5.0|Silva is a fantastic author.  His books hold your attention from beginning to end.  Material always has some historical reasoning.  He seems to use the motto of the Mossad in his writings.  Highly recommend his books to anyone..
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is a party. I am very pleased with the graphics and the challenges. I am going to tell my friends about this game.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|So far this game is going great . I am just getting started on it, hope it doesn't stop right in the middle of it..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was written and acted out well. Can't wait for season 4. One of my all time favorite shows!  Love it!!!
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I have seen several versions and this one is my favorite. The acting is wonderful and the story is very sweet. A very well done movie.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game.I love hidden object games and this is my favorite one. Very interesting and fun for all. I highly recommend it.
B008602KQI|5.0|It's Hunger  Games, what more can you say Suzanne Collins is a great writer/producer, the directing makes Cecil B Demille Look like a film student. What else can be said?
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Not your usual family drama. The teen son of a DA is accused of murdering a classmate who had been relentlessly bullying him. Family secrets only add to the layered storytelling.<br /><br />Just when you think you know the ending the author throws a sharp curve ball. Great read!
B0058YPL66|5.0|We all have shaky memories of the fairy tales we learned as children and this show provides the back stories (what did the Queen have against Snow White anyway? was it just vanity?).  By and large the acting is extraordinary and the stories keep surprising. For a distraction from all the troubles of the world what more can we ask?
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|I think the BOSS was a bit better.  A little more action.  Hoerver, the Politics of House of Cards are at a higher level.  More mentally stimulating.  This series makes you think and wonder about what is really going on in Washington !!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Really compelling.  It's fascinating to read just how the brain works in forming and changing habit and just how one can do it if they choose.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Janelle Monae continues to knock it out of the park with her third album. Pick it up ASAP and also her other two, go see her on tour, and dance your face off!

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is not Shakespeare. It does not pretend to be Shakespeare. It is clever for what it is and it is better than the original. Love it!
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Not your normal Oz. Took a little while to get into this version of OZ but ending up liking it. Yes I would recommend purchasing it.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Update: unable to download the newest update version 9/20/2013.

B004EBT5CU|4.0|Loved most of this music. If all her music sounds like this, I will be adding Adele to my favorites.
B0091X2K0A|4.0|Authentic.  It is the kind of movie, fascinating to watch and demoralizing to experience, that can make you depressed about the human condition.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones voice is so soothing to listen to.This is the second cd of &#34;come away with Me&#34; I keep the other in my car.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have gone through several otter boxes. Life proof is worth the money! I've dropped my phone several times. The case has held up great. We used the phone all summer in the pool. Great case! I won't consider a cell phone unless I can get a life proof case for it now!

B00EE3FVSU|5.0|So much talent went into this show and you can for sure tell when watching. Every scene pulls you in, leaving you wanting more, which is why the show is so damn good. Thanks BBCAmerica for giving us here across the pond a chance to watch such great shows as this. So much of this show can be said but you have to check it out for yourself, everyone I have talked to that has seen it comes away with a different view/aspect and it's always good.
B005LAIIMG|1.0|SPOILER ALERT!  I honestly cannot say why I thought this might be worth watching.  Brad Pitt?  Special Effects?  Apocalyptic theme? Mebbe.  But then I often find myself unwittingly lending further credence to the aphorism A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted.  Okay, so if by having skipped most of grade school you can bring yourself to believe getting bitten by anything other than a pit viper can bring about an instantaneous metamorphosis from normal biology to a state of &#34;undeadness&#34; (whatever that is), then, by all means, continue watching.  You will be treated to all the cliche characteristics of monsters who've been around for a hundred years virtually unimproved by any creative person's imagination:  gray, loping, limping, groaning, wrything, slobbering corpses with an inexplicable lust for the flesh of the as yet un-zombified.  (No, actually in this movie they appear to have been enhanced with turbo speed gear, compared to the standard zombie's slothful gait.  The better, I suppose, to make it &#34;possible&#34; to catch and infect the thousands of CGI extras it takes to make such a sucky movie these days).  How is it that in every disaster film there is always an escape route for the protagonist's vehicle through thousands of disabled vehicles? So, will someone please explain to me how Pitt's character is able to get from the deck of an aircraft carrier onto a plane the size of a C130 Hercules without first having to return to a mainland airport?  And why would you land the dadburned thing in a zombie-infested Korean facility without intending to rescue the few remaining military dudes?  Ah, and if you yourself were a zombie, would you have the forsight to hide away in the pantry elevator of a wide-body jet so that later you could wreak havoc in the economy section?  Why is it that the protagonist is always the lone survivor in the inevitable horrific crash of a fully loaded plane?  Then, when it seems like all hope is lost, is the day always gloriously saved by such implausible gimmickry as is desperately employed in this drivel?  Mebbe.  Is it just all in good fun? Not at these prices.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Season after season it gets better... it's a fast and intriguing drama.  Once you see one episode, you can't wait to see what happens next... You are hooked.
B008JFUO36|3.0|Somehow every title starring Tom Cruise seems to offer more action than story.  (Don't these screen heroes get enough exercise at the gym?)  Even so... Tom's futuristic control complex hovers over a desolate, post-apocolyptic ruin that's still occupied by unknown entities, and he's gotta monitor for activites down there to make sure it's all cool.  An excessively convoluted plot follows him back and forth from the surface where he's variously perplexed, shocked, challenged, accosted, duplicated, killed, and restored, finally to an idylic existence in a quaint, green little country setting with the girl of his dreams, in a way that will leave your head spinning.  But head-spinning ain't what I watch a movie for.  Tom, better stick with the Impossibe Missions Forces dude.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I used the book and his data for my own new book to make the point of how hard it is to really live by logic and reasoned thinking. In my thesis only 10% are able to achieve real understanding while the rest live mostly by habit, routine and the familiar, who I call clerks, who are able to do their jobs, live fairly productive lives but lack the ability to connect the dots of science, information and experience and achieve understanding.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|There should be an award for the best overall production.  Where every member from stagehands to producers gets an emmy.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|I loaded an Excel spreadsheet and a Word document.  Display is OK, but each document sometimes drops sections of data for no apparent reason.  When I select a document to open, more often than not I will get a message that asks me if I want to recover data.  It works best for me if I say &#34;no&#34; and go back to try opening it again.  Always have a backup on your PC.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Rarely do I review a book, but felt this book deserved a shout out.  I felt it was well written, moved quickly, kept the storyline intact.  Just finished it and have purchased Dust and Shift!
B001FQFFMG|5.0|From start to finish a job well done.<br />Im sure there's a lot of messy details they left out and it's greatly appreciated.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is for anyone who has a creative imagination. Gaiman weaves fantasy with a child's perspective into an adult book that keeps you reading and turning the page.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Only in to Season 1 episode 11, but I am hooked. It's a great show, great cast and story line so captivating! Can't wait to watch more! ( Just got my husband hooked too!) Raining today, so we are vegging out on The Good Wife!
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I ordered this to expand my Acer netbook to 2 gb, as it originally only had 1 gb.  It works perfectly.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I don't generally like series involving lawyers but decided to give this one a try as it seemed so popular. I can see why it has grabbed viewers attention.<br />Very fast paced, with a fairly good variety of story lines. Not sure of it will hold my unrest for the whole season let alone future ones but time will tell.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love Chromecast. This device is great for my Android tablets and phones. I don't have to worry about getting other cables to connect to my TV.<br /><br />Hopefully, Google will come with an update to mirror the phone to output on the TV/monitor like Apple TV.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|The graphic equalizer sucks!  The changes to sound tones are almost unnoticable.  Maybe the pay version is better, but the free version was very unimpressive.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First of all i would like to point out that the Amazon Global Delivery works great for Germany. The Part was send out 15. September and i have revived it 6 days later (21. September) with non Express Delivery.<br /><br />The Setup of the Tool works good, please note that you need a Wireless Connection for the first Setup, after that you can use your PC Ethernet Connection to cast Stuff to the Chromecast. I use it with Google Chrome Addon and Iphone and i like it. Cant wait for more Apps.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|love this app. use all the time when i am out and about and need to kill time. glad it works on multiple platforms.

B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Are we really supposed to believe Tom Clancy wrote this?? Not likely!! The author couldn't even keep his character names consistent...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|attention capturing. beautifully written. illuminating. it encompasses just about every morally important philosophical question in a heart wrenching manner. i thought it might be cliche at first but i was absolutey wrong. john green has quickly become my favorite author. DFTBA. &#60;3
B006LSZECO|3.0|Too much cussing. Not everyone talks that way. Professionals lacked credibility. Very suspenseful with a good twist. One of those books that is hard to put down.
B008133MDK|5.0|This series is very well written and acted.  Its the best of the Sherlock Holmes franchises.  The Hounds of the Baskerville espisode has a lot of humor in it.  I wish they put out more than three episodes a season.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game to play if u need to take up a lot of time.  It's simple, easy,  fun and addicting to play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|People ages 13 and up will love this book.It is a action packed non stop suspense.This book is sure to wow you.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|Evil Dead (the remake) is a strange beast. It has great setups in it's plot that make it a more \\"plausible\\" supernatural horror flick. The setup with the drug detox: kids are in a cabin in the woods to help one of them (Mia) get over her drug addiction, having chosen seclusion after the last attempt failed (though that was also secluded, but they let her leave ?) so when stuff starts happening ... they assume she's faking, lying or hallucinating. So that's a good start. The other thing that's distinctly here is the cringe worthy violence, and some rather mental and disturbing things, especially the dog getting killed in a \\"flashback\\" of Mia \\"faking it\\". Granted: it's a horror flick with all the bad and wrong imagery that makes you cringe, but there is something here disturbing on a deeply psychological level ... [[ASIN:B0095R4Z8C The Cabin In The Woods [HD]]] interestingly explained it: the characters make choices that lead them to their demise, but the dog ... that's ... just sad, cruel and wrong.<br /><br />So that's a negative point here, and I'd argue that even though it is not what probably, actually happened, the alternative is still ... not right. And it is there for a reason, but it doesn't add and so it just seems to cross a line. And it didn't bother me so much at the time, but the more I think about it the more it bugs me.<br /><br />The issue with Evil Dead is not that its ancestor was instrumental in defining the genre, and now it's going against the rules of that genre, its that the dog issue could have been done more ... tastefully.<br /><br />What stops Evil Dead from being a great horror flick is not that it isn't terrifying enough or that it deviates (or follows) the formula too much (or too little), it's a Cabin in the Woods movie and although it is predictable (face it, it's never going to end well), it does some pretty stupid things: There is not rhyme or reason to who is affected by the curse. It's not the one that invokes it, it starts with Mia, and sticks with her for a while, but then suddenly for no reason it transfers, and then on another character it behaves differently. It's like they are playing out tropes (like Cabin in the Woods, again), but without having the backing of the logical frame work. They are trying to shock you with a collection of unrelated events and characters, but reused the setting, events and characters. There is just that lack of thread that ties it together other than location, but that can't solely explain it because the characters aren't affected uniformly. And you don't know enough about the character to understand why one gets to be the hero, and the others are punished / used as punishment. It's hard to explain without spoiling so pardon the vagueness.<br /><br />So, some of the setup is great, some of the execution is wrong, and a lot of the plot tying things together is poorly implemented, there is one thing that enraged me about the setup: the events are brought on by one of the characters interacting with the evil book, and doing exactly what the warning scrawled all over it tell him not to. Now take a step back for a moment and think: if you found a site of witch craft and at the center something wrapped in a garbage bag and barbed wire, would you read open and read it and do everything the warnings tell you not to? Probably, because in reality witch craft has little bearing on our lives and whether you believe in it or not, its foreseeable that someone who does not would ... do the wrong things. And that's the avenue the movie takes. So here is the issue with this: You know you are watching a horror movie and stuff has to happen, and there is a formula, and given reality and what the formula predicts sync up you know exactly that it will and must happen, but to watch it play out exactly like that ... it's a pretty surreal experience. And it doesn't help that the character up to that point has been completely useless and with no particular reason for being there. But to me, there was the awesomeness of \\"this can't be happening\\" while at the same time knowing exactly what will happen as it must and \\"could that character be any stupider?\\" because he's doing exactly what any normal person would do if they weren't in a horror movie.<br /><br />That pretty much sums up the: what's wrong with Evil Dead (remake). What's good about it. Oh, when it wants to be creative (and ignore reality) it is awesome. Some of the violence/personal horror unleashed is epic. Also, like Cabin in the Woods it ties into a greater world event view and that is great because conceptually that's just awesome: there is a great chance for a sequel here dealing with the effects of events of this movie on the world as a whole, though you're not told exactly how far it reaches.<br /><br />Now this might have been a bit disjoint and focused on the bad. A lot of the movie is average, and if you've seen the trailer you will be prepared for what's coming mostly. But still, on the whole it is a good package, definitely from the perspective of a fan of the medium, because it just does some interesting things with the formula. Also, there are a lot of traps it avoids falling in to and as such it's pretty great. My main reason for docking it two points are: the dog, and the movie plot and some of the events don't align into enough co-herence. They don't fail to tie the story together, but they felt just a bit too disjointed and I'd say it's almost like there is a meta narrative happening but it becomes too dominant. It's like Brad Pitt in [[ASIN:B000SP1SEO Snatch]] said \\"Nobody brings a fella the size of you unless they're trying to say something without talking, right?\\"; same here: nobody is this predictable without wanting to say something about predictability without breaking the fourth wall.<br /><br />On the whole I think I'll enjoy this when I rewatch it and there is a lot here to think about, and to me that makes a good movie, but as a straight horror flick its a bit odd.t to me, there was the awesomeness of \\"this can't be happening\\" while at the same time knowing exactly what will happen as it must and \\"could that character be any stupider?\\" because he's doing exactly what any normal person would do if they weren't in a horror movie.<br /><br />That pretty much sums up the: what's wrong with Evil Dead (remake).

B005OCFHHK|2.0|I still don't get the point of this movie franchise. I haven't read the books so don't hate. But does it really take 8 movies to unfold this plot?
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Finally, this incredible \\"Holy Grail\\" of a show has been released!  Great remastering of the 16 track original tapes and a super-fun-to-watch cleaned up copy of the movie are here.  Wow, good things really do come to those who wait!!!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Very slow movie and a little too boring. But the end semi saves it. James Franco seemed out of place.

B004GJDQT8|5.0|Sometimes I need to look up an item - or purchase an item - while I am not at home and have access to my laptop.  This makes that possible.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Great movie.  Kept me on the edge of my seat almost the whole time.  I really hope zombies do not take over the world for real.
B0007TKNII|4.0|The main characters were excellent choices, and the story unfolded beautifully.  Music was fabulous.  I've seen the play on Broadway, and this version was very well done.
B004KPLVV8|4.0|Great special effects for the time it was made. Bought if for kids to see how it all started. Classic.
B005FISBV2|5.0|Love this Series! You would never think this guy is a serial killer. OH! But! He only kills bad guys.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|This is my favourite album from JM so far.<br /><br />Intelligent mature lyrics. Smooth subtle blues and folk musical composition.<br /><br />Addictive listening.
B0000DBJ2B|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family. I really enjoyed the movie  completely. this is a must see movie! You'll enjoy this one.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The screen was smaller than I expected.  The measurement was given but the pictures was deceiving.  Buyers should know that it does require a SB card.  Once I got started, It was an easy task.  It loaded onto the computer easily.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|we love this game!! its great family fun... the variety of dragons is the best out of all the dragon games out there we have a blast with it.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|this a dumb movie..same old zombie stuff but with a big name star. current 21st century planes and military type action to try to spruce up the movie....need my money back..time..i didnt see anything that hinted that i would be watching a zombie movie..which i always thought was a waste
B003I55BIA|5.0|I love this book. It makes you think of how different each and every persons lives are. No matter what , you choose your destiny and the choices you make will make a difference to others!
B004GYY714|2.0|I wanted this AP to be able to tune in to my favorite hockey team games.  Hopefully I will be able to figure out how this works before the preseason games are over.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Very good read. If you read many books on SEALS the portion about BUDs training is a little redundant but the authors views on how the military is treated by the press and politicians is right on the money.
B00CTT9646|1.0|I pre-ordered this title back in May when it was first announced. As we all know, it quickly sold-out shortly afterwards and has been sold-out for months.<br /><br />I kept waiting for the order to arrive after it shipped earlier this month and after almost 2 weeks, I get an e-mail from Amazon.com advising my order had been cancelled and that I'd be refunded.<br /><br />When I contacted a CSR via chat that day, I was told that DHL had \\"lost\\" my order and that an investigation would be started by Amazon's shipping department. I finally get the refund on my credit card only to realize that the import fee had not been refunded.<br /><br />I chatted with another CSR again today and once the fee was refunded, I asked to have more info about the investigation. Not only was I advised Amazon.com doesn't release investigation results with customers, I was advised that my order was never lost at all... it was DAMAGED. I was not advised how \\"damaged\\" the order was... for all I know, it could just be a small corner of the box that's crumpled.<br /><br />I was told to place the order again. Yeah... right... order something that's been sold out for months? Fat chance that's going to happen. My only complaint about Amazon.com is that they refuse to let me know what happened or moreso how it happened. My main beef is with DHL Global Mail. I strongly implore Amazon.com to ditch them and go with Fedex or UPS for international shipments. If they're going to charge us $17 for an import fee, it might as well be spent on a courier that isn't going to damage or lose your parcel before it even reaches the border. (For the record, the parcel was damaged immediately after it left Amazon.com's warehouse if the tracking info is anything to be believed).<br /><br />I would not be as angry if this would have happened with a regular item, but when it occurs with limited edition exclusives that sell-out a few days after pre-order, that's a whole other mess in itself.
B009CF6IDM|4.0|This was one of those movies that tried to tap into the GI Joe cartoon nostalgia, but failed... Despite that is was a good turn the brain off and be entertained popcorn flick.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Excellent story and kept your interest through out the entire movie.  You became involved in the families concern as well as the survival and determination of this great horse.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|I really liked this movie, and I can't believe I had never heard of it until I saw it in new releases here on Amazon. This film had me guessing right up to the end (the first time I watched it).
B009A9BF5G|3.0|nice blue ray, It came with a cd so you can listen in your car and keep the blue ray at home. Nice show
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I saw the movie when I was young; and 100 times since, but unfortunately I hadn't read the book until recently.  The movie was a disaster, simply, because David Lynch thought he should rewrite the story.  The book is a far deeper, and infinitely complex in a rewarding way, pink diamond the size of your head, with a smarter laying out of the scenes and plot.  If you didn't enjoy the movie, you would feel energized by the book.  The writing itself, flows generously forward like a teacup in a raging river.  I wondered if the reason I had loved the book, was because I wholeheartedly enjoy Sci-Fi?  My conclusion, after I compared Dune to other book's, rested solely on it's great regardless!  A worthwhile book to disappear into, and certainly purchase(Even if your sons and daughters permanently borrow it)
B004ZH66XO|5.0|And that's cool. Works on his hand eye coordination and I get to watch something on TV besides Spongebob or the Guppies.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The Good Wife is good television! The psychodynamics and character development make for compelling drama.Enjoyable and easy to get hooked to the plot.<br />Arlene Appelrouth
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|From my grandson. I can tell by the way he is laughing that this is a barrel of fun, thanks
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|great movie! A friend will not see this movie since it's too realistic of her childhood neighborhood! The acting is great. The movie shows the difficulties of people who have lived in a home for a period of time and have to adjust to the downslide of their neighborhood due to gang take-overs while adjusting/learning how some new neighbors can otherwise become more family/friends than expected.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|I could have easily missed this without a big theatrical release but I'm so very lucky I didn't. Great acting, amazing story, inventive original and just one of those stories where you fall in love and care about each character. To anyone who loves good movies please see this as soon as you can.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Can not put this game down! I LOVE THIS GAME! it is hard on some screens and not so hard on others...a good mix! Very entertaining and a very fun game!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I really love this little app! It cleans up cookies and makes the running of my Kindle Fire HD much more efficient. It's a must have in my opinion.
B004YRSBTW|3.0|it was confusing for me because the closed caption did not work, it was out of synch. Otherwise I think it would have been a good movie
B000J1AGQI|5.0|As a retired military man myself (Air Force Fighter Pilot), I appreciate the spirit and integrity portrayed in this move. I can tell that it is authentic.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I've had this app for awhile and love it. Very easy to use. The radar feature is great you can put in multiple areas to get weather for.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but not too hard. Not five stars only because the sensitivity is strange at times,  I couldn't get some of the pieces to respond at times.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|Was a good ad entire as well as real life drama. A. close relationship playing an active role  in young persons life. While at the same time author note the interest of  all the main characters dealings in the present as well as that which is to come. It really enjoyed this book!
B00E8JZILA|5.0|First of all I am sooo thankful that Telltale games and Playstation listened to the Vita owners and brought the Walking Dead to PS VITA!!!!!!!!!! Thank you so much !!!!!!!!!! I haven't played much Vita but this game is reason why I am playing the Vita non-stop.<br /><br />What can I say about the game, it is awesome, it is tense and exciting. I am a huge Walking Dead fan. I love this game. We need more like this for the Vita.
B0042ETJU2|1.0|Movie 2 didn't play and the digital copy didn't work would not buy it. It sucked buying 3 movies and getting that work sucks
B004FWPK8G|5.0|This is one of Goldie Hawn's best films. Having grown up in the sixties and seventies, I could identify with her character.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Not an ordinary book, it's an extraordinary one.  It is a book that deals with love presented in many different ways.  New love, old love, a story of how intrinsically woven lives and the effect it has on all involved persons. Excellent book.  I just finished it and am now opening it up to experience it again.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I received the item after a delay because it was sold out. Installed it into a HDMI slot on my HDTV (Sony) and followed the instructions. It started up and seemed to work okay. Below are the differences in using a HDMI cable from my Android to the HDTV and using a Chromecast player:<br /><br />1. It does not play on my Tablet and the TV at the same time like when using HDMI cable.<br />2. You can actually surf the net on your Android at the same time playing the movie.<br />3. It does not seem to draw on the battery when using Chromecast like HDMI cable. I have only lost about 5% playing almost 2 hours of Walking Dead when it would be 30% or more when using the cable to the TV.<br />4. Also my tablet heats up when using HDMI and it's stone cold when using Chromecast. That is great.<br />5. I am not sure about the video and sound quality when using either one. It seems louder with Chromecast but better quality using HDMI cable. Then again I need to use it for awhile longer before I can make final judgement.<br />6. I also have been using the 1 month free on Netflix and bought on Ebay for $7.49 an extra 3 months using the code someone gave me. I bought this in August and the deadline was July 24th, but a correct code is good until the end of 2013. Normally it would have cost me $24.00 for the extra months. So if anyone is interested just go to Ebay and look for the best deal.<br /><br />So after a few days of using this I think it's a great deal. You will be able to play wireless Netflix, YouTube and Google play movies and music. Hopefully they will come up with more in the future. Now if Amazon would get off their butts and make one for Android to play their Prime Movies it will even be a better buy. I have a $500 Nexus 10 as the Tablet. It is probably one of the best things I have ever bought in my life.<br /><br />I will be back to update this in a couple of months to make a final judgement. Right now I am giving it 4 stars.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love playing Mahjong , this one is just great the colors are really bright  and beautiful pictures and new lay outs. Graet brain training and great fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the greatest! its like ur actually in the Despicable me movie ... U HAVE TO TRY IT
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is super fun you have to buy part 2 but the puzzles are fun. The only thing is it will take a little to get used to
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|A new way to look at zombies. Lots of action love the actors.  Will love this movie is you are zombie fan
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Whenever I am not home and I see that my favorite streamers are streaming I instantly open up this app.
B00F91H666|4.0|I always thought it was a little silly that Zombies were destined to be slower than your aunt in any footrace and dumber than dirt. From George Romero's genre-starting \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", to Shaun of the Dead to Walking Dead, and a thousand other permutations of the concept in between, even the last person to finish any weekend 10K and taking 2 full hours to do so (that's 19 minute miles!) needn't worry about their ability to out-run a Zombie when necessary!<br /><br />This movie changes all that. If the \\"World War Z\\" zombies ever form their own Olympic Team, prepare for them to take all the gold medals! This is much more exciting to watch, now we just have to figure out how to get them their own NCAA Div1 or NFL team we can watch on the gridiron every weekend...they don't even need helmets!<br /><br />I almost didn't order this movie because it had only 2 1/2 stars when we saw it this week. I'm very glad we did...it was a lot of fun to watch! I gave it 4 stars, to get 5 from me they needed to include at least one other star in a lead role besides Brad (preferably Angelina. David Morse's 2 minute cameo role as a toothless CIA agent gone mad doesn't count.)
140006922X|5.0|Zealot is a must read.  It is splendidly written and researched.  Putting Jesus of Nazareth in an historical context in an accessible form is a joy to read.  Now I am on to Reza Aslan's other works.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|I thought this movie was much better than it gets credit for. Very well done and a great job of communicating the underlying themes from the book, as well as good character development.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app. Love it. It's really really cool. I love taking care of horses even if they're not real. Get this app now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|keeps my kids busy while i drive amd when j have to travel on train. they should add more challenges and less of asking to buy stuff.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I have the book but haven't read it yet. Usually I read the book first which fills in the gaps left out in the movie so that might be why. The characters weren't really convincing and there was no chemistry between them.
B00C9U9YOW|3.0|I normally really like QOTSA but I got to admit this one is a bit depressing and as I typically listen to music to feel better rather than worse I don't think this is going to get played a lot here at my place. Sorry QOTSA guys, really I am, I wanted to like it but ....
B008Y76VW2|3.0|I thought it wasa fairly good movie.  I actually thought Kristen Stewart acted better I this movie than I've seen her do in other movies (Twilight). Nice feel-good movie.
B00C6C6G8K|5.0|A wanna-be German Leeloo gets a phone call from her boyfriend.  He screwed up, and she needs to get 100,000 German monies in 20 minutes, or else he'll either be killed or ruin his life by robbing a grocery store.<br /><br />I read a more eloquent description and wondered how an 80 minute film could be happen in 20 minutes, but it all worked out satisfactorily.<br /><br />I really like how they don't dumb it down by trying to explain things (no midichlorians).<br /><br />We watch all films through the perspective of the narrator.  The narrator in this film never speaks, but you extra stuff is told from the eye of the camera that I liked.<br /><br />I'd watch it again, and I wouldn't watch most films again.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I played this first when it was just a flash game, so when it showed up as the free app of the day, I was really excited.<br /><br />You have to draw lines to make the sugar land in the cup.  And yes, that SOUNDS easy, and it is for awhile, but then it gets pretty challenging.  I recommend it.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I buy a lot of his recordings of all types.I'm glad he does both classical and pop with David Foster.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I have bought, and completed, this game on iOS, PC, and Android.  It is super addictive, and it is one of those games where you can certainly get better as you go, but you will never be a master of it.<br /><br />Match 3 with RPG and Looting elements?  What, do I have to give you 999,997 more reasons to buy it?  Just buy it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The raw passion and unconditional love is something I think we all want or desire. These books have touch something deep in me. Want more!
078689136X|5.0|This was a great book and I really liked it! I ordered the next two books after reading Naked Heat
B00CATSONE|5.0|There were many aha moments in this book. I couldn't help but wonder when our current technology will catch up to the genius of Tesla, who lived over a century ago. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
1416550550|4.0|I enjoyed the book and found it to be interesting.  Not my favorite, but definitely recommend it to others.  Enjoy!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This was better than I expected. The mix of suspects and sub plots give this show real energy.  The acting is superb.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|We had not heard of the movie, but a friend suggested it.  We watched the trailer and decided to rent it for the night.  Great choice!  Lots of action, cool story line and a surprising twist!  Really like it!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This book was so enjoyable that I had to purchase another one to pass along to my friends and family. I am a cat lover and could relate to his experiences. What a smart cat he has there, it was uplifting and heartfelt. Get this book, its a must have! I also ordered from the U.K. his other book &#34;the World According to Bob&#34; because it won't be in the United States until May 20014. Have not read it yet, but am looking forward to another great book.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Got to say its a really good show,a little slow in the begining but picks up towards end of first season. Great choice of characters and plots along with great cgi and brutal battles that take place i couldnt stop watching. Cant wait for season 3 :)
0307730700|5.0|I love the books that don't get too detailed with Military Jargon, where I'm trying to figure out what all the abbreviations mean and lose focus.  It is an amazing story of an American Family and all they endure together.  And I can't get enough of all the Navy Seal stories of heroism.........Adam was an absolutely amazing soul and I am beyond thankful for his service and sacrifice.
B009KUANWG|4.0|Based on the rave reviews, I downloaded this without hearing the whole song. I was not disappointed in the overall quality, but was surprised at how prominent the James Bond theme was throughout the music. This makes it a GREAT bond title song (one of the best), but less successful as a song in its own right - unless you love James Bond and those familiar music notes from his theme. Past themes usually had more cross-over appeal by just slightly referencing the theme, but this one is very Bond heavy. If you're looking for the next big radio hit from Adele, this might not be the song for you. If you want a beautiful, perfectly executed James Bond theme, this one knocks it out of the park.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love the games and other things that go along with the site<br /> I  am so glad I found this
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A calculator is one of those &quot;essential&quot; apps you most have on your device.  I have several devices.  And while this was not the first calculator I tried, it's the only one I use now on all my devices.  I experience frequent migraine headaches which means not only do I not want to strain my eyes on small numbers, my hands get shaky and apps with very small buttons do not work well with me.  The large &quot;buttons&quot; and easy to see numbers just make this calculator the best possible choice for me.  One other feature I want to mention is that it stores the last number you entered directly underneath the main screen.  So if you are using it while doing something like grocery shopping, your last number is clearly visible so you don't have to guess at what your last entry was and if you remembered to type it in.  My children could also take over keeping track of what we have spent because it is easy enough for them to use as well.  I will never use a different calculator app.  This on just makes using a calculator very quick and easy.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Very, Very, Very,  nicely done.  sound and pictures  are very good you will like it . . . . .  get the full verison.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book  I picked 5stars because it's an awesome book and I recommend it to any one with a good taste of books
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love Castle, it's fun, interesting, quick sharp wit, I love the inside nods they give to previous lives or people that might go unnoticed unless you know the background.
B001AITGWE|5.0|Everyone feels like this -- probably every day.  Did you get behind the school bus where all the mothers had to take pictures for at least 10 minutes before it moved?  How about when you are trying to drive somewhere important and the road crew is sort of standing around doing nothing while one guy digs a ditch --- for no reason by the way.  I love this movie and agree with this guy without the guns.  I just bitch and yell out the window - without guns.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|I love that this figure actually looks like the actor! They did a great job on the details and I couldn't be happier. After looking at some of the other reviews that mention the package being partially opened, I noticed that mine is too! I bought mine at the mall; apparently it isn't the amazon sellers' fault. The printing on the package is great. I am so pleased to give this to my boyfriend for his 26th. The separation between the clear packaging and the cardboard backing is minimal. It probably won't be returned (I'll leave that up to him when he gets it) and for us, it's only a trip back to the mall.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I loved this movie the day it came out and they delivered it the day before they said it would come out. I love both actors and actually have no idea where to look in this movie - Damon and Douglas!!!  Perfect together.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It was a nice movie but not a true cerebral challenge.  It was more of a ride that takes you through places you've seen before but seeing those places from a different but not better perspective.
B005HER69M|4.0|As Captain Picard, Spock and Data walk out of the Romulan interogation room at about 40:33 minutes into the episode, they pass behind a crystal art piece displaying the image of a guy in glasses chewing gum.
0151003084|5.0|love love love this  plan to buy them all for myself and give as gifts<br /><br />guarantee you wont be disappointed
B001TW68P4|5.0|This is disappointing, unfortunately.  Yes, the main Turtles hits are here but why are so many of them mono and why in the world is a commercial included?  Yes, I saw it was in the collection when I purchased but I didn't realize the quality of the entire album would be equivalent to listening to them on WABC AM radio back in the day?  I loved Cousin Brucie and the gong of the bell and all that stuff back in the 60's, but I want my CD to play the best available versions if it is labeled \\"greatest hits.\\"
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book has many intricate stories that intertwine until an amazing culmination at the end!  It was impossible to put it down!
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|I love the saga, and was happy to find them all with Amazon.<br />The best, and I have purchased other movies.  I am vey pleased.
0525952926|3.0|I was disappointed in this one probably because I just loved &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; and I don't feel this measured up to it.  I couldn't wait for this to be published, but I'm not sure I'll even get the third one of the trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this app! So much fun...almost like having a real horse. Teaches kids how to care for animals. Great tool and so lifelike!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Application has good basic functions. It is very easy to use, and has clear simple controls. I wish some of the buttons were larger.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This truly is one of the best books that I have read in a while.  It is well-written and the characters are very well developed.  It is also one of the few books I have read that are based in underground silos.  It was truly imaginaitve and I will be looking for more books by this author.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Wow! This app increased my android phones volume by a huge amount. Music, Videos and all listening media sounds sooo much better. Highly recommend.
B007TUAHVQ|1.0|I am 46 and think this is obviously labeled wrong and should be for 48 and up, not 8 and up.  This is very hard to put together.  The instructions do not do a good enough job of indicating where everything goes, the pieces to hold the wheels on in particular.  My son and I cannot seem to put other pieces on when we placed the wheels based on a count of which hole to use.  When we moved them to a location so we could successfully place the pieces next to the seats on, we couldn't put the back piece on it.  I think there might be a reason that LEGO has cornered the market on these building sets.  Too bad they didn't get the Halo contract.<br /><br />On a positive note, my son and I got to spend some time building what we could together and spending time with him is always fun.  Also, he learned that sometimes things don't work the way they are supposed to.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This page-turner left me thinking about the what-ifs in my own life. Our split-second decisions sometimes have enormous impacts on our and others' lives.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Very nice, but now that Android has built the same functionality into the default keyboard, I haven't really used this much.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Reality of life and death on a U boat. One only thinks of these men and boats as an underwater evil incarnate. Some of them I'm sure were just that, but seeing this movie makes you think of the men simply doing their job in war.
5551369242|4.0|My wife and I love Stephen King, and have copies of pretty much all of his books in both paperback (for travelling) and hardcover (for winter days by the fire).  We didn't have a hardcover Bachman collection, so we got this one.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I think they made this one just to have fun doing it. It was entertaining to watch but I would not watch an Expendables 3 if they made one.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I already had the &#34;Quadrilogy&#34; on DVD, so I really just bought this to get a slimmer slip-case, and for the Blu-Ray picture upgrade.  Haven't watched every one yet, but Aliens rocks in HD.  =)
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The packaging is awkward and doesn't fit my storage needs. The upgraded special effects were great and did not detract from the stories. Overall I am happy with my purchase
B009JVSAVM|5.0|Great cast, great writers. Surprising story lines. I have season six just as good. Hopefully the series will continue.  Look forward to seven.
B00AVF8USS|5.0|The performances are nothing short of magical, inspiring that we are ALL connected and need to be kind to one another.  Mourning the passing of even the smallest creature.  I purchased it because this one is a classic to be viewed again and again.
B0042XA2U4|5.0|This book, The Choice and Message in the Bottle are my top favorites!  You won't be disappointed after reading this one.
1607066017|5.0|It was like the writer was on acid when he wrote this.  Crazy aliens, magic, and sex all in one comic.  Can't wait for Volume 2 to get here!
B00EL8I8IS|3.0|Seen this story one to many times...a virus gone wrong, humans turn into zombies...<br />The action scenes were good though...
B000A0K2JO|1.0|This product did not work for my application.  I do not recommend this item to any one.  Do not buy.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I just returned from a 20 days trip to Alaska and the Yukon and found this story rewarding. I met a couple mushers and petted the sled dogs
B0002HZSE4|5.0|This little horse is just adorable! She is well sculpted and the details are great! My daughter absolutely loves her! The hair is o well sculpted it lmost looks like he really has a full mane! i highly recommend this little horse to anyone who loves schleich products!
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|The movie was good but the quality was not up to Amazon's standards maybe it was the storm I don't know but it was annoying.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Last night I was so addicted to this game that I spent 3 hours playing it. Definitely worth the coins I spent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so fun you jump and play and it is just a really fun game to play and its addicting
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it! Theres nothing like reading the bible!! Maybe you should try reading it!! The daily bible verses is awesome!!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I have read this book many times, but always see new aspects of the characters. There is nothing new under the sun - I can see every character in the people I know today.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun game, every time different level. So cute!! You have to be fast and interested in playing it. Oh and have a good nerves
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app is great but the only thing is that I don't like how you have to have a account or download the full to enter in a channel name but mostly it's great
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|It's a sham it doesn't even let u get into the Wi-Fi of certain system's. Don't get because it's not worth it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one great game with a lot to achieve. Plenty of  different areas to visit. I like the great graphics ,but  the only thing that can be said is fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Because u actualy get your own  games you want and you dont have to pay anything<br />y just evhvcchhcihciihcihc ccuhcigy
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Casting from computer works (via Chrome Browser) fine.<br />However, you can't cast from Chrome Browser from a mobile device or tablet - that's a real drawback and makes this just a 3 star product.<br />You can only cast from mobile devices and tablets if the app has casting abilities written into its code. Currently, the only apps I have found to do casting is Netflix and Youtube. Definitely not enough.<br />Set up is EASY!<br />Cost is great.<br />Love the product.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Hard to admit, but this was my first Stephen King book. (I'd always associated him with the horror genre, which seldom interests me.)<br /><br />But owing to my interest in the Kennedy assassination, I purchased the audiobook via Audible.<br /><br /> At first I wondered why the book was so long.  Then I realized what a master King is at developing characters.  I really felt that I knew these people.  I became so engrossed that I was truly sad that the story had to end.<br /><br />This has whet my appetite for more King novels.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Set up is not easy, does not work with Netflix, and no customer support. I have been spoiled by Apple products that work as intended out of the box. This product truly a disappointment
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Who doesn't like a good, action-packed, end of the world, zombie movie?  I thought the story worked fine... nice constant build up, and then with about 18 minutes left to go, I realized that there was no way the movie could end in a cohesive manner.  Sure enough, it doesn't, and IMHO, that's what killed this from being a great movie.  It just basically ends with a blah.  Had I known this, my expectation would have been better set.  It's fun... nice to see fast moving zombies... exciting!  But, the ending should have been done differently.  Oh well... that's the problem with zombies... never really ends well for somebody.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Coming into this album, I was not a Daft Punk fan, per se.  I own the Tron Soundtrack, which I believed made the movie.  At best, I was a peripheral fan.  With Random Access Memories, they have won me over.  This album is 10/10.  Perfect.  So good.  Seriously, I don't own speakers worthy of playing this music.
1400052181|5.0|This is an excellent book! Once you begin reading it is difficult to put down. Also, the seller was prompt and the book was in very good condition.
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|At first listen I wasn't too confident in this album.  Here's what I did.  I removed tracks 5,6, and 9 and listened to the album.  Now it makes sense!  Without those tracks this album is really good and uplifting.  I wish this was released, without those tracks of course, as a B-side or Deluxe Version of Born & Raised.  That would have made more sense and been better received.  I docked it one star for the bad tracks.
1616890835|5.0|wonderful, as a former window splash artist I really loved this book. Many of the artists I have known over the years, it was great to read about them and see the art of hand lettered signs featured in such a great way,
B009JZY3B4|5.0|I watched this again after listening Nicolas Meyer who directed this and was the screenwriter for others talk of dies tilling the essence of a book or story into the film. It was a very illuminating talk and gave new dimensions to the entertainment of this film. It is still just a story but very well told, acted and presented. Well worth watching again and again ....
B009LDD54K|5.0|The DVD version of any series is great. You can play it anytime day or night. We have basic cable and miss a lot, but the disc player can make up for a lot. The story line is wild and the the excitement is pretty steady. If sexual situations are offensive, do not watch this series.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game does a great job of bringing MTG to the digital realm.  You can easily manage your card libraries, play solo, or against other folks online.  Obviously you lose the personal aspect of the real game, but for some one like me with a stash of Magic cards in the attic because I had kids and changed my priorities in life this has been the perfect game to bring back that excitement of the old MTG days I remember.
B003TTH4IU|4.0|We love watching Grey's. This series isn't as good as the higher budget later series IMO but still good to see how it all began.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great kids game, my daughter loves it. The detail is great and it helps to keep her calm and pass time.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Update 3/10/2014  The rating is upgraded to 4 stars with Allcast now compatible with Chromecast.<br /><br />I had high hope for Chromecast connecting my Nexus 7 2013 to HDTV wirelessly.  After trying it for a week and gaining a full understanding of its current limited capability, I can only recommend 3 stars.<br /><br />I returned my Chromecast. The deal breaker is Apple's not allowing AirCast (also known as AllCast), a 3rd party android app, to cast local content of my Nexus 7 2013.
0811879542|5.0|This book is great! Really interactive and fun. I've read this to 6 month to 6 year olds and everyone was super engaged. Price is great and shipping was super fast!
B009RX7IX8|3.0|I found 'Castle' on TNT about a year ago. I watch the re-runs conscientiously M-F.  I taped some of the 'Castle' episodes when I was not at home.  I even checked out a book at the library by 'Castle'.  (Big disappointment that.)  It took me awhile to find the ABC slot for 'Castle' on Monday nite.  So I missed a great deal of the last season.<br /><br />I get my TV fixes thru a cable company that charges me $75. +/- a month. I am a customer in good standing.  I am completely offended that you would expect me to pay an additional $36+/- to see something I have already paid for.<br /><br />I do want to see the 5th season in order.  I acknowledge some of the subplots within 'Castle' and I want to follow.<br /><br />Give me a break.  n
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is a must read.  We are a diverse group and everyone enjoyed this well written and engaging story.  Loved it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so much fun and it has many levels to play at...you can do easy ones or much harder ones....there are so many fun colors in this game too...my grandson who is 10 and has Down Syndrome loves the game as much as his Nonna does....love it it is worth the time to get it....thanks for offering such fun games....LT
140006922X|3.0|The background about life in Palestine and the Zealots in Biblical times is interesting and well written. However, nothing new, just a good summary of so what many other experts have said. But the real flaw I see in this book is that it starts out questioning the validity and trustworthiness of the Gospels, showing them to be the mishmash of material added by various people long after Jesus's time, all with various axes to grind that numerous Biblical scholars ever since Hobbes and Spinoza have been pointing out for the last 400 years. All right, we think, so here's yet more reason to discount most of what the Gospels say. And then Asian proceeds to lean heavily on what the Gospels say to make his case about Jesus as if he'd completely forgotten that he'd just discredited them. Pretty disappointing - not to say confusing - I'm afraid to say.
1939416019|3.0|This is an enjoyable light fantasy tale that, unfortunately, suffers from inept copy editing.  The frequency and severity of the errors took much of the pleasure away.  Some of the most egregious examples are \\"site\\" rather than\\" sight\\", \\"creak\\" instead of \\"creek\\", \\"their\\" and \\"there\\", multiple small errors, and \\"intercede\\" rather than \\"intersect\\".<br /><br />I'll likely read the future installments of the series as it reminds me of the books I loved when growing up (such as the Chronicles of Prydain).  I just hope the editing gets better so I don't get jarred from the story.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very interesting movie. It was a great movie. Very impressed with the settings and the way it ended. Will recommend it any day.
148951418X|4.0|Purchased a go pro and had no idea how to use or set up.<br />Ordered this booklet and learned many ways to use.<br />If you are a first timer with a go pro suggest you purchase this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Thisd has to be one of the best shows ever put on TV. It's right up there with Rome. The Tudors, and The Wire. Oustanding entertainment, and very human stories.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The husband's secret was a total surprise and the ending was unexpected.  This is a great read. I enjoyed it very much and would like to read more by this author.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|THE ONLY REASON IT didn't  GET FIVE is it lacks good instructions, but they aren't hard to learn even without them. Very addicting!
B00138CYD4|5.0|I love all the songs that he has where others are singing on the album, was main reason purchased, excellent guitar player and wonderful songs how can you possibly go wrong...
B0064MGU98|4.0|Good acting.  Intelligent writing.  Good taste.  Interesting characters. Wasn't going to watch it because of the title, which didn't attract me.  Got over that.  This show is really good!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love playing UNO but have not played very often because you need more of something I can't remember exactly what it is since been so long since played but it is definitely fun.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Every American should read this.  The story of this man is why we have our freedom.  His faith in God sustained him through terrible and glorious times.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|What a great little AP.  I can check the weather without even getting out of bed.  Only wish it could give me a little longer forecast. (Then I wouldn't have to get out of bed tomorrow).
B004W2UBYW|4.0|It was interesting to learn about the person Steve Jobs was. Not everyone is meant to be nice in the world. Some learning are hard to come by
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have enjoyed hearing the British talking and watching the operations of Downton Abbey.  The best one was when the guests were allowed to go anywhere in Downton Abbey to see how the upper class lived.  I can't wait for January 5th for the continuation.
B002OMZTSK|4.0|I really liked this book!  I think it is a good read for any high schooler who also identifies as a GLB teenager. Story was very simple and made me want to keep reading!  Well written with vivid and accurate descriptions of the feelings many gay teens may face or have faced. Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever $7.00 toatly worth it my name is Tabor there is a lot of cool stuff on here and it never gets old I love the updates and other stuff This is for your own good buy it!!!!!!!!-
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This is my favorite app...with the latest updates they have so many different combinations and shapes ..trying to get perfect on each one..my 12 year old loves it too..we play it together a lot and high five when we hita perfect!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! Makes you think about what you need to do without time limits.<br />Each level is quite simple,if you can figure it out. Called myself a dummy a few times after I finally figured out the solution.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I love this author and have never been disappointed with any of his books.  I think I've read them all and this one rated right up there with all the others.  A great read.
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|Great guitar play. Lyrics took a while to grow on me. Solid album. Buddy Guy is a legend. Good buy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is absolutely the best book I have ever read.  I have always stayed away from Stephen King books because I don't care for paranormal, sci-fi, or anything scary.  My daughter plus two friends recommended this book and when I started reading it I just could not put it down.  I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat while reading parts of it and could not wait to turn the next page.  Highly recommend everyone read this book.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Boom boom boom Bang dong boom boom Pow! Wush! Fuuum!! Wow! Hadouken! Sonic BOOM! Pikachu thunder bolt!!! PIiikkkkaaaaa!!!!!! cHU!!!!!! one for the collection!
B008MM9630|5.0|THIS GAME IS awesome. It is addicting fun and like never ends Fairy farm has a lot of cute pets funny flowers and really fun stuff for your person to do.
B000R3NNDQ|5.0|This is a thought provoking book, simply told by recognizable<br /> character, easily shared it many settings.  We already know these birds.  Now we understand them.
B000Z8GZYW|4.0|this movie is way funny, any movie with bill murray is going to be funny. The story line interesting .
0385341008|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I would enjoy it.  I thought it would be difficult to follow a story written in letter form.  I was pleasantly surprised.  By the end of the book I felt like I was reading letters from friends. Near the end of the book I read quite slowly.  I did not want to say goodbye to my Guernsy friends.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|If you like drama about family, be it death, betrayal, etc., you will love this book.  It has it all.  I will warn you that it has three separate stories that intermingle in the middle and come together with one big bang at the end.  You get wrapped up in a woman who finds a letter from her husband to be opened upon his death, only he's not dead.  Then out of the blue you're reading about an older woman whose son is moving away to NY and taking her grandson away.  Her daughter was murdered 20 some years earlier, and she never got over it.  Mystery unsolved.  Finally, we have a woman who is about to learn that her husband is in love with her cousin with whom they are in a business partnership.  Her cousin has recently lost a lot of weight and has decided she wants this woman's husband.  Sound like a lot?  Almost every chapter ends with a cliffhanger and then starts a new chapter with someone else's story until the reader begins to weave their stories together and understand how they fit together.  Brilliantly written and a page turner until the end.  I was disappointed when I finished this book.  I wanted to continue hearing about their lives!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|downloaded by my granddaughter but then deleted so she must not have liked it very well as it is off of my kindle
B004W2UBYW|5.0|inspiring. a leader you want to follow. a person you want to learn from.  a human you want to know.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|guess this is another game that my granddaughter has downloaded and then deleted as I haven't seen it on my kindle
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I watch the show on MTV, I've listened to what happened to the football player and I wanted to see the movie, it was great and I'm glad I watched it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I don't care for this game.  My grandson loves it as so do many other people including adults.  You would have to try it and form your own conclusion
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I thought the main characters were not people I wanted to know,either full of self-importance or were wishy-washy. Over-rated book.
B0063GORYU|3.0|This is another game that is better played on the computer than on the kindle.  Just don't like the way it is on the donwload
B004HWYTP4|4.0|The movie is ridiculous, but I still loved it. A bunch of over the hill actors that are my age or older & I laughed my rear-end off.
B0086700CM|5.0|my grand kids love this game.  I don't play it because I can't seem to jump over the things fast enough so I don't get very far
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was a really good read. Just not happy the way it ended!! I'm ready to hear his back story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|one of my favorite games.  like on the computer if you don't have anything else to do this can be done in a little time
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Kindle for Android is as good as it can get to a kindle experience. I use it with a Nexus 7.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|must be something really cool has it is still on my kindle and was downloaded by my granddaughter which plays on my kindle when I let her
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it held my interest from the very first page to the last one. I was sorry when it was finished
B00CWY76CC|3.0|have no idea about this game.  never saw it on my kindle so I can't tell you anything about it.  not sure where this came from
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is one of the more interesting match three games. I highly recommend it. I was hooked right away. Very fun.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|I like many other NIN fanatics desperately want to like this album - but we just have to admit it's not there.  Not liking the album isn't just about wanting \\"old school head banging\\" songs, because we all probably agree the slow songs on Fragile, With Teeth, and Year Zero are masterpieces.<br /><br />The songs on Hesitation Marks just seem to lack any dynamics.  They just simply don't tell a good story.<br /><br />I think we just have to admit that Trent is getting older and is distracted with two boys and a family now.  Creating a masterpiece takes hours upon hours of concentrated effort.  Imagine trying to do that while getting interrupted every few moments to take care of family duties.  I don't think he'll ever return to the auditory masterpieces of his previous albums and we should all be ok with that.  I think he should just transition to movie scores full-time where his now muted/atmospheric style seems to work better.<br /><br />Thanks Trent for your incredible body of work that you produced in your life.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I have read more books than I could count. From A Song of Ice and Fire to the lightning thief and this book is truly one of the best I have ever laid eyes on. I recommend it to anyone who likes dark fantasy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found myself in tears several tines in this book. John Green has the ability to make you feel/hurt for every character in this book. I feel as though I will forever view cancer differently. Thanks to Hazel.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Loved the book. For someone who wants to start a business, this book offers great practical suggestions. Quick read-great book, period !!!
B00BZBEL4Y|5.0|I liked this version because the actor who played. Ann was true to the books and in the spirit of Jane Austin😍
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|This review is based on the music itself.  I was disappointed with the songs on this CD.  I only liked two songs from the entire CD.  The CD's that I have purchased in the past by this artist are much better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone.  Love the drama, the characters are so well written, and the period of the show is fascinating.
B004KKX814|4.0|my son likes it a lot. It seems a very resistant blade. i really recommend it. it was a bit difficult to set up the red stickers on it. but it's worth.
B00F35BV64|3.0|It was, oh..... so, so.  I thought the acting was poor.  They tried real hard to copy the original actors, but just couldn't get the personalities down right.  It seemed to have a, how can I describe it, a glassy look to it all.  It's worth watching as long as you don't have to spend much or go out of your way to see it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I  bought the books in a bundle of four, I THOUGHT that was all of them so you can imagine how I'm feeling ... the books are wonderful ... I love Tyrion.... he is so witty ....I love the Wolves and all of the kids....I bought the next one Dance with Dragons and I am waiting impatiently for it to load up on my Kindle.... Keep writing you have a great gift....
0399255370|5.0|Laughed so hard as I read it aloud that I woke up our sleeping Golden Retriever, Annie. She looked so sad that she had missed some of the fun that I started over from the beginning. Okay..... yes I know it's a little geeky to be reading to my Golden but I like to practice reading a book to get the flow of it before trying it out with the kids in my work as a SLP & kids yoga teacher at the JD McCarty Center. This book is HILARIOUS! This will be such a fun way to work on vocabulary, feelings, humor, inferencing & more. Hope the illustrator offers some free coloring sheets to go with the book :)<br /><br />Angela Moorad, MS, CCC-SLP, IAYT, RCYP-2<br />Speech-Language Pathologist<br />Founder of OMazing Kids, LLC - inclusive wellness activities for kids of all abilities<br />Facebook: OMazingKidsYoga
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's like tf2 but without all the classes great game but for the leveling you have to level up to buy weapons with in game money not unlocking them and you can't get classes like sniper until late in game other then that if you like fps and multiplayer you will love this game
B003YV64OI|5.0|I just love this processor. So far it has ran every game I have tried Payday 2 crysis3 sniper ghostwarrior 2 they all run fine...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is very different kind of story I usually read. I'm so glad I took a chance. It  completely kept my interest from beginning to end ... why else do we read for entertainment.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|You will get hooked on this app. It's nothing spectacular but it's entertaining and it's fun to create your own posters and catchphrases and such. Even got my friends hooked on this app as well.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|90 minute quite unique film.  Meaning in all the lines.  Terrific music by Cat Stevens really adds to the film!
0486284735|5.0|I absolutely love Jane Austin! I can't wait to get all of her books! I'm putting them on my Christmas wish list.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I found this to be a quick read of a universal story of human behavior, not just a story of early slavery in the United States.
B00DFNEUQE|2.0|I don't like this movie because I was dumb and didn't read where it said that it was in German. Now I can't evenly it in my Blu-ray player. Gonna send it back and get the English version. This is one of my most favorite movies otherwise.
B0058DRSHW|5.0|Must read for any small business owners who want to take their enterprise to the highest level and keep it there for the longhaul.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I am not familiar with the Judge Dredd comics/graphic novels, so I cannot compare the movie to them. Dredd was a good, solid action lick with high body count and the heroes up against seemingly impossible odds. The slo-mo effects were interesting and visually appealing. The plot is simple and not too bad. The villains are cruel, powerful, and overly psychotic. The uncredited performances of the 50 cal machine guns were a big hit if you like large scale destruction.<br /><br />Amazon streaming was flawless as usual. This was a good escape for a late Saturday afternoon.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played you can listen to the song dumb ways to die
B008ROF114|5.0|I may have seen this movie on TV when I was young, but I did not remember enough of it to matter. It was great to see this movie. Dean Martin did a great job acting as the timid drunk with crazy mad gun fighting skills. John Wayne is his usual no-nonsense touch guy, though he does get knocked unconscious twice. He gets the strangest grin on his face when Dean Martin and Rick Nelson start singing. Funny how movie characters of that time just started singing and everyone around them enjoys the song. Walter Brennan was quite a  whacky character. When I was younger, I did not &#34;get&#34; him as an actor. Watching him in Rio Bravo was a revelation. He is quite a unique personality. And wow, Angie Dickinson was so young in this movie.<br /><br />Rio Bravo has a good plot and strong characters. Lots of bad guys out to overpower a few broken good guys. How will come out on top, I wonder?
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|A toned-down, blue-grassy album that shows the musical versatility of mr.mayer. Instant classic in my humble opinion and every JM fan should pick this CD up.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I haven't been able to really get into SOA; but now that I have I must say I love it!
B00CATSONE|4.0|It was great to have part of Tesla's story told.  He deserves to be remembered and honored for his accomplishments.
B00D4K8SBQ|5.0|Works Great! Very easy to use and very compact. Would definitely suggest this product to anyone with an IPad and a digital camera!
B005FIO3PU|5.0|For the standard dorm room desk this light works nicely. It is very convenient and easy to use.  Does not take up very much space.
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|A very poor interactive format. In fact arguably the worst that I have encounter. It's like a book that you have picked up and immediately wished that you hadn't.
B00BXUFIQ2|5.0|This book is amazing! It's my favorite book, I love the whole series, but this book is even better than the first, which was also amazing! Give this a read, you'll love it I guarantee it.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I JUST GOT THIS TODAY;and I have to say ,a very cool app.<br />It doesn't ,freeze up or anything,right on the money,I think I'm<br />Going to enjoy this weather app.because at night ,I  like to see<br />What time it is ,plus, I can set the alarm to my music tracks .and<br />Check to see how hot or cold it is outside.not to mention all the<br />Pretty displays that it features.What more can I say about this<br />Out standing weather app ,it really has it all in what the other weather apple<br />Have ,which isn't nothing to write a review about.I am running out of things<br />To say here.it keeps telling me to keep going ,people out there, please try<br />This app ,you will be very glad that you did ,again it is very worth the money<br />Well all right then I'm going to go and enjoy my weather app, can't say<br />Enough about this I'm so glad I got it goodbye and goodnight.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is the best shark game there is and you will love it you get to eat people and other creatures. its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007N8RULO|1.0|two decks and you cant win....no fun doing that. even ask for hints before every move and still didnt come close
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Though the casting was really well done, the characters themselves left you empty. The wizard did not want to be a good guy, and never actually became one. The girl who became the wicked witch was so naïve that her character was unbelievable. Kinda dark.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It was very heart warming and renewed my faith.  I have shared it with all of my family and friends
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I am a sci-fi fan, and partly because so much of the fantasy genre is just not good. But here is the exception! This fairy tale is incredibly well done! If you are looking to &#34;suspend your disbelief&#34;, this is a blockbuster!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The book is short but very evocative.  We've all probably had that experience of having a great insight and then somehow forgetting it.  This book is all about that...and, of course, good and evil and good triumphant.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|With really good sci-fi becoming more difficult to find, the new cast of Star Trek really bring it on. Casting is terrific, acting is really good, and the story line incredible. This is what you want in good sci-fi!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was an amazing story and I liked the details of his ordeal. I guess I expected more enlightenment on the heavenly journey. All in all it is a good read especially since he's a neuroscientist and can't explain it with a scientific reason.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Awesome movie!! Great job casting, well acted and a roller coaster ride throughout. It'll keep you guessing all the way to the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy install on wifi network and plug-ins through Chrome and Mac Lion.<br />Streams beautifully 720p without hesitation or interruption of content on Chrome browser from computer.<br />Love it! No regrets.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|The tiller was a gift for my husband and he appreciated receiving it. He will have much use for this tool in his gardening.<br />The summer sudoku that I chose to have for my tablet has been a fun experience; many have taken several attempts to complete, so they are tough and time consuming and I don't mind going back to them to work them over; clear and start over, no pencil/eraser and paper needed here!
B00632HWOG|1.0|No matter what I do using Yahoo, home page, email, etc,,, it is filled with ads, it even cuts my pages in half and I cannot maximize to get rid of the ads.  The mail is awful, it does nothing to enhance the experience, it is not user friendly, I have been too busy to find another one but I am going to.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I like reading the Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly. These were ok stories.<br />I don't like when I purchase the partial pages/chapters for a book on my tablet. And, since owning the tablet, I have decided it is still more my favorite to hold the book and read.  I have usually completed the book by borrowing from the local library.  Library lending, tho, can also be done on the tablet and this can be handy when traveling and/or bringing a 'book' along.  I also have the earphones to listen privately while others are around.
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|Very disappointed in this movie. Poor script and not believeable at all. Surprised that Brad Pitt would sign up for this ridiculious plot!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was so enamored of this book.  It was perfectly written, beautifully put together and a dream to read.  Highly, highly recommend.  I desperately cared about the characters, and went out and bought more of his work,
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Great little app, It gives you just what you expect - access to you tube. I have to put in a plug for the Kindle Fire HD here, the crisp, clear, well defined edges of the images make viewing anything a true pleasure. I there is good quality going in there is high quality displayed.
B00AEFYW64|5.0|I love Mark Harmon and Sean Connery! This was a great old movie. I will watch over<br />and over again!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Good for a quick distraction or longer attempt at moving up levels. Greedy Spiders has been fun and challenging for an ol' gal who doesn't play alot of these. The.tip I paid for didn't help much though.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|On all of my fast days I feel so cheerful and more in control in the discipline area.  That's what I love about it.  Once you tame yourself one day, it's much easier to do it another day.  I would strongly recommend this book,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love the fact that u have so many games to choose from.  some are better than others.  but all in all a pretty good time killer
B008XG1X18|4.0|Lots of fun and lots of choices. My first time on I appreciated the tour showing how to get around. But when I was finished I had to search for a log out. That's the only reason this is a 4 instead of 5.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Many great characters.  The author kept me in suspense regarding the outcome.  I also liked how the author ended the book by telling how the story would have been different if one of the characters had acted differently.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Excellent acting, engaging story and characters, I'm glad I discovered this SCIFI series quite by accident. Certainly one of my favorites now, too bad it ended in Season 1.
1416583432|3.0|The author of the book seems to be a good student but a poor scientist.<br />Her collection of anecdotes about dogs' behavioral peculiarities and physiology is sometimes educative and amusing but not very much in-depth or systematic.<br />She gives a good mentioning of others works in this area but her own contribution looks hardly significant.<br />In addition, she is very subjective. She considers relationships between a human and a dog from a narrow point of view of a single woman living in a big city. Her own living experience seems to be very limited and (as it often happens with old maids) her relationship with her pet becomes too exaggerated. Here is NO description of a dog socializing in a normal human family, interacting with wife vs. husband, with kids, with other pets... This book gives a very solitary point of view.<br />She also considers dog exclusively as a human \\"soul companion\\" apparently forgetting that 99% of human/dog joint history was a fight for mutual survival and the dogs might be as important for the development of human species as vice versa.<br />In addition, very many traits the author attributes to dogs as a result of evolutionary development along with humans do not pass critical consideration. She never considers other domesticated predators - most importantly cats - who developed some distinctly different (along with some very similar) traits under the same circumstances. As a matter of fact, she hardly mentions cats in this book - mostly chimpanzees (who are NOT domestic animals). And as a majority of dogs' owners she is completely ignorant of this \\"alternative\\" branch of human pets and their interactions with humans and dogs (I have had both cats and dogs - separately and together in my life; the dogs and cats DO cooperate with each other in the same family - e.g. they steal together, not ignore each other).<br />Also, she has a naïve view that all the dogs are very much the same ignoring distinct behavioral differences between different breeds and insisting on superiority of mixed-bred companions. Apparently she does this from her singular experience with a single mixed-breed dog and she never handled pure-bred (especially working) dogs.<br />She also has a pre-conceived notion that we as human beings are inherently inclined to favorably contact with dogs. Apparently, the people of some other nationalities who was not grown within a culture like ours where the dogs are present in every child book, have a different point of view. They often consider dogs as a food or danger, not as companions. Some of my international friends are in panic even when they meet my fluffy friendly cats, not even barking dogs.<br />The book is absolutely useless for those people who never had a dog (except some sentimental whining, which may encourage some good souls to adopt their first pet). For those who has/had - there is not much new/helpful information.<br />I would say the book is an amusing reading for an air flight, then it can be put in recycling (as I did).

0375701427|5.0|Having grown up in the 60's it was fascinating to re-visit the era of &#34;free love&#34; from the dark side. Well written, thoroughly enjoyable.

B005LAJ16I|4.0|Except for the &#34;America is the bad guy lean&#34;. the plot is believable and entertaining. Incompetence at the higher levels of intelligence gathering is probably true.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really love this game I love how the dragons are really cool and also i recommend this game to dragon lovers everywhere!!!!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Even prints from my Kindle Fire HD! Meets all mu expectations. I would recommend this to everyone who needs wireless.
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|Yeah, you can make pretty drawings for about 30 seconds and then you wonder why am I wasting my time with this?  It just seems so pointless.  Does this app have any practical application?
B001NLL93W|5.0|It keeps you intrigued. Even if you have guessed some the plot. I am curious as to the rest of the might behold.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Very fun game .... and quite addicting.  :)  And the twist of golf makes this solitare card game extra fun.
0486438600|5.0|This book is definitely for the more ADVANCED henna tattoo artist or someone who always has a natural gift for drawing. :) Most of these designs would definitely take 20+ minutes to do.
1878424319|5.0|It gives a simple guideline to improving the quality of live. I have read it a couple of times and am probably going to read it again. Everyone I know who read it loved it.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Very realistic, House of Cards has the workings of our leaders and their deals down pat!  Kevin Spacey does an A+ in his role.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Flynn did an amazing job with this book! I couldn't put this book down and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time! Great author!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this thing! I have AppleTV, I have Google TV, and I have a smart TV. This Chromecast gadget is what I use the most. I can't wait for them to add more apps. Plus it is so easy to use. If you don't have one you are missing out. I will take it whenever I travel.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Not bad I don't regret watching it. It has lots of suspense and edge of your seat action. All in all a good choice for a movie night.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVE ALL THESE BOOKS!! THEY KEPT ME UP ALL NIGHT READING THEM! WISH IT WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO THOUGH!
B000TGCR38|5.0|The actors and actresses did a good job of portraying the writers sense of this aspect of World War Two.
B00FAJI116|1.0|[[ASIN:B00EE3KMOI Episode One]]Great series, until you get to the penultimate episode and there's NO final closure because the last episode isn't available. Amazon advertises an 8-part series, takes your money for each one, and then withholds the final season show where it supposedly all comes together! No explanation, no \\"tune in next September\\", nada. Really turned me into a cynic for Amazon tv series.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved it.. It's different! I mean obviously you know the starts will survive but they still keep you hooked Will be watching the new one in Nov.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game. It is fun and exciting. It also can be a very challenging game. It takes some concentrating and remember.
B00F35BV64|2.0|So is the entire blockbuster movie culture. Not much more to say. This blows. I quit watching it an hour in.<br /><br />Actually movies in general are boring. I may not be the best person to expect a balanced review from. I would pick reading a book any day.
B0067AC5KA|2.0|While I like history and enjoy a good murder mystery, my imagination could not reach this far.  Best loved by some one who found the characters more real to them.  Sorry!
B000SEFNMS|4.0|Great novel with excellent life lessons and messages.  Those who love the Alaskan wilderness will love this read.  Thanks Jon Krakauer for your dedication in getting this story told truthfully to the best of your ability.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|I love this film, its subtle and well done, you beleive every moment of it and CANT BELIEVE YOU EYES when you see the twists and turns thoroughly disturbing while still being magical. great great film and the product itself was superb.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Really good book buy not for children it says f***. But still an amazing book.  This book is nit like theTVshow.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Everything's fine... but there's one problem. I CAN'T ACCESS IT ON KINDLE FREETIME! I mean, it's an app and I own it. Why can't I play it like any other game? THIS IS ANNOYING PLEASE FIX!!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Exactly what I wanted and what I would expect from a watch made by Seiko. I work for the US Forest Service and it compliments my uniform perfectly. I especially like the plain unpretentious look of this watch. The numbers and hands glow in the dark and I like the fact that I'll never have to buy another battery again.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I first thought this would prove to be a boring task but it has proven to be addictive. You progress through stages and they get more complex with each level. If you are looking for a fun distraction download Quell.
B009OYTAL8|3.0|The writers could have drawn more from the dramatic potentials of the original character and relied upon much less schlock and filler used to satisfy the younger audience.  I stayed with it and will follow into season two.  Perhaps, the writers will have slapped a few more barrels of water by then and will have drawn back enough to bend the bow for a more powerful telling of a good story.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie was a very pleasant surprise.  An excellent cast with amazing CG effects.  The good guys are really good, the romance is well played and believable.  The bad guys are evil but not very scary so the younger set can watch.  Overall a great action, adventure movie.  Again if you like this super hero movies this is a must watch.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is fun and it challenges me. It's not the easiest game in the world but it makes you think.
B00A1C17EK|5.0|Shakespeare's historical plays can be a tough sell -- after all, they are political dramas that most modern people don't know much about.<br /><br />But \\"The Hollow Crown\\" is up to that challenge, bringing to life Shakespeare's famous historical tetralogy (\\"Richard II,\\" both parts of \\"Henry IV\\" and \\"Henry V\\") with an all-star cast and beautiful direction. The backgrounds are lush and the direction is powerful, but the real credit here goes to Tom Hiddleston, Patrick Stewart, Ben Whishaw and Jeremy Irons.<br /><br />In \\"Richard II,\\" a feud between Henry Bolingbroke (Rory Kinnear) and Thomas Mowbray (James Purefoy) leads to a duel... which is interrupted by King Richard II (Whishaw). Instead, the king banishes both men, and snatches the inheritance of Bolingbroke when his father (Patrick Stewart) finally dies. The nobles grow angry, and Bolingbroke begins to build a rebellion against his cousin -- with tragic results.<br /><br />The story then skips about twenty years into the future for \\"Henry IV.\\" King Henry IV (Irons) -- formerly Bolingbroke -- is troubled by brewing wars with Wales and Scotland, as well as the sudden rebellion of the fiery \\"Hotspur\\" Percy.<br /><br />He's also not too happy with his son Hal (Hiddleston), who spends his time frolicking with thieves and pranksters, especially the corpulent Falstaff (Simon Russell Beale). When the Percys revolt against the king, Hal is given the opportunity to prove himself a worthy future king, and sets out to battle, with Falstaff beside him.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Henry V\\" follows the new young king as he disarms assassination plots and prepares for the Battle of Agincourt. As he prepares to conquer France, Henry V grapples with his new responsibilities and seeks to find out what his men think of his rule. And he seeks to solidify his eventual victory by wooing a French princess.<br /><br />\\"The Hollow Crown\\" has the benefit of three directors -- Rupert Goold, Richard Eyre and Thea Sharrock -- and each one directs it in a way that befits the story. Goold's direction is elegant, with lots of soft white light and ornate details; Eyre's is harder and colder, with lots of period grime and slop; and Sharrock's is full of shadows, dirt and blood, but ends with elegance and light once again.<br /><br />And the entire production has a feeling of respect -- you get the feeling that the people making it know and love Shakespeare's work, and wanted to present it in the best way possible. The sets are impeccable -- from shimmering forests to a grubby little tavern -- and they take the time to explore the comic (Hal doing an impression of his dad) as well as the tragic and dramatic.<br /><br />As for the cast... they are all brilliant. There are seasoned veterans (Stewart, Irons, John Hurt, David Suchet) acting alongside relative newcomers. Whishaw plays Richard as a floating, effete king who likes cosplaying as Jesus and hanging out with his boyfriends, uncaring about how his kingdom is crumbling around him.<br /><br />And Hiddleston gives a tour-de-force performance. His Hal is a mischievous, clever young prince who knows he will have to grow up soon, and Hiddleston plays him with equal skill as a prankster and a noble young king. He's easily holding his own among the veterans, while showing charisma enough to convincingly play a monarch.<br /><br />Sadly Patrick Stewart and James Purefoy don't stick around long, although both of them do good jobs in the time they are there. Suchet gives a powerful late-in-the-game performance, Irons is excellent as a crotchety king who fears for his country's future, and Beale is quite good as the womanizing, boozing rogue Falstaff, who realizes that Hal will eventually cast him off.<br /><br />\\"The Hollow Crown\\" is a virtually flawless adaptation of Shakespeare's classic Henriad -- and if this can't get you interested in English history, nothing will.t in a way that befits the story.

0425261360|1.0|After the book which featured a miniature pony roaming some island, I gave up on Scarpetta. Have read only two since then. In Bone Bed and the previous title, Kay has become a basket case. Not one of the characters gathered around her is trusted or loyal. In the front half of this book, a prosecutor, a defense attorney, a judge, at least two staff members, a security guard, Marino, Lucy, and spouse Benton are all suspected of backstabbing, jealousy, and throwing her under the bus. She seems incapable of asking a direct question regarding her angst-laced relations. In short, Kay has no redeeming, likable character traits.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this classic Mahjong game with options for every level and preference. Nice to know we can still count on the classics.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There aren't enough words in the world to describe this book. There just aren't. If you have never cried before, don't worry. You will if you read this.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Just wish I knew which parts are true!  This book was a delightful read.  It's humor was fresh, witty and often just plain weird.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|good fantasy adult read.  quick and easy with suspense.  the only thing I would have preferred was a better ending. the ending was good but not great.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Says its at 100% but doesn't install. Therefore jacking up my kindle. Thanks a lot. Id love to delete it but...I can't...go figure.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Love this show. Great characters! Extremely well written. Can't wait to get to the next episode and see what's happening.
1416955070|5.0|I ordered this book as soon as I found out it existed. The condition was great, the book itself was a very good read and the person that I purchased it from was very friendly and even put a personal note on the order receipt. Would definitely order just about anything from this person again.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|This item works great on my phone and my Kindle.  Wish I had got one of these a long time ago.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Couldn't put this book down! Loved every chapter. Loved the characters and plot twists, I'm immediately buying the second one!
1609617401|4.0|This is an excellent read for those wishing to know how we are so often misled by foods that taste and look good!<br /><br />My only concern is that it tends to give the foods themselves, such as wheat, a &#34;bad name&#34;. Essentially it is not the food itself that is to blame, but the way we Americans use it.<br /><br />We all need to take Dr Davis' warnings seriously, while remembering that we are meant to enjoy life, not be manipulated by it.<br /><br />Thanks Dr. Davis
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Although it took me a while to get into the method in which this story is told, once I did, I couldn't put it down. A grown-up fairytale of a ride with a fast pace. The reader roots for all the right people for all the right reasons. A very enjoyable tale.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I loved the chemistry of the actors and the magic theme. I figured out the end early but then in the middle thought I was wrong. By the end it turns out I was right so the mystery part was fun. Very entertaining.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|The story moved very slowly and was redundant.  It took several chapters to explain that a character had a horrible childhood, when one chapter would have sufficed.  The characters lacked development.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|Either I'm missing the &#34;nuance&#34; of this game, or there's really not much to it, and the tilty controls don't tilt well enough.
B004VQRCGE|5.0|Totally unpredictable and very addictive television series! Love how it is based on the book The Colorado Kid, but the show is called Haven. Great stories and excellent casting and character development. I was completely hooked and now have seasons 2 & 3. Thank you for the first season!
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|It's pretty, though not ground breaking in  any way.  Fun to play, and repetitively so.  Worth a buck.  Maybe two.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|MGMT's releases just get better and better.  I know that a lot of people thought that \\"Congratulations\\" was a mistake as it worked away from the synth pop anthems of the first album.  So many other artists have copped a similar sound to \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" that I'm not surprised that MGMT would seek new directions, and I'm thrilled that they have gone in the direction of Nuggets-style psychedelic garage rock, space rock, and art rock.  The new album is simply amazing ... great soundscape designs that surround every song in a unique world that still orbits within the same universe as the rest of the album.  To me, this sounds like the Electric Prunes produced by Brian Eno, which makes me happier than anyone probably has any right to be!  \\"Introspection,\\" my current favorite, has shades of \\"My Green Tambourine\\" if cut for \\"Another Green World.\\"  Perfect!  I hope they keep going in these directions: MGMT + MGMT + MGMT + MGMT.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Doctor who is by far one of the best shows ever. It is scientific fantasy show made by the BBC.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I would recommend it to those looking for a simple game to pass the time.
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle's book is so engaging, could not put it down. Made me appreciate our military more than I already do. God Bless Chris and his family.
B008TG5H9Q|2.0|I was expecting something more grand so to speak.  Not really what I was expecting.  I guess you get what you pay for.
B004T6IBNY|4.0|Several versions to play and plays well on my kindle.  One game app I recommend for those who are pinball fans.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|good app otherwise. this review is also annoying because there is a word minimum. all and app the niose r great because you can mix them.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This was a book group read. It made for an interesting conversation! It's a well written and crafted story but ultimately disappointing in its conclusion. Read this book if you don't mind disliking every single  character and don't need a happy ending.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Classic appearance. Lots of choices. Times are tallied and posted automatically. Sometimes difficult to see but overall a good game.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Glad i purchased the season finale. Didn't have quite the ending I suspected but still great episode. Would recommend for others. Great quality pictures also!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really like the appearance of this. Not much info regarding games and scores but overall a good game. Wish there were more games included too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great graphics!<br />Nice board and the extras are good too. I like it because it's like being at<br />the arcade.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for Captivated by You!! Crossfire novels are so addicting. Love all the drama & hotness - thx Sylvia Day ;)
B009RX85N0|5.0|Keeps you engaged, and good plot. Suitable for kids and adults alike. Helps if you know your fairy tales. Enjoy.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Takes a little getting used to moving around. A little easier sometimes than some other games I've played, but controls sometimes not sensitive enough or intuitive.
B00C6BACF4|5.0|being a big fan of this movie and only had a digital copy befoe i had to get the steelbook edition and its worth it. steel book is strong and not cheap, does not feel like it will bend or get dents easy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like the movie get the app. The new update lets you get coins more and there is a new place. I have no problems with the game at all. I highly suggest this game for all ages.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|great movie and worth getting it on steelbook as it comes with blu ray dvd and digital copy. great addition.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The characters were interesting.  But just the slow progress between the levels lost my interest.  I wanted to know what happened so I was interested.  But there were pages and pages of little activity.  So I skipped through areas.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great coupled with alarm clock app which is made by same  company .  There is actually a button on your clock which links you directly to Weather Live  and all your local conditions.  .
B00BR476TG|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies that we have seen. The story line kept you entranced throughout and the scenery was phenomenal. The ending was truly inspirational.  I would highly recommend this to everyone.
B003B02O0U|5.0|This book was a page turner. . I found myself reading chapter after chapter whenever I had a break in my  day or sleepless nights.  I want to now see the movie and compare the mystery of the book to the film version .  I would recommend this book to all who enjoy stories with twists and turns
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I was just app surfing and I saw this free app so I got and I couldn't do very anything at all. You had to pay for almost every thing! I got it today and got rid of it today. If I were u I would not get this app, it's cheap!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game I am always on it!!! lol I even play on my husbands account because my credits don't last very long
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|OMG how could they end the season like that! Two main characters gone! I cant wait to see what happens next!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Was a good read but kind of drawn out . Thought there would be more drama! Too much about nothing!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Totally entertaining. Just good TV in a time when reality shows are the rule. Very refreshing. Occasional issues with the accents, but you acquire an ear for it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|As much as I love the film, I do love the book just as much! I'm surprised I keep hearing of these books after the films release but I'm glad I do so I can fall in love! Now to finish the series!
0439023483|5.0|A young girl, minding her own business and taking care of her family, now gets pushed into the intrigue of dealing with heartless and exploitive government that is totally heedless fo the needs of its people. And rises to levels of strength she didn't know she possessed.
0066620996|4.0|Think this is a book I will keep or at least make lots of notes in so I wanted to buy it as cheap as possible. Good deal.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|I have seen a lot of Movies!Trust me when I say that you might not want to pay too much to see this.Actors are good but it is the same old story.Some scenes are just unbelievable.Example = A country has best Intel,walls around their city.The walls are not guarded properly and they do not know that noise is a problem?Come on movie makers you can do better than that!<br />Thank you for reading my comment.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really enjoy this game. many different vehicles and stages also can upgrade your vehicles. tons of FREE fun. thanks
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This is a series that is unlike the rest, finally the same old story lines have been  broken.<br />Dexter is unique and different and always has you on the edge of your seat! I am very saddened by the news that season 8 is the last of the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|loving this app it so addictive I can never stop playing I would recommend this app to everyone I know l.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I avoided this series because I heard how badly it was written. However, being a fan of Charlie Hunnam, I decided I'd read it before the film is out. It wasn't as poorly written as I'd expected. Some obvious early writer mistakes--such as inserting unusual vocabulary at weird times to seem more intellectual, etc.--but that was easily forgiven considering the story was intriguing. Grey is a character you want to pry into. I'm not into this genre, but was sold on the entertainment value and am downloading the next book because I need to know what happens next. Light reading and enjoyable.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|I love most AC/DC, Ballbreaker on back.  When Airborne came along, I was truly blown away.  These guys are a heavier, faster version of AC/DC.  Recent AC/DC cannot come close to ANY of Airborne's three albums.  Even though I am disappointed with recent AC/DC, thank God for them, or Airbourne and many other bands may never have evolved.  You can't go wrong with any of Airborne's trio of albums, buy one, and expect the same in the other two.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I love this movie so much. not only does it have christian bale AND Hugh Jackman, but it also has Michael Caine.<br />Also, it shipped fast, and came in perfect condition. Satisfied!
0684857219|5.0|This massive book contains everything about Arnolds favorite routines, foods, and workouts.  I wish he talked a little more about the drugs that HE took, nonetheless this is a comprehensive book.  Arnold writes for beginners, then goes into supersets, drop-sets, static holds, and more advanced stuff.  This is not simply a how-to book, but Arnold gives his opinion about all subjects that he writes about.  He is the greatest modern era bodybuilder, so his opinions are ones that should be considered.  This book is a steal at less than twenty bucks.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Though this book was short, it took me three evenings to read it. It was not easy or breezy and it needed all my attention. Gaiman is a genius. He has created a new fairytale, one for our times. Women are forces of nature- good and evil. Though his memories have been sucked out by reality- he visits a magic place and they come rushing in like the tide of the ocean he describes. He lived a whole lifetime in a few short days when he was seven and going back to his childhood home, it comes back to him. What else do we forget from the magic of our childhood in our rush to join the world of adulthood? What happens to us when the magic disappears? Through his refreshed eyes, we see the world as he remembers and though mythical, it was more interesting, scary interesting than a lot of the other books I have read in this genre. Bravo!!!
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|SEBASTIAN  BY CHRISTOPH FISCHER<br /><br />This is the second in the Three Nations trilogy and is equally as good as the first but in a slightly different way.  It begins in Vienna during 1913 at a more gentle pace but picks up momentum along the way as we are drawn further into life in what develops to be very troubled times.  This is historical fiction at it's best.<br /><br />How Sebastian copes with having part of his leg amputated when just sixteen puts many adults to shame.  His determination to overcome the many trials and get on with life in the best way endears the reader to him.  It is traumatic enough simply being a teenager in modern day life and to imagine what it must have been like for Sebastian in the troubled times of that era is hard.<br /><br />This book explores how life was in Vienna then, also giving an insight into social behaviour and the ensuing problems that brought.  Sebastian's mother Vera finds it hard to come to terms with her son having his leg amputated.  Already a fragile person this pushes her self confidence further back.<br /><br />Sebastian takes everything in his stride and works hard in the grocery store when his father goes off to war as World War One progresses.<br />After believing that he would never have romance with his disability, he begins to fall in love thinking it will never be returned.  After all, who would want to be tied to a one legged man!  Unfortunately he has fallen for the wrong girl and that is a setback to his confidence.  Ahh, how we feel for him and want to comfort him - however all is not lost - he meets someone else and his life takes yet another turn.<br /><br />There are many avenues in this story and the author cleverly draws the reader in so you don't want to put this book down.<br /><br />There are many endearing characters and I loved the wealthy ladies who introduce Vera to the world of phyco-analizing.  I also loved Oscar and Rebecca, Sebastian's grandparents.  What colourful and interesting people they are.<br /><br />Then we meet Margit and her mother Piroska, who is another troubled lady.  They are refugees from Galicia who Sebastian employs to help in the store and home.<br /><br />We feel for Vera as she struggles to cope with all the different happenings in her life.<br /><br />Things take another turn when Piroska decides to return to Galicia and persuades Margit to go as well.  This opens up a whole new avenue as Piroska searches for her husband, but I will leave it for the reader to discover how they fare.<br /><br />What happens back in Vienna when the war is over?  Where is Margit?  Will Sebastian finally find true love and be happy?  This truly must be read.<br /><br />Christoph Fischer describes the events in Eastern Europe during that time brilliantly, as well as the facts he explains the social problems and the interacting of different religions.  This is a very good read and I am now looking forward to the third book in this trilogy.ople they are.<br /><br />Then we meet Margit and her mother Piroska, who is another troubled lady.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game not to challageing, needs some T<br />oughfer levels though, but all in all I give it 4.5 stars. I woulggive it a strong 4.  Hope everone enjoysthe game<br />.
B001ANSS5K|2.0|I got really bored with this book. It was the same character in a different book. The female character really bored me.
B000003C51|5.0|When I listened this album there were a lot of &#34;super&#34; guitarists around, trying to imitate the style of playing of Yngwie Malmsteen. I did not expect anything different from that but, surprise!  This is different! This is precisely hard rock played by a guitar master, who doesn't seem to think that technical ability lies only in playing difficult scales and riffs: as a matter of fact, he tries also to entertain the listener, making him enjoy some non trivial music. In this aspect the album reminds me of David Lee Roth's &#34;Eath Em and Smile&#34;, though all the songs are instrumental. The most memorable track of the album is perhaps the title track: try listen to it and, perhaps like me, you'll remember it forever.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I really like a few of the song on this CD. Some of them are fantastic, but unfortunately, some are whiney.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This gives a brief but very important and almost never publicized view of the sickening and unconscionable, wasteful,polluting and oversized food industry. What man does to animals,the environment,other people;  enslaved in sickening and dangerous, bloody jobs in slaughter and meat packing;farming where they are exposed to chemicals and toxic heavy metals used by the agricultural industry,or trapped by the cycle of debt and spending in production that is too big to be manageable, proves what a monster man is when man dominates,controls,manipulates,enslaves;brutalizing and destroying the lives of animals,other people,and the environment.<br /><br />In Food Inc,in the brief scenes where live animals are shown,you see a farmer talking about his animals,who aren't in CAFO's or factory farms,and the chickens who are being slaughtered by being placed,upside down with their heads sticking out, in a cone shaped decapitator,all scream and cry when they're being unmercifully murdered,one after the other. The man seems like he's human and he seems glad his animals aren't in the horrible industrial food chain/slaughter/processing system like most animals slaughtered for food are. Yet he hears and sees them helpless and slaughtered. (I think he was in Farmageddon,another agricultural-practices DVD also). But his idea is more the quality of his food not being so toxic and polluted and unnatural, as the food-products from the mega-operations and unmanageably big producers are;the animals and their lives aren't his topic. They still are slaughtered for food and he pulls the entrails out of a freshly slaughtered chicken as he's speaking. In Food Inc you also hear the cow's voices and see the cold brutality as someone tries to make a sick or lame cow,a 'downer cow' stand up,prodding with an electric cattle prod,shoving with a fork lift. The cow is crying and helpless and in fear. Trying to escape what will only be very evil and cruel and inhuman,when she is finally brutalized and moved,either by force or hoisted,live,by one leg,by a chain which will yank her up till she's dangling,head down and brutalize her. A scene like that is at the beginning of Glass Walls,a 13 minute DVD and youtube video,narrated by Paul McCartney. You don't see the cruel brutality that I know they do to downer cows,in Food Inc.<br /><br />In Food Inc you see the 'killing floor' at Smithfield slaughterhouse and they mention it by name,then all you see is pig after pig,unconscious or stunned,still and unmoving, coming down a large,stainless steel ramp like a wide,play ground sliding board. Though what you don't see are pigs who are very much conscious,going through the boiling water, screaming and going through the slaughter process and skinning, alive,like happens on a regular basis in every type of slaughter. The stunning doesn't always work. Chickens. Cows. Pigs. Turkeys. Goats. Lambs. Sheep. Nobody cares what they do to animals who are destined to be skinned and ripped apart in slaughter. The animals aren't stunned when they should have been,or the way they should have been,or the animals regain consciousness. But nobody cares and nobody has time to give that tiny human act of not sending a fully conscious animal through the slaughter process. Another animal is coming through to be stunned and ripped into pieces,sliced and skinned,gutted and decapitated,in the nightmare gore of brutality,to stock grocery store meat shelves.  You see illegal immigrants,workers at the slaughterhouse,getting rounded up and taken from their home, by ICE. And you see a man taken to court by Monsanto for \\"cleaning his own seeds\\";he had to abandon his fight because he ran out of money to pay his legal fees;someone said fighting in the courts is like seeing lady Justice holding the scales and,whoever piles the most money on,wins. And you also see,and hear about common items in grocery stores,and about GMO products and Monsanto. And one part that talks about successful organic<br />Merchandising.<br /><br />Our industrial food chain is unnatural and wrong. And so many foods are unhealthy and unnecessary.<br /><br />Food Inc tells people what I doubt they know. And also tells people something they need to know,and to start thinking about. And to start considering,and to start changing,and to start doing something about.ng.<br /><br />Our industrial food chain is unnatural and wrong.

B00A4GXJD0|4.0|This isn't my favorite Kid Rock CD, but I like it. It does have soul just like the name suggests.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great game.  lots of puzzles to solve and it will definitely keep you busy for a long time.  get it!
B00ET7ICEQ|4.0|I am digging this CD.<br /><br />I like Sheryl Crow's voice, period.<br /><br />If you liked her other stuff, this isn't as rocking, but it has the same catchiness to it.
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|Not much of a plot. I like war movies but this movie is about zombies, the walking dead. It's about a virus turning people into Zombies and they need a healthy human to bit.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was extremely fun and full of very challenging brain teasers. I enjoyed this game a lot. Want more boards to escape from.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|C'mon, what's going on with Lee Child lately?  The Jack Reacher stories have really gone down hill lately.  This same story could have been told in a book with half as many pages.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Not as much fun as Tom but he is very cute and does give you things to laugh and talk about
1599218011|3.0|Good cheer leading.  Mostly stuff I know. Would have liked more recipes. Fun graphics and layout. Hope I follow the regime at the back of book.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|It has all kinds of new charachters! The graphics are really good...the scenes are interesting too.Thank you for make a game that is so fun!
B009RX7IX8|4.0|I absolutely loved the first 2 seasons.  It's a good thing that seasons three and four were gifts.  Season three left me considering not continuing with the series but season 4 seemed to redeem Castle.  Season 5 has much better story lines and quality writing.  The series appears to have matured even beyond the potential glimpsed in the first two seasons.  They've managed to keep the humor, embrace serious issues ranging from life with teenagers to coping with personal growth in lighthearted ways yet still present interesting mysteries.
0374531269|5.0|This novel is so emotional, we think we &#34;know&#34; about these wars and the impact on human lives -- but in reality, we do not.  The memoirs that Ishmael shares are so beyond our personal comfort yet, we must read them, we must find out, we  must know.  For if we are not aware of what is happening in the world, we can not lend our hands to help.  We will not recognize when another country is falling into evil hands.  We must know, we must help, we must love.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game could almost make you claustrophobic if it wasn't so much fun! I would recommend it to those who like to use their noggin to get themselves out of a tricky situation.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I really liked the speed with which I received this and it is a good product.  I was pleased that it was what was described and there were not surprises.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Now to be honest , I am loving it. Great on Led TV. I am sure Google will add many more features and will send lots of updates with new applications. This is still it's early days. Give it some time and I am sure it will be wonderful. It is better if you have a good connection. I get a good video qulity as to my connection speed which is MBPS/75down/45up Verizon Fios. Still if your connection is slow...  for now what it does , it is still worth every Cent. I love it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am now on Season 4 and loving every excellent episode.  The writing, acting and production values are superb.  The continuation keeps you in high interest and I watch many episodes in a session.  I find it an absorbing escape and also very current in its theme incorporation of  contemporary events.  Marguilies is magnificent as Alicia and Christine Baranski is wonderful as is the actor who plays &#34;Kalinda&#34; is amazing.  They are such a great ensemble to have so many outstanding stars and characters that are all allowed to shine and develop.<br />All in all, it is an excellent series and I can see why &#34;Suits&#34; followed &#34;suit&#34; in set and setting at a law firm with a woman managing partner.<br />I will be very sorry when I have finished all the episodes!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|I'm already level 34, completed all the quests and still cannot proceed to the Ancient Ruins. Apparently I am not the only one and this has been a problem reported as early as 6 months ago and still no patches/updates! Come on Gameloft! We are WAITING!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love the new Khan.  I hope to see him in a future movie.  Interaction between the main characters was great, but I'd love to see future movies take a little more time with them.  And more alien planet scenes!
B002ZG9968|5.0|It is a very interesting and amusing movie.  The premise of the film is entertaining and what ever J lo's in has to good.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am lost in these books. The characters and scenarios feel recognizable. I am suspicious that perhaps this author has lived through all of this. His memory and his imagination are leading us on an adventure of many life times.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Go ahead and pay for this app, spend a few dollars here and there to increase your progress, put the time into it to for simple entertainment. Then once you put a bit of time in, don't be surprised when your game progress is lost and there is no way it can be restored!!! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but to me, that is called a scam. I am not sure if Gameloft is just not as advanced as other game developers, but most of them are smart enough to sync your progress to some sort of account system to where it can be restored if there are any issues with the device or application. In my case it was not the device( no system crashes, or  damage to the device) and according to the nice customer serive Rep there are no &quot;known&quot; issues with the program....
B0091REZMW|5.0|First I must say I already have this game on my phone,so when I got my Kindle I just had to have it. So coming from a smaller screen the graphics that I already loved are now even better. What I originally loved about this game was all of its different rooms,& all of the different side or sub-rooms as well as the events that randomly pops up. Yes it takes time to build up to higher levels ( especially when you don't want to pay for any of the extras) but it's worth it in the long run if you really love hidden games like I do. But everyone has there own opinion. I recommend it,I love it.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Not a very good game i downloaded it because there were a lot of five star reviews and four star reviews this game suxks trually
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a kid. Richard B. Riddick is one of the most fierce, indomitable characters ever created, and he and this movie are highly underrated. If you're looking for an action-packed, violent, suspenseful movie with some pretty witty one-liners to break up the intensity, I highly recommend Pitch Black.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game but haven't gotten the new updates to it my Husband already has it why don't I Pissed
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't think I've ever read a book where I enjoyed the epilogue more than the meat of the book. However, this book was truly amazing.  When you really think about it-life is really one big secret.  I absolutely loved it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|another Angry Bird to entertain us. Perfect for traveling with kids of all ages.  Can't wait to let my four year old grandkids check it out
B0038YWPZS|5.0|This was a awesome and priceless keepsake! Love and cherish it! This is my favorite movie of all time! Wow:)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Larry McMurtry's series beginning with &#34;All My Friends Are Going to be Strangers,&#34; is one of my favorite fictional series.  The subsequent books follow one or more of the characters.  &#34;Terms of Endearment&#34; is the most famous of the series.  This story follows the bound characters in one book.  Like the author's two previous books, Afghanistan is one of the characters.  Each chapter tells the story of one of the characters from their point of view.  The characters and stories are rich and spellbinding.  Although some of the stories are sad, the story ends on a high note.  Another great page turner.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This app is really fun, and easy for beginners like me, and the plus side is that it's free! I recommend this app to any gamer who needs something to do in their spare time. Glu Mobile is a great app company and I suggest you check out some of their other games!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Not the story I remember, BETTER.  This was a supprisingly good movie, maybe not for little kidds though, let them listen wit blinders..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series! It's just good television. A friend of mine suggested we watch it several months ago. While on a trip without television, I watched two shows and couldn't wait to get home to finish watching the season. One weekend we watched an entire Season!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Omb its so cool girls will like this game and guys I'm a girl who loves scary  things so try it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a excellent story about love, determination, loyality and trust. It was also an exciting and exhilirating read. I found it to be a page turner.  I could not put the book down.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|While in Europe on business, &#34;Pompeii&#34; was playing on the radio about every hour or two.  It's quite catchy and was playing in my head while on the flight home, so I listened to Bastille's other songs on Spotify and ultimately decided to buy the MP3's.
B0097A2LTW|5.0|Was captivated by this movie when I was 13 years of age and man..... It still a lot of fun to watch even now that I'm 38 lol!<br />The story Isn't perfect but the concept of being adopted at that time was very popular (E.T. anyone). The spaceship reminds me of the Naboo cruiser on Episode 1 when its doing a class one maneuver. Pee Wee plays as Max (the spaceship robot)! and does a great job at it! Great for the kids
B00459EZLW|5.0|Simply amazing. SG1 and SG2 are horrid. They are corny and the level of detail is reflective of the time. SGU is high tech, contains an amazing plot (cut short), and is in general a great series.
B0049J3RBC|2.0|Within the first few scenes of the movie, granny is blowing away her stuff with a semi-auto shotgun trying to kill the rat.  My 5 year old is pretty sensitive and was shaking like a leaf before I could stop the playback - I just didn't realize it was going to escalate so suddenly like that!  A gun?  Great.  So anyway, that brought on a good discussion of what guns are, why all those holes in things appear when they go off, and what to do if she ever sees a gun at a friend's house (and reminded me to make sure to ask other parents on any playdate if they own any).    After she went to bed, I went down to finish it - was pretty horrified to hear the main little rat chef scream out \\"SHUT UP\\" at his friends.  That's serious rudeness and not tolerated in this house.  Finally, the main young human chef got totally plastered with his boss on a bottle of wine, and acted completely s***faced - not really \\"G\\" movie material I'd say - it looked like something that would be a lot of fun (and it can be... just not for a 5 year old).  I do need to screen things a bit more before showing I guess.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|I love books that entertain while opening the reader's eyes to a social issue. This book was a pleasant surprise that way.
0425252868|5.0|As a History major and a serious church person, I have long been troubled with the mocking question in my mind, &#34;where were all the German Christians&#34; during WWII.  A least one of them, Franz Stigler, was in the cockpit of a Messerschmidt 109. Read this true tale in which Franz decides, &#34;This will be no victory for me.  I will not have this on my conscience for the rest of my life.&#34;<br /><br />When I try to tell friends about the story, I invariably tear up.  &#34;A Higher Call&#34; is a gut wrenching, heart warming story. Whether you are speaking English or German you recognize, God is good and Gott is gut.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's so cool. I can talk with my friends even when I'm not in town. And I can have people talk all in one conversation. And I can meet new people. I recommend it to everyone.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Karen Joy Fowler's novel is way to go to college in the 1990s via Rosemary Cooke, the daughter of a University of Indiana psychologist.  Two pages into the novel will have you completely in her stead, thinking and experiencing what she does.<br /><br />So it's a good read.  No.  It is a good read with a family perspective that will alter how you see yourself a bit within your family.  It is a science story.  It is intelligent as well as being a fast ride down a sliding board.<br /><br />Do not look ahead or try discover what is to come in the story that develops from the middle backward.  If you must satisfy your curiosity a bit in advance of the plot,  try the primate research site at the Central Washington University ([...]  Fowler has written a superb novel and an indirect work of science.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I ordered this twice from you and neither DVD played.  Guess I'll have to download from Netflix to show my grandkids.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|The game controls were easy to maneuver, graphics were pretty decent. The only part that was a little annoying was trying to do multiplayer mode to see how it works and I kept losing connection. Soloing not a problem with connection.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I give four stars for storyline. The series are by far my favourite books but just could have been written a bit better, as far as a bit too many sex scenes described in the same way. I think I'm in love with Christian Grey and he doesn't even exist!!
0307236722|5.0|So many awesome recipes in this cookbook with awesome illustrations. Need help in this department-so turn to Martha for help. Alot of useful info as well....thanks Martha.

B008J05EL8|1.0|I purchased this app to go with office suite, but I can't even open it up.  I will have to delete it, wish I could get my money back.
B009AY04A8|3.0|this game is fun unfortunately there are so aspects that are not so good. I cannot get the last games to play and just by moving screen around I get a random penalty. Other than that does game is similar to other hidden object games that I have played and they're very enjoyable.
1416955070|4.0|great idea for a story. maybe highjacked a little by trendy influences. great book for teens. overall a good read and enticing enough to continue on in the series. not happy about the star wars twist, but we'll see how the spins out. read it to the end and you'll know what I'm talking about.
B007G92QGO|3.0|I enjoyed the book and read the whole thing - i tend to have to be enticed from page one.I wanted to know what happened to Jacob and the end was predictable
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved this charming book.  The subject matter is unusual yet we can alI relate in some way to the main character who has autism.  What a delightful book, I was sorry when it ended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|entertaining and looking forward to more of the same in upcoming months. I'm hooked keep the new levels coming. Had a blast!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is so reliable, it has accurate weather forecasts and it is always updating so I can get the best weather forecasts I can..<br /><br />I highly recommend this app!:):)

B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Both the story and the special effects are excellent. The cultural aspect makes an interesting entertainment for the whole family. I highly recommend it.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I found Lindsey Stirling music on YouTube first and was amazed by it - both in musical and visual/dance elements. Even though this compilation lacks my favourite \\"Skyrim theme\\" I can only recommend it. It's refreshing to see such a \\"classical\\" instrument like violin being used for a pop-like music with great melodies.
B00DC8O6T8|5.0|I heard this cd at the mall and had no idea that the music was so great I listen to it day and night..it also arrived in prefect condition.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I choose four stars because the story and characters were great and it was entertaining.  One thing I didn't like was the political stuff with Locke but that's just an opinion and the dialogue . I would recommend it to people who like science fiction.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|You gotta give it a shot. Take a bit of time to get to know it. This is really one unique game.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. It contains so many lessons that, if people listened to more often, would make the world a better place. Absolutely great read.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|It was a really good book I liked it a lot looking forward to the next one thanks for reading
B000O8OTNC|5.0|GOOD ITEM,PRICE POINT, WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM. IDEAL FOR SMALL, MIDSIZE POCKET KNIVES W/ SERRATED ,BLADES,SLIPS INTO PACKS,POCKETS, EASILY,HOW COULD YOU NOT LIKE A NAME LIKE SMITH'SPOCKET PAL ???.
0316017930|5.0|I originally bought this book because it was a requirement for one of my English classes, but by the end of the book I really did see the importance of what this book has to say. It is spot on with its statements and it is a fascinating read!
014312336X|4.0|Did not quite meet my expectations. Felt not connection to the victim until the end. Loved the historical background, but the story itself and the events surrounding it were so sad.

B00499NHLC|4.0|Bravo to the writers and actors!  Loved it.  Thrilling character development.  If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, I think you will really enjoy this series.  The chemistry is great between Sherlock & Watson!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I loved everything about it: the story, the characters, the world the author created, the way it's written! A really good book!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great story. Characters were very interesting. Kept me up till way past my bedtime. Looking forward to the next tale.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like the colors, cool graphics and story. The writing is very small though. For mystery lovers this is the game and its free. Hours of enjoyment!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This movie is more akin to the comic books unlike the awful original starring Stallone. Its an action movie so don't expect sublime acting or groundbreaking plot. It is a fun way to kill less than two hours. It is very bloody and gory so be warned.
B00199B2Z8|3.0|The book is funny, but incoherent.  I was hoping for a stronger narrative, but it is a collection of essays. They are all well written, I was expecting something else though.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This Homeland series really hit's Home . It make you realize that what you are seeing on the screen is what is going on<br />in the world we live in right now .

B003TTCURU|5.0|At the end, my heart was going crazy!!! The last episodes are just breathtaking!!! The story line was incredible! Good job!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fantastic. I couldn't put it down. John green writes with clarity and precision. It's amazing how he can write from the perspective of a young girl.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This novel drew you in immediately....You really felt involved with the characters and cared about what happened to them....Could not put the book down and felt sad when it ended.<br />It made you think about life and death and how you would react if you were in a similar situation. Highly recommended to all.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|beautiful album ....it was everything i expected .......i listened to it more than 30 times already even better deluxe comes with the extra song
B00EM764ZC|4.0|At first the changes were annoying but now a very handy tool.<br />The navigation works great and very trusted be me and accurate both in the mid South and home in new england.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I chose this rating because I felt like I was intrigued every step of the way reading this book. I felt like I was really there getting a full view of a couples intimacy, it actually made me jealous! Wishing I was Ana the whole time and that my sexually experiences were the same. I recommend this book for anyone  looking for a romantic thrill.
B003TTH4IU|4.0|If it had included all the episodes for the season.  Not sure how many were missing, but there was definitely a gap in the story line between the first two seasons.  Only 9 episodes were listed for Season 1.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|The band and the album. so great.
1444737112|5.0|It arrived in a timely manner and she LOVED it! She used to work with addicts and loves cats, so it means a lot to her. She will reread it and share it with friends.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I love Dylan, but the unreleased/alternate old stuff on the Bootlegs aren't always my favorites. Add to that the baggage of Self Portrait, and I wasn't expecting much. But I had to have it, of course. And now I can't stop listening to it. His voice sounds great...and you'll shake your head in disbelief at the gems that he never bothered to release. For you smart shoppers...right now, you can buy the CD and get the MP3 version included for less money than buying the MP3 alone. Enjoy.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was a very easy and interesting read. The fact that a love story revolved out of everything only added icing to the cake. I loved Matthew!
B005LAII80|4.0|Different and for my taste better than the original.  Karl Urban shelved what ego he has and you never see his full face.  Congratulations actors and director for keeping true to the character.<br /><br />3D was nicely done.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|I enjoyed this C.D. with my kid while doing projects together .so yes it has brought a lot memories up. Good ones. my child plays it all the time. But the case did break on the first day.
0345803485|5.0|Given the huge hype of this book I don't think there's anything I can say that you don't already know. This book is thrilling and grips your attention almost instantly. I'm not an avid reader so for me to get into a book takes a lot and I was hooked from the first chapter. I know many people have given the book flack for how poorly it was written but maybe if you're like me and not a book snob (no offense to those of you are) then I don't think you'll have any problems reading this. Sure, there's some cheesy stuff but for me it's about the emotion and keeping me reading. The author definitely does a good job at pulling at every emotion you have - at moments I was mad, happy, horny, sad, uncomfortable, etc.. I will say, while I did enjoy reading the book that I haven't yet read the other 2. I recently had a baby and haven't had the time but I'm not opposed to reading further.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book. I think the author did a great job (ok, maybe it's no JK Rowling...), it was impactful and incredibly interesting - I couldn't put it down.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is the kind of game I like to play! Graphics are great. But for some reason it freezes my kindle fire. It might work better in Kindle fire HD. Keep up the good work gameloft! :)
0062082353|4.0|I first learned about Chris Kyle on the reality TV show &#34;Stars Earns Stripes&#34;. I enjoyed him on the show so when this book came up as a recommended buy for my husband, it was a no brainer to purchase. I feel ever more honored to own something he wrote given that his life tragically ended months after I bought the book.<br /><br />My husband loved the book - a good win with your fellas ladies. He said it was thrilling and a book he couldn't put down. The book now only details his story on the battlefield but also of his life. He gives the book a personal feel for what could have otherwise been just a &#34;history&#34; book. The Navy Seal speaks very honestly in the book and even has first-person accounts throughout the book both from his fellow soldiers as well as his wife.<br /><br />This is a very real book and well written.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|***O Crappy doodle***<br />Fell in love with this series.Loved it when Rose finally stood up for herself!It's all about the List & Suspense & adorable Muffy lol hey she's got Fiber issues ....so funny love that dog Ugly but cute!!.Loved it.The other to books in the series were basically just a taste to get you wanting more.Loved the suspense in this  ooooOooo Joe!<br />Loved the character name (Rose Gardener) get it lol.Cant wait for the next book.Great series first time reader of this  author thank you InkSlinger for letting me review this whole series!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun. Just really wish everything didn't cost so many diamonds. Otherwise the game is enjoyable. Fun game
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Its a pretty good game. Look out for farmer markets, chickens, shanties, etc. Because of how fast they produce, your always clickin'!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game easy to play fun to do what a great pass time need more games like this out there
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This beautiful novel is excellently written and has an interesting theme! But the only thing I could say is that this book is for 15+  but still is an amazing book that I couldn't put down! Definitely Recommend!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|this series is my life. read it. just go. go on and do it ill wait. read the book. read the book nowwwww.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I am always interested in history of  WWII. I enjoyed the book. Especially the ending. I hope you enjoy this book as I have.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works pretty great! Great now that you can relist from the app! Now if the can only get PayPal app up and running!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|THIS APP CAN BE A DJ AND MP3 player you can search music play it or edit it! Best DJ app ever made!
1401235425|5.0|The court of owls are the best match against Batman as two legends are against each other. It gets even more gruesome as Batman finally meets the whole court face to face (or faces) and this is one of SNyders best work!
B001H1SVO8|4.0|I obviously love Fight Club but randomly through out the movie it would start to lag which got annoying, other than it seeming like a bad burned movie or a scratched disk it was great(:
B003YFIUW8|4.0|but it starts to rag on in the end like it would never end... it just needs to get to the point faster and stop ragging on for like 100 pages
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|This video did not play because there was a DRM failure of some sort. I'd like a refund and please take this movie off my system.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|no doubt about it, it had me smiling till my cheeks would and bawling my eyes out. couldd not stop my brain from rambling on about this book for the next few days. i read the whole thing in three hours straight.
B008QMMEOE|1.0|Only four puzzles are available for free. The rest are locked and can be easily purchased by clicking on them, which is NOT a good thing in an app for young kids.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I do not have devices to use this with besides my google samsung chromebook. I just used it to stream a phillipine viki.com<br />show called Amaya to my tv and really love it. The quality of the video is actually better than the quality on the chromebook, but since it is internet video it is not the greatest. The sound is wonderful.  Everything worked so easily. It takes two minutes to set it up, really, even for non techies like me, and poof, you can stream your webpage onto the big screen. What fun!  I am very impressed and happy with it for my purposes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app I love it its great in 2 ways free and its about horses I love this app and I think you will2 try it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. My friends and I enjoy being able to compete against one another.  My kids enjoy watching almost as much as playing.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|This is another movie that I thought would be good for my grandchildren and great grandchildren to see.  Although much of this is fiction, it's amazing how much of it is truth.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Don't know why every one is saying it has a virus, works fine and is a good game, can be challenging to find all the hidden numbers
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I was a domestic in the late 40s, early 50s to a couple in Southern California. though being a domestic is nothing write home about, I remember them fondly. I was one of the lucky ones, The Help rings true for others I knew in the life of the household &#34;Help.&#34; Very funny, and enjoyable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. One of the best I have ever watched and I can't wait until Season 4 starts. I will definitely be watching.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love this app...so many sounds and you can create your own mixes. I love that it can be going and I can still read my book or play my games before falling asleep.
B001YV504U|5.0|Great transaction and the product was as advertised.  Another great movie for my home library.  Enjoy watching it again.  Product in excellent condition.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!! Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Ghandi is stellar! He won the Oscar of Best Actor and he deserved it!<br /><br />The film documents the history of India during the time of Ghandi and depicts the political atmosphere of the times, a must see for anyone who loves history.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Jodi Foster is so believeable in this movie.  I watched it years ago and enjoyed it as much today as I did then.  Liked everything about this movie and glad I added it to my library.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I think this is one under rated comedy.  While all comedies are compared to the hangover, Horrible Bosses is a close second to the hangover.  Awesome movie.
B0076I624W|5.0|Very well done movie. Amazing dialog....great story.......can't wait for them to make a sequal. Who knows, lightning might strike. Two thumbs up.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Good app for kindle and other tablets or computer. Very limited annotation but all the same its tried and tested.
B00D3PYQT0|3.0|I enjoy the movies and would give it a 5 stars, except for the quality of the disks.  I bought the first 3 seasons series last year.  the first time I played the full 3 seasons, every disk worked great. When I tried to see the series again, only the first season disks worked.  All the disks from the seasons 2 and 3 did not worked.  At this point in time I cannot get a refund.  I do not have a choice but order the series again if I want, and I do want, to watch the movie again.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This is a fantastic app for visual learners. The video and audio quality is excellent on the kindle. Content of TED presentations is wide ranging.....
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved the graphics and the puzzles. I recommend this to anyone. It kept my interest throughout. You should try it.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Fantastic book on the invisible choices we make in everyday life. Useful for those studying behavioral finance and other disciplines. I remember a University lecturer (Science and Technology) talking about the virtues and popularity of the Gartner magic Quadrant, and its popularity and I wondered whether he ever came across cognitive bias.... I recommend you read it slow, its that good...
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|I thought the screen backgrounds made it a little more confusing, but that was probably the intent.  I also thought it had too many characters - had trouble remembering what they all do.  All in all, not bad - but not even close to being as much fun as Angry Birs Rio!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I should have listened to my son and not updated to this version because it is constantly freezing up on me and not opening.<br />I don't like the pictures on the initial screen because they are so bright they wash out the words you are trying. to read.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It's hard too put this one down. You think you got him figured out, then he throws you a curve.
0399159347|5.0|Outstanding characters all and brilliant writing. Brings you to a moral ground you do not expect....absolutely outstanding book.. Haunting characters with haunting decisions to make. Makes you ask yourself over and over again....how would I feel?
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|I really appreciate Jimi's music and his influences on artists like SRV, but this CD quickly feels less like a continuation of his original talent and more like a compilation of leftovers. Enjoy and expand your original Jimi collection instead of buying this.
B00DW36G32|3.0|I love Robert Deniro but I'm beginning to think he can't carry a motion picture anymore like back in the day. I think they were both miscast in this film.<br /><br />The movie itself was entertaining to watch but I expect it will be on Netflix soon for free.<br /><br />Could have been a great story of revenge but it see-saws so much that it's almost comical. Back & forth on who's beating each other.<br /><br />Drink a few beers and catch a buzz before watching and it will be more enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Is fun but way too easy too me 10 minutes and it needs more levels. I have been waiting 4 months for new levels.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Recommened to anyone who enjoys music history. Lots of interviews with big names that made a mark at sound city and an entertainingly composed documentary.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|A bit disappointed compared to the promise of the trailer.  Getting bored with the whole zombie theme.  Been there, done that.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|There are not enough words to explain how terrible this movie was.The acting was awful, the plot twists were obvious, and in general, well... I could have done other more enjoyable things with those hours of my life. Like clean my kitchen.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|the movie is  fantastic.  my three yo  lives watching it & since its in the kindle I  can take it everywhere.  my only issue is the sound is very low.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle and how easy it is to find books, free and to buy.  It is easy reading too.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It is a bit repetitive in tasks and my grandson loses interest easily. He hasn't explored much of the different activities.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Great storyline. Not the stereotypical writing where violence or sex is the main topics or used to enhance the storyline. A deep, thought provoking story that keeps you reading to the surprise ending.
B0028OF7TA|5.0|I love this collection.  You get Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous and Invincible CDs.  The art work on the CDs is same as the original CDs artwork.  This would be a great gift for a Michael Jackson fan.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Very interesting, well crafted scripts, good characters & good actors, this show makes me want so watch the nexy episode . . .
B005UT29Z0|3.0|This was an important moment in our times.  The movie catches but a shallow impression of what minds were operating which lead to this, and their disconnect, that industry's disconnect.<br /><br />The acting is above average.  The story line falls short of capturing something essential.  The ending leaves it as nothing more than a vignette - hollywood's implementation.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|there is nothing spactacular about it but it does keep you going and it is the tree version. The version that you have to pay for might be better.
B000MD9UJC|2.0|The button works great, the led light works great, but when put together the the light beam can't be focused without turning off the light and the head of the mag lite is bearly held in place with one full twist any tighter and the light turns off
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is GREAT fun!  Malkovich, Cox, Freeman, Mirren, and Parker are a terrific ensemble with Willis AND Pidgeon, Urban and Dreyfus are great foils.  Good script.  The Baer commentary film is pretty good, too--lots he didn't reveal but that's ok.
B00785P2QC|1.0|In order to progress at a reasonable pace you need to either advertise for them on your own Facebook account or pay money. Extortion for a positive game experience?  Horrible!
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Sometimes funny and at other times dark, but awesome from the very first page! Jimmy, the junkie trying to get clean, moves to Spain only to find himself in more trouble than he could have imagined. He is weak -willed, and easily led astray by his new best/worst friend Jason, a crazy Australian who needs locking up! A great adventure with laughs and \\"oh my god\\" moments scattered throughout, I can not recommend this book enough to anyone who has been/knows someone involved with drugs or alcohol!
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|The reviews of this CD are great.  Plus you can download the whole album on AMAZON iCloud which is very cool.  A classic CD for everyone's collection that loves BUDDY GUY!
B0058SNKNS|4.0|This shoes are super-cute. I'm not the kind of girl who can wear heels or even dress shoes. I'm too big of a klutz so it cuts down on the type of shoes I can buy for dressy occasions. I got these since they are pretty comfortable and I can wear them with a skirt. You have to be careful when choosing a color as I thought I'd ordered black, but they were actually brown when they arrived. They also run a little big. Other than those two things, they are awesome.
B00B19G01C|5.0|Very believable!!! Great acting and casting!! Need to watch if you are not into the same ole same. It is my favorite thus far!!!!!
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|It has been a while since a book last brought me to tears, but \\"Finding Her Feet\\" did just that. A disaster in the family, in the form of one of the daughters dying, leads to a life of heartache for all concerned. There are glimmers of hope in this delightfully written story, but it is certainly one to read with a box of tissues at hand.
B009FRS9CA|4.0|I love this figure. He looks very accurate to the movie's Batman and comes with a lot of great looking accessories. The cape is a little &#34;eh&#34; as its cloth and doesn't really flow well with the look he has going for him but its ok. His arms are also very easy to come off which gets annoying with posing him. The good thing about the arms however is the fact that I can't really see them breaking completely which is good. Overall I totally recommend getting this figure. Just be aware of how small it is. It doesn't scale close to Play Arts but its a good size.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun game for kids of all ages. Difficult after level 27 but a little boring until you get to about level 25.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The other Sookie books I read quickly often in a day or two. They were fun light reading, great for my summertime vacation, nothing I had to think about. This last book was just awful, the whole thing felt contrived. It was boring, tedious and it took me over a month to finish it because it just wasn't good enough to hold my interest for more then a few pages. I finally finished it just to get it done, like the chore it was. Usually a writer gets better as they go on, this one was written like the rent was due and Ms. Harris had to churn out something. I see another &#34;closure&#34; book is coming out. I admit I will probably read it but I will wait until I see a copy of it at a flea market for 50 cents rather then waste money on it.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|There were some reviews on here around the watch losing time - I've been running over a week or so now and haven't lost a beat. Everything is great but there are two things to get used to:<br />1 - the band is a bit thin. it grows on you though.<br />2 - the mins being larger than the hours.. but who really needs to look.<br /><br />Could improve: the glow in the dark effectiveness. prob just a 4/10 for that.
1476712042|5.0|this is a very good book that will just make you angry that there is not more. The characters are very well developed and likable and their relationship dynamics are entertaining. My only complaint is that it should have ended a little sooner and not tried to span their entire relationship, from meeting to marriage, all in a single book.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I picked up the first book several years ago.  The whole medieval/fantasy genre had never before interested me. It wasn't until the HBO series, &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; started that I decided to reading the series.  Mr. Martin flawlessly brings his characters to life and they are so real, you almost forget it's a fantasy series, until those elements slowly start to appear.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not your typical legal Grisham read.  Dry and slow at first but picks up and keeps you interested until the end.
B00DSTBMMU|3.0|Great tracks mentioned above > really outstanding tracks (EASY, WATERPROOF MASCARA, HOMECOMING QUEEN) which carry the rest (save, a near-great true Country song, WE OUGHTA BE DRINKIN')..Merle Haggard would be very proud.<br /><br />Another positive feature is her voice. It has deepened - I feel more *power* through these headphones, than ever before, listening to a Crow studio track. However, I think she's too far back in the mix...and that's not always agreeable with basically the same production on each track. (Lose the drums on the slower songs...do something different).<br /><br />She does swell covering other artists. On Letterman she spoke of her 1960's/'70s inspirations, like Emmy Lou Harris and Jesse Colter. Why not just do a tribute album to them? Just guitar and piano. call Rick Rubin.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Enjoyed having a nice, fun, old book to read that although a bit slower than current books, still was fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you for this wonderful app. I love it. I love the verse of the day, and the different plans available for bible study.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I grew up playing manning on the computer. This is nice. Good patterns, attractive tiles. Works great. Will continue to enjoy it!
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Great. Did justice to the comic. Plays it serious which - I believe- is the right way to go, the satire of it is in playing it real.
B0091REZMW|5.0|good game mainly doing this to complete a quest though so this amy not be entirley true but nonetheless it is a good game and is enjoyable
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great movie, has a few turn your logical brain off moments but you will be busy having to much watching the movie and watching the lens flares and  phases fly.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it so much, more at the end.It was so good,the author did a great job for all the books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This review contains spoilers.<br /><br />A roller-coaster of a read, this one. I don't think I've ever flipped from rooting for one side to the other, and back and forth like I did while reading this book. I've probably called Amy and Nick a litany of names throughout the reading. They are both incredibly aggravating, frustrating, deplorable people. Yet, during parts of the book, I found myself siding with each of them.<br /><br />I really liked how... broken they were. Both of them. They aren't just flat characters in a book, but three-dimensional with backgrounds and habits, nervous ticks and patterns. They aren't perfect like so many characters are in books these days. They have a slice of human imperfection in their flaws, choices and actions.<br /><br />I loved the slow build and even slower reveal, mounting to Amy's reveal and how hell-bent crazy she truly is. And as a fan of unclean endings (the more tragic the better!), I loved how ambiguous it was. There's no happily ever here. No rainbows. No butterflies and cake. It's an ending that leaves you thinking, an ending where you find yourself hoping even though there's certainly no hope implied.<br /><br />Well-written, dark, thoroughly enjoyable read. Definitely recommend.<br /><br />Closing words: Good luck, Nick. I really hope you'll get out somehow. She's coming for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for all age girls. I am 14 and I love it.<br />I love the graphics.
B00138CYD4|5.0|It will be a classic in my mind cause of all the artist and hits that are on it also
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Always gives me a lift when I watch it.  Yes, our country is full of good and kind people even though we tend to hear about all the others.  And yes, there is still an &#34;American Dream&#34;.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Can you ask for anything more  from Phil to listen to in your home or car to be played all the time
1609611543|5.0|I saw this author on Dr. Oz and bought the book. Fascinating reading and not only have I lost weight, my rthritis has lessened.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I got this app for my 9 year old daughter. She loves playing it. I have not used the app myself but seeing the joy she receives from it is all I need to know to give it five stars.
B002GOAH1A|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter, who hadn't seen it yet, but who is a big fan of Doctor Who and other such shows.  I knew she'd like the steampunk aspect of this movie.  She absolutely LOVES this movie.  It helps that she's a Will Smith fan, but really, this movie is funny and the awesome steam-driven robotics make it even more fun.<br /><br />Totally worth whatever I paid for it.  We've watched it several times and my daughter now uses it during slumber parties (because none of those kids have seen the movie either, although they all seem to know the &#34;Wild Wild West&#34; song from the Just Dance 4 video game).  :)
B00CWVGS10|5.0|I liked this take on a supernatural romance. The characters were enjoyable and the plot intriguing. I even enjoyed the description at the beginning of the boys take on his hometown, it reminded me of my own town.
B009P0U7H2|5.0|Sean Carroll has succeeded in explaining to me what the Higgs Boson is, how it was found, why it exists and what it took to propose it and then find it. What I particularly enjoyed about this book was that it was not just a long lesson about the Higgs Boson. Instead I found it an immersive story about the whole journey that led us to the Higgs Boson. The book is well written and engaging.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the Higgs Boson and its story. I have a background in engineering and so was easily able to engage with the concepts presented. However, I believe that Sean Carroll has succeeded in telling the story in a way that anyone with an interest in science would follow and find interesting. Impressively, I believe this is a book even an expert in the field would enjoy because of the fact that it is not just about the physics but also about the story behind the physics.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I downloaded this app when it was a free item of the day. I love the challenge and can't understand why it isn't ranked up there with other popular games like Angry Birds or Plants VS Zombies. It's cute, challenging and keeps you on your toes.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Got the album because of &#34;My Valentine&#34; which is so very lyrical and touching; had it on &#34;repeat&#34; like, forever.  Rest of album is okay, too, but can't think of a standout off the top of my head.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Where to begin? The characters were adorable and funny. The artwork within the cartoon was amazing. I bought this so that my daughter and I could have a good movie to watch together. Once the movie started my own mother joined. We laughed quite a few times.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Somehow I missed out on the introduction of many of these songs, so I was happily surprised at the durability of most of them.  Paul McCartney is a supremely talented person.  Looking forward to checking his latest oeuvre.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like the fact that I can take my music anywhere I go. I can listen to it with or without internet/data connection provided I actually download the music to my devices.
B008602KQI|5.0|Was a good movie very entertaining! I read the book, film not quite as accurate as I hoped it would be, but still a good movie.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I love beautiful disaster and I love walking disaster even more. Jaime McGuire is a great writer, I can't wait to read the providence trilogy
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A great read. I'm not a racing enthusiast, but as a dog lover I found this truly heartwarming. The love and bond a man shares with his dog can bring him through any amount of turmoil.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a good book I chose it to be 5 stars because I really liked !! I can infer that Hard Luck is gonna be a good book!!!
B00821OX98|2.0|It's not bad, but it's not good.  I tried to like it, but I just couldn't.  War of the Worlds meets To Catch a Predator...
B00A83075M|4.0|Loved the movie but I wish there were more special features! Voice cast was amazing and the graphics were incredible!!!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This has to be one of the most  intreging and yet graphic television series I have yet to enjoy - every second counts. Best show thus far!
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|i thought it going to send like a dvd through the mail, but i can watch it using my pc
B00EI6E17A|5.0|LG is here to stay.  She really shows her talent now and should just improve with age and experience.  Buy this song!
B00F4PVFE6|4.0|\\"Broadchurch\\" has something in common with \\"The Killing,\\" the Danish original of \\"The Killing,\\" and the NZ version \\"Top of the Lake.\\" They're all a little too long and just a tad boring now and then.<br /><br />That said, the cast is very good. I really like the British way of having ordinary-looking people in their programs. It's much more real that way. This is the first David Tennant vehicle I've seen where he doesn't come off as the Doctor playing a new part. His co-star is excellent, the supporting cast are also good. The characters are complicated and layered, as are people in real life.<br /><br />I like the treatment of news reporters in this series. There are three of them, with differing agendas. You can't really say that any of them is bad or good, and their conflicting motivations are shown. The show delineates the bottom line for the reporters -- a good story regardless of the damage it does.<br /><br />It's worth the occasional dull stretch to watch this series.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|I gave this to a friend while she was in the hospital, I thought the short chapters would be good while she was recuperating, and a little humor would cheer her up. She did say she liked it, but then again, who doesn't like Ellen? I hope she will let me borrow it.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Actually I bought this for my husband.  He loves it and has even hooked our daughter into watching the show.  He's looking forward to the new season to come out.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Don't waste your money on this product. I figured for $30 I could just convert the few audiobook cassettes I had in my collection that were not available in any other format. The quality is terrible, with pops, clicks and warbles in the voices. The player reverses randomly during recording. I figured out the software but only because I know other audio programs, it certainly isn't intuitive at all and there are no instructions.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it! I can't wait to read more. And I am anxiously awaiting to see the movie - hope it is as good as the book.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This works very well on my Kindle.  A nice variety of sounds.  I like heavy rain best.  I'd previously tried a different white noise app, which had an audible gap between loops.  This doesn't.  This is my go-to white noise app, at home and while traveling.
B00E0P8VOS|5.0|The content and quality can't be beat. After listening to this bootleg for many years, hearing the quality of this release is amazing. A must have for any fan/collector and if your trying to figure what the band was all about, this comes closer than any other release.
B000003TAB|5.0|Bunch of leftovers between bleach and nevermind in this collection. Surprised that it didn't make the final cut.<br />There's good stuff on this one.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy playing this game very much and I try to play every day,  but I cannot play as long as I would like.  This game would be perfect if the power ups were cheaper and the collections were a little easier to obtain.  I do think its really fun to play.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the costuming and hair and make-up, the plot was good, the overall feel of the movie was a delight to the eyes. Yes there was some violence but in the context of what the movie was about, it didn't bother me too much. The main players (protagonist and her family, allies and friends) held true to their morals and exhibited strength of character, bravery and consistency. I could easily watch it several more times. Loved the theme song too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really wish there was a Season 4. I loved Downton Abbey and all the characters. I definitely recommend it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is so awesome and realistic I mean it's like your shooting real guns and whatever. Get this app.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The theme &#34;what if&#34; permeated the story line and I loved how the author presented this theme and tied the characters together. Also found the ending quite interesting.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The movie was just ok. Good special effects but overall story and character development was just ok. Concept has promising but didn't quite develop as it could have.
B00BQ4NLC8|3.0|Predictable but entertaining. Sometimes the narrative slows down a bit to much. If you're into books that are located in Australia a good choice.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is great free and enjoyable if you know what I mean ;) wink wink nod nod know what I mean two birds in a hand is better than one!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it I felt like I was living in the hunger games<br />I know for a fact thousands  of kids loved loved it around the world<br />Please make another one
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I found it difficult to use on my KindleFire. I was not able to search for multiple items with specific parameters.  Since the program was reset to the generic search, I had to reenter  my parameters for each of the similar items.  My lack of experience with the KF & the app might be responsible for this problem, but I cannot recommend at this time.
B006GLMHBM|5.0|Love me some Carey on a rainy day :))) it's always being my intention to watch the whole thing again and that's a start.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|To say that I absolutely loved The Husband's Secret would be an understatement.  Liane Moriarty blew me away with this novel and as a first time reader of her work, she has instantly made me a fan.  The Husband's Secret gives a short glimpse of the lives of three Australian, suburban woman, at the pinnacle of the worst month of their lives.  Cecilia, Tess, and Rachel all find out something about their lives that they wish they had never known and had never had to experience.  The decisions they make in those short few weeks will effect the rest of their lives.  The story twists and turns as Moriarty gives the reader a glimpse into the inner workings of each woman.  As you read, you find yourself rooting for and simultaneously angry and disappointed in these women.<br />I was amazed at how many times I changed my mind about whether they made the right decision, if I even liked the ending, or agreed with their actions.  I love books like this because they stay with you long after you've finished, and they make you think.  Honestly, the only reason I'm giving this book 4 starts is because it was a tough start.  The first few chapters had a hard time keeping my attention and there were a few times I just wanted to put the book down and move on to something else.  I'm so glad I stuck it out though, because it gets better towards the middle and leads into an explosive ending.<br />Definitely worth the read and for once, a really great book at a really great price!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have rarely seen a game worthy of a five star review but this one is it. not only is it challenging but its also creative in its storyline. the graphics are amazing. once I started playing I couldn't put it down. don't get discouraged if you cant beat a level, takes some practice but you eventually get the hang of it. get the app. definatly worth it.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|New to the blues scene I didn't know where to start. So I looked up the greats and took my chances on their work. Rhythm and blues is a phenominal album. I love it. Its new and fresh but definitely stays true to the blues.The list of guest artist on it is long and each of them compliments the songs which surround it. I woulsnt hesitate recommending this disc to anyone that's a fan of this style of music!
