B00005JNTV|5|Finally, after 13 years of waiting, Frank Miller's homage to the hard-boiled pulp novels he enjoyed as a youth have come to life on the big screen in the respectful hands of Robert Rodriguez.  Sin City won't be for everyone because like many films, they won't know what they will be seeing.  So far, friends of mine who have never read a Mickey Spillane novel or watched a Bogart film think the dialogue's too fast, the dialogue's too over the top and the actors were over acting.  This film was made in the film noir style of the 30's and 40's but by using modern technology they have tranformed it into a magical world that only exists in the pages of Frank Miller's graphic novels.  If you understand the pallet that Miller and Rodriguez used to make this film, then you might just appreciate it for the masterpiece that it is.  <br />Frank Miller started out in comics back in the late 70s, first making his landmark with his famous run on Marvel's \\"Daredevil\\" series in the early 80s where he created one of the most beloved female assassins of all-time...Elektra.  After this, he moved over to DC where they gave him the opportunity to do anything he wanted which produced his first self-titled graphic novel, \\"Ronin\\" the story of a samurai from ancient Japan teleported into the future.  Then came the big one, DC gave Miller the reigns to the character that first inspired him to get into the business...Batman!  Frank Miller produced \\"THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS\\", the story of an old Batman who has given up.  Bruce Wayne has been retired from crime fighting for ten years but a swarm of gangs and violent crime in a Reaganomics Gotham City causes the Dark Knight to return and show these punks that you don't mess with Gotham!  But this time, the police aren't so willing to accept the vigilante actions of old Bats.   <br />Moving on, The Dark Knight Returns brought Miller a lot of publicity which led him to Hollywood to write the two Robocop sequels.  But he soon learned that being a screenwriter is the worst job to have in Tinsletown.  His scripts were cut up and flipped around so badly that he lost all hop of ever doing movies again.  So Miller returned to comic book land and decided to draw what he wanted to draw.  Taking his love of Dashiel Hammet, Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane novels, Miller created Sin City.  There would be tough guys, sexy women and classic cars.  The books are like a Spillane novel on steroids...as hard-boiled as you can get.  Filled with constant violence, nudity and hard dialogue.   <br />Robert Rodriguez first became famous for making El Miriachi in 1991 for no budget and really shot into superstardom with his follow up, \\"Desperado\\".  After a few other films that included \\"Four Rooms\\", \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\", \\"Roadracers\\", \\"Once Upon A Time In Mexico\\" and the 3 \\"Spy Kids\\" movies, Rodriguez started to persue a work of passion.  A massive fan of Sin City, Rodriguez literally stalked and hunted Frank Miller and begged him for the rights to make the movie.  Miller had been so disillusioned from his past experiences in Hollywood that there was no way he was giving up his baby unless he could direct it.  Rodriguez went out and got Josh Hartnett and another up and coming actor to film a test to show Miller what kind of film he was going to be making out of Sin City.  He filmed the three page short story \\"THe Customer is Always Right\\" which is the opening of the released film.  Miller loved it, and agreed to let Rodriguez direct the film but only if he could co-direct it.  Rodriguez agreed to this, but he was kicked out of the Directors Guild for doing so.   <br />Rodriguez decided to translate three of Miller's graphic novels to the film to give the world a good idea of what Sin City was.  The first story is \\"The Hard Goodbye\\".  The story revolves around a modern day barbarian of a loser named Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is seduced by a beautiful hooker named Goldie (Jamie King) to protect her from an unknown serial killer (Elijiah Wood) who has killed five of her friends.  After a night of amazing sex, Marv wakes up next to Goldie who is dead.  He's been framed, and he will go on a violent path of vengeance to find the people responsible for killing the only woman who was ever nice to him.  The second story is \\"The Big Fat Kill\\".  The story follows Dwight(Clive Owen), a man who is wanted for killing his wife.  While sleeping with his current girlfriend Shelley (Brittany Murphy), they are interupted by her ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benecio Del Toro) who is banging on the door with four of his drunk buddies.  Dwight wants to take them all down but Shellie pleads with him that it would be trouble.  Jackie Boy and his friends leave for Old Town, a section of Sin City where the hookers and the police have a truce.  The cops stay out, and the girls get to enforce their own laws and punishment. Fearing Jackie and the boys might hurt someone or maybe even kill someone, Dwight follows them into Old Town to warn his old flame Gail (Rosario Dawson) of their drunken states...only to find the girls are already waiting for them to make a mistake.  A mistake that will threaten the way things go down in Sin City and especially Old Town. <br />The third story is \\"That Yellow Bastard\\".  John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is one of the best cops on the Sin City force but due to his angina he is forced into early retirment...but there's one case he isn't walking away from.  A child rapist/murderer (Nick Stahl) has kidnapped an 11 year old girl named Nancy and Hartigan is going to take this scum out even if it kills him.   <br />But the killer is the son of a power Senator (Powers Boothe) and the corrupt cops are protecting him...including Hartigan's own partner Bob (Michael Madsen).  Nothing will stop Hartigan from saving the little girl, even multiple gun wounds.  After blowing the killer's hand and genetalia away, Hartigan is gunned down by Bob but saves Nancy.  He is blamed for the kidnapping of Nancy and the murders of the other girls and is sent to prison for 8 years.  The little girl he saved, Nancy, sends him letters every week...but two weeks go by without any letters and when he finally gets one, there's a severed finger inside.  Fearing they may have gotten to her, Hartigan gives in and confesses to the murders to get a release so that he can save the now nineteen year old Nancy (Jessica ALba) from the mysterious Yellow Bastard that keeps following him.   <br />The movie is the most accurate and loyal adaptation of a comic book ever made.  It is literally word for word, shot for shot, Miller's graphic novels.  Filmed on green screens, the backgrounds were all animated giving the film a magical look, almost as if we are not in a real world.  The technique we first saw in \\"Sky Captain and the World Of Tomorrow\\".  At one point, I felt like I was watching the opening of The Wizard Of Oz during the tornado.  The cast is almost too perfect for the roles they play.  Mickey Rourke gives the best performance of his career.  Bruce Willis is more than perfect for the role of Hartigan, and Elijiah Wood delivers a frightening performance as Kevin the cannibalistic serial killer.   <br />Look for the scene directed by Quentin Tarantino between Benecio Del Toro and Clive Owen.  Rodriguez and Tarantino first met on the film festival circuit in 91 while they were showing their first films El Miriachi and Reservoir Dogs.  The two became good friends and even collaborated on two films, From Dusk Till Dawn and Foor Rooms.  Tarantino directing a scene for Sin City started back on Kill Bill Vol. 2 when Rodriguez agreed to score the film for $1.  In return, Tarantino directed a scene for Sin City for $1.   <br />Sin City is a film that really breaks new ground.  It is just as beautiful as it is ugly.  The violence is constant and brutal at times but easy to handle due to the comic bookish technique used by the director.  The nudity from the books was toned down.  There's really only one word to describe Sin City, \\"COOL.\\"  It's probably one of the coolest films since Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  Like Pulp Fiction, some people have been confused by the films order.  You have to remember that these storylines sometimes take place at different times, so it won't be strange to see characters from other stories make an appearance in another story, even if they're dead...kinda like John Travolta in Pulp coming back at the end of the film.  Lord knows how many times I had to explain to people that the end of the film happens before Travolta is killed by Butch.  I've gone on long enough...Sin City is a tribute to the work of Frank Miller and in my opinion it's taken too damn long.  Frank Miller is one of the best comic book writers of all time and Sin City is as hard and as tough as they come.  It was worth the 13 year wait!

B003YL4LYI|5|Martin is the story teller extraordinaire. He consistently undercuts the literary narrative we always expect. You can never guess what will happen.
B00009AOBI|5|Got it quickly, thanks! Great movie!
0767817729|5|This is a great movie but not for everyone. The actors are superb but it is a bit violent  and sad at the end.
B00I6JODV4|5|This movie was great... It really brings the whole sum of the whole experience together with the original 300.....Remember....This is SPARTA!
0385344430|2|Please refer to other reviews for a summary of the plot.  The book starts strong, largely in full propulsion from the ending of Echo in the Bone.  Waiting 5 years it was easy to fall into the story of what happened next.  The beginning of this book is unusually tight and edited well (perhaps better than any of the other books in this series).  James Frasier is one of the great characters in all of fiction and Clair carries that joy that is infectious.<br /><br />The second half of this book falls of the cliff. There is no plot, irrelevant and unimportant characters, page after page wasted on useless details (mind you I know how Gabaldon writes).  I was fully prepared for the normal long descriptions found in outlander books. This book became a tedious slog.  This book would never get published.  There are a plethora of ridiculous and unnecessary sex scenes that were not that believable.  It is like a bad 80s movie that would break into a long sex scene that had nothing to do with the movie. Additionally, there are numerous coincidences that are just completely unbelievable, actions by characters that make no sense.<br /><br />By the end of this book I was just over it. Long chapters on surgeries that have no impact on the story and are completely irrelevant.  Who cares about most of these characters?  I do not care about these new characters.  We need a reason to read about these characters, give me something.  I really do not care about William, Lord John, Hal or Ben.  There is nothing about their stories that is even slightly appealing.  Do I need to read more about characters who I do not care about?  The biggest problem of all is that it is clear after this book, there will be no end.  Do not expect a final book in this series.  I have committed far too long in reading all these books.  But this is it, I am done.  I will not read the next book.  Oh I hear that little voice telling me I have no choice because I have already read 8000 pages of this god forsaken series.  This book will be my conclusion.

B00B9HEAVS|5|This is a great cd. It's too bad most of the U.S. doesn't know about Inna.  I have been a fan since her debut.  I recommend all of her albums.  I think all three of them are amazing!<br /><br />Party Never Ends is amazing and I love her lyrics along with her amazing beats.  I'm not sure how anyone could stand still listening to her.  I have a wide variety of music that I listen to and she is one of my favorite singers.<br /><br />Party Never Ends Tour USA!!

B000002UJQ|5|An awesome album and a must have for any radiohead fan. Requires more than 3 listens to be fully appreciated, but after that it will fill you with awe. It holds your attention from the marvellous opener \\"airbag\\" to the joyous ride of the \\"tourist\\" You must own this album. This is one of my favourite albums of all time and with good reason, it is truly the greatest album of all time.

B009G78EE2|4|I loved the whole album. i had never heard of him or his music before. A week ago i heard his song thrift shop on the radio and looked him up.
B001A5IYRA|5|I just reviewed Episode 1, Season 1 of the series and my thoughts on this episode are the same.  I'm thinking of purchasing Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD.
B002G1K82Q|5|It is a great Christmas gift for my Beatles music fan brother, who collects everything and anything that honors these fantastic musicians. Besides, the lyrics make sense in a well written story.
B002KT3XH6|3|The writings had way too many people to follow,especially when their names changed to their titles.  I did spend a lot of time referring to a dictionary,but the story or history kept me going,finishing it.  Being a amateur genealogist, the history fascinated me the most .
B00005U11Z|5|I was at this concert live and I got to go to the Meet and Greet. They were funny and a great bunch of guys. Steve Augeri was amazing and his voice was unbelievable.  Deen Castronovo has a great voice and really attacks the drums. And what can be said about Jonathan, Neal and Ross...awesome.  I had to order this dvd because my signed one finally wore out.
B00F87ZUYG|5|Every episode has something interesting and leaves you wanting more! Some episodes are more jaw dropping than others but all of them have a purpose to the story line. Absolutely love Daryl! If there is ever a zombie apocalypse I want him in my camp!!!!
B006RXPYXM|5|I absolutely loved this movie. It gave me a rare glimpse into the life of the current Queen of England. It would be great if I could meet her in person. She does have a hard exterior and it is portrayed in the movie but I also wonder if her hardness has anything to do with how she was brought up. Without giving too much away, the movie was great!
B004ZN9RWK|5|This, and Wish You Were Here, have given me countless hours of happiness over the past 40 years and only now have I bought the music. Interesting that everything gelled so well in the early 70s and probably never touched that point again. It would seem that this is something I can never tire of.
0374275637|5|Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Daniel Kahneman tells us that we use intuition all the time--and often well--to make daily decisions. But sometimes, even at important times, we use intuition and make very bad and harmful decisions. Getting up in age these days, Kahneman appears to have written this opus magnum as a great compilation of his research and that of his much admired academic partner, Amos Teversky (now deceased).  A leader in psychology and specifically decision making and behavioral economics, Kahneman explores two systems of how we think. System 1 is the quick-to-judge, emotional, and intuitive thinking system we all seem to possess and use often. System 2 is the slower, more deliberate and logical kind of thinking we also all possess. Kahneman profiles the amazingly fast and omnipresent power and influence of intuitive thinking...both its profound contribution to daily life and its hidden traps when making big decisions too quickly--fueled by the biases of System 1 thinking. He shows how anchoring, loss aversion, and various cognitive biases can powerfully affect our decision making at home, at work and in the marketplace. At the same time, he introduces us to the slower, more logical, and more deliberate partner, System 2, and how it can be used to moderate, even mitigate, the flaws in the fast-thinking System 1. In essence, he helps us understand when and where to use each of these systems to maximize our outcomes. His bottom line advice: When we make important decisions, we need to slow down.<br /><br />Reviewed in depth over the next two weeks on Survival Leadership Blog.
B00004RD54|5|I never had the album \\"back in the day\\", but I've heard most of the songs at one time or another.  I thought the sound was very good.  This is an excellent album and gives a good snapshot of Lou Reed back in his prime.
B000002UAR|5|1966 was a watershed year for pop music. A tremendous sense of invention and inspiration was in the air, and a number of brilliant records, such as the Stones' Aftermath, Dylan's Blonde on Blonde and the Kinks' Something Else showcased major artists at or very near their creative peaks. But the best of the best was certainly Revolver, the Beatles' most diverse and consistent record. This isn't even debatable; it's a fact.  Their unparalleled melodicism and originality reached full flower with songs like For No One; She Said, She Said; Eleanor Rigby; and the psychedelic masterpiece Tomorrow Never Knows, which was unlike anything anyone had heard up to that time.
B00012BD0S|5|From a purely musical standpoint this album was and remains monumental - a testament to the creativity, power and passion of these 5 talented musicians. Listening to this again more than 15 years after I first fell in love with this band I still find these songs incredibly uplifting and powerful. While the progressive and lengthy nature of the songs definitely tipped (at the time) the sound in the direction of Dream Theater, these guys brandished a non-commercial, more classic pure power metal crunch that was second to none. Yet they also weaved this incredible operatic and classical fabric into the songs. In fact, to this day, I still quote this album as one of the best mixes of progressive and classical metal ever produced. And in addition to the new musical direction, Russ Allen hit his stride in this his first fully collaborative work with the band. His performance here is just superb, offering a nice mixture of intense/urgent and melodic styles. Musically, Romeo just shreds and the interplay between he and keyboardist Pinella would become a signature style for this band going forward. Despite the lengthy nature of many of the songs, the continuity during solo and breakout sections is maintained in a fashion that never grows dull. Rounded out by the punishing bass work of Lepond and Jason Rullo's dynamic drumming (the perfect blend of progressive and power metal drumming)this album captured a lot of attention, rightfully so. Some have criticized these songs as not being heavy (in comparison to say Iconoclast or Paradise Lost) but while there are more melodious, open and softer contrasts here, these songs are heavy metal. Just listen to any of the crushing riffs in &#34;Of Sins and Shadows,&#34; &#34;Sea of Lies,&#34; &#34;The Witching Hour&#34; or one of my favorites, &#34;Pharaoh.&#34;<br /><br />While all of the songs here are riveting, 3 songs stand out this many years later (as did they back in the late 90's): the power ballad &#34;The Accolade&#34; remains a fan favorite - a song which not only showcases the bands' diversity but also their penchant for writing a lyric and melody that is quite infectious. And then the tandem of the epic 20 minute title track - replete with choral arrangements and a sweeping tale of epic woe and as much instrumental prowess anyone would covet from a progressive band - followed by the surprisingly beautiful &#34;Candlelight Fantasia&#34; remains a perfect finish to one of the greatest progressive metal recordings ever. With Divine Wings of Tragedy Symphony X set the highest standard musically in this genre and it is no surprise that this has become a classic in the progressive power metal genre.rite - a song which not only showcases the bands' diversity but also their penchant for writing a lyric and melody that is quite infectious.

B004DLPXAO|3|Purchased to replace the Kindle machine I broke, and works pretty well. No magazines or newspapers, which I miss dearly.
B005NACYQU|2|By the moment that something finally happens... I was already bored to death, and really didn't care at all. The impact from the final revelation gets diluted by 400 pages of aimless drifting.  The resolution of the conflict that was expected to be epic, gets resolved by TALKING without any oposition or confrontation from the villains, neither do we get to see their aftermath after they have lost. No payoff, at least not one worthy of so many hours of your life. The concept was interesting, but the execution was done very poorly.<br /><br />I only give an extra star because I think Gaiman has a great way with words, but in terms of story and character creation he falls very short, and is therefore, inconsequential.<br /><br />Why HBO, Starz and Brian Fuller has been interested so badly in making this happen for TV (HBO wanted to make SIX seasons!) is beyond my comprehension.
0385539703|5|In this taut, meticulously assembled novel, there is a guaranteed central theme of our fragility and an absence of triumph if we disrupt the truths of someone else. We meet Fiona Maye on the first page; she is a British High Court Judge in the Family Division.  At fifty-nine years old, she has worked hard to attain her stature and her decisions are painstakingly analyzed; she reviews her prose countless times before presenting final decisions.  She is fully aware she is changing lives, hopefully resolving violent or prosaic problems with her artful talent.<br /><br />She is childless, never seemed to fit in the time to start a family although she is married to Jack for 35 years.  Ironically, Fiona is blindsided at the onset of the novel when Jack tells her that he wants a passionate affair before he \\"drops dead\\" and yet wants to stay married to Fiona.  Enraged, Fiona tells him to she would never accept the situation.  Her anger is immediate and yet she tries to compose herself to meet the next few days in Court with her usual precision and deference to the law.<br /><br />Fiona goes about the business at hand.  Her emotions run the gamut from anger to heart breaking.  She checks her e-mail looking for some communication from Jack but immediately changes the locks on their home.<br /><br />She must concentrate and act as if nothing is wrong.  She is a composed, thoughtful intellectual who commands respect and appreciates the beauty of England's environment.  She is scheduled to make a decision on life or death for Adam Henry, who is just shy of 18 years old.  He is in the late stage of leukemia, needing blood transfusions as advised by the doctors.  He and his parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and religious principles forbid transfusions.  The hospital has petitioned to the Court to save the child.  Fiona must decide.  The Court scene is fascinating as Fiona, aka My Lady, hears the doctors, lawyers, barrister and the boy's parents.  She is unsure and decides to visit Adam as he lay dying.  She finds a brilliant young man with strong beliefs and is impressed with his continued interest in learning the arts; Fiona becomes the audience to his poetry and a short violin performance for her alone. Adam and the Judge seem to be intoxicated with each other.<br /><br />She makes her decision regarding the case, and then McEwan provides us with unique letters and scenes to learn the aftermath of that decision.  The novel is enthralling.  McEwan becomes a master at legalese and takes us through some of her other decisions and thought processes.  We are subject to the passions and ethics of the distinguished judge.  Every sentence was crafted with purpose of sharp divisions between the emotional fate of a child and righteous judgment. This book reminds me of English classes when the Professor would analyze every sentence, providing us with an author's possible intent or technique.

0385513755|5|The Da Vinci Code is a stunningly captivating and astoundingly well written novel. Robert Langdon, Sophie Nevue, Leigh Teabing, and the multitude of other characters appear to be truly existent and not simply wavering apparitions. As the journey unfolds, the pages of your book seem no longer like pages, but corridors, the letters become the figures moving around you. The theories, so carefully constructed, become reality. This epic tale will immerse your every being in, and encompass you in a sense of realism I have yet to find in any book, article, short story, or any piece of literature I have read thus far.<br /><br />  Robert Langdon, an American symbologyst is attending a conference in France. Little does he know that what is about to happen will change his life; his very soul forever. A man named Jacques Sauniere invites him to dinner. Jacques Sauniere is the curator of the world renowned Lovoure art museum. Sauniere never shows up to dinner. Langdon soon finds out that Sauniere has been the victim of a grisly murder. Stripped naked, spread across the floor on his back with a bloody pentacle traced on his chest. Captain Bezu Fache heads the investigation to find Sauniere's murderer. His unknowing suspect is Langdon. Through a mist of clues and double meanings, Langdon flees with his counter part Sophie Nevue. They race not only to save themselves, but to reveal to the world several truths which would incinerate the Christian churches over night, but would liberate the souls of innocents killed. They must also fear and elude the servants of the church. The members of Opus Dei, a radical antidisestablishmentarianistically motivated group will stop at nothing to prevent the truth from coming out. History is not what it is perceived to be and the future is even less certain. With forces closing in like walls from all sides, this race for truth is truly a race against time, which will lead to a final plot twist so immense and unanticipatable, it will leave you dumbfounded and possibly confused. A truth will be revealed that could never have been thought possible before.<br /><br />  The realism presented alongside the theories in this book combines to form a series of new ideas that bend the passages of what we know. Whether or not these theories are true is irrelevant. The realism, accuracy, and tedious attention to detail that has been applied to this book is unmatched by anything I have yet read. This book was a very quick read, not because of a low page number or low difficulty level, but because of the difficulty I found in putting it down. As pages become corridors, and letters become figures, and as you become enveloped in the story; it becomes real. Slowly the mist subsides, the letters are letters and the pages are pages. You wish you can go back to when the book was unread, but you know you can not. By remembering the books theories however, you may walk those corridors once more.umbfounded and possibly confused.

B000002H33|5|If you don't know that is a piece of metallica's opening track Battery. This is Metallica at there best. If your a metal fan than you'll love this album. You will definetly need to put this album in your cd collection. If your becoming a metallica fan than you'll love the headbanging, hard thrash metal, that Metallica once was. It's one of metallica's best work and they kept outdoing themselves back in the day. Now a days it just dosn't seem like it anymore for Metallica.But the songs I recommend are of course battery and Master of puppets, but other good heavy tracks like Welcome home(Sanitarium), and Leper Messiah. Good album and true metal right here.
B00821OX98|4|Chose to watch this show on a whim.  At first I felt the setting, characters, and story were a little too boring.  I chose to keep watching throughout the season and ended up enjoying this show immensely.  The effects aren't the best out there, but that doesn't matter too much.  Watch this show for a few episodes and the characters grow on you (at least they did for me).  Definitely recommended for the sci-fi people out there.
B00AS1Q8FW|5|I had low expectations going into this. Reviews were very mixed and even before it was released people were hating on the casting of Tom Cruise in the lead role. I was surprised to find that this was quite an enjoyable action thriller. Tom Cruise was fantastic in the role and really delivered on the action scenes. Solid performances all around and a interesting mystery. Easily worth a rent and I will definitely be purchasing the blu ray in the future.
B007ZXK08C|5|Luckily it was a weekend when I started reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, because after a few chapters I could not just put it down - all of Sunday went by in Gone Girl's world.<br />This is a great crime fiction, though a very original take on the genre.  So many sudden and unexpected changes, the characters well drawn, and increasingly less likeable as you get to know them - sorting their opinions of themselves from reality was one of the challenges and delights of this book.<br />You will find no spoilers in this review ... just a recommendation for a great read!

B00BVYNSLC|3|Tatiana is amazing, but she's wasted in this ridiculous story. But I'll probably watch a second season if it happens

B00DJWV11I|4|Good, witty, fun read.
B00110K62U|4|What wonderful music.  A heartbreaking story.  I saw this in the theatre twice. I own the drama DVD and now the DVD & the CD of the music.  I just love it and hope that you enjoy it as well.
B00QLVY7J2|3|The only thing that's missing is a logout tab so It doesn't remain logged in if that's not fixed the app remains on in the back ground including the GameCircle as well so everyone who plays has to force close the app n GameCircle plz fix that -- gameplay is fantastic
B00ETADXY2|4|At first I thought it would be just easy, but two times playing were enough for me to get addicted!
B00L7PJE4A|1|The first time I dled this app it went to a black screen and stayed that way until I deleted the app. I dled it again and it won't connect to anything. It won't even find anything. I deleted it again and dled it again just to make sure. Still nothing. If I could give this app less than 1 star I would.
B005Z271Y6|5|This woman has the most powerful voice and I never get tired of listening to her sing.  Even play it in my car.
0380820846|3|I've read a few of Julia Quinn's books and they're pretty good. This one was OK. A decent read. I did skip parts trying to get to the sections where the hero/heroine would interact. The romance was just lukewarm. I did enjoy the ONE love scene though. There just seems to be something missing from certain books that would take it from being just good, to great. This book seemed to be more focused on the secondary story of unmasking Whistledown than to the budding relationship of Penelope and Colin.
B0072V394E|2|Maybe when it was filmed was a hit, but now it's dated. The dialogues are ridiculous, it can be fun because it's so bad. It's dubbed in English, and very poorly. Whi not leaving the subtitles?
1439152810|4|First off, I confess I have not read anything else by Morton. As an author, though, I leap to the one-star ratings, an evil habit. I do not agree that the book was poorly written, nor that it was padded. Sure, it wasn't up to the economy of a Hemingway or Steinbeck, but what is?<br />The storyline kept me reading. For me that's a huge plus. The point of view slipped easily between Dorothy and her daughter and Jimmy. The others characters were not as developed, but they were certainly not cardboard. I can still hear Jimmy's dad interacting with his bird and the old lady crabbing about her toenails.<br />Yes, there were misleading plotlines, as in Vivien not being able to have children, in her own words, but if \\"I can't\\" meant \\"I dare not\\" because of my situation.......such an ambiguity is permitted. The complexity about \\"who got the money\\" is one of the reasons I went four star.<br /><br />No one is pickier than another author. I give this one two-thumbs up.
B000H305U0|5|This is one of the best cds I have ever bought. Justin's work is amazing.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This game is hard but it's good for your brain to think it's like a brain work out I like it so I can be smarter I encourage you guys that are reading this to download this app right now
B00PTB7B34|5|Better than the XBoX version.
B00E5I2ME0|5|The package arrived in great shape and ran without problems. And we loved the movie!
B001HN6922|1|This is not a kids movie - the violence was overwhelming (for an animated pixar movie) & I really felt it was just used to cover poor writing.  They pulled guns at every chance, there was even a beat down in a bar.  This was a James Bond PG-13 movie - not a G rated Disney flick...
B00003CXXP|1|I hadn't rented a DVD in over a year, and unfortunately chose this one.  Technically flawless, but a perfect example of a Hollywood director/writer coming up with what seems like a promising idea, and then not knowing what to do with it.  A wandering, meandering mess.  I think the saddest part of the whole thing is those who will rave about it just because it's Spielberg, without looking at it objectively to see how awful it really is.
B00ATPVA78|4|_I loved the storyline and the beautiful graphics. I do however feel that this game should not be 4.99.  The game was very short. I would have loved for the game to be a little longer.
B0006SSOHC|4|I got this to watch with my girlfriend to combat her chick-flicks. One of my favorite horror movies. Saw 2 is ok. Don't bother from 3 to the end.
B000006NPY|4|I've never owned the album proper, but I have listened to parts of it quite a bit and I can say without a doubt that this is their neglected masterpiece.  Worlds better than their end-career peter-out MACHINA, possibly more cohesive than Mellon Collie, this is a spectacularly low-key work in the spirit of other such releases at the time, such as REM's \\"Up\\" and even Radiohead's \\"OK Computer,\\" if just for the more subtle, muted approach.<br />Guitar solos are very few and even farther between.  The only recognizably guitar-based tracks (mostly from my memory) are \\"Ava Adore,\\" \\"Perfect,\\" \\"Tear,\\" and \\"For Martha.\\"  The Pumpkins, however, prove they are masters of their game no matter what instruments they filter their sound through.  Proof of this is evident from he first track, \\"To Sheila,\\" probably the gentlest of acoustic numbers Corgan and Co. have ever penned, with lulling, breathy harmonies in the chorus and distant beats as if they were sounding across a vast barren desert.  \\"Ava Adore\\" serves as the resident rocker, although a high-charged, almost trip-hoppy one.  Though the lyrics leave much to be desired, it does give the album some nice contrast.  Same with \\"Perfect\\" and \\"Tear,\\" the former being a \\"1979\\"-style acoustic number, the latter being a vacuous ode-to-Corgan-angst tale of lost love and death.  From my memory, \\"Daphne Descends\\" does a good job of mining the same acoustic/electronic vein as \\"Perfect.\\"  <br />From there, however, the record becomes absolutely stunning.  \\"For Martha\\" is an impassioned epic with great guitar work from Corgan, and \\"Blank Page's\\" moroseness is pretty affecting, as well.  Overall, a solid effort, and despite the band's forays into silliness, this album is yet another reason to remember them by.  Great.
B007ZGO7EM|4|Simple, straightforward, a solid digital calculator that functions both for simple math &amp; simple amortization. My teenager &amp; I both find it useful.
B00GMA414S|5|Made grandsons birthday awesome. He had it together before he went home, now to learn to tell time!
B005HSL626|3|My girls love Fruit ninja but the ads that display are not appropriate for children. For example they are advertising Showtime shows. I paid for the pay version to remove ads since I can't control the ads in the free version. Overall the game is great .
B009UX2YAC|5|Grand kids love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this game and I am so glad I found it!!  So many others have glitches or freeze but this is by far the best. Thank you
B009IU6BIS|5|This movie is definitely just as hilarious the second and third time as it was the first time we watch it.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Fantastic book. Full of suspense and nerd talk. I can't wait to see the movie and hopefully it will do the book justice.
B00881VLCE|5|I love jigsaw puzzles and I can choose the difficulty level.
B00B0LPYXG|4|You've heard and read all about this movie already.It's a really good movie, maybe even the best of the year. However the 2 issues I had with this movie are sex and justice.<br /><br />It seems it  still would have been to much for audiences to see Denzel get sexual with his white counterpart (see: Cheerios commercial with mixed kid/family outrage). Completely unrealistic, two addicts trying to cope-they're gonna have sex...period.  America is so damn square. I GUESS it's is implied they have sex, but then again, it is also implied that they didn't.<br /><br />Now justice; didn't like the ending, glib and overly-moralistic. Had it been Bruce Willis or Brad Pitt or the like playing that character, he wouldn't be going to jail. Go ahead, name a movie where the like-a flawed anti-hero and voluntarily goes to jail...I'll wait, cause even if you do succeed its going to take some time to name a movie or two..... Ok, back on point, Going to jail doesn't really help him or his family. His family (son) would face shame for having the drunk-drugged out dad who killed all those people...and most importantly: NO ONE wants to go to jail. Especially someone who almost died. People don't choose to go to jail (unless it's a  mob deal-thing), even to save the reputation of a dead loved one... People don't choose to go to jail. Also, how can he be so damn cool in a harrowing landing but fall apart with some easy questions, that doesnt really happen...Hollywood...I would have like to seen an alternate ending or two. That would have done the story justice.<br /><br />Because of the acting, directing and overall production and entertainment value of this movie (even if you only watch it once or twice), it is a 4 star movie.
B00EMXBDMA|5|I will admit the only reason I started reading this book was I saw it was going to be a movie starring Matt Damon - but I'm so glad I did. I loved this book. The science was fascinating and the Mars missions seemed very plausible. Now I'm almost afraid to see the movie because I'm sure it won't be half as good as the book (with apologies to Matt Damon). Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised.
B002BI6SMI|5|The best movie from Liam Neeson yet! A great chase to lead into trouble! Liam Neeson in Taken! A great flick to see if your into the Bourne movies! I highly would recommend watching it! Loved it so much that I watched it again and even the 2nd one was great as well! Liam is getting into acting like never before! You won't be sorry if you see this flick! A+
B005K17RU0|5|A great app. I use it everyday. easy to use. Launches quickly. For the price it cant be beat! This app is an asset to my Kindle.
B0001BDAQO|5|Loved it
B006MW3UZW|5|I feel the romance of the downton abbeyl the series makes me feel as if I would have liked to live in that time. It wouldn't have mattered if I were one of the rich or the or one of the help.

B0000DZ3IG|5|Wonderful movie especially around Christmas.
B000007VCM|4|&quot;She sells Sanctuary&quot; is simply THE best rock song ever made. The CD was not their best, but that one song is worth the price.
B00B89WXYS|4|I need to give it time, but I believe it is growing on me.....it's not a &#34;secrets&#34; CD as of yet, but has great potential!
B0054JZC6E|5|this game is the most awesome game ever!!!!!!!!!! I love this game but the only reason I am writing this is to get coins.
B00IXHBS6M|3|The CD came on time & packaged well, but I was not pleased with the remastering of the original Zep CD.  The rhythm guitar tracks were way in the front, and the bass guitar, which I love best, was way in the background!  I still remember how the original album sounded, and this wasn't the same.  I would much rather have a used un-remastered  CD, then the one I got.I am thinking of trading this new version for a used version of the same Led Zep CD.  I would recommend others doing the same thing.
B00AIUUXHC|5|BEST GAME OF THE HUNGRY SHARK SERIES AND I HAVE BEEN HAPPY PLAYING IT ALL THE WAY TO HUSTON LOL
B006OZKX02|3|I don't know why so many people are surprised it's a Euro version, when the symbol in the bottom left and right says it was rated 12 by the \\"bbfc\\" (The British Board of Film Classification) and the \\"IRISH FILM CLASSIFICATION OFFICE\\", respectively... I agree that the description should be updated, but I also think people should have looked at the fine print, in the picture, before purchasing...<br /><br />So why did I give it a 3-star review, when I didn't even purchase it? Because I wanted to keep the reviews as neutral as possible...
B00A6CCF0K|4|All the readers in my family read The Shining over the course of about a month. The book passed along the line.  I'll never forget my Mom reading it alone, at night at the kitchen table. The overhead light and her own reflection in our big window to the back yard.<br /><br />This was before the open layouts that were so popular. Our kitchen could be closed off from the table all the way over to the dining room at the opposite end. My brother and I who had both read the book, peaking around the door watching Mom. Engrossed.  Edge of the chair leaning into the book. She was asking for it.<br /><br />\\"BAaaaargh!\\" we screamed. Mom jumped like she'd been goosed with a car battery, screaming too and throwing the book in reflex. Totally worth it.<br /><br />In any event, the sequel has some meaning for me.  Can't say it scared me as much as the Shining did when I was twelve. I'm older or Mr. King is older --- one of those impacted the sequel. Still, Dan Torrance has that same heart and soul that made the first book so good. And the hope is there too. You'll like it.
B008JFUNKU|5|What a great movie!  My wife and I watched it and both of us loved it.  Very intense.  My only regret is that we didn't watch it sooner.  Highly recommend it.
0877180121|5|very informative, seems a little childish, but it's a very good book to start with.
0743201140|3|This may be one of those uncommon common-sense sorta things, but DO NOT buy a used version of the book, since the code in all probability would have been used/expired already. I was browsing a bookstore and bought a used version on a hunch(not having heard of it before), and when I got to the meat and potatoes, the plate was kinda snatched away. Decent read so far, but thought I'd put this warning out.
B0084B5TK8|5|Captivating from start to finish.  Highly recommended
B000P0J024|5|I bought this as a gift for a friend who was very pleased with the quality
B002A4Q652|5|Charlotte Wessels  has excellent vocals and she really gets into what she is singing. she gives the words life. she is not just singing them like they mean nothing. she gets into her lyrics and music and love listening to the story she bring forth from her singing.

B0000033TE|5|ELP possibly created their most grandiose, yet refined studio album (at least before they started to tread downhill relationship and/or creativity-wise). _Brain Salad Surgery_ is one crazed ride that seldom gives you time to catch your breath. It starts off with the patriotic and anthemic hymn \\"Jerusalem\\", then proceeds into the crazed Miles Davis-ish interpretation of Alberta Ginastera's \\"Toccata\\". This is an extremely challenging piece to follow, as the time and tempo changes are switching left and right. \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\" is arguably the only accessible moment on the disc. This Greg Lake ballad has some nice trippy wah-wah pedals. \\"Benny The Bouncer\\" continues in the tradition of ELP's humorous honky-tonk (i.e. Jeremy Bender, The Sherriff).<br />\\"Karn Evil 9\\" is the centerpiece of the album, clocking in at 30 minutes. It's based on the world being dominated by computers (which is not far from the truth today). The 1st Impression (Parts 1&2) is definitely the most energetic movement out of the three. It features Carl Palmer doing some complex drumming and Keith Emerson doing Hendrix-ish solos...on his keyboard. Greg Lake, while doing an excellent job on his vocals/bass, actually delivers some kick a$$ guitar solos. Trust me...this stuff rocks hard...yet the rhythm section is NOT based on heavy guitars. That's innovation for you! The 2nd Impression is a jazzy/classical instrumental, which is probably the most technical out of the movements, as it showcases Keith Emerson's dazzling keyboard skills. Greg Lake has some great bass playing on here. Carl Palmer is not ignored either, as his virtuoso drumming skills are displayed as well. The 3rd Impression is the most 'innovative'. It may seem like instrumental boredom to some, as Keith Emerson's swirling, mind-warping and metallic synths do most of the walking and talking here.<br />This remastered version contains the 3-D cover art, as well as extended photos, insightful liner notes that reveal the actual meaning of Brain Salad Surgery and more. Don't ignore the 13-minute interview at the end, as it sheds light on the band, this particular album, as well as hilarious insights on meeting the dark surrealist H.R. Giger, creator of the album art.ing of Brain Salad Surgery and more.

B00L9B7IKE|4|A great summer read...good story line that will keep you guessing; I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I felt like it dragged a little in the beginning.
B00T3DNKIE|5|Some professional reviewers had negative comments about this, so I began reading knowing I could be disappointed.  I guess they didn't really read the book. Very well written.
B004DI7HZ6|5|I've read this no fewer than three times and now own it in both Kindle and hardback. Eagerly awaiting the third book in the trilogy.
B004RUF9DC|5|I also saw this movie as a kid and seeing it in bluray has been mesmorizing.  The quality is amazing.
B006885LZM|5|Excellent show. Reminds me of &#34;Band of Brothers.&#34; War sceens are very realistic
B000XUBFE2|5|This was the best book I have read in quite some time.  I love the point of view it was written from
0767803434|2|Fairly entertaining but the President's prowess was a little over the top. What's even more ridiculous (and sickening) is that the Vice President is a WOMAN! What will those hollywood liberals think of next? <br />
B003OF3R0S|4|I got into A7X back in high school, and they were nice just to listen to whenever, and even better when you're working out. All their albums though I must say have been very decent with keeping consistent in their albums. Even though their drummer died, the new drummer they have (from Dream Theater I think), does a good job replacing a good percussionist sound.<br /><br />However, this consistency is the reason I gave it four stars. I guess the beginning album was a little different, due to the increased aggressiveness, but this album's mood and tone seems pretty similar to their couple albums before this such as their self-titled album and waking the fallen. I mean, I guess there was a little change you notice as they go on, but I just didn't see the change much, but if you are a metal head or A7X fan, check this album out. I'd say it's worth a listen
B00AK0X5VQ|3|Used as expected.
B0027MJU00|5|Love her writing and the grimness of the characters.
B008Y5N3O8|3|The movie is watchable, but it won't have you on the edge of your seat at any point.  It's about a bunch of unlikeable, self-pitying real estate salesmen, all desperate to make a sale over the span of an evening and the next morning.  They all treat everyone else except their colleagues as marks for their con, so none of the characters are anyone that most viewers would want to identify with (maybe if you're in sales and your boss is a tyrannical jerk, you'll sympathize whether you want to or not).  The closest things to interesting conflict in this movie are a contest that the boss (well played by Alec Baldwin) creates, whereby the best salesman wins a Cadillac, and the worst gets fired.  In desperation, one of the salesmen (well played by Ed Harris) plans to rob their office and steal their best sales leads.  The theft itself is mostly just a plot device by the story's writer, to raise stress for all the characters, by bringing in a police investigation.  Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, and Kevin Spacey all give fine performances, but there just is not a lot to work with, story-wise.
B003IVDPC8|4|&#34;Live at the Troubadour&#34;. Carole King & James Taylor together in a live performance at The Troubadour. Music you remember with a live audience.
B008X9Z3UC|3|Good price.  Well padded.  I really wanted this to be the perfect case, but I was disappointed to discover that there is no protection for the edge of the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" from the zipper.  When zipped, the zipper comes in direct contact with the device, there is no padding or protection around the inside where the zipper closes.  It is like they sacrificed padding for the tight, glove like fit.  Very disappointing since the purpose of a case is to protect the device from scratches and damage during transport.  How can I trust this case to protect my new best friend when I clumsily drop it? I can't, so I probably won't use it. Plus, there is no slip pocket or any room for any accessories.
0143057375|5|FINALLY! a book my wife and I can both enjoy. We've also been able to resolve a few of our other differences as well after reading this book.
B00GKKTZZU|5|I loved this book :) I'm so sad it's over already :( love this series and cannot wait for the next ❤️
B00C5R7B0I|5|Good easy reading.  I read this while sitting at sons football practice.  It kept my interest and unfortunately missed some key plays my son wanted me to see (oops)  usually I will read a little then watch practice but this one kept my interest way too long!
B00FAPF5U0|5|So I got this game not stopping playing it  I am never deleting it  love you mean it oh Jesus loves the world get a Bible app and look up John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not parish but have eternal life  Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no one goes thru the father except thru me
B00HXYKYIE|3|Didn't finish.  Well written.  Don't know why.
B002O2THVA|5|Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin and numerous other stars you'll recognize. All directed by John Ford. Excellent Western film.
B0063IH60K|5|Love Solitare. The best game and so much fun. I try to beat my time each time that I play.
B004JZBGWI|5|Ive tried a lot of these apps and this is the best one Ive found so far. Its easy to use and doesnt have ads. That is a big plus for me. I love the lock and share feature!
B00BEZTMQ8|5|Only one problem with the film, it ends too soon. Fast and colorful and action and everything thrown into the mix, to leave you wanting more and more. So get the dvds over the next three years and watch it one time to enjoy it fully. Great clean fun for the whole family.
B004WO57E4|4|I have always loved and played these games.  When I was a kid, I played I and II and only got the rest of them now.  I haven't played through all five yet, but the first three are pretty good!  I absolutely LOVE the first two.  The reason for the rating of only 4 stars is that they keep freezing and locking up my computer until I open a task manager and close the game.  This has happened with all three that I have played so far.  I have windows 7.  I assume it is because the games are for windows 95 and MS DOS that they continue to give me this problem.  Game play is as awesome as I remember it being!
B00L9B7IKE|4|Liked the multiple storytelling view points. The ending is a bit predictable but still satisfying. A great read!
B004SIIBGU|5|I love Ebay and I love this app; I can spend many hours per day on it; would download again.
B00EMKVDG4|5|great stuff
B004VYYA2K|5|The is really great for little Barbie lovers to play with and also it serves as a storage too! What a great combination for under $20!
B0094BB4TW|5|I love texting my friends and family!! An  starring what I love!! It's like I'm in another world ..... Haha
1579128149|5|While I am a nerdy person (I teach chemistry), I actually purchased this book at the request of my 11-year-old son. The book is simply gorgeous. Two pages are devoted to each element, and they include a description of some of the properties and common uses of the element, a full-page photograph, and several smaller photos of applications, minerals, or historical references for that element. The pages of the book are black, providing a nice backdrop for the stunning images. The text is interesting and presented at a level that should appeal to non-scientists (and there is a nice introduction to provide some background information as well). For the science nerds among us, each page also shows an emission spectrum, density, crystal structure, graphical representations of melting and boiling points, and other data for the element. Money well spent.
B00JB3MVCW|1|I never write reviews for movies but this was just terrible. I don't want anybody else to waste their money and time for this. There is absolutely nothing biblical about this movie other than the names of the characters and the fact that there was an arc. The plot was almost completely different and this made Noah sound like some idiotic psycho. Slow parts dominated the movie and was extremely boring most of the time. Why create a movie based on the bible and have it be something completely different? Even if this was not advertised to be a biblical story and all the characters had different names, it would still be a terrible movie. 90% of the movie was computer graphics and it was just so, so poorly made. I wish I hadn't bought this. I should have listened to all the other negative reviews. P.S. What's with the stone people? Seriously?
0790729628|1|As others here have said, why just the director's cut? Where is the original with the voice over? I like them both, but prefer the voice over version. Why hasn't the original with voice over come out on DVD? Why not put both versions on this one? For that reason alone this DVD gets 1 star. Which is sad, because this is definitely a 4 or 5 star movie.
B0051MKMNC|4|The way to think and believe there is something like that in the world would be outstanding but without the wrong things it has, if you wanna know, you must watch it
B00ISJSFUW|4|We enjoyed The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.  Amazing cinematography.  We watched it to see the beautiful countryside of Iceland because our friend is a professional photographer who travels there often.  The movie did not disappoint!
B004JZBGWI|5|I am very Pleased with my order and look forward to doing business with you again. Thank you very much.
B009XIXVU6|5|Better than his first novel.
B00AE5R2NO|5|He had been wanting this particular Octonauts but they were all sold out at the stores.  I jumped on line to Amazon, found it right away, placed my order and he was playing with it in no time.
B0000VCZKW|2|Is this really a movie for children?  I don't know. <br /> <br />The school principal throws a boy out the window and it's a comedy.  Pretty scary for kids who suffer abuse. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the movie the kids pelt the principal with paint and other school supplies to drive her away.  True, she's an ogre, but whatever happened to non-violent ways of getting rid of nasty folks?   <br /> <br />Then the lead girl asks her parents to give her up for adoption, which they do with nary a hesitation.  Yikes-a-doodle. <br /> <br />As with most Hollywood flicks, this one is short on character development, semi-long on plot, and super long on technical gizmos.  It appears to be \\"liberal\\" but with such small-mindedness it's not very open at all.  And the main characters are exclusively white, while Black kids sit in the back of the bus. <br /> <br />Choose \\"The Story of the Weeping Camel\\" instead.
1423140605|5|I'm 9 years old and just now finished reading it. It is a book full of adventure and humor. The humorous part is in the beginning when Leo has to beat Narcissus in a fight to get a piece of celestial bronze for repairs. Hazel is there to get the piece of bronze with her Pluto powers while Leo distracts him. they travel around the world to beat the giants. it gives lots of info because Rick Riordan is a great writer to start with. Read the book to see how the gang survives...
B00CHIMG6Y|4|This movie delivered! It was very sad, but ran you through the gambit of emotions from happiness, horror, devastation and hope!
B000OQF6N6|2|I used to call The Smashing Pumpkins my favorite band.  Siamese Dream is still one of my Top 5 albums ever. The key word here is USED to.  Ever since Billy Corgan declared that Alternative and Grunge were dead, and released the pathetic album Adore, the Pumpkins have fallen off my radar. Machina was a decently decent album at best. This does not mean I am not a die hard fan, because I will not love everything that Corgan puts out, and the same is true here.<br /><br />I was immediately hesitant to hear this album as soon as I heard the Pumpkins were \\"back\\", and for good reason.  Corgan has lost his touch and it shows.  The astoundingly anal-retentive Corgan from the past has laid a rotten egg here.  The production quality on this album is awful.  The vocals are too loud, the gutars muddy, and the brilliant drumming of Jimmy Chamberlain sounds tinny.  And this is not even mentioning the laughably bad lyrics (see: the chorus of \\"Starz\\").  Billy had never been political, and I don't know why he tries here.<br /><br />That being said, there is some decent material here...\\"Doomsday Clock\\" and \\"Tarantula\\" both have hints of the brilliance that made Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie masterpieces.  United States has a bit of a \\"Silverf**k\\" feel to it.  But the moments of inspiration are few and far between usually fading back into some pretentious nonsense about Billy's looming midlife crisis.<br /><br />Sorry Billy, but you should have stayed in retirement.  Being from Chicago you should have learned from Michael Jordan when he retired.  The second time.
B006LSZECO|4|Crazy!  Great story line; told by him and her.  Throughout the entire book there were a number of times I was completely surprised at the turn of events.<br />Extremely strong language, so be prepared if that is offensive to you.
B00CWY76CC|4|Enjoyed this game. For a free app it was a fun game to pass the time. Gets your brain to think. Looking forward to some new levels.

6303824382|5|I have followed the life and times of John McClane from the beggining, and have always loved Bruce Willis' abilities to make this character come to life and seem so real.  For this reason I wasn't happy to find that he and hife &quot;wife&quot; had divorced sometime between the last movie and this one, but that aspect alone makes the ending of this film worth waiting for.  I also liked the very original escape scene in the film as McClane runs for his life through water filled tunnels.  This is one film you shouldn't miss.
B000056H24|5|The Greatest Story Ever Told is a huge epic movie that boasts an impressive cast full of Hollywood notables.  The movie follows the life of Jesus from his birth in a stable in Bethlehem to his teachings with his disciples all the way to his crucifixion and Resurrection.  Because the film is so huge, many parts of the life of Jesus are just skipped over and talked about later by characters who saw it happen or heard about it.  This is surprisingly effective to show how quickly Jesus' notoriety spread throughout the area.  There are several very good scenes done with no sound except for Alfred Newman's fantastic score even though we know people in the background are screaming at Jesus as he walks by carrying the cross.  One particularly effective scene involves Simon of Cyrene, played by Simon Poitier, helping Jesus carry the cross after he has fallen.  As Jesus gets up, he grabs onto Simon's arm who helps him go on.  It is a very short scene, but nonetheless very moving.<br />  The cast for this movie could go on for pages.  Max von Sydow gives an excellent performance as Jesus Christ, although he might not look like the usually accepted idea of Jesus.  Charlton Heston and Telly Savalas also give very good performances as John the Baptist and Pontius Pilate.  The film also stars David McCallum as Judas, Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas, Dorothy McGuire as Mary, Martin Landau as Ciaphias, Donald Pleasence as Satan(although he is credited as the Dark Hermit), and many others.  The film also stars Michael Anderson JR, Roddy McDowall, Victor Buono, Ed Wynn, Sal Mineo, Ina Balin, Carroll Baker, Van Heflin, Jamie Farr, and so many more.  There are several very small cameos most notably John Wayne, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier, and Claude Rains all of which are pretty good for how small they are.  The Special Edition DVD offers the widescreen presentation, theatrical trailer, making of documentary, an altered scene during the crucifixion scene, still gallery, and a filmmaker's documentary.  For an excellent look at the life of Jesus, if somewhat sanitized, check out The Greatest Story Ever Told!

0671042858|5|This was recommended by a friend, who told me it was written as juvenile fiction.  It's true the heroine is a teenage girl, but it's a really great book for an adult reader too.  I loved it, held my interest.

6304696515|5|DANGEROUS LIAISONS is a fantastic character study of the twisted and obsessed.  The classic novel translates perfectly to the screen in this adaptation by Christopher Hampton which was taken from his acclaimed stage play.<br />Glenn Close is mesmerising as the seductive and manipulative woman who challenges the cruel Valmont (John Malkovich) to seduce her naive niece (Uma Thurman).  However, Valmont also wishes to seduce and disgrace a remote beauty (Michelle Pfeiffer), totally uncaring and unaware of the tragic outcome that will envelope them both.<br />The stellar cast also includes Keanu Reeves (THE MATRIX, PARENTHOOD), Swoosie Kurtz (LITTLE GIRLS IN PRETTY BOXES, REALITY BITES) and veteran Mildred Natwick (THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY).<br />The DVD transfer is gorgeous and has a dynamic 5.1 sound mix that shows off the beautifully dramatic score by George Fenton.<br />Remade as VALMONT (starring Colin Firth and Fairuza Balk) and CRUEL INTENTIONS (starring Ryan Phillippe).
B00125WAXC|4|I had seen the movie before but wanted to own it.  The plot is applicable to anyone that must overcome a situation dispite the fact that the deck is stacked against you.  A must see.
B00688628M|5|Amazing piece of work! Quite honestly it's very hard to watch, especially the episode &#34;Why We Fight&#34;.
B00D6QUJ6U|5|Very good concert. I enjoyed the show. Worth the money if you like the BeeGees
B0074D3CAQ|5|I loved this charming book.  The subject matter is unusual yet we can alI relate in some way to the main character who has autism.  What a delightful book, I was sorry when it ended.
B003K16PFU|3|I am visiting Spain so I wanted to understand recent Spanish history.  I chose to read Orwell's account of the Spanish Civil War since he was an actual participant.  This book answered many of the questions I had and provided more insights that helped to explain current Spanish politics.  Orwell is very candid in his conclusions and admits to the shortcomings of his book.  If you want to understand the Spanish Civil war, this book is helpful.

0307272702|2|Gary Taubes is a reporter, writing down other peoples thoughts and opinions.  We all should know about opinions.  I bought this book to discover the \\"secrets\\", only to be let down...  Tons of obscure facts about remote Indian tribes, and other peoples before being tainted by the white man's diet.  Worked for my grandfather and he was skinny.  I am still unsure just exactly how I got fat and even less sure as to what to do about it.  Invest your money for a visit to a really good steakhouse..........and hold the potatoes!

B00F87ZUYG|3|slow starting  and it seems like they're running out of idea's, they need to pick up the pace a little bit
B00G6YH6G0|2|The setting is New Zealand, but it could have taken place anywhere. I was disappointed that there was not more background info about the country during that time period. The story was really prolonged with back stories coming at the end.
B005DD7TI0|4|Very entertaining movie, pretty cool cinematography - definitely recommended.  It's definitely an interesting concept and I'm sure will be a recurring theme in many future films.
B00FAX6XQC|4|Update to my review 5/18<br />Glu has fixed the issue with the L1 switch and it now works properly!!! Took them a while but they got it. No thanks to their support ticket system. I got a reply telling me that they dont give game play hints and that all their products are played through to completion (obviously this was wrong). If I hadnt went to their forums and complained and got an admin to check with the devs, Who knows how long this would have taken to get fixed. There are still glitches with the hat getting stuck but so far, a single zoom in and out fixes it. Still problems with cursor disappearing or randomly stops functioning but hitting the home button twice gets you out of the game. Going to raise mine to 4 stars. Still buggy but very playable now and fun!<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />There are serious issues with this game on the fire tv and Glu has failed to respond to my support tickets. If this game had actually cost money, I would have been demanding a refund from amazon.<br /><br />First off, I really want to love this game. I am not a huge fan of micro transactions in android apps in general, but I dont mind to help support a company when they put out a good product. The lack of communication from this company makes me think they dont care about their customers at all. In looking over their Deer Hunter 2014 forums, there are lots of people having problems with this game on multiple devices with very little response from Glu.<br /><br />First off, Lets go with the good:<br />Decent graphics<br />Decent sound<br />Huge selection of weapons<br />Lots of upgrades<br />They do seem to be putting out new seasons (havent figured out if they actually have a schedule)<br />The game is free<br /><br />Some of the cons are subjective:<br />Huge money sink (energy, upgrades, weapons, consumables)<br /><br />By far the worst bug on the fire tv is during the tutorial, It asks you to switch weapons using the L1 switch on the controller. This is impossible to do because the L1 switch is hard coded in their game to bring up the \\"Drink a sports drink\\" menu (how the heck this ever made it out of QA I will never understand). You can kinda get around this by switching out your primary weapon to the shotgun but it will still ask you to switch weapons once you get into the map. You can then hit L1, then cancel and it will then proceed with the hunt. Now, the problem with this is that when you first start the hunt, it DIMS your screen telling you it wants you to switch weapons. Even though you \\"Bypassed\\" that and are able to now hunt, the screen is stuck in DIM Mode and it makes things much harder to see. In night hunts, It is EXTREMELY hard to see anything due to it being in DIM mode PLUS normal night lighting. I tried adding the game to my kindle fire hd, synced it with the cloud and then used the kindle to get past the switch weapons option. It did go past that on the kindle but did not seem to affect it on the fire tv, even though it showed my additional kills from the kindle.<br /><br />Parts of the game controller can suddenly stop working. I.E. The right hat that you use to look side to side and up and down will randomly stop responding. You may have to zoom in and out a lot with L2 and then it may start responding. This is extremely bad considering your hunts are timed and if it happens right after you shoot something on a multiple creature hunt, you can almost forget about getting the other needed kills.<br /><br />On several occasions while in the main menus, The cursor just disappears and you can not select anything. Only way out of the game is using the home button on the controller.<br /><br />As of this post, I am almost 11 with 2+ hours played time. I am in the top 29% for total kills and top 25% in total hunts. These have been very difficult due to the problems listed above. I think I have given the game a fair chance and if it wasnt for the problems on the fire tv, It could easily be a 4 star game, but due to the problems above, The complete LACK of support or even responses  from Glu force me to give this game a very bad rating. It is a shame as it is actually a fun game when it works.<br /><br />Just so that others know, I have a few other games like Asphault 8, Zen pinball, Sev 0 and others that the contoller (Amazons game controller, not a knockoff.) works perfectly fine in with none of the problems listed above. So I know the controller is good.
B00G3L6KQI|5|Love this series!!
B000LJB9U0|4|I think it is a good movie, but it is very predictable. Mr. Walken is a very good actor as it goes for Natile Wood is one of her last or last movie before her passing. She was a great actor as well as very good looking.
B005HSL626|5|this game is so addicting, highly recommend it! I have to play it at least once a day, I even got my brothers and friends in to it lol :)
B00KA7JIII|5|Excelent game . The only con is a game short
B0002Z1EG2|5|love it
B00IG2DOKM|4|I THINK THAT THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF CREATING A FARMING TOWN IS A GREAT DEAL OF FUN AND BERRY good.
0345803485|2|I've read 14 chapters in two days... and it's not nearly as \\"dirty\\" as people were/are making it out to be. - The repetition in her writing gets old fast. His lips are always going \\"into a hard line\\" and people are always \\"murmuring\\" ... I've already gotten the whole trilogy and intend to finish what I started, but I have to say, I am a good bit disappointed.
B00E8B1358|4|I like how easy it is to use Prime and the list of movies are exceptional
B00E8KLWB4|5|It's very fun to play and definitely sucks you in with the puzzles. It's not too terribly hard so pretty much anyone could play.
B0089LOG02|5|Loved this book! Sad and heart wrenching. Wanted more.
B003YGSLDA|5|I just love the pictures and updated sound quality from Bluray movies that were transfered from either VHS or older DVD's and so will YOU!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5|Game very easy to use but still challenging, love the training and competing and being able to care for my horses!
B000RH0C8G|4|Fascinating character, interesting story, engaging writing. Not 5 stars because the chronological flow of the narrative seemed a little ambiguous to me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I very much liked Billy Beane because he understood that obtaining accurate, objective, hard information is difficult but economically valuable.
B00H71PBQ8|1|So disappointed by this series compared with the previous 3.
B002ZG98C8|5|This film managed to squeeze in just about all of the reasons that the phobic haters of non-Protestant-caucasions (and marijuana) entering America are wrong: (1) illegal immigration from Mexico, in particular, is fed by corporate (and others') greed, (2) racial profiling is worse than the false \\"dangers\\" of Hispanics in our backyards, (3) the violence associated with pot is economic and not a result of pot-heads becoming violent, and (4) despite the hyperbole and exaggerated silliness (over-the-top violence, excessive nudiy, clever--but overused--humorous cliches, you-name-it) in the movie, people are basically human, no matter what their cultural background, race or religion might be.<br /><br />And yes, this movie got all of those plus all of the arguments against such overreaction (a.k.a. people-different-than-you phobias) and even a gory crucifixion into less than two hours. I was wondering ... what happened to the X-rating for commercial movies?<br /><br />Danny Trejo was actually \\"lovable,\\" and I'm anything but gay.  See it!
B008Y778ZG|3|It was kind of long but the special effects were good. The story wasn't that engaging. I watched it off and on over a couple of days.
B002CNST10|5|Muse continues to be one of my favorite bands! These songs are some of their best. I am looking forward to downloading their next album.
1607747308|5|Amazing little book, and seriously life-changing!!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who will listen!
B0042RJWTC|1|The series was good.  However, the later disks were scratched and as a result the show skipped at points or out right stopped.  It was too late to return the product by the time I got to the later episodes.
B0000CEB4V|5|The Concert for George DVD was a great preformance with great artists. It's not everyday you can see Paul, Ringo, Eric Clapton, Billy Breston, Ravi Shankar, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne preforming toghter. George would be impressed, and so was I. The sound and visual quality was outstanding and I could'nt miss a thing. For Beatle fans this is a must.
B00AQM8H9I|5|Loved it--would recommend it to anyone.  Enjoyed playing it --thought I could rate it quickly but they require too many words!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Loved it
B00A6CCF0K|5|I have been a huge fan of Stephen King since I was a kid. I'm glad that I can still enjoy his story telling.
B000002IKR|4|The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star is the fact that compared to the production tools today, it stinks. At the time it crushed big time, but going back you hear a poor job of studio talent . Still a album for the ages.
B003PTP4S6|5|This is an album to be enjoyed at anytime anywhere.  Morricone's scores have enhanced the movies he composed for.  Yo Yo Ma's playing of the cello actually speaks a part.  One never tires of listening to music composed by Morricone, or any music played by Yo You Ma.  Together, even the angels stop to listen.
B008518MOW|5|The best of an excellent franchise! Action, fun, drama 3D what more could you possibly want apart from another episode :-)
B004J4WNL2|5|As an extrovert, I gained new perspective about the my quiet people in my life. Highly recommend!
B003G4W49C|3|If I was to only go by the first half of the book, it surely would would be a 4 star book. However, the transition from the first half to second half and ultimately the last chapter felt like three different books to me.
B0000025HG|3|I realy hate this album.  But I love to hate it
B00H71PBQ8|5|We are loving this series.  Just disappointed when someone dies and leaves
B004FGMDOQ|4|This is a wonderful book with great pictures that help tell the story. I've seen many reviews here stating this book is not appropriate for Kindle, but my husband and I have had no problems with viewing the pictures at all. I actually use the Kindle app on my phone. If you hold your finger to the screen for a second, an option to zoom pops up, and you can then click that then manipulate the size of the pic on the screen by sweeping with thumb and index finger to enlarge it.  I have included screen shots here to demonstrate.
B00O7UED2A|5|offer Ohio freeway hippopotamus effect fire fee... insiders offended!!!! Greenstein
0380715430|3|Bryson is terrific at describing the English language and its history. One would never guess that subjects as seemingly dry as linguistics and (eech) grammar could be given such a page-turning treatment. In this sense, Mother Tongue is a terrific piece of writing.<br />Where Bryson tends to fall flat on his face is when he compares English to other languages: he tends to make sweeping statements about languages he obviously does not speak, and invariably comes to the conclusion that English is the greatest language ever. <br />These sweeping statements tend to go a bit like this: Bryson wants to say something in Spanish/Urdu/Whatever. He doesn't know the word or can't find it in the outdated dictionaries he obviously uses. Ergo, English is the best language on the planet because he can say things in English that he can't say in other languages.<br />This is a bit of a worry: if his research is so shaky in one topic (comparative linguistics), how can one vouch for the REST of the book? <br />Well, never mind... if you can read Mother Tongue without worrying too much about its accuracy, and gloss over its obvious jingoism, it's a pretty good book.
B0017DJ3UW|4|void
B00PTB7B34|4|This game is pretty cool I recommend it to anyone who plays clash of clans and likes strategy
B00H71PBQ8|5|great character
B00009RGBS|5|A great piece of musical theatre put to the big screen.  Richard Geere is a surprise in the movie, who knew he could sing and dance his way through a film with such great success.<br />The story of Roxie is a reflection of our culture and our obsession with celebrity.  Rene Zellwigger is a convincing &quot;victim&quot; of the celebrity obssessed time. The screen lights up with her beauty and excellent acting ability.<br />Queen Latifah justly deserved the Academy Award nomination (I can't remember if she won or not)  <BR>Lots of talent packed into this movie.  <BR>Highly recomended for those who are musical theatre fans.
B00P7PBD2C|5|A good twist on an old story. The characters were believable and the plot unfolded well. I especially liked the theme and the ending was unexpected and good. Very nicely done, this movie is one I can recommend without hesitation.
B007PVHMCG|5|As always Lego provides a perfect product.  It kept the children busy for at least 2 hours.  They loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5|THis was a great book.  Looked forward to reading every day and could not put it down!  Loved it.  On the second book now
1400063515|1|I won't dignify this idiotic book with a thorough review. Read a total of 100 pages, and I'm exhausted. If you like hearing others pontificate on why they're smarter than you, this is a real treat. I can't add anything to what others who have rated this book likewise have already said.
B00J8CG6KE|5|Awesome
B00H5KRPD8|5|Outstanding
0767800958|5|weaving reality into a subtrifuge of the story line which envelopes both the audience and the actors, sally potter gives us another glimmer of her incredible talent...read the main review for the storyline, but color it with the photographic brilliance of a play on modern cinema (e.g. the main story is b/w while the adverts for fashion (which are meant to be inconsequential) are displayed in fantastico colour)...the double binds are spellbinding as is the texture of the film...salute sally potter...bugger all the critiques!
0064410935|5|A classic story of friends helping friends.<br />The shy pig Wilbur befriends the smart and wise spider Charlotte. When Wilbur got into trouble and his life was in danger, Charlotte came up with a genius idea to save Wilbur. She awed the people on the farm and town with words she weaves into her web, making it look like some kind of magic, praising the smartness of the pig and with that saves him from a tragic fate.<br />A remarkable book with black/white illustrations throughout. The story is enchanting and heartwarming. The true value of friendship is made clear by showing how the animals in the story work together to save the pig.<br />Even a shy little pig can be a big star and can have it's shining moment.
B008P1EWIM|2|The app has a nice look. However, getting it to actually open and stay open is another thing. It can take several tries to get it to stay open and actually display the weather. I would not recommend this app for the new HDX tablet. As a programmer with 20+ years of programming, this app is not ready for the HDX tablet. To the programmers of this app, please fix this bug and you would get a 4+ rating from me.

159562015X|5|My boss purchased this book and its associated personality test for our department. I was so impressed with its results that I purchased three copies for family and friends.     The book focuses on ways to identify and enhance your strengths rather than how to bring up your weaknesses. While both approaches have value, this book was the first to look at enhancing strengths. You purchase in all likelihood find the book an amazing and pleasant surprise.    DJ
B00IK590UI|3|It was, OK. I watched the whole thing.
B009ZXT4BY|5|My son loves it, he will play for hours on end is I let him.  He cant get ebough of it.
B00EYNGP8A|3|I was a little let down by this murder mystery. I would recommend The Murder of Roger Ackroyd or Peril at End House over this one. Both of those have a much faster pace and incredible revelations as to the killers. This novel repeats the same information several times and the motive for murder is not as convincing as in Christie's other books.
B0014I4KH6|5|It's an okay album
B00782O7NE|5|I went to see this movie in theaters because I wanted to be able to say I saw a silent film in a theater. But it is so much more than that. The Artist is a love song to the glory days of Hollywood, a time we have never been able to recapture and never will. It is also a history lesson wrapped up in a lot of fun. The only other movie I know of that depicts the troubling and, for some, ruinous time of the birth of talkies in Singing in the Rain. However, the Artist takes it one step further and tells the story in the way it would have been told at the time. The aspect ratio, the cuts, the music, the directing, the scenes, and the silent aspect of the acting all come straight of the period and all are wondrously compiled into a compelling movie even for today's audiences. I predict that this film will be one that film students will be discussing for decades to come.
B00005QIPH|5|First, let me start off by saying that this is one of those albums that grows on you.  I'm sure a lot of the people who gave this album a bad rating listened to it a few times, hated it, and threw into their closet, never to be heard again.  I nearly made the same mistake.  <br />Originality is what makes this album work.  Unfortunately it might be a little too off the wall for peole.  The distortion of Julian Casablanca's voice takes a little getting used to, but after a while it becomes surprisingly catchy. Like the White Stripes, their trying to do something new with rock.  It's for the people who don't want to always hear depressing whining in the music that they listen to.  Rather, this is meant for sitting on your porch and drinking a beer with friends to.  The Strokes aren't trying to be The Saviors of Rock and Roll, as they've been prematurely labelled as.  They're trying to do a new style of rock, and having fun doing it.
B006MW3V6U|5|A most elegant soap opera.  That's really what it is, in a sense.  Intrigue, underhanded scheming, romance, love.  But it's also a glimpse into how far women have come and how things have changed.  The set, the actors, and little things like the tea china are all captivating as well.  I'm in!
B002Z8LPYA|4|I like all winter type of thrillers, and cold and cold-blooded thrillers especially.  But I specially like this one because it was from a best selling graphic novel; and different from the novel itself, the opening was just fabulous.  Beyond that, there's Kate Beckinsale, she's one of my favorite actresses and such a great looking model too.
B00IEQDOLO|5|Absolutely delightful game, there are options to choose from which are easier or slightly more challenging, plus a very simple children's level.  I played all the way through, will definitely keep, and play through again.<br /><br />I may look into others of this kind in the future to possibly play if they are all similar to this one.
B00WE2SMO8|5|Loved Adam's new CD. Well worth the wait!
B00KA7JIII|3|Good but short.
067144901X|5|I ordered this book for my son from a book club when he was about 10 months old. I thought the art was adorable, but did not think he was really &quot;getting into&quot; it. He quickly learned, from the simple and fun text, the animal sounds...and even knows that a horse says &quot;neigh.&quot; He is 16 months old now, and it is one of his favorites.
0783226004|5|This movie was great. The plot, the acting, the humor, all of it. Its pretty interesting what small peices of equipment can do. The only thing is, just like the liar liar cd, this cd wont play using compaq's dvd  program. I had to load the cinemaster program to view it, and of course it  was worth it.
B0018BB21G|5|What more can I add; the superb sounds of this marvellous group, sustain this entire album; they were the mainstay of music for me<br />all the way through the mid seventies and most of the eighties and nineties. More than 2 thumbs up for this offering and the best is yet to come.<br />John Boy.
B004SBS8LA|3|The salsa music intro brought a smile to my face, but I have to admit that the more I played the game, the more disappointed I became.<br /><br />For so little money, I suppose beggars can't be choosers, but -- compared to the regular Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons -- the levels in this game so far seem to include fewer types of birds and fewer clever \\"physics puzzle\\" type levels.<br /><br />Sure, the graphics are even more fun and colorful than before, but I just feel that the creators of this game could have done so much more with this.

B00000IMTE|5|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />Sometimes after a rock and roll fan endures, a horrifying storm there can still be a Rainbow when the last drop falls from the sky.<br /><br />Ritchie Blackmore's departure from Deep Purple after the 1974 \\"Stormbringer\\" record was devastating to millions (To this day I wish it were a dream) but when he resurfaced with the debut Rainbow album \\"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\\" he afforded us thirty-seven minutes of a mystical journey that was brilliant from the first note to the last crackle on the LP.<br /><br />You heard the story of him joining forces with ex-Elf member Ronnie Dio, but what is often left out of the equation was Blackmore's ability to foresee Dio handling the challenging role of singing in a formulated (Mythical) project and not simply straight ahead rock and roll.<br /><br />The opening track many to this day consider Ritchie's premier post Purple tune \\"Man On The Silver Mountain.\\"  The riff became one of the most recognizable in the last thirty plus years.  The energy level is exhausting (I mean for the listener, never mind the band).  \\"Self Portrait\\" is an oxymoron.  It is haunting in its shear beauty.  \\"Draw me away to the night from the day\\" is a lyric of superlative intellect.  \\"Black Sheep Of The Family \\"is a fun tune and Dio delivers a different way of expressing a rockers success with the ladies- \\"You get a little black book and it grows and it grows.\\"  Up next, \\"Catch The Rainbow\\" is magnificent.  The words seem to freeze us in our tracks as we lean on every word.  \\"Snake Charmer\\" brings back the rock and roll and the band clicks on all cylinders.  \\"The Temple Of The King\\" is mesmerizing.  To fully digest the vocals \\"One day in the year of the fox\\" several plays are required.  To the critics that enjoyed panning Blackmore since 1968 you can tell them \\"If You Don't Like Rock & Roll It's Too Late Now.\\"  The sound of Blackmore's Stratocaster as the story unfolds during \\"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\\" is a blowtorch.  It comes out of the speakers with such fury it decapitates all in its path.  To end the journey one of the finest rock and roll covers and as an instrumental!  Rainbow takes the Yardbirds gem \\"Still I'm Sad\\" and Blackmore cuts loose for some of the best four minutes the ears will ever encompass.<br /><br />The numerous haters of Blackmore have little to no knowledge of his musical history.  His solos and riffs aren't about how many notes per second he can achieve but the tasteful craftsmanship the guitar can bring to a song.  If they would listen, learn, and read on they would actually appreciate his superlative ability to often blend classical with rock and how deep the colors become.<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"Don't Like Rock & Roll It's Too Late Now.\\"  The sound of Blackmore's Stratocaster as the story unfolds during \\"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\\" is a blowtorch.

0375413405|4|It was fun to read after watching the movie about Julia Child.  Many recipes are wonderful but I haven't had the urge to make any of them as yet.
B006O94DJ0|5|The quintessential Japanese animated masterpiece.  A must-have even for non-Anime fans such as myself.
B000Y0Q5NM|5|Wouldn't you love to be able to walk through a worm hole, an \\"event horizon\\" and visit other planets, other worlds, with different types of people? You never know what you are going to get when you do(but conveniently they all speak English). This group of explorers I love, there is humor, adventure, and excitement. This was a long running show so the first in the series are not as well produced as later ones, but to get the story of how this motley group came together, you must see the beginning episodes. This series was before Stargate Atlantis and there is a handover from one Lieutenant Jack O'Neil to Colonel John Shepard in the beginning of Stargate Atlantis, which I love just as much and more as this one. So settle in for some long exciting hours of exploration and adventure with these folks. There is humor too.
B00005JPLW|3|The movie was kind of boring. It looked alright, but the constant slow-mo then speeding up effect wore thin after the first couple times it was used. It's pretty faithful to the book, which I loved, so I really wanted to love this as well. However, it just did not work for me. This movie was pretty average.
B00008H2LE|5|Words can't describe the sound that linkin park has. some people call it electroni-rock or alternative even NUMetal but i disagree. LP's sound is much more than that. i think when u have a certain sound that people can name the band without having to hear a single lyric u have a diverse sound that people really admire and thats what LP is all about. Its funny because i hear people describe that one of the best songs on the cd (Breaking the Habit) as &quot;wierd&quot; or &quot;strange&quot;. What they dont realize is that Meteora has a very different sound than Hybrid Theory. Sure you can still tell that its Linkin Park but the songs have major change of sound. Everything from the guitars to Mr. Hahn and his Dj skills. I think Linkin Park wanted this cd to sound different just because they probably wanted to avoid making a Hybrid Theory Part 2. Hybrid Theory was a great album, but it got played out. To me, i felt that it would never get old and to this day i still love it but i think that radio stations were playing In The End way to many times(mostly because i think they wanted a new Lp album to come out so they tried to fill the void with those songs until it came out). But All in All, Meteora proves that LP will not fall off, or at least anytime soon.
B007SGM084|5|This book was amazing. It wasnt all about sex as i thought. Its a love story and beautiful one at that. Its a touching story as well i wish E.L. James would complete the whole story. Loved it.
0156027321|3|The book begins slowly but sets the stage for an intense story of survival at sea. Perhaps not to be taken literally, this story of survival against all odds is well written paralleling  a world of humanity at its worst. It demonstrates the  value of a message in myth. I won't forget this tale anytime soon.
B004LWZW88|5|This is such a cute movie! We scored a great deal on this movie as well! Go pop some popcorn and have a nice family movie night :)
B0058EBNAO|5|This is the best weather app ever seen I really like this app I recommend :) :) better than the weather Channel
B000I9YLTE|5|It's Animal House.  What more need be said?
B0095P31L6|5|This was a great film; I'm surprised I didn't see more about it when it was in the theater!  There are a ton of hilarious quotes in the movie, and overall it was a fun watch!
B00FAPF5U0|5|the higher up the harder it gets, but I still love to play. Bing it on
B006LSZECO|1|I hated the way it ended!!!  Don't think I would ever read another of her books.  And I surely won't see the movie.
0060278269|1|the book is way too complicated and the storyline is uninteresting. i don't know about reading that book, i believe The Giver written by Lois Lowry is a much better book, with a touching storyline. Read on Book Worms!! ^^~
B000001EHS|5|Doesn't get any better that this.
B00003Q43A|5|WOW WOW WOW!!! never i've seen such amazement in my life. the story deals with a race of 15-mile spaceships who descend to Earth and destroy all the major cities in the world. it's up to President Whitmore ( Bill Pullman), David ( Jeff Goldblum) and Stephen Hiller ( Will Smith) to save the fourth of july from the apocalypse. It's a wonderful, imaginative, intense, movie experience filled with humor, tears, Action, Explosions, sci-fi references, and everything to fill a action/sci fi lovers taste. you must see or own this Grand and entertaining experience on DVD and it'll make you feel like you went to see it at the movies for the first time.<br />Recommendations: The Fifth Element, Stargate, War of the Worlds,  The Matrix, Starship Troopers, Total Recall, Armageddon, Deep Impact, Con Air, The Rock, Star Wars and Men in Black.<br />ENJOY!!!!
B002HWRYJE|5|I thought I was buying the single-disc edition, but I received two DVD's that looked somewhat used and the plastic holder was broken. Overall I'd say the positives equaled the negatives as far as product delivered. I really enjoyed the movie as well as the extras.
B000Q6GUW0|5|Hubby started watching this show this season so he hadn't seen Season 1.  I got him these DVD's for xmas and he was so excited.  I was a little concerened over the few negative reviews, but decided to buy the DVD's anyway.  With that said, I am so glad I got them.    As for the negative reviews, I have no idea why people are saying the video quality is sub-par or that you have to watch a clip from another movie, etc. before being able to see the 12 episodes.  We found these DVD's to be excellent quality and we had no problem putting in the DVD and going right to each episode.  As for the show, we are hooked (me included)!  Great show, great DVD's.  I Can't wait to watch season 2 now.  Enjoy!
B009HSPODE|5|About ordinary people trying to handle life, and how chances can be used or lost. Post world war Canada in remote places is an interesting perspective as well, it somehow reminds me of Norway in that period, before we became rich and spoiled....
6305903182|4|Decent plot, good characters, good directing.  The identity of the killer keeps you guessing up to the end, just like the first two movies.  Plenty of inside jokes about the movie industry, some of which I got, and many others I'm sure I missed.  Ordinarily I'm not a fan of movies about movies, but when it's a send-up, I suppose I can relax the rules a bit.  Carrie Fisher in her cameo was hysterical.  I was happy to see that they brought Jamie Kennedy back for the finale--I thought he was the most entertaining character from the first two movies.  Wes was a little enigmatic with his final closing shot, seeming to say that he's still open to making a fourth film.  That could happen, but frankly, I think Wes said what needed to be said in the trilogy.  No need to serialize it any further, and if he tried, I don't think it would make him a buck.  Worth the price of a rental, or if you are a fan of the genre, a purchase.
B00005QDW1|5|At first I didn't like the &quot;Hey Baby&quot; song, but its grown on me.  My boyfriend bought me the CD after hearing them perform &quot;Hella Good&quot; on tv and thought I'd like it.. I do.. it's one of my favorites!! The CD is awesome and although it may not have as much &quot;emotion&quot; as previous albums, you can tell they just let loose and had fun.  Its a kick-back CD with fun sounds and some fun lyrics... not EVERY CD has to be totally involved.. I like it a lot!
B009FZHYKU|5|The Walking Dead is one of the smartest and entertaining shows out there!  And it keeps getting better!  Season three is full of non-stop action and suspense. A must see!
B0066QQ8DA|5|Ive been pretty obsessed with Wolfmother for the past couple months. they are like a chemical mixture of all my favorite rock bands. this particular album of theirs is one that deserves to be on vinyl as much as any zeppelin record. there were no skips no issues. this is an incredible product. I'm still wondering why a distribution deal wasn't worked out in the US (like their second album's vinyl version).<br />#wulf-mothaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAH
0307593312|4|I love Murakami's books.  I must admit, I was disappointed with this.  There were no Murakami touches, the gentle humour etc.. I have thought of this book of all the angles, maybe I missed... But I have to say, I like it least of all his books.
B00006JDU9|5|Oh well, Star Wars again. You have to have it if you're a Star Wars fan. It's fundamental to have the complete saga
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Time consuming but worth it!!!!!!! Can't stop playing it!!!! I give it 5 because I have downloaded it on different devices and I love it !!
B00H3NMXYS|5|Love it
B000BCE918|4|I was a Kid when I saw the first one and I loved it. The Day it came out on VHS mom bought it and I wore it out. The first one alone is worth the other two they don't add up to the first but they are still entertaining, and how can you beat the price.
B00BB8RKH6|4|This wasn't a movie I neccessarily would have gone to see in the theater, but glad I watched via  Amazon video. I hadn't heard much about Flight, so was unsure of what to expect. Denzel Washington gives an unbelievable performance as a pretty unlikable character who is severely flawed and battling with addiction. The dilemma - for lack of better word  - of dealing with the aftermath of a place crash in which he was very heroic, coupled with the poor decisions he made before the crash and after make for a great story in my opinion.
B004XDYJRU|3|So I unimstalled it.  However, now that I've uninstalled it, Amazon won't remove it from my list, a constant reminder that I should never have downloaded this app.
B00ABGEFWC|5|my little sis is absolutely in love with this game and believe it or not it kida helps with reading. so I think its grate for at least four to eight year olds
B00278U1W0|4|If you are a fan you will like it~
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is awesome and exciting and fun but although is hard to earn money and gems get it know you&quot;'ll love trust me.
B00005JMJG|5|THe only creative movies made lately are independent films that hardly anyone sees because the theatres never show them. But amazingly a film has been made that can only be considered genius viewing after viewing. What's fantastic about this movies is it keeps you thinking a long time after you see it. Charlie Kauffman (spelled wrong) seems to do that alot, and that's a good thing. To praise this movie more i must say that after this Jim Carrey has become a superb actor, as he also showed in THe Truman Show, another great movie. From the moment the movie starts it captures you, and you are way too intrigued to leave for a second. Jim's quiet way of acting in this movie connects with your heart immediately. If you like movies that you don't have to think about then don't see this movie. But if you're looking for a more creative, thought provoking film, go check it out.
B007IXWKUK|5|of course not! then there wouldn't be a third book! wish these books were cheaper... it's kinda fantasy but still fun and suspenseful at the same time.
B000EJ9MTW|5|The sound is retro, definitely in the vein of 70's hard rock groups(I won't name them, I think they have been named enough).  The music is catchy and guitar riffs are aplenty.  Though one thing is concerning me, many reviewers make it sound like there is finally one band going back to basics but that isn't true!  Of course everyone has heard of \\"Jet\\" but if you like Wolfmother and want more Old school garage band sounds, check out \\"The Datsuns\\", \\"Kings of Leon\\", \\"Silvertide\\", \\"The Black Keys\\"(Really bluesy),and \\"Buckcherry\\".  Now back to Wolfmother, my favorite song is definitely White Unicorn, but all the songs are good.  If you are looking for solid rock and roll with guitar solos and heavy guitar riffs and drum beats then get this album!!!
B000KG499M|5|amazing for displaying your models. best part is you can connect the bases together
B00DUGCLY4|5|This app is very cool i love it thanks its a great game for like 4th graders and up u guys should make more games
0064471837|5|I was going away on holiday to turkey a few years back and wanted a book i could read at the beach. Whilst at the airport i picked up some other book (can't remember the name) nearly went to pay and saw the front cover for Sabriel and thought it looked fantastic. Anyway i bought this book and it just gripped me until the very last page of the book. The characters are amazing and the idea of the bells and switching between life and dead is just fantastic. After i had read this book i HAD to buy the other books in the old kingdom series Lirael and Abhorsen and hearing that the new book clariel, made me want to re-read the books before clariel is released.<br /><br />I won't go into any detail about what the books about because i feel its best to find out each character and the story line yourself. However I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for that next series to read. By far the best books ive ever read anyway<br /><br />This series should be made into a movie!!<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book- \\"Does the path choose the walker, or the walker the path\\"
B00CWY76CC|5|This is a fun 10 level game.  There are puzzles,gathering clues and entering the information to gain tools.  It's fun.  I did get stuck a couple of times.
B000H4TX9I|5|What can I say, I've been a Firefly fan for years and really enjoyed re-watching the entire season on prime.  If you enjoy Syfy original style shows, give Firefly a shot and don't forget to watch Serenity after you finish up the season.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I cannot put this game down. It reminds me of a game my mother told me she used to play when she was a kid
B00DHKKN6Q|4|Fun game Cute graphics.  would be great for the grand kids to play.  will look for more games from the creators.
B0058UXHHK|4|I liked this book. It held my attention. The crying was a bit much, but I still wanted the characters to have a happily ever after. I didn't like the old judgmental busybodies or the mom. I'd probably read other works by this author.
B00F35B8F8|4|Complete Star Trek fan .... Love Chris Pine and Zach Quinto. Though it was great to watch, the first part was more entertaining. So 4 stars. A definite must watch for Trekkies.
B008EZVNFE|4|I LOOOOOVE this album! When I listen to it I think of a romantic indie film set in the fall. No, she's not the best vocalist, but I am more interested in the melody and lyrics- she does not disappoint in either of those categories.
B005LAIHXQ|1|If you liked Alien/Aliens and must see it, wait for the rental first, then decide if you should buy the DVD. If you like everything having to do with the Alien franchise such as AvP, then you are probably safe in getting the DVD.<br /><br />This movie was marketed so well with an excellent trailer, complete with the 'aahhhh' siren sounds from the original 1979 Alien trailer, which leads prospective viewers to believe it will be a horror type prequel to Alien. I would have been more satisfied had I paid to watch the trailer looped for two hours, because it had the right background music, the right dialogue, and the right scenes. The rest of the movie should have been left on the cutting room floor. \\"Cut it off! Cut it off!\\"<br /><br />It's a B rated sci-fi TV show at best with interesting concepts poorly executed.<br /><br />Some people may consider the next comments SPOILERS:<br /><br />It's not a horror movie, but it does have all the aspects from the Alien franchise in it such as how the alien attacks and reproduces with scenes that are supposed to be gross/gory but fall flat. The background music was similar to that of Apollo 13 when Tom Hanks was excited to be going to the moon. The alien type creatures looked like they came from the movie Sphere or an aquarium. I found myself laughing half the time, especially when \\"the claw\\" from Toy Story appeared.<br /><br />I actually liked the concept of the evolution of the \\"alien\\" to show something different and of it being more of a space exploration movie. I liked the concept of maybe 3 prequel sequels. I also like the concept of what I believe the twist is going to be in the sequel to this movie, which would explain the Space Jockeys' motives. Unfortunately, it just was not executed well at all.<br /><br />Other reviewers, who downgraded the movie, were correct. It lacked character development. Do I need to read their resumes? No, but some more interaction among the crew would've helped like they did with Aliens or Blade Runner for that matter. Then there's the illogical things the characters do. For example, in one scene that is in the trailer involving Shaw dropping to her knees, logical dialogue would have been \\"What happened? Are you okay?\\", instead it's more like \\"Hello. Nice of you to stop by.\\"<br /><br />SPOILER****SPOILER*****SPOILER - Just as an added side note for people who watched it, but thought it didn't correspond to Alien correctly. Prometheus is not a direct prequel. The Space Jockey and his ship are NOT the same Space Jockey and ship that the Nostromo found. Prometheus was on LV-223 with pyramid structures that are supposed to tie in with Earth's pyramids. The Nostromo went to LV-426 and found a ship that had crashed on its own accord. Remember from Aliens, Ripley said, \\"..It was not from there. It was a derelict spacecraft....\\" The LV-223 Space Jockeys had begun terra forming the place and were using it as a storage facility. Maybe the sequel explains how a different ship ended up on LV-426 with eggs instead of vases. Perhaps it's the ship Dr. Shaw was flying at the end of Prometheus. END SPOILER*** END SPOILER *****END SPOILER<br /><br />My advice: Watch the TV viral videos and the trailers and then watch Alien again instead.
B003HARV98|5|how could you go wrong with a marina cd? you cant. every song is pure perfection. full album, great buy.
B00005V9IJ|5|I seriously don't see how people aren't in love with this movie. It's so captivating.
B009HV2JT8|1|Uh this sucked. Bad movie with a bad plot. I would only recommend this if you are in to low budget movies.
B000JMKNJ2|3|Long plot, scenery hard to picture...... it's magic,science, middle ages? I don't think I'll invest any more of my time.....eh!
B00G1TOJ7Y|4|Moving and totally engaging
B0094LU9C0|3|Fun to watch
B00VRYCGLO|5|This the best majhong game I have played in a long t time
B00FY5784C|5|good book. I like the stories of how the songs come together.
B000XXGMS8|3|Ok, so first the good:<br /><br />They look great.<br /><br />They seem sturdy enough for my intended use.  That is to say, daily wear and &#34;casual&#34; hiking.  I have my doubts that they would hold up under very rugged conditions, but then again, I didn't buy them for any sort of aggressive hiking conditions. I'll wear my Merrells for that.<br /><br />The leather is surprisingly soft right out of the box.  This was nice as the boots required almost no breaking in time, unlike almost all other leather boots I've bought.  Within a few days of purchase, I wound up wearing them at an all day photo shoot.  They were comfortable all day long and, most importantly, by the time I got home, my feet were not screaming at me.<br /><br />Now the nitpicks:<br /><br />Prior to purchase, I read a number of reviews complaining about the sizing.  I'm glad I did.  Based on what others said, I ordered a half-size smaller than normal (I went with a size 10, instead of my usual 10.5).  Even then, the boots feel just a tad on the large size -- not enough to justify going down a half a size again, but just a touch more roomy in the toes than I'd like. If I were going to do any sort of aggressive hiking in these, I don't feel like I'd have a good feel for the trail due to the extra &#34;play&#34; in the toe area.<br /><br />The second nitpick is that there appears to be a defect with the sole on the left side.  The toe &#34;squishes&#34; when I step, as though air is rushing out.  It did this right out of the box, so I know it was nothing I did to the boot.  Like the sizing issue, it's not enough of a problem to justify a return, but it's a disappointing lapse in quality.  If the soles wear out as quickly as some other reviews suggest, this problem will take care of itself when I have theme resoled.  But this shouldn't be an issue with brand new shoes to begin with.
B005SFS4ZU|5|The best ever. My wife and I have listened and enjoyed many times over. The music and acting are most compelling.
B000FCKGPC|2|This was really terrible, no one you are interested in is in it. Wait till the next book is out and just skip this one.
1400031362|2|I read the first volume of the \\"No 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" and now volume 3. By comparison, vol 3 dwells too much on the personal lives of Mma Ramotswe and her husband to be. These parts of the book are uninteresting and did not engage me much. On the other hand, very little detecting is done in this book. The main character really handles only one case, and while in the first volume this was where her earthy wisdom shone through, here her advice is not as convincing, as if she has her mind on other things.     On the other hand, the minor characters in this book are delightful. It was good to see the assistent come into her own, and the mechanic apprentices insert a much needed comic note into the story.    In all, this book feels like the author is treading water, not sure where to take his characters. He is shifting from the series-of-vignettes to a more long form novel, but the result is not convincing. Yet.
B00CATSONE|4|The book starts with an interesting introduction which helps you later on to understand Tesla better (if it's possible to understand him at all). The book provides enough information to make you an admirer of the genius inventor.
B00IG2DOKM|5|I love it because it is fun and because you can do so much stuff. I like this game because it is awesome!
B00DYOOGYK|5|YOU should get this game it is the best game ever if you just want to chill and do some stuff like race and that stuff.
B001GUXJQA|4|Great reading, keeps you in the game.
B004FEFS5E|5|Brian is outstanding.
B000B8QG4A|5|Thank you:) Fast shipper!!!!
B0000039QA|3|Most people will talk about how great this album is but that's just nostalgia talking because the first time they heard it they knew they'd never hear new BIG music again.<br />Tragedy aside, this album has Puff's fingerprints all over it. It has very little energy and lacks the flavor of Ready to Die. Only two songs really come to mind-\\"Hypnotize\\" and \\"I Got a Story to Tell\\"<br />It's just got way too much R/B in the production
B005CRQ3RK|5|HOLY CRAP THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ I HIGHLY CONSIDER THIS BOOK TO ANYONE IN DA WORLD
B00AREIAI8|5|It was the best horse game I have ever played I loved how you could take care of the horse and compete with computer players
B00003CXZ4|4|So, lots of people have told you how terrific this movie is (except those that didn't understand it).  I highly second those glowing reviews.<br />Just two things, though:<br />First, if Leonard can't remember anything since he and his wife were attacked, why does he remember his &quot;condition&quot; and explain it to everyone he meets?  He seems to never need prompting on this point - he doesn't even have a tatoo explaining it.  So, how could he remember it, since it happened after the attack and he can't remember anything he does, says, has done to him or said to him from that point on?<br />For this reason I gave it four stars.  Otherwise it's excellent, and deserves multiple watchings.<br />One other thing: At the end of the movie we see flashbacks (?) of Leonard with his wife.  There is a new tatoo on his chest that isn't there throughout the entire movie: &quot;I DID IT&quot;.  This was alluded to as a tatoo he would give to himself after killing his wife's murderer.<br />So, was his wife really dead?  Was it all an act (remember, he accused his client of acting, right?)?  Was he dreaming of his wife being alive after his vengence?  Is this just a left-curve thrown in by the filmmaker to confuse us?<br />An enigma inside an enigma....<br />I also liked the menu &quot;clues&quot; - very clever, extending the story outside the bounds of the film itself....<br />Also, Guy Pearce could be my best friend's twin brother... very surreal watching him....<br />-
B00CAYHVKQ|5|The book is fun to read understandable and I can't wait to do the experiments. I recommend the book to anyone
B0038P59A0|3|This is not the Sherlock Holmes I appreciated. He is some kind of gun toting martial artist. This is more a caricature of the character than anything else.<br /><br />Noisy and too much emphasis on special effects and gratuitous violence for me to appreciate as much as I might have.<br /><br />Even so it was not that awful for a couple hours of entertainment. I guess I just prefer a more traditional Holmes.
B000IKQMFO|5|Purchased as a gift for a friend, again. One of my favorite movies. Excellent movie if you are a fan of Downton Abbey stile of movie you will love this film.
B00003CXDB|4|I thought I bought this product new? If I am incorrect, please disregard the review. When I received the DVD, the wrapping on the end was open. The DVD plays fine without anything wrong. It appeared to have been opened.
B000BYA4JM|5|Funny story starring Madonna & Griffin Dunne.  He's about to be stuck (IMHO) in an ill-fated loveless marriage, when he encounters Nikki... and things start to change for him before he even knows it... or at least before he admits it.  ;-)  Entertaining movie...
B009YP9L7U|5|This was a very good read. I enjoyed everyminute of it. I look forward to more books by this author.
B00CATSONE|5|love the book sorry for hm
B00IJJUIMY|4|I've read every book in the series, and am never disappointed.  Harry and his new, young partner, Lucia Sota tackle a cold case that takes surprising turns.  I'm never disappointed in this series, and always enjoy another case with Harry.  I will be sad when he retires, which seems to be on the horizon.  I would recommend reading this whole series, starting with the first book, for Harry has led an interesting personal life, as well as his professional life as a cop in L.A. This is a good book.
B008XG1X18|5|Great App
B00FAPF5U0|5|I was so excited to finally get this on my kindle. It was a long time coming. Love it. Can't stop playing .
B00C7KXUOE|5|Wonderful, intelligent, captivating series. Excellent in every way. It even has continuity with the rest of the Hannibal universe. Could not stop watching!
067443000X|1|Too dense. I read the whole book, and was nearly put to sleep. Why do French writers take so long to get to the point...
B00TU9UO1W|1|This movie was just plain awful.  I have always been a sci-fi buff and was very anxious to see this film, but ended up being sorely disappointed at wasting nearly 3 hours on this illogical pap.  I'm accustomed to bringing a healthy dose of suspension of belief to any sci-fi movie, but this nonsense required such a massive dose that it surpassed absurdity.  I note that some other commentators giving a 1 star rating were generous enough to give positive points to the cinematography and special effects, but I can't in good conscious even do that as I felt both were poorly rendered.  I'm not a huge fan of McConaughey but I've enjoyed some of his other movie roles, yet, in this disaster, his presentation was wooden, hollow and yet, still managed to be overly melodramatic - I mean, seriously, did his script just read - &#34;mumble a lot and break into tears in every other scene&#34;?  The story was so long, so boring and so inconsistent that it became nearly incomprehensible.  And, the plot drivers so weak and convoluted that trying to decipher the ludicrous story line became the only source of extremely dubious entertainment.
0790729628|5|Someday he'll be Sir Ridley, no doubt, but now he's just Tony Scott's big brother. Blade Runner is one of better movies made either of the science fiction genre or of the noir mystery genre, or both. I imagine of the science fiction-mystery noir genre it may be the only one.<br />It is a thinking persons movie because it doesn't leave all the questions answered. Is Sean Young a Replicant? Is Harrison Ford a Replicant? Is there a secondary or tertiary meaning in Rutger Hauer's escaped Replicant that is not dissimilar to Pierre Boulle's &quot;Planet of the Apes?&quot;<br />That Ford argued with Scott on the emphasis of &quot;to be or not to be&quot; regarding his role as a/the 'blade runner' along with the silly voiceover about which art regrettably had to bow to money has given the story of the movie almost as much interest as the story.<br />All characters are well played; the movie is stark and surreal; highly recommended. Larry Scantlebury
B002QYUVY8|5|This movie is a very funny movie.  Make sure to pay attention to the entire movie or you might miss something important.
B009RX7IX8|5|I am a bit of a geek about this show. I love the characters and the way they work together. I know that they are not real, but if they were I would love to have them as my friends.
0446580848|2|I really have enjoyed previous DeMille books and John Corey's smart mouth. However, The Panther goes on and on for 90% of the book before it got interesting and a page-turner. It was interesting to learn something of the history of Yemen and the native culture, but that's not why I buy a 'thriller' novel. On the positive side, Corey's outdid himself with his smart mouth, maybe even too much; but it did add to this otherwise boring tail. Come on DeMille, you can do a lot better.
B00KBYLR02|2|Tried the free version, which didn't last long. Thought, &amp;#34;ok, not bad, I will buy the full version!&amp;#34; Had Amazon coins to purchase with so I wasn't out the $4.99, however I was out a good amount of coins! DO NOT BUY this game. Keep your money or coins. The full version ended as quickly as the free version! Reached the end in less than a week. VERY DISAPPOINTING!
B008Y7IP0S|5|This is a great movie no matter how many times you view it.  We had our grandchild over and got this so he could watch something more geared toward young children.  No bad language and no out of control sex .  There are not too many movies today that keep up with old time morality.  This is one that does.
B0012QCZ54|5|Given as gift to granddaughter because she likes this kind of dvd.  I hope it makes her happy.  That's all.
B0013K1ALE|5|MAN, I LOVE LED ZEPPELIN. JUST AWESOME. ROCK GODS....
B003ZDZ22U|5|If you are a Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana fan then this record is an absolute must.    If you are not a committed fan then Miley actually has far more talent than her critics would have you believe so approach this one with an open mind.     You do not need to have watched the Hannah Montana series to like the songs but having context to the songs does help.   You might not get \\"Gonna get this\\" until you have watched the \\"Hannah's going to get this\\" episode so if this the first song you listen to skip over it and then come back to it later as it will surely grow on you. Been here all along, I'm Still Good and Love that Let's Go also take on a different dimension if you have watched the episodes.    Both Miley and Hannah music has become more dance/pop/techo over time and this album follows the trend.    Technical quality on this album is the best of the series and there is a good variety of songs from reggae style \\"Gonna get this\\" to a moving ballad in \\"Love that lets Go\\" which features Billy Ray Cyrus with some nice harmonies between the voices of Miley and her dad.     Stand out tracks are: Gonna get this, Ordinary Girl, Love that lets Go, I'm still Good, Been here all along and Barefoot Cinderella but all the tracks are very listenable.    Although it was generally reported that Miley was getting bored with being Hannah Montana - this is certainly not evident from the quality of her singing here and she really puts her heart into each of these songs.
B00AQCMK32|5|I love this game! But please add the newer consoles on this game. I want to make a wierd reversi game for ps4!!
B004H6G0TI|5|The planes are shooting each other, and you have a classical music in the background. Funny to me. I enjoyed playing it. It's very touch responsive on Kindle Fire, and Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I played only a few level and enjoyed the game play so far. It's simple, and cute. Not too many buttons to press. The planes that has higher speed, makes me dizzy. It spins so fast, and moves so fast. I prefer the slower planes.  My 2 years old son love to crash the plane. Definitely worth 2.99 but I got it as free app of the day.
B00AB7HESI|2|I liked the ds games, but remix is stripped of the best features. There is no challenge, and coming up with creative solutions to the puzzles is difficult as the system steers you towards a small set of options it will accept. The ingame currency is completely worthless, you can't buy anything with it.
B0000BYM3K|5|Maiden is back and they are more hardcore then ever. <BR>*WARNING* This album is not for cry babies this is only for the hardest of the hardcore fans. I would say this is probably their bes album since seventh son of a seventh son. Janieck Gers solos rip this album and Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound amazing.
B008JMKN4Y|5|Love this book, great writer,very real characters.  Must read will read again again.  Can't wait to read the next one
B00003CX96|5|This movie would be considered an \\"indie\\" movie today, with <br />it's low production budget, but hence lies its charm. <br />This movie is the cinimatic equivalent of John Cougar's <br />\\"small town\\". It delves into the absolute core of what it means <br />to grow up in a small american town, without patronizing <br />the characters. I grew up there around the same time and age of <br />the characters. That's how it really was. The movie <br />captures that ineffable, transient moment when our adolescent dreams haven't quite calcified into harsh reality yet. <br />It perfectly captures the precious few years we have when life is endless with possiblities and dreams, and the gravitas <br />of responsibilities and stream of disappointments hasn't hit us yet.
1616960922|5|I'm a fan of Sanderson and I've read all his works.  I found this to be a terrific short story and I hope we get the chance to delve more into this world in future novels.
B00LZXOI5E|1|A pest with asking for review, very annoying.  Too easy, not much of a brain teaser. Easily and quickly bored with game.  May be OK for preschool.
B004TI1WME|5|Any college student will find this very useful.
B0055D3EFU|3|one of the scarier movies of these days. everybody knows scary movies arent even scary anymore but this one is the best done in recent times. you still wont be scared out of your mind but it's a good try
B006GG1KOC|4|Lots of fun for kids, my son loved the pinch and zoom.  We had a blast going though all the levels.
B0056UHSYK|5|After his first album, I didn't believe David Cook could make a better album. The first album was fantastic. His sophomore album is even better. David Cook proves once again that he can sing, and the wait was well worth it.<br /><br />Every song in this album is different but great.<br /><br />Here's a breakdown:<br />1. Circadian 9.5/10-  David does it again. This song is great. It opens up the album, and establishes what the album will be about.<br />2. Right Here, With You 9/10- Even with this upbeat song, David Cook keeps the album going with a lot of emotion.<br />3. We Believe 9.5/10- Beautiful song. David Cook shows his softer side in the beginning, and delivers another emotional, beautiful song.<br />4. Fade into Me-8.5/10 - This is a slower song, but is beautiful. It's moving, and Cook shows his softer side once again.<br />5. Hard to Believe 9/10- Another good song. Not much to say about it, except that it was great.<br />6. Take me as I am 9/10- Beautiful song, very moving. Cook showcases his voice once again.<br />7.Time Marches On 9.5/10- Cook has an edgy tone in the song. It's beautiful once again.<br />8. The Last Goodbye 10/10- This song reminds me of his songs in his debut album, but to another level. Cook showcases his storytelling abilities, and his voice together. Great, beautiful, song.<br />9. Paper Heart 8.7/10- Great song. It tells a story, and Cook shows a softer side once again.<br />10. Four Letter Word 8.5/10- An edgy song, but great.<br />11. Goodbye to the Girl 9/10- Great song. Not much more to say.<br />12. Rapid Eye Movement 8.2/10- Good song. Even though I gave it a lower rating, it's still great. Cook has a great voice.<br />13.This is not the last TIme 9/10- Great song. very moving.<br />14. Let me Fall For You 9/10- Cook closes the album with this moving song. Once again, like all the songs before it, he showcases his voice.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great album. I'm not disappointed, and I'm already looking forward to his next album.<br /><br />Overall rating of album: 9.7/10
B00DR0PDNE|5|Turns your TV into a smart TV.  Have been using this product for 6 months, and have had no problems.  Works great with Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube.  I really like the ability to make a YouTube playlist, sit back, and enjoy the videos!
B00OTD72PA|3|Good Game except that if you win the game you shouldn't lose a heart only if you lose a game.
B007HACDLK|5|Out of all of the Mitch Rapp books this one is the best one I have read. I highly recomend this book
B0035JRVR8|5|One of my fave films. A romantic, funny, adventurous, film full of excellent turns of events. Set in Rome and beautifully filmed in black and white. A classic.
B00BZAJMWG|5|Realistic portrayal of mental health difficulties not only for the main characters but for the family members as well. Hits all of the emotional buttons
B004GHNIRK|5|Victor Hugo is brilliant in his portrayal of life.  His story is a wonderful classic.  I was introduced to the musical first, and reading the book is such a joy.  Love, loss, struggle - it's all there.
B0099Y2MYK|5|Excellent season, with the deaths of Sybil & then Matthew. I can hardly wait for the new season to be available here in the States!
B003XF1XOQ|5|This trilogy is so good.... So inspiring. I like the part where at the end someone mentions how fickle and forgetful we are about the bad and good things that happen. How those games, or war shouldn't come back, yet we always find a way to get them back.
1936594153|5|I first read this novel when I was in high school.  It was one among the many that we 'pseudo-intellectuals' of the 70's were reading. I enjoyed it so much, I recommended it to others, and was dumb enough to lend my copy, which I never got back.  Recently, I began to re-read Kahlil Gibran, and I get the urge to re-read this; and I was so happy to have found it.  This time, I won't be lending it out. I recommend this magnificent literary work to any who have ever had the conscious moment of 'thinking about thinking', and wondered if they were the only one.  And even if you've never had such thoughts, this novel will provide you with hours of thought provoking enjoyment. Debbie
B00IIOFVYA|5|I really enjoyed this game.  Most games are the same thing over and over but, this game kept my interest.
B00DJFIMW6|5|My 3 year old grandson plays this on my kindle fire every time he gets in my car for a ride. Nothing is better than listening to him giggle as he is chasing the minions. Cute!
B00OH74BXY|5|This movie was seriously freaking awesome! I have always loved the X-Men movies and I knew that at the end of wolverine in Japan when he ran into magneto and Prof. X in the airport that they were going to put on a great movie for us. This movie had it all!!!!!!!<br />The young Prof. X puts on a heck of an emotional performance. It was beautiful seeing a lot of the old cast. I still am angry at Anna Paquin's character for getting that shot that takes away her mutant abilities early on in the series, because she would've been great in this movie meeting up with her old boyfriend and frenemy.<br />I love Wolverines character. And I love the young Eric/magneto. Even Mystique I absolutely adore learning what made her tick!<br />There's so many great scenes in this movie and so many great messages. I've always wished that I had a mutant ability. Mutant  and proud!<br />I wonder what they are going to come up with next. Because it's obvious Prof. X and magneto are getting up there in age and they do not have Logan's ability of not aging. There was one sad part where the character of Mistique found out what happened to her old gang – the red Devil guy, The fairy girl that could spit fire balls, the ice crystal girl, etc.<br />I truly love everything about this movie and series. That is why I have a gush fest going on here.
B008602KQI|5|Not as good as the books, but for a movie it's really good. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Catnis. looking forward to the next one.
B000PMLFRA|5|We all know the movies, so no point in prolonging another discussion.     The only thing I hope the studio does when releasing them, and utilizing the Blu-Ray disk capacity, is to have the option of playing the ORIGINAL theatrical release.    Leave the what I call \\"butchered\\" revised version as an option for people, but for the love of all that is holy in movies - give us a high def version of the original films.    Here's hoping ....
B000002JSP|4|Led Zeppelin's final studio album is in many ways in a class by itself; the only one that makes use of synthesizers as its base sound, the only one recorded in Sweden (at ABBA's famed Polar Studios); and the only one with bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones clearly in charge of the music.<br /><br />What's remarkable about this record is that despite the extensive use of synthesizers, the album is still so very heavy. \\"Carouselambra\\", the epic 10+ minute track at the album's center, is as loud as anything on 'Physical Graffiti', \\"All My Love\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" both achieve epic sweep and grandeur; and even the countryfied \\"Hot Dog\\" and piano-centric \\"South Bound Saurez\\" rock like few other bands can manage. Only \\"In the Evening\\" retains the classic Zeppelin cronch, while \\"Fool in the Rain\\" takes off for Brazilian destinations never before seen in the world of hard rock.<br /><br />Perhaps it was nigh impossible for Zeppelin to not be loud, or (more likely) they simply found a way to incorporate the (then new) world of synthesizers into their sound without compromising their hard rock cred. Even with very few guitar riffs (only \\"In the Evening\\" contains any of substance), the music manages to be both heavy and yet full of variety and substance.<br /><br />Largely the work of Robert Plant and John Paul Jones (Page and Bonham were absent for many of the sessions due to addiction issues, although the work they contributed is exemplary), the music on 'In Through the Out Door' seemed to indicate a new musical direction for the band, a direction that alas was not to be explored further.<br /><br />Although not one of their bigger selling albums (and certainly under-appreciated since its release), and although nothing can equal their early albums, 'In Through the Out Door' is still classic Zeppelin in every meaningful sense, showing yet another side of this multifaceted and exceptionally talented band.
B00F9F1G4U|4|Quick and easy to use.Pop
0345522303|5|I was so excited to see Flewelling bring this back again.  She really created something great with this world and the character.  The only thing I didn't really like was how she romanticizes prostitution, and I know a lot of writer do it but I felt that part of the book was just unnecessary.  But overall this was a great read and I can't wait to see what she does next.
156895963X|5|Received the book in a timely manner. The print is big enough for me to read even without my reading glasses - BIG plus!! I would order again from the same vendor!
B007JM4CWY|4|Instantly addicted. User interface is easy and intuitive. I give it five stars because no app is perfect, yet I have found nothing wrong with this app. Easily one of the best free apps of the day, and I've already convinced a friend to buy it for the five dollars. After five minutes he was addicted and claimed it was well worth the price.
B009GEAPYW|5|Phenomenal. This is a must see. The entire movie from start to finish makes all of Nolan's work look amature. Great job.
B00N1HONIO|5|WolfyNat here So I was totally exited when I heard this game came out on the kindle fire because I can't download the real game but now I'm like AHHHH in a good way my favorite is Bonnie and I'm sad that n the 2 one Bonnies face is ripped off =( but I also draw pictures of all the characters and my friends wanted me to draw some for them also I made a power point on it just for fun all the info you need XD I even bought a shirt on 5 nights at Freddy's also for Halloween I was a security guard from 5 nights at Freddy's. I love this game so worth 5 stars I also want to go to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza when I get older btw it's a real place
B003YUC2FE|5|I think the trilogy is the best way to go!  If you don't already have TS1 and TS2 on Blu-ray, then this perfect since TS3 was recently released on BLURAY/DVD/DIGITAL.  We give our daugther the DVD version for her to keep in her collection, we keep the B-R in the family collection and download the digital to the family computer so we can upload to electronic devices anytime.  If your child is like mine, chances are they'll scratch the DVD or misplace it.  This way, you always have the two backup copies, and B-R is just wonderful on your big HDTV as a family movie night choice.    I think the movies are well known enough, so we don't have to tell you how cute the characters are and how heartwarming the little story lines are.    ENJOY!!
B005H0IW6W|5|Love it love him lost the first went rite out bought a second one can't be without over the holidays ‼️
B004NOH9LC|4|To put it simply, this is a good movie.  I've been a Television Producer for over 20yrs, and they nail the characters and situations in this film.  I know and have worked with people that are exactly like everyone in this movie.  Yes you sometimes need a zany, talented producer to shake things up. It was also refreshing to see a simple feel good film that had a natural feel without any extreme special effects.
B004V9MU86|5|Looking at Nazi Germany from a totally different perspective.<br />The small stories of the people who make up our lives.<br />Fantastic Book.
B008KOTNVA|4|Bought this kit because it includes the tri-wing bit which is needed to remove battery from recent Macbook Pro computers.  I like the feel of the screwdriver and it has the &#34;spinning&#34; handle top thing to remove screws quickly.
B00K7C17QW|5|This is the biggest thing you can think of Will I give it up. No plz pass it over cause you don't know what to do this is awesomeness sauce bro I'm detective awesome and this my case case closes
1451666179|5|Allie Brosh is hilarious- you probably already knew this. But the poignancy of her comics dealing with depression were my favorite part of this book. She has a rare skill of combining humor and self-deprecation with universal human struggles. She admits the things that we tend to hide from ourselves (in fact, I think she should probably give herself a break!) but are true to some degree for almost all of us. Whether it's procrastination, lack of motivation, social awkwardness, or tricking yourself into thinking you're a good person, she lays it all out there in a way we can all laugh at and at the same time relate to.
B005FJ7DOM|4|THIS MOVIE IS JUST ABOUT THE MOST REALISTIC VERSION OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THERE REALLY WERE VAMPIRES ON THIS PLANET. ENOUGH ACTION AND EDGE OF YOUR SEAT SCENES TO KEEP YOUR ATTENTION.. THE ACTORS GAVE A VERY REAL PORTRAYAL OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO TRY TO STAY ALIVE WHILE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR SANITY....
B00ABGEFWC|5|This is fun and cool playing with super cute pets<br />As a adult I enjoy this game.  Anyone any age can play and have fun.
B001KZG99A|5|We aren't into comic book characters, but this was a believable movie with a lot of action and some humor. We enjoyed it.
B0040I09RM|4|Great series.  Not terribly fondvof howvit ended.
B00DJ3ITKS|5|Very interesting to have a deeper understanding of this amazing story.
B002M3GPOI|1|Wilson's 09 mix is unnecessary. Red and Lizard, on the other hand, are excellent.  The 04 ITCOTCK remaster was itself the greater accomplishment and revelation.  Also, on the 04, Moonchild is intact in running order with all its chill mysteriousness.  A 180g vinyl reissue of the 04 remaster would have been more appropriate as a 40th anniv marker.  Genesis did this beautifully and with meaning on their 70-75 remix box.  I do hope Fripp will get this done soon and for the full catalog incl the original Young Person's Guide.  Crimso LPs were masterpieces of design, perfect representations of what was inside.  Often their texture made them a wonder to hold and touch.  I went cold when I took hold of this box -- glossy and off-color, harsh outdated jewel cases, icky foam compartment insert, wimpy garish buttons.  The entire packaging of this new box is an embarrassment to Barry Godber, the musicians, and the fans.  Until I give this away or sell it, it is going in a cabinet to protect people from seeing it.  I love the mini-LP packages done on the 02-04 remasters.  They even faithfully reproduced the original paper stocks used on the originals. But for now I'm through buying ad nauseum Crimso repackages on CD.  Gimme vinyl, please please please!
B008XG1X18|4|I would have given this app a 5 but now they (in the past two weeks) have been pinning pins &quot;of possible interest&quot; onto my board......I don't enjoy that. Everything else is good. I use this app to sort my recipes :)
B00H3GZMIE|5|I love this cd.
B008XG1X18|5|great app
1595822003|5|I got this hearing about how it was Wrightson's Magnum Opus.  I figured it was a graphic novel.  I don't have 10,000 years of life to read all the books I'd like to, so I read graphic novels.  I had never read Frankenstein and was happy to get this and see all the art.  I was taken aback first by the beautiful book and the condition and quality it was in.  Then I was bummed while thumming through it to see it wasn't a graphic novel but the actual novel, illustrated.  I set upon reading it and was blown away.  It's one of the best books I've ever read. The large pages with double spaced paragraph's make for an easy and pleasurable read.  What a tactical failure turned strategic success for me!  It's so much better than all the movies I've ever seen. Also, Kings intro is kind of mundane as one reader had indicated but it was the original intro done for the first pub years and years ago.  If you miss out on this you will be bummed and it's a bargain at 30 bucks.
B000Q9ISSQ|4|Consistently entertaining, this book added insight into my recent trip to Australia.  Delightful writing.
B00AJLHUYO|5|Sinister is a horror movie about fear. Now while that sounds redundant it actually isn't. The fear is a different one then you might be used to. It's the fear of fading into obscurity, and the lengths someone will go to, to avoid this. The film shows a defiance of logic, to prevent the fade. Peppered throughout the film, are suspenseful moments, and some quirky characters. The movie is wonderfully shot, and lit. At times you will be peering into the darkness to see if you can make out the antagonist. The Super 8 footage looks awesome as well. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. If you have to see a horror movie in theaters go see this! It's an ORIGINAL movie! And at the end of the day isn't that better than seeing the 4th film in a franchise where someone will inevitably stand over someones bed? I tried to be spoiler free. After a long time a really good horror movie has arrived. Sinister was smart, unpredictable and scary. It also the right mix of gore and supernatural thrills. The story is very well developed and Ethan Hawke's performance as an self absorbed writer was praise worthy. All in all an enjoyable treat for horror movie buffs.<br />IS GREAT in PQ & AQ Awesome sharp lQQking blu-ray & Must to own for blu-ray/horror collector. real good flick & acted! A
B004J4WLB4|5|I loved this book!  I would read it again and again and recommend it readily to all my friends .
B00005K3OT|1|Heavy-handed dreck about a woman who brings &quot;enlightenment&quot; (through libertine ideas and the metaphor of confections) to the supposedly close-minded rubes of a small French village. I watched it for the scenery, but even that small hope went largely unsatisfied.<br />I suppose it's a wonderful little fable for those who were born in the 60's and got stuck in perpetual adolescence.

B0060CX8F6|4|Stunning animation and wonderful music with a bayou flair. Disney creates memorable characters in the retelling of the classic tale.
B001NFNFNU|5|As it started in 1928, this film did an excellent job of recreating an era reminiscent of our parents' and/or grandparents' time.  It was the good old days of model-T fords, switchboard operators, and steel wheel roller skates in a time when role models were structured, the air was purer, and life was sweeter.  Unfortunately, it was also a time before nation-wide Amber alerts, a time when shock treatment was standard for psychiatric patients, and when authority went basically unopposed.    This was the setting of Angelina Jolie's surroundings in what was a well-deserved academy award nominated performance of the real life Christine Collins, a woman whom the L.A. Police returned the wrong kidnapped son.  In spite of overwhelming evidence supporting Collins' objections, the chief of police insisted she was over-reacting from the traumatic experience of the kidnapping and had her committed to a mental hospital.  Better that than admitting the possibility that she was right and they were wrong.    As a single parent who was also a career woman, Christine Collins was ahead of her time.  So was the radical, but compassionate minister who fortunately was interested in her case.  Together they managed to release her and all the other wrongfully admitted patients who were also committed to the hospital by the power of police brutality.  They brought down the police force in court, giving the story an uplifting ending, leading the way for hope.      For the realistic portrayal of the times, the horror of the events, and the acting from Jolie down to her youngest co-stars, this is a classic portrayal of a true-life event.  Viewers could walk away wondering how much things have changed and how much they stayed the same.  There's still abuse of power and wrongfully accused and committed victims, but more importantly, there's still the possibility that a few strong and dedicated people standing up for what is right can still make a difference.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I cannot get enough of this awesome game...I find myself playing for hours, literally! All my friends play, too. So, we can all help each other. Sometimes I wake up with it on my lap... Gotta get back to crushing some candy! Enjoy it for yourself...
B00004X01U|5|this is Madonna's true return to dance music and her launching of a million cowboy hats and sound alike songs... all following the sound of this albums title track.<BR>Madonna's follow up to the steller Ray Of Light is Music. Music is a pop album that redefines pop, just like Madonna each time she releases a new record.<BR>\\"Music\\" is the lead track and the lead off single of this album and it's a brilliantly simple song with raw energy and a fun catchy beat.<BR>\\"Impressive Instant\\" would probably be considered the best track on this album, it's the most danceable and so darn fun.<BR>\\"I Deserve It\\" is a great ballad about love and loss and keeping what you have and going on... really wonderful.<BR>\\"Don't Tell Me\\" is one of the best songs on the album, a stripped song in the music and a funky country/pop vibe going on.<BR>\\"Gone\\" is another fantastic track about keeping faith and going on.<BR>Madonna has always done a good job on her records but with this one she did an exceddingly good job.

B00BSBUZPK|5|Just love this item.  Good music and behind the scenes video.  I would definitely order again.  If your an Eagles fan good music and video
B00OT39R3K|5|great deal
B00ACP3OOM|1|I was very excited about this product i swim regularly ( 3 days a week 90 mins) and the idea of a mp 3 player which i don't have to put in my ears was very appealing. Even though i have read the negative reviews i assumed they received faulty products since amazon was still selling it. Oh boy was i wrong. At start product functioned okay mid level sound (considering it underwater it wasn't bad), swapping of songs was nearly impossible without taking the mp 3 player out, but i didn't mind it since it worked. After one month of using it product malfunctioned the screen turned bright and then it died, its not responsive and could not hold any charge. I live overseas so sending the mp 3 player to repair is out of the question (due to transport cost and customs hassle) so basically you are throwing your hard earned cash to drain.
B00002Z88D|5|Metallica with the Michael Kamen and the Symphony has out done Metallica. This clever fusion will be remembered for years to come. The spectacular orchestration is complex and interesting. This is the best attempt of  merging the orchestra with rock. <br />I remember listening to Aerosmith's  &quot;Dream On&quot; backed by orchestra which was fabulous. After  Metallica's Nothing Else Matters on this CD with the orchestration, I can  say that the effect from Metallica and the Symphony is far superior.<br />This  superior sound comes because a great composition with great orchestration  makes a masterpiece. Metallica's composition ability is superior because  they are constantly pushing the envelope in Rock Music. The addition of the  orchestra is ingenious. This concert is more than a concert, it is a  journey into 2 explosive worlds. Rocking the world of Rock and  Classical<br />I think there should be more concerts like this. I would much  rather hear a clever fusion with orchestra symphony and rock band of Rock  and/or Classical Music over hearing a classical symphony or rock concert  independently.<br />I hope someday Metallica will agree to play Beethoven's  Fifth Symphony with Orchestra. This is what music is all about. Being  creative rather than hearing the same redundancy over and over again.<br />The  best performances include. Master of Puppets, Nothing Else Matters, No Leaf  Clover, Call of Ktulu, One, and For Whom the Bells Toll.<br />Even those who  have never heard of Metallica may also like this because Mr. Hatfield does  not screech as much. <br />I congratulate Metallica and Michael Kamen for  merging the 2 worlds of Rock and Classical. Now only if Metallica would  play Beethoven's Fifth with Michael Kamen that would be incredible. Rest  assure it will rock the classical world even though Beethoven would welcome  such an idea.<br />In fact if Beethoven, Mozart, Liszt and Hayden were alive  today they would be begging for Metallica to play their works with the  orchestra.<br />True Artisry is so rare in pure rock. In the 60s it was Led  Zepplin. In the 70's: Deep Purple. In the 80's: Van Halen. In the 90s it's  Metallica.
B0074QGGK6|5|I've loved this book since before it was a book, and only a blog post.  It's fantastic, and so helpful for someone like me, who loves all things art but doesn't really know what to do with that.  Thanks, Austin :)
B00ICF0OZQ|4|what a hoot!  this game is hilarious.  don't play it if you are hoping for a serious game of great strategy.  i mean, there are some decisions to be made, and there are ways to tip the odds in your favor.  however, anything can happen!  super fun.  lots of laughs.  quick and fun.  we are gamers and we own appox 100 games.  this one is a keeper for sure!
B004132HZS|5|Watch the actor who plays Sherlock, an Academy Award winner in the making and the actor who plays John, yes, they are on a first name basis is soon to play Bilboa Baggins in \\"the Hobbit\\".  The update to the 21st century makes it more fun.
B001EC3JME|2|I have a Fenix PD-32, which comes with its own holster.  However, it is one of those which require you to pass your belt through the holster so you cannot just clip it on and off whenever you wish.  So, I wanted to get one which I could put on without removing my belt!  This one looked good.  However, when I tried to put my flashlight in it, it was nearly impossible.  The holster is really stiff and the elastic is really tight.  Once I did get it in the holster, it was really, really hard to get out.<br />My flashlight is not a really big flashlight, but it's such a tight fit that this holster is basically useless to me.<br />On the plus side, the holster does seem sturdy, so if your flashlight will slide in and out, it should last.
B0069UV0LS|1|Why make movies like this?  I watched this with an open mind & sadly watched it until the end.  It is one of those movies that make you feel unclean.  I don't see the redeeming value of portraying these pathetic creatures.  You don't have to shove it in my face how awful life can be --  I see it in the news everyday.  Winner at Sundance film festival, really??  People surprise me all the time.  Yes the acting was good, cinematography good blah blah blah.  The first five minutes did hit me in the gut as I am sure it was meant to but after that I could feel no sympathy for the main character at all.  So watch at your own risk if you like to see animals getting hurt, women getting hurt, and children getting hurt.  As for me, I need to go take a shower and I don't even think that will help.
B002RI9MWA|4|I highly recommend The Reluctant Fundamentalist particularly BEFORE seeing the movie that has just been released.  It is an insightful and compelling almost &#34;exquisite&#34; read for what has been described as a psychological thriller; a mesmerising monologue by a young Pakistani named Changez and an unnamed American who are sitting at a table in a simple tearoom in Lahore Pakistan. It took a few pages before I realised I had been completely absorbed and this was sustained through to the last page.
B001HDYK6Y|5|Over the last 12+ years there has been a disturbing lack of music with any depth. Most albums released over this period either have a nagging sound of whinny dragged out lyrics or they sound like the same uninspired boring emo noise. This has been true across almost every genre of modern music. Luckily there are a small handful of exceptions but 90 percent of the albums released fit this mold.<br /><br />Perfect Symmetry by Keane is the perfect example of what an album in 2008/2009 should sound like. It has many of the elements of the sounds of the great 1980's while still sounding perfectly fresh and up to date. Great depth in their writing and song development with strong synth-pop elements. Unlike most albums of 2008/2009 that bore your ears after a few listens Perfect Symmetry seams to have additional depth each time I play it.<br /><br />Some have knocked this album because it differs from previous Keane releases but to my ear it simply sounds like they have found their full potential in Perfect Symmetry. There is much to be enjoyed in Keane's previous albums but this is their best album to date! Easily 5 stars.
B0001NBMBC|2|I have alot of respect for Corey, and other members of Slipknot. However, I think that this album should not have been made at all. I think that Corey should have called it quits with Slipknot and just stuck with the stone sour thing. I really like older Slipknot, but this isn't them, this is like stone sour and slipknot thrown in a blender with a pinch of John Mayer maybe. I don't understand why they would do this to the Slipknot name, they already get enough crap for being &quot;numetal&quot; (whatever). I think that Corey and the boys wrote some great melodies but they are too catchy for Slpipknot, and they didn't even try with the more heavy parts. It's almost like just a bland filler until the ultra-catchy chorus. I recommend the new killswitch engage if you want a good CD.....Goodbye forever slipknot
B00LD1OHE0|5|Colleen Hoover is one of my top five authors. I have read most of her books and love everyone of them. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that wants to read about loving someone so passionately.
B006ZZANFG|5|I love it.
B006LSZECO|2|This book is a serious waste of time. I did feel compelled to finish the book but I started skimming through the end just to see if the plot wrapped up in an interesting way. It didn't. I seriously couldn't believe how bad and contrived the ending was. The author clearly ran out of ideas and just decided to leave it go. Don't bother, you won't be satisfied.
B001BWYZWA|5|This is one of the most inspirational sports movies I've ever seen. The BluRay version is amazing. This is a must for any true sports fan!
B0000AKCLS|5|What a terrific addition to the growing amount of music produced by this fabulous artist. Be sure to add this album to your collection. I find that this album is frequently played in my home and I think you will find yourself doing the same!
B004YM6JI2|5|Greta delivery time! Story line is getting better and better. Love all the characters and the drama!<br />Can't break away from it because I want to see what happens next!!
B00B4FU6KE|4|I loved the writing style and the story was thought-provoking. A good book for discussion. I did think the second half dragged a bit and there were threads that repeated too often.
B00030EIY6|5|Everyone in the orchestra and the audience knew this would be the last time they would see Carlos Kleiber conduct this celebration.  There was an underlying sense of sadness during the performance as well as great joy.  Gerhard Hetzle (concertmaster) was terrific.  I prefer the '89 concert because I like the musical choices better and I think Kleiber was in better health but all in all, anytime you have a chance to hear and see Carlos Kleiber you should!  The orchestra plays superbly for him and, of course, his interpretations are squeaky clean.

B00008OLIO|5|\\"Raw, powerful, gritty\\" are the adjectives most of the other reviewers are using, and with good reason. This is the straight up real deal.     The lyrics to \\"Live Wire\\" are what Tipper Gore read on the floor of the US house of reps, her hands and voice shaking, when she was trying to promote censorship of Rock. (\\"I'll either break her face or take down her legs...\\")    Unfortunately, MC got worse instead of better.  'Shout @ Devil' was a very good follow up, but from there on out, they were in large part pandering to the crowd instead of screaming from the heart.
014132161X|5|This is such a great story!  I loved reading it along with my kids.  Although the language is a bit dated, the plot is so compelling that kids easily figure out what's going on and can follow the story.  After we finished this one, we immediately ordered the next two.
B002MQYOFW|5|The book is amazing the author has a wild unique imagination I highly recommend the book to readers who have not let read it.
B00005OAIE|5|John Mayer is absolutely my favorite artist. <BR>(I also listen to Dispatch, Jack Johnson, Ani Difranco, etc.) <br />Although this CD doesn't do his talent justice, it is a beautiful collection of songs.<br />The lyrics are warming and romantic --- His voice is sexy and smooth --- the songs are catchy and beautiful --- nice guitar and band arrangements. It's hard for me to even choose a favorite song because I've grown to love them all so much --- <br />Give this guy a chance, if you haven't already. it might not be your genre of music but listen and see what you think :) Then go see him in concert and he might just surprise you --- he's amazing.<br />If you don't fall in love with the CD (shame on you!) try downloading some live versions of the songs ------  they make me melt :)
B00PSLQGX6|5|This was a great series and my husband and I enjoyed this series.<br />It was nice to be able to watch it without commercials.
B002BCNK1Q|5|Gran Torino knocks the viewer off their seat with a hard hitting story that is laced with thumping humour and heartbreaking inspiration. Starring Clint Eastwood, it is the experience of personal loss for all the lead characters in this film, which is a building block for their own greater development. The movie highlights many troubling social dynamics, often with an at times cranky old man's well aimed boot and good heart.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B0013ND30M|5|One of my very favorite cartoon stories, Tchaikovsky-based music a huge bonus! See Malificent as her magnificently evil self, not as she was recently reimagined. If your child is extra sensitive to bad guys fighting good guys, you might want to prescreen and fast forward through some sections.
B000FCKGPC|4|With everything and all of the surprises that took place in book #3, I guess the author had to give his readers a breather?  He achieves this slight break in the action in book #4.  So, compared to book #3, this one is very good but not great.
B001NLKXK2|5|This is not a beautifully written book, and some of the dialogue feels stilted, but it is GRIPPING.  You will not stop thinking about it after you are done. I certainly haven't.
B00005N6RU|1|Unfortunately I was not able to watch the movie due to some irregular situtations in regard to the dvd.  It wouldn't play and I'm not entirely sure that the seller is cooperating.
B005HSL626|5|it is a pass the time game. Watch for bombs. Keep trying for the best.. Hack  your way.. Watch where your hands are.
B006LSZECO|3|I felt like there should have been a better solution than that.  The characters were too strong for such a wimpy ending
B00L9B7IKE|2|So so. Predictable
B004UB9SKS|5|works as I thought it would except i wish the playback was a little slower but I know that they speak real fast in  the countries I visit
6304493711|4|Not listed in the main list of actors, this is John Hannah's first film.  I love the supporting actors more than the main two.  Highlight includes John Hannah doing a poetry reading of Auden at the funeral, very touching and moving.
0307272702|4|Well documented and convincing.  The approach is working for me.  I have lost 15+ lbs. and feel much better.  It is reasonably easy to follow.
B00DL48CN4|5|A fabulous and truly enjoyable movie about an historical event.
B00009RAJH|5|I only bought this to get the &#34;single version&#34; of Say You Love Me&#34; with all the heavy guitar. Loved it.
076781326X|2|THIS MOVIE WAS ALRIGHT, BUT I WAS EXPECTING THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL MOVIE, AND IT WAS NOT. IF YOU WANT<br />A SHORT VERSION, THIS WOULD BE FOR YOU.
B00AG4NSY0|3|The first was fun and fresh, the second a little less so. Now this one continues the downward trend, as too many of these tracks sound like they could have came from any other Christmas disc. The choice of songs is actually a decent mix, but none really stand out. Slightly above average are the big and somewhat jazzy `White Christmas'; and `Jingle Bell Rock' is enthusiastic, but not particularly memorable.  Not sure how it plays on TV, but if they can't keep up for Christmas, I'm wondering if the whole Glee thing has already begun to fade.
B000002AS3|5|remember what it was like when it all just began??  if you wasnt in england when this album came out you probably will never understand what this band really meant and really did.now they seem to be dead and gone its time this album saw the light of day again.its funny how things seem different the morning after isnt it???  lets not forget.
B00BAXFAJC|3|I read this on my Kindle but wished I had a hard copy book so that I could go back and forth to remember who said what, when! Not really sure even after reading the entire book, who was responsible.
B00594XOZU|5|Kik is basically made to text to people, but you can share youtube videos, share drawing you drew, share google pictilures, and lots of more stuff! Once I found kik I knew it was just right for me 100%, no changes! It does include kik user, password, and email as well! Hope I helped!
B008AK8FHM|5|Saw this on a 60 minutes show and bought the book.  Am REALLY enjoying it so far!  A nice dow to earth writing style.
B00O0MBHR4|5|I highly recommend this! Beautiful music! It's Aretha, can't go wrong getting her tunes!
B00004S367|5|Five stars!!<br /><br />Because this album,  by Stevie,  is that good.
B0063IH60K|4|My husband enjoys playing this game when he has nothing else to do. The colors are bright and we like being able to choose between three card deals or single. Fun game to pass the time.
0679745203|2|I mean this book was a tad boring:/. I really loved the parts set in tuscany but the whole desert chapters werent easy to bear.
B00B5HQLMI|5|One of the best Bond movies of all time. This is an intense and wonderfully exciting film that keeps you on the edge.....
B005IQZB14|4|An incredible story of a young woman coming to grips with her life and the lessons that were learned during the process of backpacking 1100 miles on the PCT. I had to google Cheryl after reading the first few chapters of this book just because I wanted to see the face of someone that had lived such a crazy and wild life. Needless to say I was surprised by the picture that Google brought up of Cheryl but also by the openness of the story of her life. I loved this book and it kept me totally enthralled till the end.
0143120581|4|This is an entertaining read.<br /><br />As someone of Asian background however, I will add one key note that deflates most of the reality of the book.<br /><br />The simple unstated fact that renders her 'tigerness' totally fake in true Asian culture of her generation is that typical parents in her generation (esp ones like mine who were born in Asia) beat their kids.<br /><br />Her 'rebellious' younger girl who she has so many stories of battles with mom she has to tell about, in reality would never, ever happen in a true tiger Asian household. Even one iota of rebelliousness would instantly get beaten out of you, even at age 5.<br /><br />So for all the Western folks who read with both horror and amusement at her anecdotes, and revel in the independence and spirit of her younger daughter, keep in mind that it's all fake compared to a true Tiger asian parent, who would simply beat their children into getting their way. Yes, it theoretically should put you into child protective services here in the USA, but my parents grew up in Asia in a world were this was routine practice, even in the public schools. Rebelliousness was not met with frustrated negotiations - let a parent figure feel even an iota of rebelliousness from you, and you'd pay the consequences - physically, and repeatedly. Not every parent did this, but enough did that it was absolutely NOT frowned upon, and in fact, my parents considered it poor parenting to NOT do that to your kids if they were misbehaving.<br /><br />I strongly disapprove of such parenting styles and I clearly recognize the shortcomings and limitations of such bullying, but for the older generation, and especially the high-achieving immigrant parents Chua seems to be trying to sterotype, this would be the true Tiger mother reality.<br /><br />So while the book is definitely entertainingly written, to someone who has actually lived the life and walked the walk of someone with a true immigrant tiger asian parent, her story is a complete parody of the much harsher reality that Asian kids in my generation had to endure when their parents decided to be high-achieving parents.
B001GZ6QEC|5|awesome movie
B009LGO88E|5|Nice, but adds bulk so if you do not like that then might be a difficult purchase. The titles exclusive with this add on do get considerably better though, in my opinion. I like the added heft to be honest
B005U9REU0|5|Favorite movie of all time! I watch Labyrinth at least twice a year. My nephews (4 & 5) are still too scared of the goblins, though :(
B008JFUOWM|5|Have all fast movies. Been a fan since they started. Paul is my favorite and will always be. I am not sure how the others will turn out without him, but I know they will do their best to honor Paul. This one is a must see! The best of the series so far.
B00DUGCLY4|4|It makes you think, tho only problem I have is it only gives you one coin per solve and hints are 15 a pop. They should give you more coins. But other than that it is a great game!!
B0010V4TZU|5|Just damn good music.
B0054JZC6E|5|great experience to the people who wants to play in each game with a challenge to get the next game.
B007T99ENE|5|Another good story from Ian McEwan.  Straight forward writing, good twist at the end.  Imperfect, relatable characters.  Trademark mixture of misunderstandings and human failings.  Very good.
B00COGY2P2|5|Good escape from the reality of my day. Loved the cowboy justice ending and the characters in the story. I'll watch this one again.
B0000028RR|5|part black sabbath, part led zep, part punk fury, part hardcore and part public enemy, this album is diverse and amazing.  tom morello is such an exquisite guitar player.  his manipulation of the guitar re-invents the instrument and its sound.  (eddie van halen eat your heart out)  he is tasty and brilliant.  he strums, his guitar screams,  he plays his guitar at times like a DJ sctraching.   <BR>     the rhythm section is incredible.  Y.Tim K on bass and Brad on drums dropping the dope beats and funking it up like old school funk meets new age hip hop.  Front and center is the eye of this hurricane.  Zach De La Rocha.  (his lack of presence in music in 2003 is felt very hard)  he is intense, intelligent, creative, angry, focused and exploding.  this is, undeniably, the best rock rap band ever.  and this album from &quot;bombtrack&quot; at the begginning (which will blow you out of your seat) to the feedback drenced &quot;Freedom&quot; to close , unimpechably, one of the best hard rock records ever made.    <BR>    each member is ingenious in their own way.  tom is the new guitar master as zach is a hand grenade always exploding.  in the background but by no means are they taking a backseat is the rhythm section.  brad on drums is amazing.  simple, powerful and down to the beat (or point) Tim is such an amazing bass player.  different, inventive and oddly familiar.  <BR>   no one member is central.  it is the combining of the four memebers of RATM that make the group so dynamic and extraordinary.  their demise is tragic
6305949980|2|Long had I dreaded the day when I would be forced to sit down and watch \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\".  Not because I thought it would be horrible - in fact, I expected it to be quite good.  I've always loved Tim Burton, and the premise sounded great.  So this Christmas, when my brother received it for a Christmas present, I finally sat myself down and watched it. <br /> <br />The storyline is great: Jack Skellington, Halloweentown's spookiest spook, is getting sick of Halloween.  One day, he stumbles across a door which leads him into Christmastown - and immediately, Jack is entranced by this jolly world in which all is good all the time.  And so Jack decides to bring Christmas to Halloweentown. <br /> <br />I can sum up my thoughts about the film in two sentences, as sang by the fabulous Danny Elfman: \\"What's this?  What's this?\\"  This film is always rated very highly, but I found it to be extremely bizarre, creepy, and even a little repulsive.  I wouldn't dream of showing it to my kids, with the eerie creatures and lines such as \\"Kidnap Santa, chop him into bits\\".  The animation was fantastic, but I thought the rest of the film was weak.  There is, however, one great song, \\"What's This?\\". <br /> <br />While I can understand people enjoying this film, I just couldn't.  It's too bizarre, grim, and perhaps even grotesque for my tastes.  I suppose you'll just have to try it for yourself.
0061537969|2|Protagonist is happy.  Protagonist loses happiness.  Protagonist finds happiness again.  The (apparently Hindu) dog describes it all with his understandably weak character development skills.
B00LTI5A70|5|Great basic case to keep your Kindle protected and to give it a nice feel to hold while reading. The straps on the corners really hold the Kindle securely and it doesn't move around at all like I thought it might.<br /><br />For those of you who were confused like I was about if the case would fit your model, I will tell you I have the 7th generation kindle and it is perfect for it so it is not just for the paperwhite or fire.
B00DJFIMW6|5|A fun game. The family rearlly enjoys it or at least the ones that enjoy playing games. I find myself playing it tpo much. Having friend challenge is really fun also.
1594488843|4|\\"Drive\\" is a very interesting read--a thought-provoking, evidence-based analysis of the factors that motivate knowledge workers and a prescriptive guide for moving to a new motivational model. I also appreciated the bibliography.      While \\"A Whole Naw Mind\\" examines the attributes of knowledge workers, \\"Drive\\" examines these peoples' motivations and how to most effectively manage them. It also helps validate and provides many new areas of discussion for my blog, which examines the the types of jobs and career paths that will be most sustainable in a global workforce and how to prepare for these jobs ([...] ).     The book provides validation to those of us who have managed our careers (and ideally our employees) in accordance with Mazlow's self-actualization principles. Hopefully it will prove as persuasive to some managers and employees that are currently stuck in a Motivation 2.0 mindset.     Tom Kucharvy  Beyond IT, Inc.
B001L5YW9I|5|One of the best movies ever made.  Definitely one of my Top Ten of all time.  One of Daniel<br />Day Lewis' best performances.
B0010ZR160|5|Two young private detectives are hired to take a closer look at the mysterious disappearance of a little girl and soon discover that nothing is what it seems. Ultimately, they will have to risk everything their relationship, their sanity, and even their lives to find a little girl-lost. This movie has strong scenes and compelling performances and also a fascinating moral dilemma within the context of the abduction of a 4-year-old child. This movie is powerful stuff.
B00NWDP6P6|3|good
B00U7VDC7A|4|Pretty fun overall, though it can be hard to find what your looking for to complete each quest.
B009XIXVU6|5|I could actually feel every feeling, see each scene, and know what it was like to live these lives. Hosseini is an absolute master. A brilliant, stunningly heart-wrenching story, like reading poetry, listening to music, & looking at a most beautiful painting all at once. I'm very sad it's over ~ I wish it could go on & on.

B0000DYJM6|4|There's only a few bands around who's b-sides are as good as their a-sides. &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; is one of those bands. This is so sweet. It collects many of the songs that didn't make the cut for each album, stray singles, compilation tracks, and 11 previously unreleased cuts. 30 in all. The only well known songs here are &quot;Last Kiss&quot; and &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;. It's kind of like a best of collection, but of unknown songs. There are things missing, like &quot;Crazy Mary&quot;, &quot;Soldier Of Love&quot;, and anything from &quot;Singles&quot;, or &quot;Merkinball&quot;. I'm sure a fanatic could dig up even more. But of what's here, it's 2 cd's of unheard greatness, essential for the real fan. Now where's that &quot;Soundgarden&quot; b-sides?
B00BD99JMW|5|I loved it ties up a lot. Great series and soon to be great movies. By far one of my favorite series
B007LB5MF4|5|I loved it! Worth. The money. I will be buying the other two and cannot wait for the rest to come out.
0855329483|5|I was wanting to learn ribbon embroidery and this book was exactly what I was looking for.  Lots of information along with excellently  written and photographed directions.  I'm really pleased with this purchase.
B00M4BJ3KG|4|Good game
B00ILHW6AG|3|I liked the story, but it dragged on a little compared to some of Stephen King's other novels.
B008TRUDAS|5|One of the reasons I give young adult a chance. It moves you in so many ways. It breaks your heart. But it's the kind you wouldn't mind.
1781169314|5|AOK
B004VFYPTW|5|great
B003R17BV0|5|Great real life story. I'd reccomend it to any sports lover. I believe that people that don't like sports would like this movie too.
B00JJH254O|3|The movie was entertaining, however I don't think the additions to the original story add anything, and in truth I feel take away from the story.  It is obvious that Peter Jackson wants to make the Hobbit and epic prequel to the Lord of the Rings, but this takes away from the story of a quest to face a dragon and reclaim the lonely mountain.  It also looks as if they are focusing more on great visuals and less on story and characters.<br /> There is also a problem with chronology, Gandalf's fight with Sauron, doesn't make any sense, in the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring, Sauron return is in whispers and suspicions, the 9 riders appearance brings confirmation, but there are many who are in doubt and unaware.  The Hobbit takes place decades before the fellowship begins, Bilbo is celebrating his 111 birthday.  It is a little bit hard to understand Gandalf waiting all that time if he seen Sauron with his own eyes.  Likewise, if the 9 riders are out and about, how crazy is it to leave the ring in Bilbo's possession for all that time unprotected?  And why wait to destroy the ring? it would have been a lot easier to do before Sauron raise a million orc army to surround mount doom.  Visually, I liked the scenes with Gandalf fighting the darkness, but story wise it doesn't match up with the Lord of the Rings.<br />I could go on about a number of other additions, and how they distract from the original story, but suffice it to say, I don't think they are necessary.  I think Peter Jackson would have been better off, to do the Hobbit as a single story, and then if he wanted to write a tale of what happen in the in between time before the Lord of the rings, it would be better.  He could give us tales of Legolas, Journeys of Gandalf investigating Sauron, and even the dwarves opening the mines of Moria, along with any other additional stuff and characters and none of it taking away from original source work of the Hobbit or Lord of the rings.
B008673ZAQ|3|It was a good second half always keeping me on my toes! It j/ needed something........more!<br />Can't wait for book 3!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5|Had heard about this but couldn't get it at the library unless I wanted to wait endlessly.  Therefore, i got it and it was indeed a good mystery with characters who need slapping badly.
630469797X|5|Director George Romero delivers a horror masterpiece with DAWN OF THE DEAD.  Usually sequels lack what their predecessors possess, but this one goes NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD one better. Besides being the best movie in  the zombie movie genre, perhaps the greatest thing about this film is  make-up artist Tom Savini's frighteningly realistic cosmetic effects.  The  amount of gore here is certainly not for the weak stomached.  Watch this  one with your eyes open and in a well lit room.
1594489505|4|Was good
B000003C2S|4|This is Deaths 3rd cd and while it is quite good, it hasnt aged as well as other releases (leprosy,ITP ect..). The lyrics are quite basic as i believe Chuck was trying to branch out a little here. Talking about subjects like Abortion, Preachers and degenerates. Not Satanic or ghoulish. but musically it is really good. Especially \\"Altering the Future\\",\\"Low Life\\" and the title track.<br /><br />He had a new backing band again on this release.<br /><br />Great for its time, but still not scratching the surface of what future Death cds would offer.
B001AQR3MQ|4|I wanted to get the bluray copy of this movie for a friend and we watched together a few weeks ago. Just a warning it doesn't come with subtitles/sound in spanish.
B00L9B7IKE|5|While similar to Gone Girl in format - I thought it kept the reader's attention much better.
B0081336FO|5|Excellent writing, acting, production values.  Great story lines and Benedict Cumberbach as Sherlock is phenomenal.  Martin Freeman as Watson is equally good.  Some of the plot lines are not credible, but if you can suspend your disbelief (which is easy because of the quality of the production).  My only regret is that there are more episodes because it is some of the best and most entertaining TV ever.  Highly recommend.
B002ZG994U|5|Much fun.
B004SKIPXW|5|great movie for 3d also
B000JMKNV0|3|Too far out.  Looking for an earlier book of his to see if this was only a supposed money maker because of earlier works.
B005COO1X6|4|Old fashioned fun horror. Only the kids are dumb enough to believe and survive. King at his best, lean, direct and smart. Always a useful commentary on the present. Keep writing.
B005CMGKTG|3|I've been a fan of the \\"Space Battleship Yamato\\" TV series called \\"Star Blazers\\" here in the United States back in 1978.  I've always said that it should be made into a live action movie and in 2010 they finally did it.  When I saw the theatrical trailer online, I said I've got ot see it.  I was hoping that it would be released to theaters here in the United States but that never happened.  That left seeing it on DVD as my last option.  When it finally came out in June of this year, the manufacturer produced DVDs without English subtitles.  That left me out in the cold.    Then I saw this copy called \\"Space Battleship Yamato - The final battle.\\"  I was suspicious but I ordered it anyway because it said it had English subtitles.    When I received it and played it, my suspicions were confirmed.  This copy is a bootleg version.  Here's what's wrong with it.  The movie was shot at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio but on this DVD it's streached to a 1.85:1 ratio.  The movie was recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 but this disc only has Dolby Surround.  Some of the subtitles are either wrong or came across as silly.    On the other hand, it was the best I could get at the time.    However, another company is making copies of this movie on DVD that are superior.  The movie is presented in its full 2.35:1 aspect ratio, it has Dolby Digital 5.1 sound along with the Japanese dialogue and the English subtitles are more accurate.    I bought the new copy and am very happy.  That makes this first copy obsolete and unnecessary.
B00BAXFECK|3|An interesting read, but too much &#34;thinking&#34; and being in the head of the main character. This would make a great movie.
B00MUCX6AW|4|Groundhog Day w lots of action!!
B004XVMCPI|5|This release has extended scenes that help make the movie more sense. For example, they explain the relationship between Stephen Chow's character and the female character much better.
B004EPYZOO|4|Cage is always an interesting performer but his nemesis, the Accountant [played by William Fichtner] pretty much owns every scene he's in - even when they finally confront each other.
6304698526|4|Bought this for my son the Mustang owner/fanatic, along with LeMans. He was too young to see these movies on the big screen and didn't know anything about them when the 2006 Mustang Bullitt Edition car came to the Auto Show. This is a great chase movie, classic McQueen.  Buy and watch both,  makes a very enjoyable movie night.
B005RUUUAI|5|I got hooked on this book when they reran every episode last summer!  Needless to say, I don't like some of my favorites getting killed off, but you just can't stop watching!  Great show!
B0058VW36U|5|this game is so cool i love it and my son loves it. i just wish it was free. but its fun
B00006IUL7|4|It is a nice follow-up installment after the unique psychological thriller - Memento. Chris Nolan can surely saved his seat in the mainstream with this good work and we do need this talent out of the at-times boring industry.<br />But in my opinion, it could still be more better. Chris Nolan should shed more lights on the impact of suffering from insomnia that affected Will Domer as in Memento did to Leonard Shelby's amnesia. In addition, the ending sequence could extend longer and look at the intensity between the three characters, whereby will be more satisfying.<br />ANY GOOD?<br />The chase cross the river is the best moment of the film, nicely crafted and shooted.<br />Robin Williams' soft acting earns him 5stars.<br />Al Pacino's sleepy eyes are absorbing, u can definitely feel his tiredness.
B0029LCJJS|5|the settings, the costumes, the actors, everything was perfect
B00I6JOD2S|5|This movie is fantastic, and everytime I watch it, I notice new, funny things in the background I didn't notice before.
B004SJ3AXI|5|Its awesome Game I Love It,, I recomend getting this game.. I am sooo glad that i got It. its very fun. I think everyone should get Angry Birds.
B003H4I4JU|4|Interesting take on the human condition and how we act and react to things strange to us. Ender is at once comforting and wise and devastatingly lonely and desperately seeking redemption for the sins of his youth. All of which were set before him by those he should have been able to trust.<br />All in all a really great read.
B00IRMTTPU|4|Good story well acted but in most ways predictable. Not the type of movie that I'd watch more than once, so IMO rent it but not buy it.
B00AREIAI8|5|its fun. I cant seem to stop. if like horses then u should get this app. I cant have a horse so this is the closets to taking carat of one.
B009LMTDL0|5|This book is not a self help book, it is an inspirational book that has aided me in making some changes in my career and my personal life. Truly  well written.
B00CNQ7HAU|3|It was a pretty average Grisham book.that was very easy to figure the ending. it was enjoyable to read as usual..
B0054SMID0|1|Seriously flawed movie with mediocre plot, no character development, really bad performances (you almost think that the actors are going to burst out laughing while doing a serious scene), stereotyping, unnecessary characters (William H Macy, Kate Mulligan, John Leguizamo, Marisa Tomei, Frances Fisher, et al)  Jeez people! Is this what we've come down to? Avoid it.
1401322786|4|Time. We all use and abuse it, and it is the topic of conversation everywhere. In his new book, Mitch Albom follows three distinct people in their search for more time.<br /><br />Dor is a man with principles. When he refuses to work on the tower to the heavens, he and his wife leave their family to keep them safe. But as his wife lays dying, Dor runs for the tower. What happens next determines the  beginnings of \\"Father Time.\\" Victor Delamonte has vast wealth, but finds it can neither buy happiness or health. He makes some choices about his remaining time without telling his wife. He wants more time. Sarah Lemon is a teenager who doesn't fit in. She wants time to speed up, but her choices lead her to greater difficulties. What would happen if these three met? Mitch Albom explores that question and what the results would be, encouraging the reader to be careful what they wish for.<br /><br />This is a powerful book about time and how we use it. I enjoyed the characters, and while I didn't like the stories being interrupted by each other, it all made sense in the end. Time - we need to spend more of it loving others and enjoying what God has given us.
B0063GORYU|2|Too difficult to play
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great
B00007KWHG|5|Great album.  I love being able to understand every word of the songs something that is missing from today's music.<br />I would highly recommend it for any one who loved this era and music.
B00FAX6XQC|1|You can't track an animal. Ex. It may call for you to do a heart shot, even if you hit it right in the heart, but you didn't upgrade your gun by adding attachments that really add no power to a real gun, the deer runs of. That's fine it happens but you should be able to track the animal. That's how it works. The energy part and upgrade parts of this game ruined it.
B0073QNIH6|4|Jaw barely opens and is stiff.  I thought the jaw thing would be a gimmick but he try's to use.  A lot. The coloring and detail is nice and it balances well on two feet.  No easy trick
B00HDMMISA|4|Fun read that deals with serious issues.  I must read more Liane Moriarty.
B00881VLCE|3|Fun little time waster. Probably not something I will play often, so I have removed ot from my Kindle. Thanks
B000FBJFSC|5|This book really paints a picture of the hardships the Irish people went thru. It is hard to believe that some of them lived with the food or lack of food they had. Makes you apreciate your life as it is. A lot of the book was sad but very true.
B003O86FMW|4|I enjoyed this book.  I'm a Twilight fan, and was expecting it to be a little different than it was.  It honestly was a bit more graphic than I thought it would be.  I can see if you like Twilight than you'd like these books.
B00GDNC00Q|5|Very good movie.  Not face paced and moves a little slow, but it pulls you in and and you're very involved.
B00KK0PICK|5|This is literally my first Amazon review, and I buy a lot from Amazon! This is a one of the most life changing books I have ever read. I have read countless organizing books & blogs & articles, but my whole philosophy on organizing has changed forever because of Marie Kondo's advice. I seriously wish I could buy it for every member of my family and all my friends.
B00005JMJ4|1|I am a huge fan of Bill Murray and this was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen.  After all the awards that this movie won I thought it would be worth watching.  I could not have been more wrong.  I actually watched the whole movie but that was only because I thought that at any time the movie would start to make sense - it does not happen!  Do not waste your money like I did.  If you really want to see this movie, I suggest renting it.  I just wish I could take mine back to the store for a full refund!
B000L53D4O|5|Baby loves it.
B00003CXAA|5|perfect and fast shipping item arrived in a very good condition
B00FAPF5U0|5|I have a love/hate relationship with this game. It is a great way to pass the time. Definitely would recommend you try it.
B00BHMETKC|4|Although not totally accurate about a secret Jimmy Carter approved rescue, it does capture your attention and makes you think. Again, worth watching no matter the movie awards status.
B00003CXI1|3|Have you read the book \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\"?  If you have then you know the entire plot of this movie-- if you haven't-- here's a brief synopsis:  A young boy named Harry Potter is an orphan and lives with his only family-- his horrible Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley.  His life with these people is awful-- they treat him like a \\"dog that rolled in something smelly\\" (to quote the novel) and make him sleep in the cupboard under the stairs.  One day Harry receives a mysterious letter but his Uncle snatches it away and destroys it before Harry can read it.  Soon, more and more letters come and Uncle Vernon starts to go mad-- he uproots the family to get away from the thousands of letters addressed to Harry.   <br />      The next night a giant man barges in on the family and delivers a letter to Harry (one of the same that plagued Uncle Vernon)-- it's his acceptance letter to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Harry is a wizard!  The rest of the story involves Harry's first year of learning magic, making friends, playing Quidditch (like soccer on broomsticks) and finding out more and more about his past and his parents-- apparently he's famous in the world of magic!<br />      Ok, it's a great story and the novels have captured the imaginations of children and adults alike.  The Harry Potter books are a phenomenon and the movie has been greatly anticipated.  Fans will not be displeased with the film when it comes to the story line-- director Chris Columbus stayed true to the book in most respects (many small details are left out and some events have been altered just a little in order to help move the plot along better).  The film was two and a half hours long, if all the little details had been left in the film, who knows how much longer it would have been.<br />      Now, the only thing that might disappoint those who are hard to please (like me) are the special effects.  The movie is about wizardry and magic, yet there areonly a few scenes in which anything magical happens.  It would have been nice to see more magical things, especially in the class rooms (hardly any scenes about that at all-- which really disappointed me).  The special effects that were there, some were fine, some were good, and others were laughable.  Ever see \\"The Mummy Returns\\"?  Remember the end with the Scorpion King animation?  Some of the animations were that bad....but not all of them.<br />     So, do I recommend this film?  Sure.  It was fun and it's a good story-- obviously, or else the book wouldn't have been a hit in the first place.  It is a little long...2 1/2 hours will do a number on your rear, make sure you've got a comfy chair!  If you haven't read the books and you enjoy films in the genre of fantasy then you will like Harry Potter.  If you did read the books, you'll be happy that nothing important was left out and nothing was bastardized-- (think \\"Circle of Friends\\").  You'll enjoy it I'm sure....I'm not sure if you'll love it....but you'll enjoy it.  I dunno, maybe I should watch it again....maybe I'll end up loving it.  But right now, when someone asks me I say \\"Ehhhh...it was good I guess\\".  Take it for what you will.
B000H305U0|5|Thanx
030759565X|5|Love the stories and the recipes! They are inventive yet practical.  Very attractively designed.  I did not want this book to end!
B00FRQ32N4|5|Good graphics lots of fun. Level up your robot and you can log into facebook to get free robots and other stuff. OH and I forgot you have to go on multiplayer mode.
B00BAXFECK|3|I really like parts of this book but it didn't hook me the entire way so it took me longer to read than a typical novel, Not quite sure I get all the hype...
B0001UL7RY|3|I was suggested to give this album a listen, despite my extreme dislike for Lavigne's personality, fakeness/wannabe-attitude, and overall simple-minded lyrics.  I have quite an eclectic taste for music, and anything other than Celtic music (Lnasa, Altan, Clannad, Solas, Loreena McKennitt, Capercaillie, etc...), or genuinely talented/pioneering musicians (Blue Man Group, Rush, Linkin Park, October Project), usually only consists of a single song or two I happen to like by any one pop artist (Alanis Morissette, Godhead, Love Spit Love's remake of \\"How Soon Is Now?\\", Tears for Fears, Def Leppard, Poe, Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow, ...).    Anyway, now that you have some understanding of what I like, I can state from my own point of view that I think \\"Under My Skin\\" is generally mediocre, though better and slightly more matured than Avril's debut \\"Let Go\\".  But I WAS absolutely SHOCKED and DUMBFOUNDED that I DID like one of HER songs: \\"Nobody's Home\\".  I found the only reason I enjoy this song is because it DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AVRIL LAVIGNE.  I first heard the song in 24h Fitness one day and she sounds more like a cross between ELIZA CARTHY (from whom I DO like her music and voice) and the already-obvious ALANIS MORISSETTE (I like her voice too sometimes, but only a few of her songs).  And, as others have already mentioned, she doesn't really do a whole lot of work anyway: Chantal Kreviazuk wrote the lyrics, she doesn't actually play the guitar (though that's an old rumour; maybe she's learned in the last two years), and her voice is largely synthetically corrected in the studio.    To summarize, it's more like Alanis Morissette wrote and performed the song, and Eliza Carthy sang and helped with orchestration.  That's all...  :o)
B001AVCFJM|1|Loved the movie but the DVD skipped all over when played.  Double checked on different player and still did the same thing.  But Amazon's easy return policy makes the return process a snap and I will definitely reorder from Amazon again.
B009UX2YAC|3|its super fun but it wont let me access the store to buy powers or characters! what's the point of playing it if u cant buy anything with the coins u earn?
B004LWZW8S|5|I'm really into Greek mythology....this movie was done well. Henry Cavill is some serious eye candy and a good actor!
B003477DVK|4|Cute and fun family movie. My two daughters -13 & 11 years old- loved it! Skip reminded us everything about unconditional love :-)
B002I0J5FG|5|excellent Product
B00I164DSK|5|Very good album. You will not have to skip any tracks on this one. You can play it from beginning to end.
0307341577|4|It's a sad story. That's not a spoiler, as you'll discover in the very beginning. Sad mixed with horror, but one could say &#34;beliavable&#34;. The characters are very well developed. You even get mad at most of them most of the time, but it's a compelling reading, extremely well done and you just can't stop until you reach the end.
B007PTJOV0|5|This game is addictive amazingly fun!  One of my favorite games ever is Super Mario Bros and this reminds me soooooooooooo much of it! I definately reccomend this game for Mario Bros fans.
B00AFEY354|5|This film has the perfect blend of humor and drama that make up the high school experience. It will remind you of your high school days as the story takes you along this unforgettable ride.
B005MLOKXA|5|Awesome TV show!
0780622642|1|WOW, was this a stinky movie!  This is what you call all special effects and no intelligence, plot, humor, or sense.  There was nothing in this movie to make me cry out, &quot;I'M A CHANGED MAN!&quot; after seeing it.  It's not even fun to make fun of.  It's just a total waste of time that you could use to do much better things.  Go bake a pie for your crazy neighbor.  Or go reunite with your long, lost father-in-law who bit your ear off when you accidentally spilled punch on his ultra-tight t-shirt.  What a horrible film.  Horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible!
0142403873|5|My little guy loves this book so much! He is ten months old and smiles and gets excited when we take it out and laughs throughout it. We read this to him multiple times a day...I can recite it word of word from memory and I'm sure he will be able to someday too.
B0038Z5SEW|5|I bought this movie to go with my mom's Sony BDP-S3100 Blu-Ray Player because this is one of her top favorite movies of all time and I wanted her to see what they looked like on HD verses the standard DVD.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Excellent read if you like sci-fi and/or survival novels.
B000148KK2|2|This CD is a let down to core fans of Diana Krall. She has walked away from her listener base in favor of an exploratory concept in music. Too bad she has left her jazz standard abilities on the sidelines for music to satisy her intellectual curiosity. It's not like they ran out of standards for her to perform for the next 20 years. Bottom line, stick to your knitting, Diana, and dont walk away from the listeners that helped make you.
B00F880BWG|1|If the rest of the series keeps heading in this direction, it will mean a short-lived run for walking dead.
1439177783|5|I'm so happy Portia de Rossi wrote this book. It's absolutely amazing! Beautifully written, very personal, and it's nice to know someone else is as crazy about their eating disorder as I am. Thank you for sharing your life with us!
B0000A36J5|5|I have to say that Peter Jackson is an artisitc genius and the care that he has used in attempting to transform the greatest books of all time into excellent movies.  Everyone knows that when a book goes Hollywood not everything can be transfered word for word, but Jackson manages to capture the heart of the books performing phenomenally.  Not only are the special effects above par, but they are blended smoothly with exceptional acting and breath taking scenery.  An exceptional movie that raises the bar for Hollywood
B008JFUOWM|5|Still entertaining even as the 6th episode unfolds you get caught up as if watching for the first time..  Fast action and great cast as usual.
0393035158|3|Author Sam Harris is a philosopher and a religious critic who feels that belief in a higher being and the whole notion of organized religion is detrimental to the good of society. He feels we would be better off with no religion and he makes his case for the \\"End of Faith\\" in this book. Harris feels that religion is the root cause of much of the world's evil and that most of the fighting that takes place in the world would be gone if religion took an exit from society.<br /><br />Harris isn't too fond of any religion but he is most critical of Islam. To Harris, Islam poses a grave and immediate threat and he points to the attacks on September 11, 2001 and to the actual scripture of the Koran as proof of his opinion. Terrorism is a serious issue, and according to the book, Islam is not compatible with a free and rationally- functioning world. The book also attacks religious moderates, whom the author feels are nothing more than fundamentalists in the making, since most every religion has radical beliefs at its core.<br /><br />I can understand where the book is coming from in some instances. I can agree that fundamentalists of all faiths are a menace to society and I like the fact that the author chose to include actual quotations taken directly from the holy books of the world to prove his point. But I think his negativity toward religion in general is just as extreme as the devotedly religious people he so deplores. The book makes no effort at all to see the positive side of religion. It doesn't take into account the charitable acts, the positive ethics, and the sense of community that some religions bring to society. They are all dismissed as obstacles to human development at best, and perpetrators of terrorism at worst.<br /><br />Eliminating religion would not wipe out the force of evil. The book doesn't go quite this far in its discussion, but it comes very close. As much as these terrorists of recent years have strong allegiances to religion, there is no mention in the book of the fact that leaders like Stalin and Mao Tse- Tung were responsible for millions of deaths and were not religious in any way. I think the book gets a little carried away in this regard when it tries to pretend that evil will mostly disappear if religious faith was a thing of the past. Concentrated political power is just as large a threat- if not more so- than religious extremism.<br /><br />This book is written in a very intellectual way and it contains plenty of references to back its claims. I don't necessarily believe in everything this book preaches about religion and its supposed detrimental effects on society. But I do respect the author's point of view, and even though I disagree with some of his conclusions, I feel this is a good book to read by those who have an interest in philosophy and religion and who like to tackle controversial subjects.on in the book of the fact that leaders like Stalin and Mao Tse- Tung were responsible for millions of deaths and were not religious in any way.

B002361MLA|5|The book strengthened my belief in the teachings of Gautam Buddah and the practice of Vipassana.  It lucidly explained the Power of Now which I was struggling to understand having done Vipassana.<br />If I sincerely follow thru and live in the present , which I intend to do, I am certain I will achieve to live a wholesome life.
B0053O89K6|5|What is it this series has that almost everyone loves it?... House would say: &#34;Me&#34;. And he would be 100% right!!... Love this series, I have all the previous seasons and now I feel complete with this final season!!... 200% recommended!!
B00VOYP60K|3|Growing up for both parents and adult spoiled children
B001P06GX4|5|Easy instructions. It takes a couple of minutes to understand the game. Definitely great for all ages. For the original Blokus, I agree with others that the best way to play is with four players. Three or less..it can be done but with less fun.  Well worth it!
B003I55BIA|5|This is an amazingly perfect book!  The story of totally opposite types of cliques falling in love is beautiful  I immediately fell in love with Alex, and Brittany seems so surreal, and the way she cares for her sister is cool. I don't know of a teen that would care so much for a person like that.  At one point of the story I did cry I have to admit. Alex with is gang background is characterized good. Simone Elkeles is a really good writer. I would suggest this book and her other books to any teen and maybe older people.
B00ID4I0FM|1|The quality of the instant feed was acceptable. What was not acceptable was the utter atrocity my eyes and ears were subjected to. Production of that movie constitutes child abuse for all those involved in the making and viewing of that truly terrible, absolutely appalling, horrendously hideous example of an unnecessarily truncated and bastardized story. I'm so mad at that film I just got a perfect score on my SATs trying to describe the level of disgust I have for that &#34;movie&#34; or whatever it was. I'll stick to the books.
B00FATEJYE|5|Great graphics great game just takes a little bit to much space also great story and boss battles and great for kids 10+
B004J4WLB4|5|The Language of Flowers was interesting to read. The story was sad to think about abandonedy children in our present society, but presented a strong and strange character. Victoria was an abandoned child that sought a lovely family. Victoria was a wounded character that tried to distort her own happiness. All end well
B00CSR2J9I|3|This game is unique and pretty addicting.. I had a lot of fun playing it.. I think I played it for like an hour straight!  Definitely worth a download..
B0086700CM|5|This app is the best app created in my opinion. (: It is so addicting but fun! And if you have nothing to do, a great time passer! There is no doubt you shouldn't get Temple Run!
B00SH04286|5|Story, acting & cinema!
B00GVFJ54A|4|Great 70's sound track with a mixed bag of music.  Great for background music or for long car rides.
0671027344|5|read it and you will understand why to live life. Do as charlies does, read what charlie reads and listen to what he listens.  This is one of most magnificent pieces of art I have ever viewed.  The innocence and adulthood behaviors mix to form this genius idiotic character and it makes it a beautiful mess.
B00124DSR0|5|Classic. Chicago at it's best.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This game is awesome me and my cousin absolutely LOVE it!! It's amazing and we love it so much it AWESOME SAUCE!!!!
B00DPM7TIG|4|Nice writing style. Loved the two main characters  the book held my interest although it didn't quite go where I expected. The ending felt a bit flat but otherwise highly recommended
B0034DGPEU|4|the Kitchen House is  an historical fiction that takes place during the slave period.  The story is intriguing and takes unexpected twists and turns and very realistic.  If you enjoy reading about this period, you will not want to miss reading this novel.
B00HBQWGXK|5|Always love Jack Reacher!
B000HC2LI0|5|As good as the first time on TV.  This is a smart, funny tv series that ended far too soon.  Aaron Sorkin is the best writer for fast paced shows with smart humor and non-stop dialog.  From the first show of the first year, the cast has charisma and work well together.  As the seasons go on, you find yourself routing for this presidency and the West Wing people as if they are real.  This is one of the best TV series to ever aired and is worth watching over and over again.
B002SEQ92E|5|This is a great movie and I never get tired of watching it.  I had it on VHS and purchased it on DVD.  The picture was amazing.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|I found out if you go play survival in this great game, can a lot of coins the longer you survive. I recommend  that the first gun you buy is the best pistol because it has range, accuracy, and a fast fire rate.
B00DFFHUUA|5|Great movie
6304994540|5|This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  If you liked Raising Arizona and Fargo you will love this movie.  Sit back, have yourself a White Russian, and enjoy.
B004I2K4DY|5|This is a fantastic video with a surprise ending which I will not divulge, but trust me, it's fabulous.  If you're into Les Mis, you will love it!!
B00EUGYM04|1|Like any human, musicians get old and humble just like normal people. For musicians though, this is a bad thing (See Metallica). I hate when bands release &#34;best of&#34; cd's with one maybe 2 new songs. Seether is still a talented band, but their target audience has changed from those of us that LOVE heavy music, to those that love Country. If you want an accurate visual depiction of this CD, the artwork sums it up beautifully. Unless your an AVID Country & Western lover, AVOID THIS DISC
B0038M2AZA|5|VERY GOOD FILM, PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND OF AUTISM(AND THOSE WHO DON'T ALSO)WILL REALLY LIKE THE WAY THEY EXPOSE TEMPLE'S MIND, AND THOUGHTS, THE WAY SHE SEES THINGS, I CAN SEE IT IN MY SON'S BEHAVIOR.  DEFINETELY CLAIRE DAINE'S PERFORMANCE IS VERY GOOD AND ACCURATE, I LIKE HER.
B003I55BIA|4|This definitely isn't one of my all time favorite reads, but I still really enjoyed this book, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to a friend.  This has a nice pace, and I never felt the book dragging along endlessly.  The love between Alex and Brittany was fun to watch blossom, with the timing done just right.  -Not rushed or unnatural.<br /><br />I know that some people might not love the ending, but I thought it was a great way to end the book, and a nice way to remember Paco. :)
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Really enjoyed the depth of the book.  Characters were well drawn out.  While I knew what the ending would be from the start I am amazed how Grisham got there...masterful!
B0069G5Z9K|5|this game is awesome and I am 10 years old and my b-day is 5/22/13 so this game is just awesome.
B00B2166BS|4|Works awesome and it charges the tablet faster than the Micro USB cable. You are actually able to charge it and use it at the same time now. Magnet is strong but not too strong to pull the tablet if the cable is snagged. This has saved my tablet from a few falls due to cable snagging.<br /><br />Would give it 5 stars if the cable was a bit longer and the price was lower. $20 is a bit ridiculous for a cable.
B002QYUVY8|2|Uh, I like Robert Downey Jr, so I'll give him the stars, but this one was rough. Others watching walked out.
B00101ZOTA|5|Great movie
B0000AFQS0|5|After watching the newly-restored DVD of The Kids Are Alright, all I keep saying is Wow.  This is the greatest collection of The Who and their performances.  From their TV appearance on The Smothers Brothers to their final performance with Keith Moon at Shepperton, the movie just blew me away.  And it looks crystal-clear, and sounds excellent. I recommend this to any Who fan. Go get it!
0385340990|4|I found this book to be a page turner, I finished it in two days. I thought the overall story was good and it was certainly interesting to learn about the different experiences during the war. I also enjoyed the facts about classic authors that the book mentions. The book is light hearted about a heavy subject, which is the tragedy the war was to so many people. One of my complaints is that the story was rather predictable, by the middle of the book it is clear who Juliet, the main character is going to end up with. The end of the book seems rushed, I think that it should have had a little more development before the end. There are several loose ends of the story that I would like to have seen some closure to. Overall I liked this book and would recommend it, but I don't think it is as  glorious as many would have it made out to be.
B0000AQS0F|5|Star wars, the Matrix, and now Firefly, a new look into the future that not everyone embraces but will be, despite it's short run, a defining vision of science fiction for this generation.  The influence that this series will have on future projects in the genre will be huge.  This is worth the money and worth the time,  it is a great show and a wonderful ride.
B0026SCMNM|4|I liked the original story line and the well but not overdeveloped characters. I will read another book by this author.
B00NG4K8UO|5|Easily the most accurate two handed keyboard for android.
6305807043|5|With Hollywood cranking out more mindless films each and every year, it's important to take some time to stop and appreciate those rare films that combine strong writing, inventive direction, fine acting and a unique story.<br />&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; fits the bill. But don't go into it expecting standard Hollywood fare. The movie twists your understanding of the movies and leaves you wanting more. Is the story possible or believable? Nope. Does it require the viewer to suspend disbelief? Absolutely. Of course, that's also what makes it so much fun.<br />The film is director Spike Jonez's debut, but he makes the transition from music videos to cinema seamlessly. The acting is top-shelf, with John Malkovich brilliantlty playing himself, the always excellent John Cusack and Cameron Diaz leading the way.
B006DJ2JSI|5|Most helpful when reading for instant information on unfamiliar words. Type a few letters and possible word examples are suggested. Also pronounces word and gives synonyms and anonyms and word history.
B0058EBNAO|5|I love this app Shows way more then the Weather channel app
B00B0LPWU6|5|Outstanding performance by Denzel, very gripping story
0374280967|5|This slim little novella takes about a minute and a half to read, and is the most delightful story I've read in a long time. When Her Majesty, out on walkies with her corgis, stumbles upon a traveling library, she checks out  a volume to avoid seeming rude. Her following transformation into a reader and, in the process, into a better human, is laugh-out-loud funny and touching at the same time, an experience this particular very common reader absolutely loved.
B0009UC7QQ|4|This film by Peter Weir (Gallipoli, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dead Poets Society) has some themes in common with 'Dark City' (by another Australian director, Alex Proyas) as well as the British sixties TV show 'The Prisoner', although it doesn't go into as much philosophical depth as either of those. It's still a worthwhile film, however.<br /><br />'The Truman Show' is clever in the way it gradually reveals the artificial nature of central character Truman's world. Jim Carey performs well as Truman - an actor people love or hate, but he suits the role admirably here, despite not being able to resist breaking out into his trademark exaggerated flourishes. Weir is a director who knows how to play the viewer's emotions, and the pathos of activists trying to tell Truman his life is a charade is beautiful. Truman's producers believe they can 'handle' him, but his spirit breaks out regardless in the end - a lesson to would-be totalitarians everywhere.
B000002UB3|4|Without a doubt, this is the best The beatles ever sounded.  The songs were expertly crafted, the band sounded fantastic and that cover...   All together this could make for the perfect beatles album.  if you don't own this, why?
B00GXKVZSW|5|Graphic and yet artistic.... I'm loving this show
B00C7KXUOE|5|Grand Guignol makes its triumphant return with Hannibal!  Watch if you like incredibly polished production values, deeply nuanced characterization, awesome women, the creepy kind of fairy tales that happen in the very darkest places in the forest, stories that leave no stone unturned when it comes to the characters' minds and motivations.<br /><br />Don't watch if: you are sensitive to blood (SO MUCH BLOOD), violence (SO MUCH VIOLENCE), nightmarish murders that would make Hitchcock wipe away a tear, cannibalism, listening to a serial killer wax poetic about God, oh my god is that a totem pole made of corpses.
0316666343|5|I read, on average, two to three novels a week, and not often do I come across a book as haunting and beautifully written as The Lovely Bones. For a long time I didn't read the book, though it had been recommended to me and I'd read the reviews. As a rule, I do not read that many books where the storyline includes murder, especially in this case where it's a young girl who is killed, because I find no pleasure in reading about such topics. However, once I began reading, it was so different than I expected. The book focuses much more on the emotional pain of the girl and the family who is left behind. It was so different and really special. It was harrowing, but it was so reverent, Sebold's writing is so careful, and the narrative is so personal and direct, that I was touched in a way I never had been by a book with a similar plot. I never feel she's going overboard. It is easily one of the best books I have read in the past decade, and I would not at all be surprised to see it win either the Pulitzer or the National Book Award this year.
B00DRPVE3M|5|I play multiple times per day.  I love the card game, so I really enjoy this online game.  There is always someone ready to play.  Keep it coming!!  Love the tournament's, but wish there was a way to earn more points, like there is to earn coins.
B000QCS8TW|5|Bought the book on accident then couldn't put it down! Extremely well-written. Great characters and unpredictable story line. Can't wait to read the rest of the series
B0039N74CW|5|This copy was a replacement for my vhs copy. No, Shrek is and will be a classic.
B006SVHOL8|3|I did enjoy this movie,  however it was very slow at times. It is very scary to realize how accurate the movie is when showing how fast an epidemic could spread.
0446547638|5|My daughter read this book and she thouroughly enjoyed it! I would recommend this book to all!  Nicholas Sparks has many more books to read, so check them out!
B000WGYMAQ|5|I love the movie and stage show RENT. The Blu Ray disk provides much better sound and picture quality than the DVD disk I have. I'll be buying BluRay from now on !
B00BMKDTNC|5|After so many years I've read the last book of the Wheel of Time series. Quite an accomplishment. What a great time for you to start reading it. You won't have to wait for the next volume to come out. In fact you can get them on your Kindle. Mine take up a large section of one of my book cases. An awesome series. I recommend it to every one of you that love to read fantasy and even to those who just love to read. It creates a whole new world populated with heroes and adventurers, magic and villains. I worried when Robert Jordan died, so many loose ends. But when Brandon Sanderson stepped in the transition was seamless. A wise decision by Robert Jordan's family. Thank you.
B003MYYJD0|4|ok
B008Y212PI|4|I Like It So Far. Only On The 5 Square. LetS See How The 10 And Above SSquareS Go. :)....
B0045XGRQE|5|Great. Entertaining. Creative plot, character development.  Lots of action. Complimentary and a worthy continuation of the story From th first film.
B008133MDK|5|Awesome story line & cast. Awesome story line & cast! Could not be better as a modern adaption.<br /><br />Amazon requires three more words to post. I don't know why?  Sort of a moronic requirement.<br /><br />Still the show is brilliant!
B000SEIK2S|5|I have read this book three times so far, and every time I read it I get more out of it. I am at that point in my life that I can really identify with John Perry. It would be incredibly fantastic to be able to take your existing consciousness or soul and transfer it to a young and vibrant body again. Maybe someday that may happen. Who knows? We can always hope. 40-50 years ago we saw science fiction in Star Trek with Kirk talking on a communicator.  The Motorola engineer that developed the cell phone and the video camera in a cell phone got the idea for his inventions by watching Kirk with his &#34;communicator&#34;. So science fiction has become fact. Who is to say that it can't happen again. Impossible just takes a little imagination and a little longer!
B00CL68NOG|4|Can't remember last time I was a movie with Streisand, some of the dialog seemed un rehearsed, but I know mothers like that.
B00OICLVBI|5|This book is a must for every couple thinking about getting married. What Gary Chapman has put together is the most important guide to a healthy, happy marriage a couple must read before walking down the aisle. Couples considering divorce, please read this book and try it for 6 months. I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't put the book down. Even if you have a good marriage, this book can make it even better.
B0009HLDFU|5|This album rocks.  I have no idea what everyone's complaining about with the whole copyright issue...I imported the songs onto iTunes just fine.  Listened to them on my iPod just fine.  Oh well sucks to be you if you can't I guess. <br /> <br />Anyways the Album great, I enjoyed both the \\"Hard\\" side and the \\"soft\\" side.  I thouroughly recommend if you've ever liked anything the Foo Fighters have done, pick it up as soon as you can.
1442362537|5|I listened to this on my way to Canada and was drawn in right away  I read the Shining years ago and thought it should have a sequel and I think King nailed it the reader also was great I only wish it was on audio cds  instead of mp3 discs
B00APJLX8E|5|Great Movie!
B00AB7HESI|1|Threw 2$ out the window. I bought it once and it said there was an error and it could not be installed. Then I bought it again; it said the same thing. I use a kindle Fire and over this game no 4 or 5 stars until I get the game.
B006VREHRS|5|Great so far!
B00AYDC5HY|4|Probably best viewed during the Halloween season, this movie is a hoot. whoo, whoo whoo. I viewed this movie while down with the flu, it made me laugh and cough. Oh, and maybe leaky in the eyes.
B000K7VHQE|3|I love movies without big budgets and without big stars.  I went to see this because of the reviews, and was a bit dissapointed.  The characters were excellent and it was pretty funny at times, but over all, I didn't really feel much when it was over.  I probably won't see it ever again, and really wouldn't recomend it to anyone.  At the same time I didn't feel robbed of my money when I saw it in the movies.  So if you want to see it, my advise would be to rent before buying, because while it was an ok movie, I'm not sure most would watch it more than once.
0060589280|3|This is the frist book from Paulo Coelho I have ever read and it entertain me a lot the way he writes is very interesting but to me this book is too much about sex.
B005HSL626|4|Good way to have some fun and relax, addictive.  Fun to see the slicing options and hear the sounds when you slice different fruits.
B000062YAZ|5|As Angel of Death came roaring on the speakers of my car I realized that this CD was not going to be average, it was going to be freaking awsome.  I couldn't belive that the song was from 1986, it seemed so modern.  The rest of the songs roared by and I was genuinly hooked on this CD.  The second time listening through highlighted especially Criminally Insane and its remix, which actually sounds kind of scarey at the beginning using sound FX from Raining Blood.  Anyway, and Slayer or metal fan should enjoy this CD.  Anyone should enjoy it, unless they are put off by the alegid \\"satanic\\" nature of it.  It really is more like an anti-satanic album even if the songs are really cool.  Look at the front cover.  Is that really a pro-hell cover?  Not really.  Anyway, there are some songs on here that I think everyone can enjoy and have alot of fun with.  I'm really glad this was good after hearing Seasons in the Abyss, buying Divine Intervention, listening to Decade of Aggression, and hating God Hates Us All.  I think you'll like this one.
B007FTZDN8|5|I love TED, great way to get up to date information.  I love the download options for viewing videos on the go.
B00G118LYY|1|well first off it is hard to move your car and all you do is run around on your car and brake stuff. and you just well not really do any thing it is not at all fun so ya
B00BMCLCG6|4|The album is okay. Not there best work but Bon Jovi is like pizza, even just an okay album is good and satisfying.
B000HIVIOW|5|I had to buy this for several people.  I have been watching this every Christmas for years!  This is a WONDERFUL Christmas story!!!!
B000FCKGPC|3|It was an okay book that ramped up ever so slightly at the end to leave the reader feeling okay with the fact that he wasted his time reading the first 500 pages. Ultimately lackluster compared to the first three.
B00BEF1AEK|3|I like this game for the reasons below. It's fun, a little mundane but always passes the time.<br /><br />The thing I don't like is that the save file gets corrupted. This happened to me several times. The last time it happened, I had finished the main game and moustache world. Sadly, when I went to load the game seconds ago, I'm back at the beginning with no save file.
0345522478|5|I was determined to start the new year with a fresh start by trying out some new authors, so I was very curious about when The Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearnes showed up on a couple of my recommended lists. This amazing new series more than delivered to be excellent Urban Fantasy.  Hounded is the first book in The Iron Druid Chronicles. The lead protagonist is a 2,000 Druid named Atticus O'Sullivan, owner of an occult bookstore and apothecary but he really is a druid in hiding. Atticus has been hounded for centuries by a Fae god who wants something very powerful that Atticus has.  Atticus is a fascinating and likeable lead; the secondary characters are an interesting spectrum of non-humans of werewolves, a vampire, witches, demons, Celtic gods and goddesses.  After burning out in disappointment with several PNR serials and irritated with the plethora of faux-Urban Fantasy drivel, Hearne's writing is a dynamic and refreshing return to exciting and original UF storytelling that is grounded in plausible Druid history and weaves an accurate portrayal of the Tuatha De Danann, Celtic, and Norse mythology.  Unquestionably, Hearne's riveting writing is an outstanding addition to the Urban Fantasy genre. I was so completely blown away with Hounded that I bought the next two in the series, Hexed and Hammered, and I can't wait for the fourth book, Tricked, due out in April. Very highly recommended, I look forward to immersing myself into this riveting series.
B00B2V66VS|3|Its got good visuals and tight game-play. that's about all that can be said, its a mobile game so it doesn't really excel in any area.
B006LSZECO|4|Gone Girl is really diffrent from what I usually read.  But, it definitely had my attention from the get go.  All written from a different perspective than the usual novel.  Each chapter is as seen thru that particular character.  Very well written and a page turner.[[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]
B007FEFLTO|5|Man, can he write! This is the second in the trilogy of the 20th century. The book takes place before and during the 2nd World War. The history and lavish accounting of the time period is explained and detailed, without boring the reader. I couldn't put it down.
B000AU9UYM|5|Batman Begins explores the origins of the Batman legend and the Dark Knight's emergence as a force for good in Gotham. In the wake of his parents' murder, disillusioned industrial heir Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) travels the world seeking the means to fight injustice and turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. He returns to Gotham and unveils his alter-ego: Batman, a masked crusader who uses his strength, intellect and an array of high tech deceptions to fight the sinister forces that threaten the city.
0439023483|5|This is a great read! I couldn't put it down and became addicted. I can't wait for book 3.
0545265355|5|So it was my sister's will to have these books for her birthday, as well as a Kindle Paperwhite. Thus, I got her both articles, and I have to say that the presentation of this set is very neat: three ellegant hardcover volumes in an equally ellegant slipcase make you feel you did not waste your money. Kudos to Scholastic for such a wonderful edition.<br /><br />Now if you ask me about the content, I have to admit I haven't read them yet for two reasons:<br /><br />1- I am already into the Ice and Fire books, so I do not have time for other books (by now).<br />2- Up to now, I have few or no interest in this saga. Like I said, this was a treat to my sister, all because of her Name Day. But probably I will give it a try in the future. After all, nothing can be worse as Twilight.
B0063GORYU|5|I have an Amazon Fire HD 6 and play this game several times per day.
B00C2FFJFM|5|Good
B00BAXFACO|3|Fair, got side tracked by other books that were better.  I may return to it<br />and finish in the future.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Great game, just hang with it and keep playing it will open new adventures
B00FAPF5U0|5|highly addictive ...good for pass time ...play at night at ur own risk...:) please refrain from asking for more lives from facebook friends.
B00992CF6W|1|I cant play it omg it is the worst game ever and I mean it. it is to much money
B00BF8OYJO|4|I am a fan of M.C. Beaton's Agatha Raisin but she only had a 'bit part' in this very short story because she cracked the murder in one sharp shot. Still it was a fun read.
B00K7C17QW|4|I only wish the stars were a bit easier to get. I enjoy crime scene investigation and gives me something to do.
B0057URWSQ|5|What can I say? It's a really fun show to watch. All the characters develop in really interesting ways, it's more than a show about lawyers. Much, much more.
B001SGEUMY|5|A band can not sound the same every record, this guys are evolving, sure there are Better records in my mind, but this collection of songs is pretty damn good
B001Q4Z5UY|5|Great
B00PJ5AUCO|5|This game is awesome  end
B001GZ6QDS|4|I really love this movie.  But I felt 22 dollars for the double disc was a waste of money.  They didn't really show anything on Heath Ledger or the making of the movie.  What a waste of a dvd.  What was the point of having 2 discs if your not going to put anything on it?  They didn't even put any deleted scences on the disc, I'm sure they had some.  To the people who haven't bought this movie yet, I wouldn't get the double disc, I'd get the single disc movie.  Save your money.
B00DRPVE3M|2|It moves so slow..  and it keeps wanting to play with my face book friends.  Not necessary...<br /><br />If it moved quicker - I wouldn't be so apt to fall asleep.
B0036OS3EW|3|It didn't fit me, I bought it the same size as my crocs clogs but they are really too small, they are cute but if you are going to get them, try a higher size as usual.
B009FZFONO|5|Dish Network dropped AMC for a while last year and I streamed one episode of the Walking Dead using a Roku box before Dish restored AMC.  Very good picture quality.  The Walking Dead is one of my favorites.
0066620996|4|Today's popular business press is filled with books that purport to know the path to business greatness.  Theories, new buzzwords, and charismatic authors pushing the latest business fad, have not answered \\" Why some companies make the leap and others don't\\"?  This question drove Jim Collins and his research team to embark on a five-year research project to examine the transition of going from a good company to a great company. Jim Collins captures the culmination of their efforts in the book \\" Good to Great\\". <BR>    Jim and his team used rigorous selection criteria that resulted in the pool of 1435 publicly traded companies, which had all appeared on the Fortune 500 list between 1965 and 1995.  The team subjected these companies to a \\"death march of financial analysis\\". The analysis methods are detailed in 51 pages of appendices in the book. The analysis had four elimination rounds.  In the end , eleven \\"good to great companies\\" remained from the initial pool of 1435 companies studied.<BR>     The final eleven companies were examined and interviewed to determine the underlying traits that separated the great companies from the good companies.  The great companies had traits in common.  These traits were transparent to industry type and product.<BR>   Jim Collins and the team set out to discover and understand how businesses achieve and maintain greatness.

B0000AQVCL|5|Yeah, they're derivative.  But in this day and age, who isn't?  And frankly, I would far rather listen to a great, funny, fresh band like Jet than the recycled junk of Britney Spears or any of the other highly popular &quot;artists&quot; that are floating around out there.  Jet has put out a CD that is so much fun that it is positively infectious.  &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl,&quot; regardless of what it's influenced by, never fails to get me wanting to stand up and dance, and the same goes for &quot;Cold Hard B****.&quot;  Their ballads, like &quot;Look What You've Done&quot; and &quot;Move On&quot; are far better than I would have expected. A guilty pleasure? Perhaps, for some- for others, it's just a great time.
B003O86FMW|5|After the first book I couldn't put this series down until I was finished. Collins book had the right amount of action that kept you in suspense about what would happen next. Just simply an amazing series.
B005HSG3TC|5|It was cheap and the material is perfect and light and not bulky at all. Thank you very much, i will get a lot of use from this item
B00005KK19|5|The Wailers had been playing and recording in Jamaica for many years already. But it was their 1973 major label release on Island that brought the band onto the international stage. The Marley cuts are strong, especially \\"Concrete Jungle\\" and \\"Stir It Up\\". But Peter Tosh's two numbers, \\"400 Years\\" and \\"Stop That Train\\", are actually my favorite songs on the album. It's a shame that Tosh and Marley (along with Bunny Wailer) had to go their separate ways as they truly were the Lennon and McCartney of reggae music. Also don't underestimate the contributions of the Barrett brothers. Emphasis on bass and drums is one of the distinguishing features of reggae music and no rhythm section was more powerful than the Barretts.
B000000W6X|3|While the title track is alluring, the rest isn't as strong and  is more suited for background listening. Most songs hint several ideas using different vocalists but never really hit their mark.<br />The followup album Mezzanine is much stronger and I would recommend that you would seek out that one first.
1439192812|4|I grew up in a religious household, so science was never emphasized and I always felt secretly ashamed for \\"believing\\" in evolution. I \\"tuned out\\" for most of my life when I sat in science class. Reading this book introduced me to concepts that, believe it or not, at 28 years old, I had never fully conceptualized or considered. I especially enjoyed learning about the different myths associated with each question at the beginning of each chapter, and then reading on to understand the scientific explanation. Admittedly, I was lost when he began talking, at length, about gasses or the elements, but other chapters were thoroughly engaging. I read and re-read the chapter on evolution, how other animals including fish are our distant cousins. I would often pause and sit for a while to ponder what I had just read. I felt a connectedness with all life forms that I've not previously felt. I devoured the chapter on what makes a rainbow, and read with delighted interest about his theory of life on other planets and how he intelligently deals with questions about why bad things happen and what a miracle really is.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed!
B00006IUL7|4|Al Pacino plays a detective who's being investigated by Internal Affairs for his alleged illegal activities in bringing bad guys to justice. <BR>He's put on a case in a remote northern place in Alaska where the sun only rises and falls once a year. Trapped in a world where the day does not end, the detective suffers from Insomnia and has to keep his mind clear in order to pursue a murderer and stay out of trouble while doing it. Accidentaly shooting your partner doesn't really help much either. <br />Robin Williams is clearly into psychos lately. I didn't really think his performance in &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; was all that good, but in this movie he's got his act together. Al Pacino is pretty good in his part, although not as great as I have come to expect from him.<br />All in all, I enjoyed this movie. Catch it if you get a chance!
B0027MJU00|4|Kept me guessing til the end!
B008XG1X18|5|pinterest is the best time killer ever. it is so addicting its like one big magazine and there are so many great ideas!!!  LOVE THIS APP!
B0078XGEK2|5|Really enjoying. Prompts you to analyze l life choices.....
B0000025DD|5|Many years after listening to About face was not disapointed by this production.Can listen to it over and over again especially Theres no way out of here.To cut the long story short if you like Pink Floyd buy this cd  you wont regret it.
B0087GF8ZG|2|This shipping for this product was great. It arrived ahead of schedule and everything was there and in working order. The light is simple to use and easy to install. The motion sensor on mine works great. It picks up movement from about 10 feet away, turns off in about 30 seconds when there is no longer any movement, and actually does sense when it is day or when other lights are on so you do not waste battery life.<br /><br />However, the light itself is not very brite. I purchased this light for use in a closet that does not have power ran for a permanent fixture. Unfortunately, this light is not brite enough to distinguish the color of my clothes. I can't tell which shirts are which, so the light is basically useless for my purposes.<br /><br />If you are looking for nothing more than a simple nite lite with a motion sensor this will do the job. However, you can buy a plug-in nite lite for less than half the cost and still get that job done. If you want to really light up an area, like a closet, you should not purchase this light.
B007TBZ63Y|5|This was one of the best books so far in the entire series. First the seven demigod from the prophecy meet and then they get split up again...I mean this is definitely one to remember.
0316069485|3|Probably like most of us as we get older and have a family, Harry Bosch is slowing down.  Michael Connolly certainly is.  This story is long on procedure and short on mystery.  Harry, his half-brother, his half-brother's ex-wife, and the two daughters just don't have the edginess of the early characters.  This story is very predictable and lacks complexity.  Unpredictability and complexity is what made the earlier books so much fun.  I think Mr. Connolly should consider putting out books as he crafts a good story vs. once a year according to his publisher's schedule.  Having said that, I will admit that it was hard to put down.  On the other hand, most of Connolly's early work was impossible to put down.  My advice - wait for the paperback or check it out from the library.
B000IDGBWU|5|Great movie
B004GJDQT8|5|Very efficient.
B0054TKAZW|2|Not a very good plot.<br />Very dry humor<br />Poor acting
B00881VLCE|5|Only thing it runs my battery down fast.....but love the game
B00GUXO12O|4|seems I can't say that if you like Bruce, you'll like this.<br />I guess you have to LOVE Bruce ?<br />I don't know<br />I'm still listening to it<br />Not too thrilled with the other guy ( tom )<br />but's still Bruce
B00DJFIMW6|5|Good job Gameloft! This game is so creative; it's not like a lot of other &quot;run&quot; apps. Can't wait for updates! :)

B00FPT5UD8|5|**CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br /><br />FALSE SECURITY is a thrilling novel by Angie Martin. The story starts with a man meeting a woman and wanting to date her, but there's something hidden in the past of the woman's life. She sleeps with a gun, has horrifying nightmares and just as you think you understand her secrets, another twist in the plot means that you still have a lot to learn. It is not until you meet her captor that you start to understand why Rachel has been running all these years, and then you are taken back in time to the one truth that Mark knows about her - the death of her parents.<br /><br />I found myself itching to get to the part where Rachel had left her abuser to escape, knowing that she would never fully be safe. Even when she is able to escape a second time, there is still that knowledge that he will not rest until he is dead to make sure that she stays with him and no one else, using any tactic necessary.<br /><br />Overall a thrilling and exciting story that is well written and will keep you guessing until the end. Whilst the ending itself is open ended, I am sure that there will be a sequel to keep the readers on edge. Highly recommended to those who love crime, psychological thrillers and a good love story.
B0000009SE|5|This album got mixed reviews on release. But i love it. big swifty is a triumph. It has this irresistable groove running through it, a credit to the rhythm players. George Duke plays some of his best music here. There's great zappa guitar and horns. It's a sprawling epic. The tune itself is another zappa classic. Words don't do the music justice , get this! The two songs are very good songs. Your mouth has some great singing, and good guitar too. One shot deal is cool too. It has nice singing and a killer steel pedal guitar solo from pete kleinow sneaky pete. title tune is gorgeous. i played it to my friend, and he said to me 'dallas!' ie he thought it sounded like the tv theme. It has a lovely melody played by the horn players. Then a lovely trumpet solo, sal marquez. And then one of the greatest solos i've ever heard. It's by Don Preston on mini moog. Don Preston played with the original mothers of invention, and appeared in 200 motels too. I think this is his finest zappa moment. Hear it folks. Frank comes in at the end of don's solo, playing gloriously. Aynsley Dunbar gets to play a little solo, then we go back into the theme tune. There is more really beautiful music from the horn section, brilliant bass playing from alexander dmchowski (excuse my spelling al),and the tune wraps up with some bells ringing, like church bells . It's a glorious finale. 36 minutes of great music which i recommend strongly. Thank you
B00FAX6XQC|5|My co-worker was addicted, so I had to try it.  I am not a hunter by nature, so I got my mom, dad and brother hooked, as they are hunters...
B009LH1Y1W|4|Not only do you not have commercials, but the first run programs on the CW are not HD, and the quality of the Amazon streams are nearly so. I get a square picture on the CW and fullscreen on the Amazon stream.

B00127RAJY|5|I JUST bought this DVD last week...today was my 7th day using it.  Let me tell you...this is working!  I am not really looking to lose a lot of weight.  I really just want to be in better shape. It's taken  5 months to find the \\"right\\" routine for me.  This is it! I LOVE it!  I can feel myself getting stronger, I have much more stamina (after 7 days!!!), and the work out FEELS good! I love it! Tommorrow----I'm moving up to level 2 and I am EXCITED
B000VSAEYI|4|My 1, 3, and 8 year old love this! It might have been a little small for an 8 year old, but we put a bigger slide in it so it was kind of like a (&#34;slide-n-slip&#34;) slip-n-slide on the long end. The slide attached to it was not so good. There is not enough room at the end of the slide so everyone, including the 1 year old, would slide down then hit the edge of the pool. The smaller pool area behind the slide was perfect for the one year old to drop his toys in and my 3 year old sat in it like a little jacuzzi.  You can attach a hose to it and it will spray/mist water, but you don't have to use this feature.<br /><br />Perfect toddler pool depth. There are some blow-up toys that come with it. A turtle, whale, and some ring toss thing. The whale kinda looked a little inappropriate as the water spout coming out of it's head looked like something that made the adults all laugh.<br /><br />Draining and drying it out has been a little difficult. I drain it, flip it over to dry, then it always flips back over (from the slightest of breezes) so I end up with a little pool of water in it in the corners. We don't want to have to inflate/deflate constantly, so I just spray it out again before each use. Not a huge deal. I also move it around our yard every few days so the grass in one spot doesn't die. Works well.
B00EEN66SY|2|Its a shame that the script wasn't able to maximize the talent....probably because there wasn't any depth to it.  Trying to stay too true to the actual events of the Hollywood Hills Burglars made this a very shallow movie.  There wasn't any motive or any sort of inner struggle with the things the group was doing.  Had they based it on actual events and added some thought process for one or more of the actors, Coppola would have used her directing prowess more effectively.  Very nice shots throughout but this story would have been better served as a Lifetime TV movie.  It really got monotonous and ended flat.  Wasted performances by Watson and Farmiga.
B00JATCM0S|5|Great music, great guitarist, I love all his albums. You cant go wrong buying any of his music.
B000031XBQ|4|I am  a big fan of ABBA ..always have been as their music is timeless..never out of date...can enjoy it regardless if I heard it 25<br />years ago or yesterday. Purchased the spanish version as there is a couple songs I do not have in my current english collection.<br />This spanish collection is just as wonderful as the english collection. Some songs I enjoy more in spanish than english but all in all I consider this an excellent purchase.
B00B2V66VS|5|GET THIS APP!!!!! IF YOU GET IT I WILL GIVE YOU A HUG<br />(&gt;^.^)&gt; &lt;( &bull;.&bull;&lt;)<br />  me  you  ...........that was a nice hug;).............
B00D8CSVLW|3|Not his best or his worst effort. Lilkely to be made into a sequel move for 'A Time to Kill'
B005LAIHY0|4|Liked the digital copy.  Watched it on computer and home theater.<br />Big fan of Sci-Fi so my opinion is a bit skewed.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Did not like how it ended..
B006VRDZ44|3|Of course the series is great but only the first season is included with your Prime membership. I am starting to see that having Prime is not worth the price.
B0070Y46UY|5|I didn't see the movie and didn't know the story when this book arrived.  That was the very best way to read it.  Not only did I follow the transformation of Pi, but I experienced my own transformation.  I discovered that there are many layers of courage and I came to cherish our resiliency.  It isn't particularly poetically written, but it burrows deeply into the reader's heart.
B00F91RYL8|4|I'm not much for zombie movies, but this was pretty good and not gory.  A lot more exciting than expected.
B009NY43NY|4|It's hard to see it end, but it is definitely time for Sookie to move on. I really enjoyed it.
B00DR0PDNE|5|It's really pretty hard to go wrong, for $35. Being able to use my phone as a remote, and using the normal mobile interface of each app to do so, is fantastic.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Loving This Series! !
B003VJTGLQ|4|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was better than I expected, after reading some of the reviews.  It wasn't the greatest, but not the worst either.  I give it 7.5 to 8.0 on a 10 point scale.  The lowest score I have ever given a Blu-Ray is 4.0.<br /><br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was adequate (there just wasn't a lot of surround sound in this movie, except for the background music).<br /><br />After watching the Blu-Ray, I put in the DVD.  The Blu-Ray is better, but not a whole lot better.  Both the Blu-Ray and DVD appeared to be 2.35:1, with black bars on the top and bottom (the way I like movies to be).  The DVD appeared dark in some scenes.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this Blu-Ray purchase, because I really like this movie.
B0054JZC6E|4|fun games something for all ages really like the racing game. the aquarium game is the hardest but still fun. party on
B0000024YL|5|Thanks so much!
B00003CXE6|3|Wow! I'm glad this movie got Oscars! It was deserved! The best of the year!.....Ooops wait! I was actually thinking of \\"Traffic\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" (Which showed how politically unfair the Academy Awards were when they both lost best picture to this work of unoriginal, mediocre quality) The fighting scenes are entertaining, but between the action you'll want to fast forward over the unintelligent dialouge and card-board acting. Poor Russell Crowe, who was looked over at the Oscars for his  great performance in The Insider and won for a very overrated performance in this (If you watched the Oscars that night you'll know that he knew that as well). Poor Academy voters, who have yet to make up for continuing to let mediocre, non-challenging movies that has the artistic merit of a advertising billboard, win the top awards. It was entertaining! But also very lacking.
B000I9YWDO|3|should be a prime instant video, i don't like paying for older movies when i pay a whole bunch of money for a year prime membership, its outrageous to pay for them
B00AFROVQC|5|Absolutely Loved this book was an amazing written captivating story couldn't put it down read it nonstop for two days and finished it look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series!!
B00IHZ91T6|5|This is a real classic, you read it once. You have an idea, and every year you read it again and you learn something more. Especially the last chapter that deals with the \\"seasons\\" in any relationship.
B00005A8MA|5|\\"Back to the Roots\\" fue uno de los discos que me hicieron entrar en la msica de John Mayall, el otro falta editarlo en formato CD \\"Moving On\\" recuerdo que el vinilo era de uno de mis hermanos mayores otro amante de la buena msica, las canciones que ms escuchaba eran \\"Accidental Suicide\\", un himno a todos eso seres humanos que creen encontrar en las drogas su fuente de escape a la realidad y nombra a Jimi Hendrix como uno de esos seres en un caso de \\"Suicidio Accidental\\", \\"Drugs may bring you joy... but the dangerous is that they destroy.....\\" que gran verdad, muy buena letra, otra cancin \\"Blue Fox\\" con un solo de harmnica realmente extraordinario, \\"Dream With Me\\" donde Sugarcane Harris se luce con su flauta, confome pasaron los aos; Le empec a encontrar el gusto a las dems canciones, pero no lo tenamos en CD, hasta que en 1988 apareci \\"Archives To Eighties\\" una buena recopilacin de casi todas las canciones del \\"Back to The Roots\\" algunas regrabadas con muy buena calidad pero... faltaban canciones? como: Groupie Girl, Full Speed Ahead, Travelling, en fin... faltaba el CD original!! recin hoy podemos apreciar esta joya de la msica contempornea, con grandes msicos que acompaaron al \\"Padre Blanco del Blues\\" en esa ocasin: Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Sugarcane Harris, Harvey Mandel, Johnny Almond, Larry Taylor, Steve Thompson, Keef Hartley, Paul Lagos etc. Les cuento que solo le asignado 5 estrellas porque no hay suficientes en el universo para evaluar como se debe esta produccin, no tengo mas que decir que lo compren inmediatamente, no se arrepentirn, saludos
B00TJ69DHM|5|I loved this song before, but after seeing the movie, it's much more meaningful and poignant.
1400069181|4|An interesting read, although will not teach you much about HOW to start something that matters.  Blake  encountered a series of happy accidents, which allowed him to build a great company.  Unfortunately, these accidents cannot be taught or planned for.  They just happened and he, being an entrepreneur at heart, knew what to do with them.  Quick and easy read, enjoyable and inspiring, but certainly not useful for someone looking for business advice.  I recommend it to anyone interested in others' stories of inspiring success!
0802130208|5|Do not read this book in public because your laughter will cause others around you to think you are crazy.  <br /> <br />This was the funniest book I have ever read.  Once you get to know Ignatious and what makes him tick, everything that comes out of his mouth will have you laughing hysterically. Though at times you feel sorry for the guy, you can't help laugh at the life he has made for himself.  Will Ferrell is playing him in the movie version which is coming out in 2005 - so read this before the movie.
B005GFPZYK|5|Could barely put the book down. I just wish there was more to read it is such a shame that Chris is no longer with us.
B008K9SG9K|5|i ORDERED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE THE SONGS TOO.  GREAT SONGS TO RUN TO....VERY UPBEAT.  THEY ARE HEADED FOR GREATNESS!
B0001FR3IQ|2|Most movies ask for a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but this one carries this to a ridiculous extreme.  For example, if a ghost can carve a clue into your arm, why can't it just write you a note to tell you what it wants?  Also, I'm quite certain that a medical examination after a rape is a good way for a well trained expert to determine whether or not a woman has been raped or at the very least has had sexual intercourse.  Another problem in the movie is with the fact that in a suicide investigation, the forensic examination of the body would determine whether or not injuries were received before or after death.  These and other obvious flaws in the storyline and the less than mediocre plot are just some of many reasons this movie is lacking and should be skipped.
B000G6R7B8|5|good! cuty item!
B00V4JKT52|4|It lost me, but my six year old loved/loves it.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I love the big numbers, at last one calculator than I can use without problems of hitting the wrong key.
B007J4T2G8|2|How does E. L. James get away with hijacking the Twilight storyline?  Bogs my mind.  Granted, I enjoyed the story.  But it was Bella and Edward.
B007T7MIR0|3|Haven't used much.
0446525537|4|Just like the phenomenal author Nicholas Sparks warned me, I smiled and I cried while reading this book.  It is a true tale of love.  The main character Landon Carter cannot help falling in love with strange but kind  Jamie Sullivan. Landon's love for Jamie was a true test of time as revealed  in the surprise ending.  Nicholas Sparks has a great talent, each book of  his has captivated me and left me amazed.  I srongly recommend this book to  anyone who has loved another.
B007IXWL2C|5|So glad that the books took the romantic turn and not the S & M route. Was not comfortable with that.
B00DXP0QV2|5|This edition of the last amazing album from Nirvana is completely full of rarities. The attention to detail is also great.
B00BUCXVPI|4|The movie has great action, great fight scenes and cool car chase with old Chevy muscle cars. An enjoyable movie.
B000E1OI7G|5|Scripted by Stephen Gaghan from an acclaimed BBC miniseries, Steven Soderbergh's Oscar-winning \\"Traffic\\" is a hard-hitting, superbly stylized expos&eacute; of the war on drugs. Visually slick and masterfully directed, the film works beautifully as an ensemble drama of interconnected vignettes, and as a wake-up call to parents, educators, and clueless officials, highlighting the insidious ways illegal narcotics infiltrate the culture--and the mostly ineffective means we have of rooting them out. An exhilarating reality check that'll keep you hooked.
B008MEM24S|4|I'm down loading it right now. but its took over 10 mins. to just down load! cant wait for installing! not! well anyways I bet it will be worth the time and 99cents :l I hope
B003SWNRU2|5|Excellent album, that is if you like heavy metal music with rhythm and not having the guitar beat to death with one chord over and over.
B00005JL7Q|4|You've got to have a regular job to melt into your society, otherwise you'd only become an romote and isolated island. The guy in this movie lived a peaceful life, a kind and gentle man, but still a loner and loser in other standards. This a man who could afford a not-so-bad living by not doing a job is actually everybody's day dream. I just wish I could be that kind of guy.
B008XG1X18|1|I got the pop-up requesting a credit card too. didn't download as I don't want to risk being charged for a &quot;free&quot; app. it's killing me because I really want it on my fire!
B005ZUR724|5|A lot of work went into this game,very well done! it seems to run nicely on the Kindle Fire. Top notch MMO that takes just a bit getting used to the controls but it is so much fun. And you can not beat the monthly price.!
B004SD5GZ4|5|Used in my Kindle...great...because most of the document you can read it only with .!!!..want to used in my iPad soon!!!
B004SEUJ82|5|THANKS.

B005ZOBNOI|5|Great book!
B00008J2DQ|3|The band just ain't the same without Tommy Stuwart. He is one of my favorite drummers. Anyway it sounds like Shannon Larkin is mimicing Tommy's style of play on some songs.It's okay
B004J4XGN6|5|What is considered the bible for many was a great read.  Lots of ideas and great anecedotes and stories of how this is best applied are inside.
B009G41CG2|3|This game is a little harder than I am used to.  The older one would let you shuffle to get all the tiles and this one does not and I get so exasperated for I have not won that many games..  I still play with it just to see if I will win.
B008EQIK90|4|I'll admit that the trailer didn't sell me, and the fact that it was a remake didn't help either. However this was actually a pretty funny movie. The chemistry between the cast was fantastic, and the humor wasn't insulting. I know humor is subjective, but as a 25 year old male, I found this to be a very enjoyable time.
B00006CXSS|4|I purchased this series as a gift for my adult son. He was enthralled by it when he first saw some of the exploits on HBO. He watched it and raved about it until I was finally allowed to &#34;borrow&#34; it and judge for myself. I will have to admit it is a spell-binding series to sit through. I have developed an affinity for &#34;action&#34; movies and &#34;war&#34; movies and this series does not disappoint. I thought &#34;Schindler's List&#34; was great in its time...and still think so. &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; was another favorite and I still believe it is one of the best war movies of all time. So, where does &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; fit into this heirarchy?? It is hard for me to say exactly. I have developed sort of a love/hate relationship with it. I use that term (love/hate..) to describe the emotional turmoil I feel, not my feelings toward the project!! In the first place, how do you compare a made for TV mini-series with a wide screen cinematic event? It is difficult at best because the portrayal of Easy Company takes place over ten to twelve hours allowing the viewer time to assimilate the story and to develop bonds with the characters that simply cannot take place in a two to three hour cinematic portrayal. For that reason I believe that &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; reaches into areas and touches virgin ground in its portrayal of the intricacies of war. Does that mean that a mini-series is a better venue than a feature film?? Not always, but maybe in this particular situation it is.<br /><br />So, if this project is so good, why only four stars..?? That's a good question and I am not certain that I can answer it. When you watch something this BIG, you expect BIG. You expect big plot lines and big characters. You expect big sets and big cinematography and big sequences. You expect big dialog and big action. And you expect your characters to display big emotion and demand a lot of empathy. And, for the most part, this series delivers all of that. I just wonder if it's really as good as I think it is.<br /><br />The main characters are well developed. I especially appreciate the efforts of Winston, Nixon, and Speirs. These characters lead the procession of Easy Company across France and Germany and along with many others form the nucleus around which the series revolves. There are many other characters who figure prominently in the series and are present in almost every episode. I haven't counted characters and episodes so I don't know for certain, but it seems like there are a lot of the same characters portrayed. This would make sense, both from a producer/director standpoint and from the standpoint of a real life military combat unit. Except in cases of extreme casualty losses, units tend to stay together and new or different faces are not too frequent. I think that the extended casting necessary for a project of this size is part of my reluctance to admit that this effort is in fact the &#34;best&#34; and worthy of that rating. I think it is impossible to fully develop all of those characters...yet I would like to see that happen. I don't know, it's probably just me!!<br /><br />In any event, this series, &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is too well done and too grand to miss. As a war portrayal it covers events in a way never before seen and goes into detail never before attempted. I think it is important to remember the touchstone phrase &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; because we are dealing with a man-made portrayal of a particular series of events that actually happened. And while not one hundred percent accurate to recorded history, it is very close. And &#34;very close&#34; in this case means an ALMOST perfect portrayal. Don't miss this one!!st wonder if it's really as good as I think it is.<br /><br />The main characters are well developed. I especially appreciate the efforts of Winston, Nixon, and Speirs.

B00CO8D3G4|5|This was just one of many books I've downloaded for free from Amazon, but I have to say, it has been one of the best books I've ever read. James Altucher has great advice and exercises, hard won through experience. He also has a great writing style. As avid a reader as I am, there are few non-fiction books I would want to reread, but his I will probably start again tomorrow.
B000003TAR|5|Sure, we all know what unfortunately became of Kurt Cobain after the release of this record, and now, years later, it is all the more apparent that this was bound to happen. Espescially with this album. The songs were raw, angst-filled, angry, and self-loathing. There are some seriously scary lyrics in this. Cobain was at the end of his rope and he felt that the noose was tightening. They say that in pain the best art is created. There has never been a more obvious example of that statement.<BR>The album is incredible. All the way from &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; to &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; to &quot;All Apologies&quot; to &quot;Very Ape.&quot; Every song is a masterwork. The lyrics are intense, disturbing, and most importantly sincere. the album is a dark tour of someone who has lost all hope for themself. This is truly tragic considering what a wonderful person he was. These uncensored feelings are what make this album an essential recording. Cobain ended his life feeling that he never ammounted to anything, but there are millions of fans, myself included, that owe him more than he would have ever understood. He will always be missed.
B00006HBUA|1|It fails to be both a satire and a homage to the old 1960's cartoon of the same name. It's jokes are soo bad that even South Park would call foul on them and its effects are no better too. The movie also has a lot of mean-spirited moments like Shaggy wanting to sacrifice his friends in order to save himself. In-fact, none of the cast members act nothing like the ones in the cartoon. Its use of supernatural elements is out of place in the Scooby-Doo World and I'm not counting the 1980's/1990's TV movies. The dumbest part of the movie is finding out that Scrabby-Doo(Scooby-Doo's Nephew) was the villain the whole time mainly because it was poorly handled. The only upside is Matthew Lillard's performance but it still fails to help in the film in the long run. I give this film a 1 out of 10.
B00T0S7CYA|5|I award it 4 1/2 stars out of 5, simply because the 9-minute Minstrel in the Gallery live video is a delightful tease. Especially since footage of the band performing live from approximately 1971-1976 is so rare, if it even exists at all. Although the liner notes do caution that they did, in fact, only film that one song as a promotional piece. Other than that...the sound's brilliant and true to the original. Plus, the concert's an added bonus. And, just like the three prior releases in this format (i.e., Thick as a Brick, A Passion Play, and WarChild), the accompanying book alone is worth the price of this boxed set for Jethro Tull historians and collectors like me. I still feel this 1975 album is one of the band's very best and only gets more enjoyable over time!
B000YHG72E|4|An excellent family movie for all ages - you can't go wrong with Elf! My kids love it and I bought it for my mother as an Xmas gift!
B00CTEMQLG|5|Watched this site when it was on TV, wish there are now seasons. The musical numbers are terrific and the characters are endearing (besides Jerry and Ellis)
B00NM7IR26|1|This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. No, make that not seen. It was LITERALLY un-watchable. I don't know if it was just the format or what, but it was as if they went past the &#34;found footage&#34; genre and on to the hot, new, &#34;shot in the dark&#34; genre. My wife and I sat through the entire experience feeling as though we were watching a radio play with occasional daylight footage. I find this unacceptable and tomorrow I am contacting Amazon for a refund of both my time and money, as well as the time my wife spent watching it with me.
B00BAXFECK|5|Although long, I didn't want the story to end.  Some of the wording is so beautiful, that I re-read phrases again and again, trying to commit them to memory.  Disturbing and haunting characters add to a plot full of twists and turns.  I strongly recommend this book.
B00007KWHG|5|Great CD, Frankie Valli & the Seasons are fantastic. Especially these  songs (I got you under my skin & I can't take my off of you)
B0074JOCIG|5|Just Got it 3/22 and couldn't wait to play it. The disc loaded quickly on my OPPO BDP-93. The first thing I noticed was picture quality is better than the previous Blu-ray of \\"Live at the RAH\\", sharp and never out of focus, good color and without the white saturation.<br /><br /> The Sound quality is spectacular in DTS Master Audio! You can clearly hear every note being played at all times from all the band members, what struck me was the drums being so sharp and having very good punch and snap. Excellent micing and mix, hats off to the sound engineer guys, one of the best I've heard.<br /><br />  The opening is JB playing acoustic guitar in the NY subway and then jumps to the Beacon Theater where Joe struts his stuff.<br />His rendition of Gary Moore's \\"Midnight Blues\\" is to die for, the best version I've heard. Check out the guitar he uses on \\"Bird on A Wire\\" watch how it changes color and patterns. JB never ceases to amaze me, he might be one of the best musicians (not just guitar players) alive today. I think what makes him so enjoyable to keep listening to is he plays a different guitar on every song. Each of those guitars have a different sound and he makes them work, sound wise, with each song so the sound is not fatiguing.<br /><br />Beth Heart is worth the price alone on \\"I'll Take Care Of You\\". Paul Rogers was impressive, he might even sound better now than he did with \\"Free\\" or \\"Bad Company\\". John Hiatt's section was very good also, \\"Down Around My Place\\", a typical Hiatt song, was extremely entertaining due to Joe's excellent guitar playing.<br /><br /> With out hesitation this is a must have for anyone who collects Concert Video's, is a JB fan, a blues fan, etc... etc.... just get it you wont be disappointed! Now I'm just waiting for the new CD \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\" where he goes back to basic blues tunes.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.<br /><br />1. Performance<br />2. Quality of Audio<br />3. Quality of Video (for DVDs and Blu-ray's)<br /><br />1.*****<br />2.*****<br />3.*****<br /><br />Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard.

Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.br /><br />1. Performance<br />2. Quality of Audio<br />3.

B00003CXGG|5|As the debut movie for Aaliyah, this was very impressive and entertaining at that! I loved this movie and I also love the sound track. If you are a big Aaliyah fan, you have to have this in your collection. Aaliyah displayed great acting, the action scenes were great, Jet Li and Aaliyah made a great combo, and the story line was well thought out. <BR>This movie was great!

B000002JAX|3|I want to like Madeleine Peyroux. I've heard some of her live radio performances that really touched me. On the album cuts I've heard so far, she seems a little restrained by comparison, a bit less spontaneous.  <br /> <br />She sounds like Billie Holiday, I guess. I am not a Holiday fan, so frankly I could care less. It is a non-issue. Madeleine is not trying to ape Holiday, I am convinced. That is just the way she naturally sings. <br /> <br />The problem I find with this album is that it is uneven. Getting Some Fun Out Of Life, which is an obvious example of her Billie Holiday sound-alike-ness, is a fetching little song. And La Vie En Rose is beautiful. Some of the arrangements on the other tracks are so corny, they're like something you'd hear coming from the public bandshell at the Iowa State Fair.  <br /> <br />All I can say is that this was her first record. I didn't even care for the first Beatles album that much. So she's grown a lot in ten years. Today her song choices are better and her arrangements more refined. There are some gems here but choose wisely. Maybe download selected tracks you want. I know I'm glad I did not buy this. At its best, it is a promise of better things to come. At worst, it is a little embarrassing.
1609611543|5|Good information.
B0036G1T78|5|This movie still holds up over the aging that time gives movies. The acting is well done, the plot, esp. the relationship between Redford and Dunaway is intriguing, the music is well done, and the movie has a nice flow- no boring spots.

0385342063|5|I couldn't wait to dive into Sophie Kinsella's latest novel, I've Got Your Number. I'm not sure who sent it to me, but it showed up in my mailbox one day and I squealed in excitement when I opened the package. And can you believe it - I'm giving it a five star review! Shocking, right? I just love Kinsella and her stories, and this one was right up there. You know when you read a book and it just keeps making you laugh out loud? And then every once in a while you snort with laughter? That was me all the way.<br /><br />The story follows Poppy Wyatt, whose world gets flipped upside down when she loses her engagement ring. Shortly after her ring goes missing, she loses her cell phone - her lifeline! She finds a cell phone in a trash can and decides to claim it as her own. It was in a trash can - clearly the owner had given it up. But she finds out the phone actually belonged to the assistant of Sam Roxton, a very busy and angry businessman, and he wants it back! Poppy eventually convinces Sam to let her keep the phone for a while longer, at least until she hears back about her lost engagement ring. Poppy finds herself a bit bored, and starts reading through some of the text and emails that she is forwarding to Sam. Before she knows it, she is practically playing assistant to Sam, and finds herself immersed in some of his personal business. Poppy thinks a spark might be happening between her and Sam - but how could that be? She is set to marry her ideal man. Sure, they don't have much in common and his family seems less than impressed with her but still - she knows this marriage is the right thing to do. Right?<br /><br />I whipped through this story, cracking up along the way. One scene I'll point out - and you'll only get if you read the story - was the gift Poppy tried on that was meant for her fianc&eacute;'s mother. I was red in the face from laughing so hard. Wait, one more I want to point out. When Poppy is buying a fake engagement ring to play off as the real one. That scene with the jewelry sales girl was AMAZING. All I can say - read this book! You won't be disappointed.t scene with the jewelry sales girl was AMAZING. All I can say - read this book! You won't be disappointed.

0307943194|5|Always a good book to read. This one was a little different than his other stories but as always, Grisham writes well and has a good ending.
B00ADQPB50|3|If I had watched the first season instead of buying 1 & 3 together, I would never have bought the 2nd.  Won't bother with the third.
B0088X7YU0|3|This movie was ok if you like animated films.  These types of films have their place, but I would rather see another like the original as opposed to animated versions.  Enjoyable film.
B0001XAPZ6|5|What a great way to show the world what we need to take care of now. Kind of scary what the imagination of the future may hold.
B004EI3ON4|5|Good album if you like electronica type of music.
B0029XFN9O|5|This is one of my wife's favorite movies and we watch it several times every Christmas.  The stunts are fun, and it gets us in the Christmas mood.

B0000CFW87|4|Just as great as his 1st album with even more power and melody to his song choices.  Always a pleasure to listen to him!
B00EQF0JJC|5|Very fun and interesting, there is no better way to watch Shakespeare than through the characters and imagination of Joss Whedon
B003WH765U|5|This is a love story between a Japanese lady & an American Serviceman. It was taken in the 1950's but it could have been shot in 2015. It shows the racism of America towards the Japanese people after WWII, around the Korean War (that still exist today). That once you get to know the Japanese people and their culture you find that they are no different than us. Having done two tours on Okinawa (one in the late 70's and the last in 2011) this is an excellent movie. It shows not only a love story, but parts of the Japanese history, culture & customs.
B003F3PMYI|5|Very good practical info.
B00CTSDDVO|5|But as far as watching it in non 3d it wasn't as good as the first one, but it's one of the best movies out there for 3d

B00CNQ7HAU|3|This decades old secret is gradually exposed, layer by layer, like peeling an onion, as only Grisham can do.  Not his usual fare but keeps you turning the pages.

B0007DAZW8|3|I had a lot of songs off Discovery downloaded before I ever got the album.  My friend bought it for me for my birthday and it seriously is one of the best albums I have.  Combine that with the amazingness of Interstella 5555 and you just can't compete. <br /> <br />When Human After All was released, I didn't know it was coming out.  I hadn't been paying attention.  I bought it though, hoping for some of the same things I absolutely loved about Discovery.  But maybe the joy of discoveries is over, and now it's time to settle down. <br /> <br />The main problem I keep hearing about this album is it's droning repetetiveness.  I mostly agree.  Some of these songs just go on a bit too long.  I shouldn't have to change the track just to hear a slight variation.  Specially with Daft Punk.  So as I'm flipping through the tracks, Im getting more and more upset.  What IS this?  Someone told me that, while it took years for them to release a new album, they only spent a few weeks in the studio on it.  Can you rush art?  Destiny's Child's latest says NO! <br /> <br />There is one acceptable track off the album, which is why I gave the CD three starts.  \\"Technologic\\".  That little voice and the music behind just captivate me every time.  I'm stuck, until the track is over.  I wish the rest of the album had been even remotely like this one track.  I really do.
1401938906|5|Completely Love it!!
B00514HDNW|4|Chilling and so intriquing that I read this in one sitting (it is a short story). It is quite different from the last film version of the story (with Will Smith), so if that is what you are expecting, you may be disappointed. Personally I found the book infinitely better.
B002S45V32|5|Love it
B0090EKRKU|5|My 11 year old grandson and I watched this movie together. He is adamant lately about not watching &#34;baby&#34; movies but he agreed to watch it with me and we BOTH enjoyed it soo much!

0070511136|5|Unlike most developers of sales training, Neil Rackham methodically backs up his claims with in-depth research. To build the flexible, adaptable SPIN model, Rackham has observed and analyzed a large number of high dollar value sales made around the world. Rackham convincingly demonstrates that successful salespeople marketing high dollar value products and services do not rely on the sales tactics geared towards low dollar value sales that are traditionally taught to salespeople. Successful salespeople typically go through four stages that Rackham has identified as: preliminaries, investigating, demonstrating capability, and obtaining commitment.<br />1. In analyzing \\"Preliminaries\\", Rackham first warns salespeople that although first impressions count, they are less important that too many of them imagine. Furthermore, Rackham recommends that salespeople get down to business quickly and avoid talking about solutions too soon. Raising areas of personal interest with buyers can sound suspicious. Talking about the benefit of a solution before understanding buyer's needs and building value to satisfy these needs, can also be an invitation for trouble. Unfortunately, Rackham does not remind his audience enough that this approach to preliminaries, though perfectly appropriate in the American culture, can be perceived as offensive in others. Salespeople doing business abroad beware.<br />2. In looking at the critical \\"Investigating\\", Rackham advises that salespeople not only use situation questions and problem questions but also implication questions and need-payoff questions. Salespeople usually ask the first two types of questions to uncover implied needs unless their customers or prospects tell them upfront that they have an explicit need for a specific solution to their problem(s). In high dollar value sales, salespeople must leverage the uncovered problems to make them bigger by exploring their implications. Buyers can indeed perceive an imbalance between the price of the solution and the severity of their problem(s). Because that type of questioning can sound negative or depressing to buyers, salespeople must follow with need-payoff questions to make their customers or prospects feel good about the proposed solution to their problem(s). To his credit, Rackham reminds his audience that the SPIN model is not a rigid formula. The type of questions to be used and their relative importance depend on the circumstances of the specific high dollar value sale at hand.<br />3. In examining \\"Demonstrating Capability\\", Rackham makes the distinction among features, advantages, and benefits. Rackham convincingly shows that offering benefits is key to meet explicit needs expressed by customers or prospects. Selling only features can be a risky value proposition because that tactic potentially makes customers or prospects more price sensitive than they should be. Resisting that temptation can be particularly daunting in the high tech industry that sometimes suffers from \\"feature creep.\\" Selling only advantages can also backfire against salespeople because that tactic is eventually an invitation to objections raised by customers or prospects. To his credit, Rackham emphasizes objection prevention and not objection resolution by bringing customers or prospects to the insight that the product or service being offered meets the needs expressed by them.<br />4. In investigating \\"Obtaining Commitment\\", Rackham demonstrates with panache that there is an inversely proportional relationship between the number of closing techniques and the success of high dollar value sales. Traditional closing techniques such as assumptive closes, alternative closes, standing-room-only closes, last-chance closes, and order-blank closes can easily generate objections from customers or prospects who are not yet ready to act on their implied and expressed needs. Progress in high dollar value sales is measured in actions on which customers or prospects agree so that salespeople can eventually move on along the continuum stretching from lead to order. As long as customers or prospects do not commit to advancing in that process, salespeople are indeed condemned to stagnation at best, definitive loss of the order at worst down the road.<br />In Appendix A of his book (which is really worth of his audience's attention), Rackham is humble enough to recognize that a jump in sales following one of his sales trainings based on the four-step approach described above can be totally or partially attributed to other factors such as changes in people, changes in products, changes in pricing or changes in competition.<br />Finally, as a side note, a good strategic complement to the tactical \\"SPIN Selling\\" is \\"The New Strategic Selling\\" by Stephen E. Heiman, Diane Sanchez, and Tad Tuleja. Like the former, the latter focuses on high dollar value sales.espeople can eventually move on along the continuum stretching from lead to order.

B00957T6X6|3|Okay my son got me hooked on HBO's Game of Thrones base on these books.  I am interested in the shows and I am reading the books because it seems you get more insight that in a Hollywood drama but the is a catch.  George R. R. Martin is not finished writing the series.  As I understand it he has been over four years since he finished book five and is not planning an immediate release of book six (Winds of Winter) until 2015 or possibly 2016.  As I under stand it there is also a book seven planned.  With the advent of the show it is rumored that there will be seven seasons total.  I hope so.  The author is 65 and if he takes another five years to complete the set he will be 70 and if he should pass away will we get the end of the story?  So with that in mind and you do not mind waiting then by all means start reading.  Me I will wait for him to finish as I would like to see an end to the story before the end of my lifetime.  I will move onto something else.

B00594XOZU|3|So they deleted kik from the Amazon app store. :( worst decision that they could have ever made . It was gone for like a month and now it's back !^,^ but it's not as fast as it use to be, in fact it's pretty slow, but not that slow. One of the things that I don't like about it now is that I can't see who I'm talking to, like it won't even load there profile picture , so that's really confusing when it comes to group chats. They need to fix that. Other than that I'm happy that they brought  it back . I was sooooo bored when they took it off the app store.
0071390111|4|This is an excellent textbook; already in its 5th edition. I owned previous editions and was eager to get the latest one. Its quality has been always high and the coverage very comprehensive. One has to admire the editors for keeping such an extensive text up-to-date over many years. I guess this is about the most complete general text on neuroscience available. And that in combination with an attractive style and lay-out. I am looking forward to studying it in detail, which will take time, given its large volume!
B004N1S25C|5|4.5 really. The end of the book made me think that part should be labeled \\"Reasons Why You Should Self-Publish\\". Pretty sure that wasn't King's intent. Anyway, great book even for those who aren't that interested in the writing part.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|As usual Grisham can take an average story - in this case - the probate of a will - and turn it into an exciting character filled book. A must read for all Grisham fans.

B000002H97|5|This is probably Metallica's best album ever. It is not all metal like the first four albums. I think I might have enjoyed this album a little more because it has many different sounds packed into one. Any Metallica fan  should definitly get this album. Some people say that Metallica changed to  much between ...And Justice For All and this album. I can see why a lot of  die hard metal fans did not like this album. The songs are shorter, it is  not as heavy as the other Metallica albums, and there are more songs but  shorter songs. This album is semi-heavy but if you are looking for a sound  just like their other, earlier albums this might not be for you. Metallica  is my favorite band. I have all their albums and heard all of their songs  so I have a strong opinion. The best songs on this album are Enter Sandman,  The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam,Of Wolf and Man, and Nothing Else  Matters. I loved this album but you may not. So get it if you liked their  earlier stuff AND their newer stuff because it is like a combo of both.
0783240287|5|It's a cute production for families to watch.  It's geared more toward kids, probably in the 6-12 age range, but it's entertaining enough to keep a parent paying attention too.  I'm not religious, and found no part of this offensive, overbearing or otherwise difficult to follow or get into. It's a  fun way to tell a story from the Bible.

142311339X|5|The Lost Hero (Heroes of Olympus, Book 1) is a great follow-up series to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. Old characters from the first series meet new characters on fun, wild, and sometimes scary adventures. Rick Riordan definitely hasn't lost his touch when it comes to creating interesting books to keep you entertained, especially if you are a fan of Greek mythology as I am! Definitely another winner from Riordan.

B00AESN8XY|5|I bought this thinking &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot; style pandemic &amp; was not disappointed.<br />  Basic idea, spread a global disease, kill all of mankind. Think the game Risk, but you play as a biological plague against humanity. It seems very well rounded, vectors, infected, transmission vs. Modern medical science. Kinda horrifying, when one considers the Ebola outbreak &amp; MERS virus spreading (May 2014), but addictive.<br />  Challenge Mother Nature to out think mankind. 3 levels for each type of plague. Multiple types of play. Unlock plagues, genes, &amp; advantages as you succeed (or buy the cheats, like $20 bucks).<br />  Worth way more than 99 cents. I can't wait for future up-grades!

B003VOPHO6|5|\\"How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking\\" is a delicious look at foods that matter.<br /><br />I'm a guy. I like sports, action movies, steak and other things stereotyping my gender. However, I like food. While I'm no domestic goddess (nor do I esteem to be one), I prefer the aroma and taste of a food made within the confines of my home. Restaurants are too..., um, well, they sort of seem to filter out the best parts of a meal. Restaurant biscuits might tastes wonderful, but they lack that sublime domestic elegance of the one my oven in my home provides.<br /><br />You've got your good-for-you food, and you've got your, \\"I'm starving; fill me up quick\\" food. In \\"How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking\\" Lawson gives us the food we want to eat, and how to make it.<br /><br />Hmm. No, she doesn't give us the food. That's where we come in.<br /><br />The pleasure of making a food is almost as good as eating it, and helping someone else enjoy the ecstasy of a well-baked delicacy is unbelieving satisfying.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />anthonytrendl.com

B007Y36K46|5|I love this movie, good clean entertainment!
B003K1EYM6|5|I will use this on a European vacation next month to back up my treasured photos each day. I will use the SD reader and like that I will not have to keep track of cables or take my heavy MacBook this trip.
B0094KTCUQ|5|This is one of my most recent favorites. This animation is geared towards the older children and adults. Just not entertaining to a two year old.
B0037B6QSY|4|A nice book, a bit simplistic, perhaps a good gift for someone idly curious about the subject but not yet into it. The author tends to &#34;talk down&#34; to the reader, but not obnoxiously so. It came promptly, in good cindition and well packeged. I'm glad to have it and would buy from this vendor again.
B008Y7N7JW|1|We tried to watch the movie last week and I could not get it to play at all so I would like my money back or send me a new one.
0374374562|5|Sweeeeeet!
B00FATEJYE|5|When I first got this game I didn't know anything about it but now it is the best game I ever had.
6300183971|4|But if you didn't read the book, you'll probably be confused by the complexity of the plot.  Still, I thought the casting was brilliant, and the set designs were perfectly-suited to the strange, futuristic world as  described in the novel.  See the un-cut version if you can --- I don't  understand why they shortened it in the first place!
B005K17RU0|5|quick accurate weather info thats easy to navigate. i can check the weather for any location. you can get daily info and weekly info
B001QKSWOE|4|Another entertaining Stephanie Plum novel. Love Wicked Appetite and Wicked Business so this intro to Wulf and Jessica (sort of) was fun. Mixing it up is good for a long-running franchise.
B007SGM084|5|Fantastic!!!! Took me 1 week to read all 3 books and I am reading them all again
B00IRISI42|4|Great book weeeek ending
B00HYTT7BI|5|My family had been unable to get to the theater to see this.  We had heard was a good movie.  It was a great movie.  Tom Hanks did a great job.
B001706I5I|5|We enjoyed the movie and it is a holiday classic
B009C7JS14|4|Paid version is much better than free version
B004AGI2L4|5|It was a great movie. Filled in the missing parts of the story from &#34;The Eagle&#34;.<br />It was a bit gory in the beginning. The battle scenes were probably very realistic.<br />It was a movie that both my husband and I watched and enjoyed.
0061120073|4|I used this for a book club and it was an excellent choice.  I wasn't sure it was going to be a success but the members enjoyed it. There are so many controversial topics and differences in lifestyle from that era to today that it really facilitates great discussions. The questions in the back of the book that are provided for use in book clubs were great.
B008JGSM6G|5|hours and hours of fun. so glad i tried this game. very enjoyable and very addictive. challenge your own brain.
B006PKQQJS|5|Most certainly worth 2$. It's fun and funny as well. I like seeing guys getting old lady hair and stuff. Keeps you very busy. Starts off easy enough and gets faster but not so much that you can't keep up and you get frustrated. Really fun game and well made!
B0063IH60K|1|I waste too much time playing it.  It causes me to play just one more game, and then on more and ..........
B000007OY0|1|Hey, sorry but it is true.  The Shawshank Redemption is nothing more but a modern day update of a 1930's prison picture.  Lets see....<BR>1.)  Innocent man sent to jail for crime he did not commit<BR>2.)  Crooked guards<BR>3.)  Malignant Warden who manipulates prisoners and the system<BR>4.)  Saintly fellow convicts who spout metaphysical wisdom like Grandpa on Walton's mountain.<BR>5.)  Edgy violence when hero is attacked by fellow inmates (supposed to show the terror of everyman).<BR>6.)  Hero appears to be co-opted by the system but then tiumphs  with a semi-spiritual redemption leading to the come-uppence of his tormentors.<br />That pretty much sums up the plot of Shawshank, nothing but a formula picture that you have seen before.  In that way I guess it is comfortable in that it breaks absolutely NO NEW GROUND, it is a re-hash of all the prison pictures that came before it.<br />Shawshank Redemption?  They should all get the chair as it has NO SOCIALLY REDEEMING VALUE to use the prison parlance.  After all the only message I got from it was that white collar crime pays if you are slick.
B002UNMWAG|5|I'll get right to the point here, because I know that if you're actually looking at this movie, you obviously saw the first one, and if you're reading the reviews, then you probably didn't make it to one of the 10 theaters the second one came out in. So is it as good as the first one? Yes. I will elaborate on the things that stood out for me. First, it is lower budget than the original. This is noticable immediately by the way the cinematography looks like a made for T.V. film. It's good cinematography mind you, beautiful shots, amazing direction, but you can just tell it's a cheap camera or something by the way it looks when the camera moves. It doesn't look like you're seeing a change of scenery, it looks like a camera pan on the set of a TV soap opera. This isn't as apparent as the action picks up, but right away you can tell it's low budget, and that's saying a lot compared to the first one. Other than that, everything lives up to the original, or surpasses it. It looks like all of the actors are having a lot of fun making the film, as you get a genuine sense that they are enjoying themselves every second of the movie. It's funny, it's action packed, and it's a great continuation of the original. If you didn't get a chance to see it in theaters definitely get this as soon as it comes out. I was lucky enough to see it in theaters, and I will be pre-ordering it as I can not wait to see it again. GREAT MOVIE. Thank you to everyone who decided it would be a good idea to film a sequel to The Boondock Saints. This is more than I ever expected to get.

B0000584V3|5|Wow, what can I say? Words really don't do this justice...but i'll go ahead anyways. This has to be my favorite Opeth and it has a special place next to my heart, since this was the cd that got me into true metal and out of the sh*t hole known as nu-metal. I remember when Michael Akerfeldt started singing in The leper affinity...me and my friend were totally stunned.This album basically changed my taste dramatically for the better, for sure! Now focusing more so on the album...the production (courtesy of Steve wilson of Porcupine tree) is perfect, just an incredibly rich sound to everything. I also think Michael Akerfeldts is at his best here, both the guttaral growl and the clean singing. And as for the rest of the band, I would say that Opeth has one of the most solid line ups in bands i've heard, just that every member is so gooood, and no ones really competing for being the best. Well anyways, enough of what I think , just go buy it if you haven't already! And don't forget about the rest of the Opeth collection either , that would be quite the mistake!
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game. it is so much fun and I love competing. its a very realistic game. you must play this game!
0345360338|5|Sharon Kay Penman writes historical novels to savor.  The mental picture she draws of each scene is amazing.  I cherish each of the novels I own of hers and look forward to the next.  Falls the Shadow is my favorite of her creations.  I recommend it highly and have hooked many of my friends on her style.  If you like historical fiction about England...  This is an excellent selection.
0316017930|5|Ther writing conveys facts, figures, and thoughts that arent dry but are rich with insights and conclusions.<br />Pushes one to look at things and our exisitng thoughts in new ways and from new perspectives.<br />A book that will cause one to think and rethink.<br />Once started extremely hard to put down.<br />If your mind is ideling this book will cause it to take you to new destinations.
B00846REIS|1|Okay, with roughly 100 pages to go, I think I've read enough. I just couldn't finish this book and find myself very disappointed that Ms. Day created her own story based on the widely popular E.L. James book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey.\\" Sure, Christian Grey is now, \\"Gideon Cross\\" (I'm not a rocket scientist, but I figured out the initial exhange - along with changing \\"Ana\\" to \\"Eva.\\") But here's where I'm baffled: Ms. Day is actually a good writer. There's a reason I read as many pages as I did. Because of that fact, with each turn of the page, my heart sank for her.<br /><br />Without going into the meat of this story, if you've read FSOG, you essentially already know it. Yes, the people, places and situations have been jumbled around a bit, but for the most part; (and it pains me to say this since Ms. Day has such great potential), someone should have waved a red flag in her direction long before it was published.<br /><br />This is the first review where I am at a loss for words...
B003MC5N28|5|l have never read a book like this one. It was different, but kept my interest. l am not sure about the ending.
B000HLDFM2|5|Based on Garon Tsuchiya's manga, Oldboy is about Oh Dae-su, an ordinary salaryman type, who is held at a police station for being drunk.  Afterwards, he is kidnapped, locked up in a hotel-like room without windows, gassed repeatedly so the room is cleaned and so  he can get a haircut and clean clothes, and kept there for 15 years.  \\"If they had told me then that it would be fifteen years, would it have been easier to endure....or harder?\\"  His only contact to the outside world is the TV.  \\"It's both a clock and a calendar. It's your school, your home, your church, your friend... and your lover<br /><br />It's after being let out and into \\"life in a bigger prison\\" that Oh Dae-su's quest really begins.  Who imprisoned him and why?  He is given a cell-phone and a wallet full of money by a scraggly bum, then goes to a sushi restaurant where he meets Mido, a beautiful young woman who takes pity on him and takes him back to her place when he collapses.  It also appears he has been hypnotized during his imprisonment--but why?  His nemesis, a man later identified as Lee Woo-Jin, is quite the mastermind.  When they first confront each other, Lee gives him five days to find out the truth, or he will kill Mido.  If Oh Dae-su wins, Lee promises to kill himself.<br /><br />Through clues of finding out which Chinese restaurant provided him with the same potstickers he ate for 15 years, he finds Mr. Park, the owner of the hotel where he was imprisoned.  It is here that two memorable scenes occur, one a tooth torture scene where he extracts Mr. Park's teeth out with a hammer, all set to Vivaldi's \\"Winter\\" section of the Four Seasons.  Using such music in such a scene adds a bit of humor in it.  He then takes on a handful of Park's thugs armed only with a hammer, his fists, and keeps on fighting even though a knife is plunged into his back.  The sardonic smile on his face when he encounters an elevator full of thugs is priceless.  Guess what happens to them?<br /><br />The theme of revenge and Lee Woo-jin's attitude, \\"Whether it is a grain of sand or a rock, in water they both sink alike\\" implies that no sin is too small for revenge.  He later tells Oh Dae-su, \\"Seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who has been hurt.  Try it. ... Once again, revenge is good for your health.\\"  But to quote Hamlet, aye, there's the rub.  \\"But what happens after you've had your revenge?  I bet that hidden pain probably emerges again.\\"  The whole point is that this isn't about Oh Dae-Su's revenge on Lee Woo-Jin, but vice-versa.  As someone who holds grudges easily, I can easily relate to what Lee says.<br /><br />Oh Dae-Su's introspection in seeing who it was he had offended reveals that every life is far from perfect.  \\"Study your whole lifetime,\\" he is told by Lee.  But he also realizes that his imprisonment has changed him, as he figures Mido wouldn't like him the way he was before imprisonment.  But there is hope for redemption, as seen in the scene with snow, symbolizing a clean new start.<br /><br />This was actually the second film I'd seen with Choi Min-sik, the first being Shiri, but so far, this is his master performance, a creditable and credible performance as Oh Dae-Su.  He later appears as the villainous Mr. Baek in Lady Vengeance.  Yu Ji-Tae scores well as the devilish but weak Lee Woo-Jin, and has a cameo in LV.  Ditto for Kang Hye-jeong as the cute-as-a-button Mido.  She is a TV reporter in LV.  And Oh Dal-Su (Mr. Park) plays the bakery owner Mr. Chang in LV.<br /><br />The movie's score is another triumph.  Whether it is the upbeat techno beat of the opening shot of Oh Dae-su grabbing onto the suicidal man's tie, the haunting quiet ambience during Oh's fight with Han in Lee Wu-Jin's penthouse, the Godfather-like waltz that is Lee Woo-Jin's theme, and Mido's sad theme with clarinet and strings, the music team scored a big triumph.<br /><br />This is hailed as the best in Park Chan-Wook's trilogy in story-telling, film-making, acting, and techniques.  One of the best films I've seen in awhile.
0062114042|5|This was one excellent book.  I've always been a KISS fan and I admire their hard working ethic and respect for their fans.  I had no idea that the confident Starchild frontman from the band was an insecure and bullied child.  The adversity that Paul had to overcome would have caused many people to give up and crawl into a cave, but he persisted and now is an American icon.  I recently got to see my first KISS concert and they put on quite a show.  I loved this book, I loved the concert and I wish Paul and the others all the best.
B00F91RYL8|2|This move made me so nervous from the utter chaos not to mention bored. I do not recommend this movie.
B00FAX6XQC|5|I b killin it I love this game it takes me back in the day even tho the graphics are way better keep the awesome games coming to the awesome games for free
B005BCE7II|5|Picture quality great
B000QXDED6|1|I went to this movie with few expectations. From the previews, I expected no more than a random, brutal, and stylized action flick, but it still didn't impress. The movie replaced half of the would-be action and violence with a steriotypical story about a soldier giving his life for his family. The movie shoulv'e at least mellowed out the overly-dramatic and soap-opera like emotional dialogue, because it didn't work out very well with the overall presentation of the film. As far as the stylized action goes, the computer-generated blood looks cool as swords impact flesh, but every drop of blood dissapears before it reaches the edge of the screen .Noone wasnts to see an awesome blood spurt fly through the air, and then quickly fade into nothing. This was just downright lame. All of the soldiers would come out of battle clean and blood-spatter free. This is in no way nearly as good as Sin City. Lastly, the movie doesn't feel either visceral nor intense, just clean and full of disapearing blood effects. The movie comes off as lame and cheesy. Rent it first.
B0055SWM08|2|From the start this game looks and sounds great, however during the different levels there is an annoying flicker and lots of pixel dancing (noise) going on which is very distracting. I was thinking of uninstalling and re-installing, but I'm not sure that will solve the problem. Too bad, overall is seems to be a nice soothing game. I read another review that saying the same thing. I expect more from \\"pay\\" apps.
B005LAIGSC|5|Very good acting.  Suspenseful.  I hadn't seen it before, but trusted that with these actors it would be worth purchasing and I was right.
B00004W221|5|This is an excellent movie!  Based on a true story, it is all about perserverance, and I would recommend it to everyone.  This is a movie that can be watched over and over.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|This should be famous you can triad with mpc<br />And crime ropes awesome game
B002KEDQJQ|3|The opening title sequence with each of the &#34;golden age heroes&#34; biting the dust to Bob Dylan's &#34;The Times They Are a-Changin&#34; is one of the best pieces of cinema I've ever witnessed. The rest of the movie follows the arch of the cult-classic graphic novel to painstaking detail. This attention to detail is both good and bad. The movie can drag on and while it's nice to see the characters brought to life, (particularly Jackie Earl Haley's Rorsach, Cruddup's Dr. Manhattan, and Wilson's Nite Owl), some of the actors fail to make the characters pop (see: Malin Ackerman's Silk Spectre and Goode's Ozymandias). Overall it is a faithful cinematic take on an incredibly daft graphic novel--for better and for worse.
B008B3EQPI|5|This is easily one of the strangest bands I've listened to.  The combination of hard rock and swing, plus a little opera and techno creates an interesting musical style that I've not heard anywhere else.  I really like the vast majority of the songs on this album, but the songs with heavy brass are my favorite.<br /><br />This band is definitely not for everyone, but if you're looking for something different and you like brass music, then you should definitely give it a listen.
B005ZO6NRA|5|I grew up reading the Conan stories written by Robert Howard,so this movie feels right. Uneven,things may not fit exactly or you have no idea where that character came from--but true to the original Conan stories. Not polished nor a continuation of the older Conan movies(those long silences where the characters stared into each others eyes were boring) so while it could have been better--it was good for what it was. An action sword and sorcery with blood violence and an occasional half naked woman thrown in. Which is how the Howard Conan stories were.
B00F1BFRA6|5|Completely hooked on this series and MUCH more reasonably priced than PBS
B008UCJ7KO|5|Great book.  Keeps you very interested. I didn't want to put the book down. Great love story. One you can really relate to real life. It's a must read.
B000Q67876|5|I could watch this movie 100 times over and not get tired of it. I loved it.
B00CATSONE|5|This thesis dispelled the view that great inventors were motivated by advancement in science more than personal recognition and financial reward. Obviously the former is fueled by the latter. Advancement requires benefactors who are risk takers. Kind of justifies capitalism,but not in an altruistic sense.
0345803485|1|Wow, this is truly the most boring book I've ever tried to read...I say tried because it was so incredibly boring I couldn't even read the whole thing. It has NO story...the series is just basically an excuse to write S&M lite sex scenes for twenty somethings who've never actually ready good erotica. I read the \\"Story of O\\" in my twenties and this doesn't even come close. It's S&M lite for the Twilight obsessed YA audience girls who've never in their lives heard of S&M. There is NO story...not much S&M really takes place, well, a little ... mainly the sex consists of Christian \\"punishing\\" Ana with multiple orgasms for her disobedience, against her will...then she whines about it afterwards, yet she still marries him ... because he's \\"hot\\", I guess.<br /><br />The whole point of S&M is the woman WANTS to submit to the man...some of the sex scenes seem more like rape than willful submission. Rape can be good role play, but Ana seems to dislike the whole thing even though it makes her tingle \\"down there\\". And what is with all this \\"inner goddess\\"  and \\"subconscious\\" Sh*t...Gosh...I was beginning to wonder if E. L. James' comically bad writing is a joke. How did an editor let this mess happen?<br /><br />Ana definitely acts like a teenaged girl, and Christian, although we're constantly reminded about his hotness, seems a little psychopathic. And how does a 27 year old guy become a billionaire anyway?<br /><br />I LOVE erotic...and this is SO boring! Initially I thought some of the sex scenes were well written, but that has worn off fast. Also, some of the sexual gymnastics honestly seems unrealistic to me. How many women can actually orgasm from having their nipples sucked and tweaked? Not me...well...if you are a teenager who's never read about S&M and sex and you are obsessed with Vampire Edward, you will love this. Adult women beware...<br /><br />E. L. James should be on her knees every night thanking God for Twilight, because without those books she wouldn't have her characters. But WAIT - Twilight is boring as hell also! And she plans to re-write the third book from Edward's POV? Wait - didn't Stephanie Meyers plan to do that?<br /><br />Frankly I'm surprised that Stephanie Meyers hasn't sued E. L. James yet for stealing her characters. She must be a nice person.

B00122MBY8|5|More than 40 years on, \\"Astral Weeks\\" sounds as fresh as the night it was recorded. Many reviewers have pointed out that this is one of the greatest musical statements of all time: a true musician's album, impossible to categorise, standing out distinctively even from the rest of Van's voluminous and consistently excellent body of work over 40 years. All played in one inspired spontaneous burst, in a 12-hour studio session by musicians who had little or no experience of playing together: in the can, done and dusted, a timeless classic created in one night in NYC.<br /><br />Bursting with youthful energy, musical originality and jazz-improvisation, featuring some of the most inspired poetic lyrics ever committed to song, the whole beautiful, timeless marvel is carried along by strings, brass, flute, acoustic guitar and the most delicious driving bass playing you'll ever hear. And then there's Van's voice, articulating those poetic lines with such power and conviction you feel he's baring his very soul.<br /><br />Someone said of this album many years ago: \\"You can't really say why it's so great. You have to listen to it to understand that. It just is.\\"<br /><br />Words like \\"seminal\\" seem somehow inadequate to describe \\"Astral Weeks.\\" There's nothing else like it, nor ever likely to be. It's gorgeous, rich, delightful, transformative, inspired, a one-off. If you've never heard it, then it's time you did.

B00KGDYP5C|2|The Monuments Men, 2014 film<br /><br />It begins by showing paintings which were removed from a church to hide them from the Germans. [War is about property, to get it or to keep it.] We see Germans marching through Paris. Goering inspects paintings. A champagne goblet is prepared for German officers. In Italy people work to save a famous wall painting from bombing. Can these works of art be saved? Can the US Army send a team of artists to Europe to save them? They will try. Men receive Draft Notices then go to Basic Training. They were selected on their knowledge of real art, to protect them from confiscation by the Germans. Are those real bullets? Some German trucks were captured with boxes of art treasures. So too a trainload of boxes sent to Siegen (and other places). This saves history and culture. Can they get ahead of the Third Army to capture this stolen art? [Note how much smoking they do.] They arrive at the front lines. There is drama. Can they save the Cathedral of Bruges?<br /><br />Then its December 1944, the Battle of the Bulge. They show scenes with a song about “Merry Christmas” for irony. [This copies the 1963 movie “The Victors”.] The Russians have a Trophy Brigade to regain stolen art. They learn about the “Nero Decree” to destroy everything after the German Fuehrer dies. There is shooting on a country road. They capture a map that is marked. What is behind that brick wall? Claire provides information, she kept notes. [This is slow-moving at times; script or director?] They search another salt mine to find 100 tons of gold bullion! Elsewhere captured art is destroyed by the Germans. One soldier stepped on a land mine! There is a fix. They find barrels of gold teeth! They find statues, some paintings were burned. One mine had its entrance destroyed. Will the German officer talk? This area will be turned over to the Russians tomorrow. The last panel is found before they pull out. Stokes finds a statue at the last hour. The last scenestell about the successful retrieval of other private art, over five million pieces. Many great works of art were never recovered. Will anyone remember this in thirty years? Yes, when they write a book.<br /><br />Note how some of this stolen property was taken from an ally. This is a good story, not a great one. It is based on a true story, little known as it was censored for decades. The book must be better. The disappearance of that gold bullion became another unsolved mystery of WW II. [Who had the motive, means, and opportunity?] They did not receive any consideration for showing the use of tobacco products (nicotine is a mild stimulant). Is this movie worth watching? There are better movies and books to entertain and educate you about WW II.

0385504209|5|My realtor suggested this book and now I owe him!<br />It starts off with the chief curator of the Louvre being murdered for a secret.  He lies to his killer; who leaves him to die.  The the curator does something strange.  He strips, draws wierd symbols on the floor, and sets off the alarm which seals him in the museum, and then he positions himself in a strage way!<br />Enter: Robert Langdon a professor of symbology who was trying to get a decent nights sleep.  He is dragged to the scene and then becomes the main suspect for the murder!  His case is not helped by the fact he was supposed to meet the curator.  He evades capture with the help of a beautiful brilliant cryptologist with a past.<br />You enter a world of intrigue that covers history, pagonism, Christianity, the Knights Tempelor, and a secret socity that is holding a closely guarded secret that may cause the downfall of Christianity!<br />The characters are great!  Langdon is not Indiana Jones! He is a professor and lecturer who would probably shoot himself if he needed to handle a gun!<br />Now as the the claims of Relgion bashing.  There is a HUGE clue on the cover of the book!  &quot;A NOVEL by Dan Brown&quot;  A person told me she saw Dan Brown speak and he said &quot;It is a novel and that he stretched facts to fit the story!&quot;<br />It is a great read that draws you in.<br />A good indicator of telling a good story is that people belive it to be true even when you tell them it is a novel!<br />I will look at his other books and I kind of think this would make a great movie!

B0083P1QUM|4|I've been reading Cornwell since the beginning and have skipped the past few books because the drama amongst the characters seemed to be going the way of a soap opera.  There appeared to be no easy way for Cornwell to write her way out of the situation.  In Bone Bed, I think she has taken the best course of action and has shifted the focus from all the external drama to Kay's internal and more personal issues.  In this way, Cornwell allows us to move away from the heavy and often negative dynamics of the characters and back into the world of Kay the doctor, forensic scientist, and woman.  The bit about the femme fatale in the ranks of the CIA was just implausible.  But otherwise, well done. I'll be reading the next one.
B00457X7XQ|5|Mark definitely knows what he's talking about when it comes to internet security, which is refreshing compared to a lot of the techno crap that are out there. In spite of this, the book is very approachable to all readers. It's fast paced, fun, and you'll have a hard time putting it down!
B008P1EWIM|5|This is a great app! I can keep track of the weather regarding the important people in my life. Plus, when I get ready for trips, I know what kind of clothes to pack.  Great app!
143911000X|3|It's okay. Pretty dumb and of course it's not a book to be taken too serious. I rolled my eyes about a hundred times while reading it. I resold it.
B0091REZMW|4|Love the idea of solving a mystery. Little mystery within a larger one. Achieving goals makes you feel like your accomplishing something.
B00AO2P3GA|5|The only downside is the extra data adding in the beginning but its only once and even though i paid $7 dollars its totally worth it!!! btw i have a game review website which u can checkout called [...]…on VGB terms i would give this game a 9.5!

0525423281|4|Stephanie Perkins knows how to make me smile!! She has a gift for writing humorous stories with one-of-kind characters. After I read and loved Anna and the French Kiss, I knew I had to get my hands on Lola and the Boy Next Door! I bought Lola and the Boy Next Door the day it came out, and I absolutely loved it!  Was this novel adorable? Definitely. Was it predictable? Yeah. Did I love every freaking minute of it? Totally!  Stephanie Perkins does it again with Lola and the Boy Next Door. I will admit that I missed the poetry and the slang from Anna and the French Kiss, but I really loved the characters and their hobbies in Lola and the Boy Next Door. You have a costume designer, an inventor, a future detective and an ice skater. Plus, all of the characters had eccentric and unique personalities. Lola is quirky and hilarious. She is the definition of one of a kind. She often wears a wig and a costume, and she refuses to wear anything twice. Cricket, the boy next door, is also a funky dresser. He's caring, lovable, energetic, a little awkward and kind of shy. Lindsey, Lola's best friend, is very focused on her academic agenda and refuses to date in high school. She's also obsessed with solving mysteries. Calliope was a little self-centered, but protective. We aren't even going to talk about Max. We will ignore Max. The characters really made this novel.  Did I mention there are several guest appearances from Anna and Etienne St. Clair? Oh yes, they pop up a lot throughout Lola and the Boy Next Door, which was awesome!  I also loved Lola's unconventional family. Her two dad's Andy and Nathan are loving and protective parents. They fully support her uniqueness and they encourage her to be true to herself.  Not only was this novel remarkably cute, but there were also a lot of great messages throughout this novel, such as: finding yourself, staying true to yourself, discovering if someone is the one, and the importance of trust.  I gave Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins 4 STARS. This is an amazing story for young adults. It's hilarious and romantic. I strongly recommend this novel for anyone in search of a great Chick-Lit.   -XOXO  Reading, Eating & Dreaming  FOR MORE REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT: READING, EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF

B00FAPF5U0|3|Works your brain. have to play like chess. think of moves ahead to set board up. Very strategic games easy to vet frustrated or lose track of time.

B009NY43NY|1|To much changed just to end the series. Sookie deserves better you failed her Mrs. Harris. Yes she is your character to to with but really???
B003L77G6A|5|If you have not seen at least one episode of The Big Bang Theory, you must be living under a rock. :-)<br /><br />This show is funny, friendly, and yet still has a biting sarcasm all its own. The interaction between the friends and eventual girlfriends  is filled with hysterical social and emotional blunders as they struggle to understand each other, the world, and their place in it.<br /><br />Some might find it shocking to note the character growth within the series. Trust me, it's there. :-) But as long as the humor is there, this group will be a television mainstay!! Enjoy the reign of the nerds!!
B005RJI67I|4|I found this for a gift for secret Santa that my company put on for Christmas this year! It was the perfect gift, the right amount of money (because we had to stay under a certain amount) the only thing I wish was different was I was hoping it would have been in a box instead of a bag... I think the bag looks cheap.... Besides that it was a good gift and my secret Santa got a kick outta it!!
B0067Q42BY|4|I would rate it 5 stars but the ads in a paid game are annoying. Fine if the first time you start they are there, but after that they should only show as an additional option labeled &quot;More Games&quot;. The tutorial is at most 45 secs to go through. Other than that I like it so far. BTW got it as a free Amazon app. Works very well on my Kindle Fire.
B00FMQILBC|4|Good product
B00KX4TORI|5|This card reader is awesome, it is one of very few portable card reader that is capable of the latest UHS-II spec.<br /><br />This card reader supports latest 4.20 spec, further raise the data transfer rate to a theoretical maximum of 156  MB/s (full duplex) or 312 MB/s (half duplex) using additional row of pins<br /><br />I also have the previous generation mobilelite g3, and this is slightly faster even with previous gen cards that are UHS-I, the G4 is about 4% faster peak bandwidth, and this is much slimmer and better constructed out of some metal alloy material.<br /><br />I use this with samsung 64gb pro microsd (2014 Gray Color 90/80 MB/s) , and samsung 64gb pro microsd (2013 Black Color 70/20 MB/s), and both get above rated speeds, using crystaldiskmark 100MB sample size on a USB 3.0 capable PC, with sequential transfer speed I get 89.1/78.6 MB/s for 2014 model and 75.1/23.2 MB/s for 2013 model.<br /><br />I am very happy with purchase, it is much improved over previous mobilelite G3, in terms of performance and design, if you are constantly transferring files to sd cards, this is much faster than built in sd card readers in your laptop/pc/macbook.<br /><br />The only issue with the reader that is a problem with most portable SD card readers is that since its as wide as an SD card, it might block off access to another USB port on a laptop, or USB ports on side of LCD screens.
B008JFUP0I|5|I love all the fast & furious movies. I had to buy this to add to my collection
145162607X|1|I kept checking the publication date to make sure it was new.  Still, I recognized every conversation, every emotion of Anne's, every twist, every turn, every bit of paranoia, all of the fear and loathing of the Woodvilles, the love of Richard turning to distrust.  Then I realized I HAD, in fact, read this book before.  Only it was called \\"The Reluctant Queen\\" and was written by Jean Plaidy.<br /><br />How utterly disappointing.  I'm not saying Plaidy's book was great, but this read like someone had just cleaned up her prose.
0743424425|5|The Shining is a great book. I am sure most people already know that, but I thought I would add my 2 cents. In case you have been living under a rock for the last 25 years - The Torrence family has decided to spend a winter as the caretakers of a reclusive hotel in the mountains. It will only be Mom, Dad, and the little boy isolated for the winter season, buried in nothing but snow and loneliness. The little boy, Danny, has a unique gift -the shining - where he can talk to people with E.S.P. The father also has a gift -the ability to see the ghosts of the hotel. Unfortunately, the ghosts want blood, and to add to the permanent residents of the facility. The decent into madness is one of the best ever described in a book. For those of you that have seen the 1980 Kubrick version, you will be in for a treat, as the ending is substantially different.<br /><br />This is classic King, and should be read alone at night, with the winter winds howling outside, the telephone turned off, and the blanket pulled up tight.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. King.<br /><br />Relic113
B001BC5HXG|5|One of Steinbeck's classic novels is still a wonderful absorbing read today. Warning! You will want to discuss the novel with others who have read the book recently after you have finished. This is a terrific discussion topic novel.
145210655X|5|hilarious book, love the artwork and humor.<br />this was a gift for my friend, she loves this book!
B000VWYJ86|5|I love this whole franchise!  Matt Damon is a jewel in the lead.  He carries the movie well.  If you like James Bond, you will love Jason Bourne.  The action is well choreographed and non stop!  Delivered as promised, I would use this vendor again.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5|For me personally I did enjoy this film as a dark horror far more than I do when watching the original-no! I said I wasn’t going to compare-dang-it! The 2013 film was a more serious film with a darker atmosphere and near anesthetic nature. The characters were sullen and practically introverted which made the relationship between one another a bit more tense than the happy-go-lucky weekend getaway style. For me that set a tone that was a bit more edgier and made a statement that this wasn’t a surreal or reflective horror story-it was a straight up, raw, gory massacre event in the bowels of hell. The film wasn’t as scary as I would like for it have been. I didn’t jump or feel creeped out on any of the scenes, but the shear gory nature of the moments that unfolded, and the full throttle battle for the soul through almost the entire film was pretty intense-and thrilling.<br /><br />The effects in this film are tops-they should be for the budget this pic had- the soundtrack that rippled through the film was chilling. The death and ultimate possession scenes were gruesome enough to the point of making me giddy about seeing them. I was a little disappointed by the woodsy rape scene with Mia-for some reason I was expecting it to be more graphic and offensive, I found it a bit tame. The overall story was well written, the film’s cinematography was great and I thought Fede Alvarez done a great job re-visioning the Evil Dead concept. “Evil Dead” 2013 is actually one of the few “remakes” that I haven’t been disappointed in. Yeah at times the story seems to rush the build-up, atmospheric spookiness and go straight for the kill switch but the fact that it started out dark and moody and just hit overdrive into Hellish horrors and all out nightmare wonderland right up until the end created a great viewing experience in my opinion. I really enjoyed this film and will definitely adding it to the list of films to watch over and over-especially during the Holiday seasons!asons!
B004EI3ON4|4|Good story. Wanted more action. Even a back story/prequel movie of the father building that world would be great. It could be a series of movies. It leaves you hanging as to what happened at the end but leaves it open for possible other movies. It was good. I can watch this again unlike some Marvel films.
B007J4T2G8|5|Received the book through Kindle and it was great. Easy to purchase and able to read immediately. Much easily than normal purchases.
B001H1SVO8|3|I am probably too old for this type of psychological movie.  If the movie is perceived as ironic, then OK.  If overt violence is a logical consequence to passive aggressive culture, then I find fault.
B00DR0PDNE|3|This is an awesome idea in theory but the technology is only as good as your internet provider and it doesn't disclose that.  Fortunately we have great internet speed but I know friends who have purchased this and been greatly disappointed.  Also, the compatibility of this device with my &#34;new&#34; HTC phone is a little sketchy.  Not enough Apps yet to be worth your time or money.  Maybe in a year or two it will be worth it.
B00FATEJYE|5|Really great game for mobile just encouraged friend to get this game for his phone and he likes it to
B008JFUORW|2|Not really good at all, should have just changed all the actors and gave a different name.
B006OCM0G0|5|this game is a great time killer. the only thing is that you can only expand so far without friends playing.
B009XHAM8G|2|Wasn't as great of a story as I heard it would be. I know it's a children's book, but it wasn't  the greatest...
B0063IH60K|4|good for killing time. goods for when you are trying to ignore someone. not a whole lot of fun but it has enough setting options to make it challanging and interesting.
B000FC2L1Y|5|A great continuation of an exciting saga.  This is every bit as good as the previous stories.  Keep them coming!
B00QW8TYWO|4|I think that this is the best game that I have ever played besides Minecraft but that is beside the point. I think that you should have little games on the side to earn coins instead to watch videos when you have WiFi or earning a free gift every couple of hours either that or you should lay more coins down in the playing field. Or you should bring down the price of characters in win a prize. But I'm seriously suggesting that you put small little games on the side so you you can earn more coins. It would have to be fun and not very long so that you can play in the car away from WiFi that is a great idea and in seriously suggesting that for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love this game, but I refuse to buy power ups and such so I get stuck for days at times! But it's a fun challenge!!
B002BWP49M|1|After suffer all the twilight movies (so far) for my wife (she insist on go the movies and watch this..things..) i can say, with all honesty, this saga is one of the worst craps i see on film.   There are only two ways to watch this, one is laughing loud of how awful this is, the other is seeing thru the eyes of a thirteen years old girl.   I dont see how this movies making money, i just depressing. Now, if you want a few laughs about a bad movie, super creppy (sort of handsome) young actors, really misoginist script and you really really hate womens, this is your movie. Dosnt hurt if you really hate vampires too, because this movie really take all a vampire should be and turn them into the gayiest people on earth, really any creature of the night must be ashame of been in any way related to this travesty. Anyway, a movie is as good as is screenplay, and in this case, the lack of it.

B000AJIF4E|5|There are some things in life that should be enjoyed as best you can. I believe one of those things is music. Having good headphones is key to private listening. What better headphones to listen to music in as close to the original form as possible but the Sony MDR-7605's? The industry has been singing praises for these headphones and, frankly, I can't help but join the chorus. These headphones give more clarity than any other headphone I have used, and I've used a lot of headphones in the past.<br /><br />So, why are they so good? I couldn't go into the scientific part as well as I would like so this is purely my anecdotal story. I like sound more than most around me. One could say I'm addicted to music. I'd been searching for a good pair of headphones for a long time. I'd settled with some Sony MDR-XB400s that Sony had graciously sent me for some really minor stuff I did for them but it just wasn't enough. I had tried the Bose, the Sennheisers, and the AudioTechnicas but none seemed quite right. Some had too much Bass, some didn't have any Bass, some couldn't play the highs very well, and some could only do the highs well. Overall, I had basically given up and was going to stick with the cheaper MDR-XB400s as they were more comfortable on the ear and did the best as all around good headphones. Now, not too long ago, a friend and I started geeking out on audio systems, receivers, speakers, and building your own home theater system with actual good stuff (no HTIBs). I really started to find out stuff I should've learned back when I was searching for a good set of headphones. One, Amplifiers are extremely useful, two, DACs are extremely useful for headphones. With some new knowledge, I went out to find a good set again.<br /><br />Now, since my last search, this search was much more precise. Before, I was only dabbling, now I was serious. I read all the blogs, I read all the forums (okay, I only read 4 enthusiast forums) and all pointed to either above 300 a pair if you could or the Sony-7605's. The warnings and caveats on the 7605 were that they played sound very close to how it was recorded which allows professionals t find the flaws and fix the flaws easier. The Bass isn't hard like most people want. I wanted something close to the original so I decided to grab the 7605's. I was blown away. I grabbed the 7605's with a DAC/AMP from FiiO, the E10K, and just wow. No Bass? I say it has the perfect level of Bass for my really heavy songs. Clarity? Wonderful at high ranges (some people do find the high highs a little headache inducing, I did not). Comfortable? I wore these for almost 9 hours straight during a blitz on a project, didn't even know they were still on my head when I finished. Sound blocking? Yeah, with sound playing, it's hard to hear the outside world even at low volume. They are large and not something I would walk around with on my head. I leave my old MDR-XB400s for that. Whether it be for recording with my Yeti Mic, or listening while I work, these headphones have another fan.<br /><br />I will add a note. Using these headphones on your computer without a good sound card is like putting the best chocolate in the world over old, almost rotting strawberries. It doesn't work. You do need a good soundcard or a DAC to use these headphones, or any higher quality headphones for that matter, to its real potential. I tested my desktop's sound card and it was horrible. If you do not have a good soundcard or DAC, you will not enjoy these headphones as much, or even dislike them. This doesn't apply to soundboards, studio microphones, or any other professional equipment. Also note, listening to 128Kbit MP3's is similar. Follow the Garbage in Garbage out principle and all will be well. Most people can't tell the difference between sound quality when you hit 256Kbits on an MP3. Going to FLAC/SA-CD may or may not make your listening experience better. Again, the science part is a little beyond my knowledge. The hidden effects ofhaving the entire range playing and how it affects the brain is oft argued. Just know, at least try to use 256Kbit MP3s. I use FLAC or 320Kbit MP3s. My hearing, scientifically measured, is better than most so I can tell a difference.<br /><br />A side benefit, not indicative of the quality of the headphones, is that I can connect them to my A/V receiver when I don't want to use my standing speakers while playing a game or watching a movie. The screw-on, 1/4 inch plug adapter is a wonderful thing. A wonderful thing indeed.having the entire range playing and how it affects the brain is oft argued.

B005ZOBNOI|4|This book has a lot of hype, and although it was very interesting I expected more. I'm a crier but this didn't hit me. It was a quick easy read. I still enjoyed it.
B0070Y46UY|4|The book starts out as a very descriptive insight into the life of Pi but the interesting part begins after the sinking of the ship. The end leaves the reader thinking about what really happened and how a teenager survived in the face of death.

B00I2TV3NO|3|No bad so so
B005LAIHPY|5|Great action.
B00AESN8XY|5|Fun game.  Great way to kill a few minutes
3866078161|5|Very cool absolute edition.  I love it!
B007XKEY6Q|5|So fun!  I would recommend this game to play with friends.  You don't really need to be an artist but I'm sure it helps.
B008JFUS0U|5|Seriously, though...who doesn't love Thor?  If you are reading this thinking &#34;me, i don't like Thor&#34;, than i don't recommend this for you....
B00DUGCLY4|5|Great way to pass time. Easy to use. Works great on my Kindle Fire!<br />I highly recommend this game. Keep up the good work
B00004WEJZ|4|1.)  Sean Connery's back in the role to which most people best associate him (would \\"Trainspotting\\" REALLY have been as good without the dialogue between Renton and Sick Boy in the park during the air rifle scene?)<br />><br />2.)  Film and special effects technology finally had finally caught up with the series by the time this movie was made.  As cool as Sean Connery was back in the shagadelic '60's, baby, the special effects in his movies were really second-rate.  They may have been a step up from the Godzilla movies of the era, but not by much.  The action in this movie seems to take place in real time rather than in a special effets lab.<br />><br />3.)  The supporting cast are awesome...former Blaxploitation superstar Bernie Casey may be the best CIA Operative Felix Leiter there's ever been; Rowan Atkinson (\\"Mr. Bean\\", to most of us Americans) is good as the hopelessly up-tight Nigel Small-Fawcett, and does anyone really need to be told just how hot Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are as a \\"Bond Girl\\" double-barrelled blast?<br />><br />4.)  THE PRICE!!!  With all the other MGM/UA Bond films weighing in at [price](or more), only Ted Turner himself can afford to own them.  This admitted re-make of \\"Thunderball\\" is not the best Bond movie out there...IMHO that distinction goes to \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" (sue me, I'm a hockey fan and I grew up during the Roger Moore years)...but for the price alone this is worth owning.  True, the classic \\"James Bond Theme\\" is missing, and it is a bit tacky seeing the jet-setters in tuxedoes and evening gowns playing \\"Centipede\\" instead of baccarrat (sp?), but this DVD is the James Bond film anyone can own...and regardless of what shortcomings other reviewers have attributed this effort, none of them fall on Sean Connery's (ample-as-ever) shoulders; give it a shot (with a Walther PPK or a union jack fountain pen)!
B00DR0PDNE|4|I love the simplicity of this product..price was right, it works fine and has the potential to do more..<br /><br />I was offered free shipping and that was a good deal, though I live 30 minutes from the distribution center and it took two days to get here as it's shipped by FEDEX to Memphis TN and then sent by USPS back to where I live in the south Nashville area...didn't quite make sense..wish there was a check box I could use as I live near a shipping center...
B00HEPDGKA|5|Love it.
B00CSR2J9I|4|Addicting fun game.

B009G7ZYPY|5|These are my favorite singers and they seem to always do their best, so they deserve the best rating. Susan Boyle is my very favorite singer ever, Jackie Evancho is the most wonderful child singer I have ever heard with an amazing voice. Josh Groban is the best male singer I know. I am a musician and piano teacher.
B000FBFN1U|5|If you've read the ASOIAF series you understand just how uniquely constructed and presented these books are.  If you haven't, and are in any way a fan of fantasy, historical fiction, and/or simply something different in today's world of &#34;nothing new under the sun&#34; entertainment, you simply must give this series a try.
B004A8ZWVK|4|If I had world enough and time (especially time!), I'd be one of those people who--when it came to comparing a movie to its source novel--could always state authoritatively which was better. I imagine that nine times out of ten, it really would be the book, BUT according to the critics, there have been numerous, and very notable, exceptions (THE GODFATHER, JAWS, M*A*S*H, among other--probably arguable--examples).  Well, I like to read and am an avid movie goer, but how often can I (or anyone living in the real world) say that we're even in a position to compare the two?  For me, book vs. movie is usually an either/or proposition.  I either haven't read the book prior to taking in the movie OR I read it so far in the past, that I've forgotten the plot.  So it was really by almost the sheerest of coincidences that I recently saw not ONE but two films based on books I'd only just read: THE HELP and the abbreviatedly entitled HEDGEHOG (why they downplayed its elegance is a mystery to me).  And, yes, both were reasonably faithful to the original's plotline and were obviously done with great respect--and maybe even love--for the source material, neither really captured the essence of the literary work that inspired it.  And both seemed too hasty, too choppy and underdeveloped.  I came away from them with a certain respect for the filmmakers' chutzpah in trying to adapt serious, idea-rich literature to the big screen but wondering if it's really worth the effort.  When I read Kathryn Stockett's THE HELP, it really didn't seem all that sprawling a novel.  Stockett was able to juggle the various plotlines handily, and in truth, they all did interrelate to a large degree. (It's Skeeter's concern of the fate of her own family's maid, Constantine, that inspires to seek out the personal stories of Jackson's other \\"colored\\" maids and relate them to the rest of the world.  One storyline feeds off the other in a very real sense.  Even the Celia Foote sub-plot which might sound kindof schematic and obvious in outline form(girl from the wrong side of the tracks--or the town line--is as much an object of scorn as any of \\"the help\\"), but Celia is too loveable and vividly portrayed to be simply a plot device.  In general, the book's relatively leisurely pace gives us as much time as we need to get to know its numerous characters.  In all fairness, that's an almost insurmoutnable task to set before a filmmaker.  You can't tell EVERYONE's story in just over two hours.  You can hint at those stories, but almost all the characters are going to end up cheated on some level or other.  Everything about the film version of THE HELP seems too rushed, too obvious and a tad awkward. Every line seems rushe: every emotion telegraphed. Even Skeeter's unruly, frizzy hair seems fake.  It's like a bad perm.  (If actress Emma Stone really DOES have naturally curly hair, I'll eat my toupee.)  And, really, she's just too pert and petite and, yeah, PRETTY to effectively play the oft-times socially and physically awkward Skeeter.  When I heard that Jessica Chastain would be appearing in THE HELP, I thought that she would be ideal for the role of Skeeter and was surprised to learn that she would be portraying Celia.  Ms. Chastain is a skillful actress who seems to transform herself physically for her roles:  she's really quite attractive in a way that some might describe as \\"handsome,\\" she has that kind of coltish athleticism that the role of Skeeter would seem to require.  As it turns out, she's also quite good as the sexy, skittish Celia.  She is clearly a young actress to watch, in every sense of the word.  Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer bring real depth to what you could call their \\"title roles.\\"  Of course, Aibileen and Minny were co-narrators in the novel, so you would hope and expect their characters to be among the more developed ones in the film.  But Skeeter's role in the novel is just as significant, and the film really doesn't do justice by her.  Davis, especially, gets the screen time she needs to develop the character of Aibileen and establish her as the film's cornerstone.  It's understandable that the filmmakers give Aibileen the spotlight, I suppose.  She is the film's sole narrator, and that's a justifiable choice.  The novel's three different voices would have been impossible to convey cinematically. One of those voices HAS to become dominant, and in 2011 you can say it's pretty much high time that that dominant voice be the one offering the African American perspective.  That's one of many things that the film really does get right.  It's clear that the project was a labor of love on the part of director Tate Taylor.  I only learned recently that Taylor and Stockett are close friends and that the filmmaker had started development on the project even before the novel was finished.  In a way, that surprised me though, since even his \\"insider perspective\\" didn't seem to prevent him from taking apparent shortcuts that often don't work and sometime come a cropper, the botch of a job telling Constantine's story, for instance.   Taylor can count on his stellar cast to help him get over many of the awkward moments.  Bryce Dallas Howard somehow is able to inject a bit of humanity into the otherwise despicable character of Hilly.  In the book, Hilly was a devoted mother at least, and in her own way, something of a caring friend to Skeeter.  The script, by contrast, doesn't offer much insight into Hilly's inner workings. But Howard is somehow able to convey something of Hilly's human-ness, despite those limitations.  She makes Hilly a little less of a caricature than the role might otherwise have been.  Which is not to say that she doesn't DESERVE that pie...
0679731725|5|The Japanese-English author has done an amazing job portraying the inner-struggle of such a quintessential English character.<br />Hats off to Mr. Ishiguro.
B00005QDW1|1|I know this has been said countless times, but is this the same group that did the past four albums? It can't be. I grew up listening to this band, Tragic Kingdom was the first album I ever bought, back when I was just nine years old. But now, they've gone from ska to......hip hop? Are you people deaf? How can you say they DIDN'T sell out? Why would they even think of doing something like going hip hop? How would they think their rock fans were going to react to this? What would the late Sublime frontman Bradley Nowell say if he saw them today? Even by standards of pop, or hip hop, or whatever this crap is called, it's still awful. The lyrics downright horrible (refer to \\"Hey Baby\\"), they have reggae singers now (remember, this used to be a ska band) and the songs have awful hip hop beats. What the hell? Sure, they're more popular now than ever, more power to them, then. They were obviously shooting for a teeny-bopper image instead, and that's just what they got. I wouldn't be surprised to see them on tour with Justin Timberlake and/or Britney Spears sometime soon (if they haven't already).<br />R.I.P. - No Doubt
B0027MJU00|4|I like the author's style of writing, each chapter delving deeper into each character's personality, views & actions.But at times it got a little gruesome for me. The investigation, however, kept my interest going right to the end.
B004FOA84A|5|i thought this was going to be a dumb game but it actually turned out to be one the the funnest i have ever played on a mobile phone  it really gets you to stop think, and observe.
B00CATSONE|5|Super short but very interesting.
0064471837|5|I read this book when I was in middle school and have re-read it so many times I am now on my third copy of the paperback. Nix creates a wonderful and fully realized world with interesting cultural details. I loved his take on magic and the rings of death that Sabriel has to travel. The explanations of the different bells that Sabriel uses to control and dispel the dead is so wonderful.<br />It really feels like you are stepping into another world. And the main character Sabriel is immediately likeable. She is funny, smart, and determined.<br /><br />Even better than this book is the trilogy occupying the same world.
B009KEN87O|3|Its fun in a pinch when u gotta kill a few min. But to play for long-  no weno at all
B000FBFN1U|5|I just love this series.  The only problem is that when I first started to read it, I didn't realize the series is unfinished.  I'm really hoping that the author is able to finish all the books.  So you will be good and hooked by the time you finish the last one out (book 5), but then you'll have to hang out waiting, with the rest of us!
B00012QM8G|3|I disagree with the majority of viewers.  This is no masterpiece.  It is a pretty good movie with a story that is moving. <br />Spielberg never uses subtlety.  He hits you over the head with each point and I find it insulting to a viewer's intelligence.  Shots linger too long... characters explain their actions..<br />If you can get over Spielberg's in your face style this is a great and sometimes moving story.  The acting is above average but nowhere near approaches the performances in &quot;Sophie's Choice\\", &quot;Europa, Europa&quot; or even the made for TV mini series &quot;Holocaust&quot;<br />This movie is worth seeing but given the choice I would first view the others I have mentioned.
B00P7PBD2C|5|Great take on sleeping beauty. This ones a keeper
B008JGSM6G|5|This game is great for killing some time. The object is to connect dots across the gridded game board. While this seems simple at first it gets very complex in later levels
B00DU74U74|3|I watched this right after finishing the book and so many key elements from the book were missing.  I am glad I read the book first, because if I had watched it prior, it would not have made much sense and I would have been very disappointed.  Character development is not even close to what it needed to be.
B00881VLCE|5|I enjoy doing puzzles, I also like my pets.  Unfortunately my pets have too much fun with my regular puzzles so being able to do them on the computer or my Kindle makes it easier for me.
B0036BK6MW|5|In this port-rail of Leigh Anne Tuohy, it is not just one of profound love but of supreme motherhood in the most endearing way.<br />If your a mother or if your a son; watching this story... it WILL only enhance your appreciation for the power of a woman, the kind of power that can't be applied in battle but surely will instill piece in hearts of men every where... GOD BLESS the nurturing nature of a powerful woman. With out it, real men are lost!
0156027321|5|I really love this book. Despite seeing the movie, the book has so much more information in it and similar to other movies that are based off books, the book's storyline is way more in depth and complicated.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Useful piece of tech that needs to be a standard across the TV industry. Highly recommend.
B00HME4I0A|2|It was OK for its audience
B00HY7VU60|5|Excellent!
B007A4SDCG|2|The beginning of this book is good, talks about (and personifies) &#34;Resistance&#34;, which is pretty much anything that stops you getting art done. The final section went right off the rails though.
B0094LYJZI|1|Totally a waste of time, storyline is not exciting, acting is subpar.  Normally I enjoy shows like this but I barely got through it.
B00E8KLWB4|5|This game is really fun so far, as I am still learning how to get to the pictures to complete them,hopefully I can figure out how to get to them, but enjoy the many levels of this game. Really enjoy finding the hidden objects.
B005R32L66|5|Love it
B001NLKXK2|4|This is a well written, poignant story of the awful progress of Altzheimers disease.  Ms. Genova describes well the variety of responses of the people in Alice's life.  Alice comes alive as an intelligent fighter against the inevitable destruction of her remarkable mind.  I cried and I laughed.
B00AKKTDJY|4|it is a wonderful game because it keeps me occupied for awhile then if I get bored I just get new furniture like New doors more chairs and better food. the only thing I don't like is how mad the ccustomers get when they don't get food. how should I ccontrol it. other than that it is a wonderful game
B000E6UK5K|4|David has given us something special. There is no doubt that after 18 years from his last solo album and nothing since the last Floyd Album (93) we have had a major dead spell by anyone from Floyd.     Well Dave is an older man and his talents have only aged like a fine wine. Sure he doesn't have rockin' out tunes like you find from the 70's but more an element of the age of all his works. This is a mellow album with the licks of his unmistakable and original guitar works. This is very much like a Floyd album without being one and if you are a fan of his or Pink Floyd, you will enjoy this. 20 years from now, you will uncork that bottle and enjoy it just as much..this is a timeless piece.
B00ESNE696|5|The only predictable thing about the Good Wife is that it is always fun to watch! Season Five is full of plot twists. Will's death was a complete shock. How did that remain a secret on the web! Diane is more elegant than ever. David remains completely obnoxious except for the very touching scene when he learned of Will's death. Alan Cumming is just fabulously Alan Cumming. Great writing and cast. Love seeing Nathan Lane and Michael J. Fox back. Please bring back Patti Nyholm for an episode or two! She is so perfectly annoying and funny! Hope Matthew Goode is a regular. Happy to see that there will be a Season Six. What is in store for Alicia and Peter!!!
B00HUCF6KK|5|So good!
B00000099Y|5|If you are an elite Tool fan, you will admit that this is indisputably their finest effort to date. Undertow, Lateralus are God-like and even Opiate is superb as well however I am sick of you Tool newbs not realizing that Aenema is simply unrivaled by Lateralus and Undertow. <br /> <br />It's not that its my opinion, its a fact, sorry.
B008GXHOFW|1|this game is a rip off all u do is pay money and watch a 30 second video and then it crashes and turns black and just goes back to home page. I try over and over again but nothing I wish I could fix it DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! I wish there was a 0 star choice!!!!!!!! arrggg :(
B00K0OI42W|5|This is a thought provoking book. I must admit it makes me feel bad how we sometimes treat others so poorly. It has made me reevaluate how I treat those different from me.  I am glad that it is required reading is so many of our schools.  Great book & a must read.
B003WUYRGI|5|This book is about learning the meaning of words and why it is important to learn the English speech and the English language.
B00HB62MC0|5|Just wow! I love everything about this author, who in my opinion is one of the most humble, gracious and hysterical human beings on the earth and boy can she write the heck out of a love story. I cried my eyes out over Miles, I loved Tate beyond words and when I closed the book when the story was finished I thought of the two of them for days. Loved every moment of my time with Ugly Love.
B00BHHIWQO|5|This is the game that I have been waiting for to play.. I wish I had time and the money to play all the time.
0307476464|5|This story is unique and different. It took me awhile to realize it is not true! The author has a great imagination. It is one of a kind story. I do a lot of reading by Japanese authors and find them to be unique in their story telling. I could not put it down.
B0063GORYU|5|This game is just challenging enough for everyone.  With so many choices you can keep the fun going for along time
B004XKVPG6|5|An all star cast and a fantastic story with a surprise ending makes this movie a must see!
B001AQO3QA|5|I love the way this set has been put together as a collector`s box complete with behind the scene`s footage consisting of 2 disc`s also a small booklet inside the rear pocket. The quality of both picture and sound on my Sony blu ray is awesome no glitches and all is crystal clear. A box set that is absolutely value for money.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Wish the game was longer....... freaking awesome game! I would play this game also day , or on my PlayStation.
B008BM9L72|5|Once you start reading you won't want to leave it down! Gripping, romantic, erotic all at the same time. A book that I wished never finished and would easily read over and over and over again!
B00CSR2J9I|4|It's not real car racing stimulator. But driving this funny car is interesting. It's possible to upgrade your car: buy 4wd, good wheels, etc. I like to play this game. Try You too :)
B0015AARJI|5|It works like a champ.  Has a good weight to it compared to the sixaxis.
B00DPM7TIG|5|What an amazing and very powerful book. It's very intense and very beautifully written. I unequivocally give it five stars!
B008Y2X78S|5|Can't wait till next season.  Left me wanting more.
B000QCQ8Y4|4|As usual a well thought out plot and an enjoyable read<br />Childs never disappoints in a well crafted book  Can't wait for the next one
B00028HBKM|5|you will love this movie its so real like and will move you. you will sit and cry all the way to the end. you will see how<br />much of pain that christ went though. be careful about small children watching this movie. it has alot of  bad parts in it<br />it show how christ was beat and his body with blood all over him. and when they nail him to the cross. these parts are so bad. not for children to watch. this movie will make you stop and think how much pain he went though for us. it changed my life.
B00L9B7IKE|4|A great fast paced psychological thriller. Enjoyed the multiple perspectives of character views as well as the development of possible villians
0517147688|3|This is a lovely volume of Jane Austen's work and I would've given it 5 stars if there were less typographical errors dotted throughout the entire book.
0143119680|4|Book Description<br /><br />A witch who rejected her magic after the brutal death of her parents, Diana Bishop is a historian researching alchemy at Oxford. One day in the Bodleian library, she calls up a manuscript called Ashmole 782 that has been bewitched. Unnerved and frightened by the manuscript, she returns it to the stacks. However, her actions have not gone unnoticed--she's drawn the attention of other creatures (witches, vampires and daemons) who flock to the library. It turns out that Diana has unwittingly found the lost manuscript that contains the secrets about the origins of creatures. Ashmole 782 is much desired but has been lost for centuries--protected by powerful magic that has kept it safe until Diana unearthed it. As various creatures begin to position themselves to seize the manuscript, Diana finds an unlikely ally and protector in a 1,500-year-old vampire named Matthew Clairmont. Although she's been warned to never trust a vampire, Diana finds herself confused by her feelings for Matthew. As her relationship with Matthew develops and a war for the manuscript begins to take shape, Diana is forced to examine her past, accept her powerful witch heritage and confront her feelings about her own magical abilities.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />This was an enjoyable read but--and I can't believe I'm saying this--it was no Twilight. I really didn't get all hung up on Matthew like I did on Edward Cullen (which might say more about me than it does about the book). Although I enjoyed the fun that Harkness has with witches, vampires and daemons, the book didn't generate much heat (sexual or otherwise). Everything seemed to happen too fast and easily. At one point, Diana gets into a bit of a jam but then tada! she gets out of it pretty easily. I guess I needed her to suffer more or for Diana and Matthew to experience more angst. It sounds like a strange thing to say, but what I guess I'm getting at is that I didn't feel a sense of danger or menace in the books to give it emotional heft.<br /><br />What was most enjoyable about the book was how Harkness reimagined the various creatures of witches, vampires and daemons. One of my favorite parts was the house owned by Diana's aunts. The house has feelings and gets ready for visitors by creating new rooms for them to stay in. Another fun aspect was when Diana decides to prepare a meal for Matthew and tries to figure out how to cook for a vampire.I think Harkness tried to create more modern believable  back stories for creatures, but she doesn't quite have the imagination and fun that, say, J.K. Rowling had with the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />Another area that might appeal to readers of a certain type was the historical tidbits that Harkness throws into the mix. It is obvious that she did some research to provide Diana with a plausible career as a historian studying the history of alchemy. The book is full of historical references, and Matthew is forever making casual references along the lines of \\"Oh Pope Blah Blah Blah... yeah, he was a vampire.\\"<br /><br />Readers should also know that this is the first book of a planned trilogy. I was under the impression it was a standalone book and, as I was reading, I kept thinking \\"How in the world is she going to wrap this up in the pages remaining?\\" It wasn't until the final pages--which ends with a very big cliffhanger--that I realized this was the first book in a series. The second book is out now (Shadow of Night), and while I do plan on reading it at some point, I didn't rush out to get it.books to give it emotional heft.<br /><br />What was most enjoyable about the book was how Harkness reimagined the various creatures of witches, vampires and daemons.

0452295548|5|I first heard of this person, and her book, while watching a TED Talk that she gave about this. If you've never seen it, watch it...and then buy the book. Dr. Bolte Taylor's incredible journey, described in intimate detail, will take you through so many details about the brain and how it works, and then go on to describe the events that led to the writing of this book. What she saw...what she experienced...can only be described as wondrous. The initial chapters about the brain can bog you down a bit, especially if that type of stuff doesn't interest you. However, once you get to the part about her stroke, and the resultant experiences she had, that all changes.
B00GINENG0|5|This cool game is a great way to keep kids busy. Even if you are an adult you will love this game.
B00992CF6W|5|Awesome for on the go minecraft. Wish it was a little more like pc version. Like a Redstone update would be awesome. But great app otherwise!
