B001KQB624|5|Fit like factory but stronger as it is metal. Took less than 5 mins to install.
B00VHOE3RE|5|As a Service Maager, this is the best tool that I have used for opening iPhones and Android devices!
B00BGBUNOA|4|Looks real good on the car. The 2 bolts on the outside of the spoiler match up real well but it leaves inner holes under the brake light exposed. Nothing a color matched piece of vinyl won't fix. This is for the 2011 SS.
B000C936EQ|5|Worked great on my 92 Jeep cherokee laredo.
B00VHE76GE|5|Quick delivery and very convenient carry case. Have not tried out the cables but they look well built. It even comes with a metal brush to clean it with. Great convenience, length, and price.
B00FY0S61Q|5|I just got back from a trip to San Marcos Texas, and on the way home, we happened to go over newly laid asphalt on the highway. When I got home, I realized that my new vehicle had tar splatters all over. I immediately went to an auto parts store to purchase tar remover, but after several hours of constant wiping, my vehicle looked the same. The instant this product arrived, I applied it to the vehicle. To my surprise, the stuck on tar began dissolving instantaneously. After 30 minutes, my vehicle looked brand-new again. I will recommend and purchase this products over and over again.
B00WMK3O7W|4|These mats are great! They are sturdy, fit my Ford Escape perfectly, and shipped quickly.<br />My only complaint is the strong rubber smell that they had in the beginning. Other than that, they were a great deal and very high quality.
B002ZTNVB4|5|This is great.  It makes it a little harder to get into the stow in go, but well worth it.  The other downfall is the edge is very high, but it does keep any liquid spilled on the mat.  Fits perfectly!  With 4 kids and two dogs, this is a lifesaver!
B000E7SY16|5|Good selection of Bungee cords
B0009OMYDS|5|This is a well built brush. I was going to use it on my lug nuts but it is too stiff but the brush is good for cleaning parts off.
B00B0C121I|2|So....  I'm installing the last pad of the entire brake job and the wire spring on one of the front pads comes off launching itself to who-knows-where.  It was never found, so I was forced to use one of the old front brake pads to complete this job.  Upon closer inspection there is another pad with a spring held on by a very questionable peening job.  The materials of this kit seem to be good, but hard to give it more than two stars when the manufacturing job is sloppy.
B002E58QGO|1|Collar too long for a samurai  transmission. Connector incorrect. Not close enough. Return.
B001FIDNGO|5|great help to my excursion seat belt, quick delivery!
B00VDQNELW|5|Best thing that I have bought for my jeep. I absolutely love it!!! I would buy again.
B0000BX6Q7|5|Best product ever!
B0024ESKHA|5|Worked in my 2006 chevy cobalt. EASY replacement...
B00279F67E|2|tired of china parts and shipping took 11 dayes
B00LNK43FY|4|Plain black license plate frame
B000SL4A84|4|Comes with all the essentials you need in an accident (except for flashlight, markers, and pen with notepad) all in a very convenient case. Ships quickly too.
B00802EYAW|5|These are great. I can't really speak to the life of these lights cause I've only had any of the Kensun lights for a couple weeks but I installed the high beams in my 2011 Tahoe tonight and they are awesome. They do take a few seconds to heat up as do the rest of the HID's I have on my truck which isn't a problem but if you are wanting the high beams to be super bright right away then these won't do that for you. It isn't like a stock set up where they are crazy bright immediately. But after a few seconds they are ridiculously bright. I am very happy with all of the Kensun products I've purchased and I have already recommended them to other people. The installation was very easy, the only issues I had was finding room for the ballast on the passenger side. It was plug and play for my vehicle and I couldn't be happier with the color and the final brightness. One of the wires was loose in the connector which caused the passenger light to fail but it just took some wiggling and some electrical tape. I'm a 22 year old female and I got asked last week who installed my low beams because guys assumed I wouldn't have been able to do it myself, and while I am very handy these headlights couldn't have been easier. I included some pictures to show the before and after color and overall brightness. I have these Kensun high beams with the Kensun low beams and Kensun fog lights
B008Y9KEW8|5|My 2006 chevy cobaly was locking/unlocking itself all the time. Even while I was driving!!! Replaced the lock switches on both the passenger and driver side and my problem is solved
B003LFPY5M|5|Worked perfectly. Instructions were easy to follow. Thanks BD Diesel!
B007G2IN04|5|Mount holds the grill perfectly. Has not slid or warped or anything. It will scar the railing. I tried to put rubber around to protect it, but to no avail.<br /><br />Suggestion: find a better mounting system than screws. Every time I take the grill off to bring ashore for a BBQ or when the boat is unattended, I'm unscrewing it over the ocean since it hangs off the railing. I once dropped a screw and by the grace of Poseidon it landed on the 3/4&#34; lip at the bottom of the transom. There's gotta be a better way.
B00JKMKZJA|5|Seat covers fit perfectly very hard to tell they are not factory great job cal trend. I've had them on for a month holding up great so far.
B00JK327VS|5|I received this item at a discounted amount and I would like to leave my unbiased opinion.<br />Included in my review are 5 pictures of the item once I opened the package it arrived in. It has a zipper bag that holds the jumper cables in place. I can't recall ever seeing jumper cables coming in a case with a handle to carry. These cables make my current cables look soo flimsy and weak from appearance. 500 amp jumper cables.. The black and red colors are bright and bold, it can sure stand a long life of use and I doubt it will get dull or fade. The design on these cables are very well put together. The teeth on the clamps look no where near my old ones, the clamps teeth are rigid. The clamp itself is not bendable. The power of these cables are astounding, I use these on my car to jump my neighbors truck, usually it takes a while for a car to jump a truck, with these bad boys it took less than 5 minutes. Most certainly will be a life saver for anyone that needs a jump due to car battery dying!! It is now in my trunk of my car and I vow to never leave anywhere without it!
B0012SCX5O|4|Clever gadget. Didnt know i needed one until i saw this one. Bought one of each size.
B00AZ4R1OO|5|Best Window Visor I owned. Comes safe and clean
B00D9H0D3A|5|Fit my road King turn signals very well. Great price too.
B00JIIZCM6|5|works well for car seats
B001DSIIOS|5|Looks nice
B000VU0IRE|4|As described
B001FEISS6|1|leaves oily streaks that i have to wipe off with spray detailer everyday. not a good wax. time to find a new one that doesnt involve daily buffing.
B005SVXQS4|5|woked as dexribed love being able to change my nav while driving
B005FKRB70|1|This product was filtered by Amazon to fit my 2012 Mazda 3i Touring.  It did not fit.  Wasted time and thankfully no money with this purchase since my mechanic was generous enough not to charge me for the time.
B00DZ357ES|4|Bike starts right up after installing this battery. no issues.
B00BSV325A|5|Great touch
B00D7T4LX8|5|So cute, and quite painful if used! I love this keychain! Whenever I show it to my friends, they chuckle at it because it's a pink kitty, but that's because they don't realize how much it can actually pack a punch! I haven't had to use it yet thankfully, but my friends have told me how it actually hurts when I've poked them gently with it. So, it's definitely good to keep on hand. Just don't go to airports with them.
B00I5HOD9O|5|Only one issue. If you put in the studs first as I did, it is very hard to align with the holes because it is a very tight fit. Putting in the studs after placement requires some sort of method or a helper to hold it in place. Once the top studs and nuts are on, the bottom would be a piece of cake. I guess if you put in the back stud and can manage to get the nut on from under the car, you can put in the other two from the top.<br />Check engine light is now off, YEA!<br /><br />Oh yea, get new seals/gaskets when you order this. I destroyed one and had to go to the dealer to get a replacement at dealer prices. They are a filled hollow steel ring that fits into a groove. Not easy to fabricate. AutoZone and Advance do not carry these seals.
B00VFWOUGW|4|Product was very good.
B00139YMUQ|1|Buyer beware... My husband LOVED this when it arrived.  He put it up and went to use it again 45 days later (after only using it once) and its not working.  It is giving the wrong reading.  I was really disappointed because it was an awesome handy thing for the five minutes he was able to use it.
B000JZDO68|1|another part for 1998 Volvo that does not fit as indicated that it does this is for a two wheel drive or front wheel drive not a all wheel drive need to get your description straight and know how a vehicle is designed before saying parts fit. Example this is like putting this part in a 4 wheel drive truck that is for a two wheel drive, one has a transfer case the other doesn't  It wont fit so in description it will not fit a all wheel drive and a two wheel drive one has a transfer the other doesn't.
B00N2ZFLGS|5|Perfect fit on my '09 M8
B00BVQ5S3Q|5|works great
B003V9XYNW|5|Easy and effective
B000EPP6X2|5|Perfect fit for my 2009 Hummer H3.  Had a hard time finding the right piece after my local carwash broke off my antenna.
B00KTJ1SBM|4|Very good replacement for the broken ones for my Grand Marquis.
B00BCR60U4|4|The fit is big for a mercery mariner.  The straps to hold the cover to seat are very cheaply made and I broke two of them installing the seat covers.  Very comfortable and looks great!
B004J9J5EK|5|Fast delivery, great price, and good product
B001W9OSRE|3|It is a good buy for the price, but does not fit so well or I would say no good way to secure everything in place. I used it on my 2004 Cavalier.
B00WNCX2D0|3|I am unable to use or see any split option
B007XB4R80|5|Great Thank you.
B002QFGHOA|4|did as it should works fine..
B00V6F023S|5|Purr-fect! Easy to apply, looks great.
B00UJ82TAC|1|Never worked
B00OIABUMK|4|Came as described by the holes did not fit my 45hp 'Johnson so I had to drill them out a little bit to get it to fit properly.
B00B1G9788|4|it is supposed to work with the Prius and did with the exception of the back piece which, if installed, would prohibit the middle cup holder arm rest from being accessed.
B009FUFD1C|3|If you're just going to use these for drying dishes other light interior housework, they're probably fine. I use microfiber cloths regularly to help dry my car after a wash, and these are by far the flimsiest, most unimpressive cloths I've ever worked with. They're very thin and light so their water absorption potential is low. I can see these things getting thrashed easily with repeated use. I've moved on to other, thicker, more heavy-duty brands of microfiber clothes.
B001EOWQY4|5|Works good.would recommend
B00KTP4138|5|Work great, easy to install!
B00FPTMI3S|1|Nothing special about it still need just as much scrubbing as anything else
B00COYNZJ8|1|Large bubble has formed in middle after several months if use.  Not worth it.  Poorly made.
B008CE09L6|5|It was just what was looking for.<br />thank you
B007RVR4SQ|5|Very good product, it fits perfectly to my Nissan Murano 2006
B00M4A3ZTC|5|My mom saw this on my husbands car and really liked it.  I got it for her birthday.  She is older and it's always hard to buy for her - a person can only have so many slippers and socks - LOL  I like that it is a stick on because her last magnet one was stolen off her car!
B00MV9OBE4|3|Good bulbs, but the color temperature, though rated at 4300k is more like 2700k after the bulb is on for more than 15 seconds...which is a disappointment.
B005R6R6DG|4|Does the job! Good brand.
B000N4UQL6|5|works great, very powerful
B000N5RCKI|5|AS EXPECTED
B00IO9CIYU|4|Good work fine no noises or vibrations if you know how to install brakes properly
B004CHBM6S|5|Nice enhancement to the steering level on my Hobie.
B00AU8XCOS|5|So easy to install and it looks great with my new steering wheel.
B010RIDGVE|5|Nice quality stickers.....Getting lots of action with these! Will order again
B000BV823K|5|The seat cover fits perfectly on my Hyundai Santa Fe!!!
B00B0QWXW6|5|Great product, durable,  doesn't block the view of your plates. It gives a nice look to the front of my car.
B001O0TZ7E|3|Did not come with installation clips as the title promised, what a crock
B0006FKFMC|4|The instructions included get you started but play with it some and you'll figure out how to make it work best.  Very pleased with it once I got it figured out.
B000SL4AA2|5|I use this for high pressure racing wheels on my bicycles, works great.
B003TUCFT2|4|It has been only few months, but so far so good. Very quick delivery.
B000WK8CSU|5|Worked Great!!! Easy to install. Perfect for my cycle.
B0089K9NH4|1|Was the wrong key, can use the key, but not the remote.
B00N463R3Y|5|looks great on club cart
B00JAOAFRA|5|Excellent!
B002ZBWKAU|5|I'm using for tires and bicycles. It's great and inexpensive
B00MAMTXZ4|5|Best price and fast shipping .
B00279M7UI|1|Wrong for my car, wish I saved packaging so I could return it, wasted my money!
B00QSPU0NS|4|Waiting to use it this winter
B00367IMOK|4|Nice.
B000LV9RNY|5|These wiper blades are exact replacement units for those on my 2012 Ford Explorer.  I pulled off an old blade and in very small letters somewhere on the rubber was the name Valeo.  The Explorer has a unique snap on attachment system and I'm sure you could get one of the common adapters sent with new blades to work but these are direct drop in replacements. Very glad I figured this out.  Blades were competitively priced and excellent quality
B0039LDB8A|5|Perfect tools for the trail. Nice and light.
B00230CVS4|5|Great!
B00IPS0LI0|5|Works as advertised....
B000XQ2S4M|4|Good product, arrived on time as scheduled. :)
B008MZPTJW|2|The lack part starts to bubble after a while, and the steering wheel one sticks on like a sticker, not very secure. Same with the wheel ones
B00JEUHSXY|5|Perfect fit in my 2009 Patriot.  Look much better than the factory floor mats and protect the carpet from slush and mud.  Highly recommended!
B00HJEGQQ2|4|Would have given a 5 star, but had to discover that I needed diodes on the tail light side to prevent internal cross-talk from the brakes to the tail lights to my headlights on my Golf Cart. Had to track down problem on the internet that others had the same problem. Once the diodes were installed, everything worked great. They do blink faster than incandescent, but on my Golf Cart, I really don't care, lol.
B0049CK5PK|4|Good tight fit.  A little hard to close, that is good
B00FGXEAW0|5|verry bright works great
B00BGUMF9W|5|Perfect replacement for original.
B002TS2ZSG|1|Horrible item
B00EECM5FI|3|They work but not better than any other brand.
B00E9IFAQI|5|Perfect!
B002RPJWSW|5|Looks and fits great!
B002OP8WLI|3|The switch assembly is cheaply made, but worked nicely.  I ended up replacing and the original unit with a 3 function switch.  The four brackets have worked out well, having been modified on a grinder to fit very specific places.  One of the electrical studs on the flasher broke off with almost no bending pressure applied.  A standard auto flasher will slip into the rubber mounting bracket, which proved to be quite handy.  Didn't use the mounting studs supplied.
B00MIDWSIO|4|Missing the black plugs
B003PJGC3M|5|Great add on to Impala 2009. Bolted right on with little issues.
B00B9LDD08|4|I think I just didn't read carefully I thought it also came with hardware but oh well overall the latches are perfect no more bottle cap windows
B0012WHBSO|5|Good portable compressor L love it Fast shiping.
B008E7U4QG|5|Good. 100% be perfect thank you
B00429NKWK|4|Although the process took longer than was advertised, that could have been because I was learning on the job. Overall, the instructions were clear and easy to follow and the end result was true to their claim. My headlights look good as new & I would buy this product again if/when the need arises.
B00U868BN4|2|You can get the same one for 2$ off eBay, but honestly I don't smell any ionized brand new car smell or anything so I'm not sure if it's working.
B001IGBIAG|5|worked great for me and my artic cat 500 4x4 atv im 300 pounds and ive had no problems so far and I use them a couple times a week
B001A0J2JO|5|This is a great mirror.  It's way longwe than I thought it would be.  Possibly better to use in a truck.  But it gives you a great wide angle view.
B00R9VNBAO|5|Fast shipping and looks great!!!
B004I170FU|5|It fit perfectly Nd we couldn't have been happier with the process.
B00YWTDWT6|5|Excellent product ,used as reading lamps in RV.
B000JZZ8CG|5|Perfect match for my 2009 Pontiac G6. Snaps in, slightly difficult if you have remnants of the pre-existing antenna. The picture has some shine looking slightly gray but don't be fooled it is in fact black. Hint: prior to installation, use a razor or flat head screw driver to scrape away any pre-existing adhesive on the antenna base, the base should be flat with the center &#34;T horseshoe&#34; slide-in. You may use a thin layer of poly-adhesive designed for plastics to make a more secure connection if you're worried about the antenna being knocked off or &#34;removed&#34;. Be sure not to damage the base, as this part will cost about $85.00 to replace.
B00DMTTSIQ|1|Very cheaply made plastic junk. When I tried to install them the grommet that is supposed to secure them to the floor fell apart. I would never put anything this poorly made in my new truck. Don't waste your money on these.
B00ENXUIKC|5|Thank you for the fastest shipping. I set up the machine at my car, the machine is working well and color matches with my car color. This is good product.
B00FLKIKQA|5|Love it!
B005HMHVSA|5|Awesome!!! I bought these for my 2011 Mazda 3 hatchback. I requested the dome light be red and the rest white, and they were able to work with me. The seller is completely legit, as this is the second time I have ordered from them. The lights are long lasting, bright, and plug and play. Would immediately order again, and most likely will should I buy another car. Good job!
B009K4G8GM|5|OEM Oil filter save me some money buying in bulk, I own a Pilot and Civic and they both use the same filter.
B000G72UOQ|5|The super jumbo sunshade fits my 2012 Honda Civic very well.  the quality is good, and they fold up easily for storage.  I wish the silver surface was more reflective, but they work very well and stow very easily.  I haven't found anything better, and the cost is very reasonable.
B00KTIYXLU|5|great price easy install sure beats the dealer.
B0000BVELA|5|Bien bueno
B00LEB6D1E|5|Awesome
B002X709OA|1|I triple checked to make sure this was the right item for my car. My mechanic checked and agreed as well. Item looked real nice and pretty when it arrived.  BUT, the diameter on the factory compressor in my car was 5 and 3/8 inch and the diameter on this one is 5 and 9/16 inch which is right about 3/16 of an inch too big. The belt doesn't stretch 'that' much and did not fit, which wasn't found out until the evening when parts stores are closed. So a day later without a car and an extra $38 for a bigger sized belt (which a few had to be tried to find one that fits) I received my car back.
B001G9CJQW|4|This is a must have for the Excursion. I was going to sell mine because of how poorly it handled towing our camper. Since adding this sway bar 90% of the towing problems are resolved.
B000C5A0A8|5|Perfect fit. Easy to install along with the strut insert. Good quality. I rebuilt the front end on my 73 super beetle and it drives like new. I have trusted Moog products for years and will continue to do so.
B009LLUVHG|5|Simple purchase with no surprises or disappointments.. just like I wanted.
B00DH66HGA|5|'Merica
B00QSGOWJA|4|Installation would be nearly impossible without an additional set of hands. Once you get somone to help you it was a breeze and took less than 10mins. I love that this does not utilize 2 sided tape and there is no anxiety about it flying off at highway speeds and / or cracking the windshield. Beautiful product!
B008Y8M4NQ|1|Did not fit at all and the return process isn't even worth all the damn trouble I would recommend you to purchase elsewhere as I did ! Wasn't money
B000WJEY8S|5|Great American made hour meter ... Accurate & I have used one for several Years ...
B00LVIII5O|4|Gift and the person loves it
B00029WYEY|5|Great product, easy to use. Read all instructions and follow, you will have no problem using this cleaner kit. I have more than enough to clean a second time and re-oil my filter. Once you clean your filter with the cleaner, let it air dry completely prior to spraying the oil on the filter. I let mine dry about 5 hours in the sun, in which it did just fine. Man, once the filter was clean, my truck seemed to ramp up in HP again, and of course the sound it generates is awesome. My MPG has increased as well.<br />Good product/Great price - You can't go wrong with K&N cleaner for a K&N Cold air intake filter.<br />Shipping was fast, accurate, and protected very well.
B0051SUM9U|5|An awesome set of steps and inexpensive. They are made very well and should last for a long time. I bought a set for our new jeep and likd them so much ordered theae for my new Ram. They are very easy to install. All hardware is included.
B001FI0XHG|1|Does not fit kia sorento 03. Bad experiance with this seller
B00BVR75QI|4|Good quality looks nice
B00BLZ8ZEQ|5|Great product,perfect fit,awesome delivery time. Thanks.
B00U7XT1C8|5|Great Visor - mounted mine upside down at first, but after correctly installing it - I really like the product.<br />It surely could prevent an accident by blocking out the bright sun in your eyes.
B004AIO1TE|5|Perfect fit ... arrived timely ... excellent quality ... they are even better now that they have been broken in ... turns that were sketchy at 65 are now no problems at 85-90.  VERY HAPPY ...
B000CGFFE8|5|Perfect fit for 1999 Civic LX
B011K25J8E|5|Looks great, fast shipping, really looks great on my truck
B00BPE4AP6|5|Received the product quickly and it worked great!
B000T9OE5Y|5|Finest oil you can buy!!
B0001MQ7E0|5|what a great cooler.  I use it when getting groceries - as it is hot here in Florida and it keeps them cold until I am able to get home with them.  Definitely the right price for such a great addition to my van.
B004GCC91Q|2|Wrong product,poor quality, lousy packaging.
B00K3Y6MPK|5|great vest
B00A14QNP6|5|Works and looks just like OEM
B005XV23TM|5|Works like a charm.
B00GT2FUB2|5|I have had one before. It's everything I expected.
B0099RKG1S|5|i love this tool thats the coolest thing i have seen it worked perfectly thanks!
B008B9W0IC|5|Love this product. Put it on this weekend came out great, super easy to put on also. Some pics for show. Will update on how it lasts.
B00UBYNOOY|5|Its great
B0093XZDS4|5|Awesome product!
B00I0H28AK|3|It didn't fit my seats as it said it would before buying. The covers were way smaller than expected. I would not recommend this product to a friend and would definitely not buy again!
B00T9AGBOQ|5|I had some doubts about this. But, based on the reviews and price I bought it. The reviews are dead on. I've used this several times to start cars with completely dead batteries. The flash lights and strobe flasher work great too.
B00873J0YY|4|Great generic adaptation to canoe kayak mounting but falls short in adaptability to specific situations.
B00P2D3VZG|1|The product page claims that it fits with 2013 Mazda 3 but in fact does not at all
B008MO5BPK|1|This is yellow! multiple layers of the color will make the amber but defeats the purpose and multiple layers leaves bubbles. Disappointed. And to top it off half the roll had wrinkles!!! So can't even make multiple layers to make amber because half the roll went to waste.
B008G1WGDE|4|fit ok had to file tabs to slide in properly
B00PHHR9H8|3|much much smaller than I had invisioned; however, I suppose that is my fault for not understanding what &#34;4 inches&#34; is haha:)
B001FIK0D8|5|fit and has been working great on a 1998 sienna. Close to a year latter
B009P7RZUW|5|Worked perfectly
B00JIJ4LWW|5|This did an awesome job in cleaning and conditioning my leather sofa. It helped to make the aging and scratched leather look new and left a non-sticky protective finish. I then used it on leather belts and it renewed them to their original condition. The terry cloth applicator made the process easy (I hand washed and air dried the applicator for future use).  I highly recommend this product.
B0041822YO|5|I must have kicked the molding on my driver's side too hard and by accident.  It popped off and I thought I popped it back in.  However, lately it kept coming off during the drive if we went over a speed bump or dip in the road.  It was really embarrassing because it would just kind of hang there.  I wasn't sure about these clips but they work great.  It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to install them (I easily figured out how to take out the broken ones) and they popped in real easy!  I am thoroughly pleased and impressed.  Since I only needed 3 for that moulding, I have spares in case it happens again!
B000WJF4HS|5|cheapest option i could fine and works as good as the rest!
B000FW620A|5|Great product! Exactly what I was looking for :)
B00480N154|3|When I ordered these X-treme power Bulbs , I thought I was Gonna Get a Really Brightness increase , over standard , Stock 9006 headlight Brightness !! But I soon Discovered that they are just a Little Bit Brighter , than a standard Halogen Headlamp .  It is not a very White Light . More of a regular Headlight type of brightness . Like a Regular yellow , white of color . Sort of like a Maglight flashlight brightness . They were not what I was Desiring , in a headlamp Brightness . I bought them to replace a set of Sylvania 9006 Silverstars . which were a whiter Type Lowbeam . But, I got sick of the Sylvania Bulbs burning out so soon . So I tried these Phillips .  Now I,m on the search Again , for a whiter Brighter 9006 Lowbeam Bulb !! If you have Bad night vision ? I would skip these , & consider a Crystal vision ultra Bulb , by phillips Or something Else ? Stay away from sylvania Headlamps !! &#34;Unless you want to Feel Like You Just Rented them&#34; ??  &#34;KINDA DISSAPOINTED&#34;  &#34;But what do you want for 20.00 a pair &#34;?
B0002Q80WM|5|Cord has not came loose and dragged down road. Works as it is supposed to. Lights are on!
B00OJGTF8Y|1|Did not fit right,was off quite a bit from ac vent holes.
B000GD5FMY|5|Great glasses for the price. Foam around the lenses helps keep the wind out of your eyes. Will buy again!
B00SW5P0Y6|5|Very cute
B00JS9WQPQ|4|Rims arrived a week after I was sent the wrong ones. They look good not chrome however cheap plastic!
B000930N0U|5|good job for me
B004MYDO80|1|Did not work for my application. Company then wanted me to do an expensive service in order to try to make it work. Best to buy direct from Dometic.
B00AN5SG94|5|These brakes fit perfectly and provided increased stopping power!
B0046MVWPU|5|Easily programmed.  Works as it should.
B00V04CP30|3|Met my needs
B001G139XC|5|Worked well on my 1998 mastercraft Votex 5.7 TBI.
B000CM2VIK|5|Ordered this for my HRV so it wasn't an exact fit, but I knew that would be the case! The mirror is shiny, sturdy, cut nicely, reversible, and easy to install.
B00805YH7E|5|fit perfect
B0000AZ6DA|4|Product was an exact fix, very well made
B0001EVXCY|5|Perfect fit.  Perfect price!
B005FF6PEU|5|Great Body Armor! Fits perfect, affords great protection and I also like the Velcro elastic waist band that holds the jacket in place and also acts as a kidney belt.
B005FUU7EY|5|Love the new look. Wish the kit included sun visor vanity led lights.
B008LXJPJU|4|my only wish would be that it had a comprehensive index.
B00IAIPAHM|5|This is the second time that I have used one of these wraps. I really like them because the seem very durable and the material is very easy to use. The instructional video is also very clear on how to install the product. In the past with this product I have found that the material holds up very well to the environments found in hunting and it is very waterproof. My dad has a dipped gun and he has mentioned that my wrap seems to hold up better than the paint job on his. I have used this wrap to cover a Mossberg 500 and a Remington Versa Max
B000CF6SAO|1|Product Does not fit the truck it was made to fit with leaves a half inch gap on front windows
B00KTE0P2A|1|Cheap quality, key doesn't stay inside holder, flimsy and not at all what I expected. Pay the extra money and get rekeyed at a dealership.
B000C57Y98|5|Installed the set of two to replace factory ball joints that boots were missing on, two new tires and alignment, drives and tire wear is fine
B0070Y35OC|5|Purchased this for a Subaru Forester. All cuts were just right and the one for the rear side window that has the radio antenna embedded in the glass, even came with the small cut for the connector.
B00Y36NAMM|1|Very disappointed with this filter. The second half of the foam is attached to the frame so as to make cleaning and oiling foam a REAL PAIN!!
B00JUQFVX6|4|I purchased this to protect the back of the seat and provide some storage for my granddaughters travel toys and books.  It does a great job holding small toys and snacks or a water bottle. The compartment I use for books is okay for a few paperback books, although they lean forward a bit and my granddaughter plays with them with her feet.  She is unable to reach the items herself from her car seat, but I am able to reach back easily to hand her things.  I love that the back of my seat is no longer getting scuffed by feet.
B00QBU7MIG|5|I bought this compared the one at the mechanic's shop in town for $400. It's been about a month an a half and is still working great!
B000BQSL5E|5|perfect! thou I lost the cover!
B00SRXDRMA|4|For the money you can't complain. Fitment is 90% on my 5.7 hemi and the sound coming from the hemi is awesome! Could have spent 3 times as much and i don't think there would be to much of a difference other then maybe a little better fitment.
B006TMKX5U|5|awesome product. plugs right in.
B000VEDEKS|5|Great product! Easy application! Would definitely purchase again!
B002Z5VIS6|5|Worked well
B00JR4D70K|5|Item arrived on time and works perfectly.
B000G76RWM|5|It worked great. But I did have to re-drill holes in my trailer since the trailer and this universal layout didn't line up. But it was pretty easy.<br />My trailer is a 2004 Fourwinns 17.5 foot if you are wondering.
B000B6JJUK|4|I have used the Accutire MS-4350B for over a year, and was concerned about leaving the device in the glove box, while the car being parked in the hot AZ Sun. So far no problems, still works like new. I like the locking feature were it beeps when it reads the tire pressure and locks the air pressure reading so you can easily read it. Works great on tires, but I recently used it for a water filter system I setup, and it required a low 5-8 lb. air pressure, and this device worked great for the low air pressure.
B003079HPO|5|Perfect for the service men and women
B00B1RMG2G|5|Easy install!  Was able to wire up and install within 10 minutes.  Keep in mind this is a surface mount, so you will need to cut a 3x3 square hole in the surface you want to mount to and ensure that there is 12V in that location.
B002UJVNFA|4|Great for riding under 80mph.
B00DU4F6WA|3|Works
B00186NGHO|5|Fits perfectly no problems at all
B00HFLC4ZQ|5|Cup Does not feet Sprayit Sp-33000 LVLP if you are guessing, Excellent Customer Service.
B00E4UEXDW|5|100% satisfied
B002HR6HH4|5|love it! so pretty
B002PMOPOS|5|Fit perfect to my mini r56 3007 turbo
B0052FRX9E|3|Fits driver side door ok however, once I installed the part the door would open from the inside and the door lock did not automatically lock when I drove the car a few feet as it was suppose to.<br /><br />The replacement part has two holes that the door lock bar and the door open bar attach to. Both holes were too small thus the bars did not fit. I had to  widen the holes with a larger drill bit and I had to adjust the door open bar so that the door handle would release the door lock mechanism when I  wanted to get out.<br /><br />It works but it took longer than it should have.I would try to find an OEM part if you are not mechanically inclined.
B00KTIXGLI|3|I little bit disapointed whith this 2 and for the price they are a little two exxxpensive and 2 big i cannot use em anywhere else so i have to dump 'em
B000NCOKZQ|5|super happy with this
B000COCTWQ|5|Product works well!
B005NU5OCQ|1|I finally got to use this lamp, I have had it for a long time and it has been sitting and never used. After a power outage in my home, my daughter used it to charge her iPhone and it never worked right and would not charge the phone. Light works well but USB charges is useless.
B00SQ4W46A|1|Terrible!!! Not bright AT ALL!!!!!!
B0015RP2RS|4|GOOD PRICE
B004I0L38G|5|Great
B006X8BATI|5|Good fit.  Looks great!
B007GB3H5G|5|Awesome Sticker
B000EDOSMO|5|Fit my 5th wheel camper perfectly and the price was great
B00BD4SM9S|4|Easy to install
B00L32LLPC|5|Came fully assembled and ready to mount.  Instructions were easy to follow, tonneau looks great and is functional.
B00CUL8BXK|5|Worked great on our trip towing a 1989 Jeep YJ out west great help in the mountains. Easy to use.
B00P9W8NLW|5|Works great at a great price!
B00G3DKIDW|3|I haven't used it long enough to do an indept evaluation of it...
B000OO4PVM|5|Good Item,  Best price.  Fast !!
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Very good
B00RW7XE8E|5|Great deal on wipers that work exceptionally well but were a little difficult to install-otherwise I am satisfied and would purchase again!
B00032KBEA|3|All of the pieces were not in the box, and the box was open.
B005FWWUNS|1|Very cheap
B00CICNVR2|5|The LED ' S make the extra expense well worth it.
B004HIAI9O|2|The regulator was faulty and did not work.. I bought another one from John Deere and it works fine.. Also the terminal locations were in a different spot on the regulator??  Not right??  This was one purchase that costs me extra money instead of just going to John Deere and buying one that works.....
B00VFFOD16|5|Great
B00WZS401A|5|Nice & Strong
B009NRBD4I|5|Great replacement part at a great price did a write up here http://carmelvalleyclassics.com/2015/07/20/brake-booster-replacement-69-pontiac-lemans/ of the install
B001656XEU|3|Had to put a 50 watt amp on it to be able to here it over my Mule. Sounds good but if i had to do it all over again i would just buy the already amplified sound bar.
B011WZSTA4|5|Works great. As advertised.
B004RXKJTS|5|Very easy to attach, my fiance loved them. Color and design is true. Great product shipped very quickly
B008ZDYLC2|5|i bought it so i could see live data and know what the engine was doing during the fault. has not disappointed me yet.
B000ND0WB6|4|ok
B00MMQRTLI|5|Looks really great and it fits nice.  My tailpipes are 2-1/4&#34; and these chrome extensions slid right up onto them.  The stainless plating should help them last a while too, unlike the standard &#34;chrome-only&#34; ones I used to have.  I'll update this in about 6 months and report on how they're holding up!  So far, very pleased.<br /><br />Product Update :  have had these for well over 2 years now and they still look great!  A couple of drops of chrome polish three times a year keeps them looking like brand new!
B01463WLBW|5|It is so nice to have my hot leather seats covered and they look great! I used these on my 2006 Honda Pilot. The front seat covers were easy to install and fit well. The back does cover the mesh baskets that come on my seats but that is something I can deal with. The back seat was trickier but I was able to do it by myself in about 45 minutes including moving car seats etc. The back seats have a 60/40 split and the piece that splits them covers them just fine once I figured out how it attached. The head rest covers are a little small in front and a little big in back, but I don't see how much better it could be with a universal cover. The head rest covers come attached to the seat covers and you have to cut them off to use them. You also have to cut the seat belt buckles through the back cover, I would have preferred something with sewn holes. They say the product will not rip and it seems fine so far, so not really a big deal. There is a faint smell out of the package but it went away in a few days. I love the color and protection these covers are providing and think they are a good deal to cover the whole car. And my legs are not burning!<br /><br />* I received this product at a discount for my honest review
B008G3KG70|4|They're good but not as great. Not as bright as I wanted them to be.
B00MNN16GY|2|Smell good but scent is gone after two or three days
B004R39PSY|2|the ad is VERY misleading I thought I was getting what was shown in the picture but I only got 1/2 of what was shown. It is only the ramp not the whole thing. Now I have to order the actual carrier.
B005ZV2PF2|4|Perfect fit for my Jeep Commander
B00FTB2CCO|4|I installed these on my wife's 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse and they work great. I had an initial problem getting a stud to screw in but the customer service department helped me work the problem out. I would buy them again.
B00V5MV006|1|Terrible product, wires and parts come loose after a week of installation and cause your lights to flicker and not come on.
B0006HMBB8|5|Very nice replacement boot
B00GKMPAJS|5|Got this for my 08 Lexus GX. Perfect fit. A little tricky to install without removing bumper but got it done. Looks better than a full size tube hitch in my opinion. Also better for a hitch warrier since it sits higher with more ground cleance. Very satisfied with this choice.
B00KCQSOAA|5|Perfect
B002P2YTQW|5|Right size for my Starcraft centennial tent trailer.
B00DIIL6D6|5|Great! Doesn't have an opening to allow for on the road charging but I just cut a little slot big enough for the Lightning cable for iPad and now it's perfect.
B00XZ9NRK8|5|I did need help programing, but found it to be very easy. Thanks.  .
B00V7ZJMJC|5|Great battery. Very strong. Cold starting amps are excellent
B0007TQWM4|1|A piece of $#!+  I did exactly as the instructions wait for it to cure 2 days and it look awesome but when í put back the repair tank 15 min later exploded the section i repair . people don't sell junk that don't work
B00DGYN086|5|I like it
B0083UU7CA|5|Works great, as advertised. Super easy, just popped off the standard QR ends and put these on.<br /><br />I used these for hope pro 2 evo rear on my SS. I was then able to run a 10mm thru-axle.
B000XQO0Z2|4|Needed something with a straight thru design, ... not quite as mellow as I wanted so I added a Vibrant resonator in line. Love the SS.
B000COTX34|4|Application:  2015 Chevy Silverado 17&#34; OEM 6 lug Wheel GM #23173537, Lug Thread Size:  M14 x 1.5<br />McGard 24210 lock nuts are 1.9&#34; long, which is also what is specified if you try to buy lock nuts from GM dealer.  The problem is that 1.9&#34; stick out further than the standard lug nuts which I measured to be 1.79&#34;.  Doesn't sound like much? Believe me they look terrible on the wheel.  I do not blame McGard because I'm sure they are simply using the same 1.9&#34; dimension that GM indicates.  What about the McGard 24215 wheel lock?  It is spec'd at 1.639&#34; overall length.  According to McGard, they do not recommend using their #24215 because they claim it will bottom out on the wheel stud and possibly push the top of the wheel lock off when torqued down.<br /><br />I am a die hard McGard fan and decided to buy the #24215 locks and do my own fitment analysis.  Here is what I came up with.  I am not suggesting you ignore McGard's warning, and I'm not guarenteeing anything, but you decide for yourself.<br /><br />I mounted the 2015 GM Wheels/tires (takeoffs) onto my 1997 GMC 4x4 Sierra.  These are my measurements in inches:<br />  GM OEM  McGard #24215<br />Overall Lug Length:  1.790  1.645<br />Lug interior depth  1.771  1.434<br />Stud length reach (Min)  0.933  This is from the end of the stud to the middle of the 60 degree bevel in the wheel<br />Stud lenght reach (Max)  1.289  This is from the end of the stud to the bottom of wheel hole, going past the 60 degree bevel<br /><br />As you can see, the clearance is sufficient between 1.434&#34; interior McGard wheel lock, even up to the 1.289&#34; maximum which I believe is nearly impossible for this lug to go down to. (Note I used a cut Q-tip and jammed it into the wheel hole next to the wheel stud)<br /><br />Bottom line -- for me the McGard 24215 (not the 24210), went on with no problems (torqued to 90 ft/lbs) and they look great!  Will they work for you?  You decide for yourself.
B001XCBCQK|3|Great concept, but it is a pain to get it installed right. I gave up and just bungy corded it to the back of the front seats. Good thing my dog doesn't try to get through it, cuz it is flimsy. Am thinking of drilling holes to place screws to hold the vertical extension bars in place. If she ever tries to nudge it with her nose, she will be in the front seat in no time.
B00E1JOEI0|5|Looks nice. just what I expected, but have not used yet
B0009JKI8G|1|Horrible, after a few days left streaks and didn't last long. Had to change them after a few weeks
B00AEY13P8|5|couldn't be happier than finding OEM parts at a discount. how 'real' was the OEM of this part? the directions were in GERMAN.
B009IFIB0Y|5|Fit just right.
B003BZR7KM|2|Don't waste your time with this. I got this for the lettering for my tires and it barely worked for the first one and then stopped already on the second. The marker was mostly dried up and made a mess. Thankfully Amazon has very good customer service and is taking care of it.
B00JGJGLEU|5|decent price,all copper, and right gauge to provide loss free connections
B00FXIFBLC|4|Look sweet one kids Barbie Jeep!
B009DJUQSK|3|The only part i really need is the key-hole trim, but it seems you can't buy just that piece.  Although it is functional, it does not have the same tight fit the OEM piece had.  For the price i'm not gonna complain, but I would suggest adding a little super glue (epoxy) to the trim piece to make sure it stays snug to the rest of the door. .
B010C4KYIQ|1|The fogs are good and stuff, but the wire harness was wayyyyyyyyyy too short. The button to turn on the fog lights can't reach the inside of my door. Bad place to buy..
B00KQTH95E|5|Super duper awsome product!
B0018ERPVE|5|Great add on. very well maid, its compliments the bike very well.
B006G2MJZU|5|Perfect fit. Look great. Good quality
B0050DDFSQ|5|Oh yes!!!!! this is an absolute must get , it is awesome!!!! changes color, super easy to install. and it looks bad ass. Also it is very well maid. we love it.
B0099M2RYC|5|Better than the blue stuff.
B000EDOT8C|5|This is great!  I can use my stove as countertop & it got rid if the rattle. Good quality. Love it
B00LEBLI82|5|Can't beat these for the money.  So far I've came back and ordered 3 sets of these (30 bulbs)  All work out of the box, no issues.  Great bulbs.
B0050NGHSG|2|very heavy and bulky jacket
B007KAC8D0|5|Perfect Ladies Jacket! I bought this particular jacket for my GF in XL. We measured and referred to the size chart and it was dead on. The quality & features afforded by this jacket puts it in a class by Itself. It offers maximum protection where needed as well as form fitting features affording Maximum comfort. Not one missed stitch in the entire Jacket! The fact that it is drop-dead stunning and flattering as far as style goes, is only an added bonus feature. You will be hard pressed to find a higher quality jacket at any price that rivals this jacket. Ladies, if this is your first riding jacket it will be your last, it's that good! Why overpay for style and very little comfort?  BTW My GF is shaped like a coca cola bottle & this jacket follows Every contour & proportion flawlessly! A lot of though went into designing this jacket for Ladies specifically. It's that noticeable as soon as you try it on right out of the box. You can't go wrong.
B009ZM7ETE|5|Dashlights 74## works great
B001COAS78|5|Worked perfectly for my SLK.
B000F10S1A|5|Looks great
B005DKIIJW|5|Great deal and works very well. Worth the buy!
B002XL2IBS|4|could have a more solid tube. The water pressure pushes the end of it backwards so it doesn't really shoot out at an angle.
B00B2PY31O|5|These are well made and are perfect for keeping spills that kids might make off the carpet below.  It covers pretty much all of the floor and is curved up on sides which is great!! Worth the money!
B00B1IK15E|5|Worked as expected
B00B9W4HGQ|4|Worked as expected.  This has a very mild abrasive effect, much less than polishing compound.
B007VRE8NA|5|This transmission pan is for a GM TH400 transmission.  It is much thicker than the original sheet metal pan.  If you have a shift linkage that mounts to the transmission plan on making some modifications.  The pan seals great, no flex at all.  It comes with new bolts.  Great product from Jegs.
B00W2QUYGK|1|Bought this and paid for priority shipping, only to find out it does not work! I have the correct inverter and it works, and I even tried a different Ethernet cable that I know is good. Still don't work, requested a refund after Aims Customer Support hung up on me!
B000CITK8S|5|Great battery saver! I've used it on my motorcycle, lawn mower and wave runner batteries which I bring inside for the winter and rotate charging them. Each battery has now lasted several years longer than ever before. I would highly recommend this for those batteries that are only used ocassionally.
B00F5272FE|5|it's small. so useful.  buy for car seat. it hold air at least two or three day maybe more. Easy pump control in full detail.
B0006JLW5M|3|If your not sure of the size I may have ordered the wrong size because I couldn't get it to stay in the corners. Looks like I'll be sticking it In The garage until another use comes along
B00VF2IC9I|5|Although I had my doubts that these portable automotive jump starters would actually work, this one actually does. Powered by a 20,000mAh battery, the Model QD6 Multi-function Car Jump Starter Portable Mobile Laptop Power Bank comes with an assortment of adapters and cables to power various smart phones and some laptop computers. There is also an emergency 3-mode LED Flashlight. The main purpose of the QD6 is to be able to jump start your car in case of emergency. My test was simple, and the same one I've seen CNET do on various automotive jump starters. I disconnected the positive terminal of the battery on my vehicle's battery, and connected the Model QD6 Multi-function Car Jump Starter to my vehicle. The big question was, would the car actually start? It started on the first turn of the key, no problem. What else can I say? I am impressed. If I ever have a dead battery, I'm no longer gonna jump start it with another vehicle as long as I have the Model QD6 Multi-function Car Jump Starter around. It's simpler and safer to use.<br /><br />(For reference, my test vehicle was a 2009 Hyundai Elantra)<br /><br />*Vendor supplied product for evaluation and review.
B000BUQOFO|4|It will level a trailer fast But I'm only using 1 and I'm starting to suspected that it twists the frame. You may need two so both wheels the low side are in similar positions
B00MGI60RQ|3|Not very bright, and cheaply made. Some are falling apart easily. The others work well but not as bright as I hoped.
B008G3QB6U|5|Great Rug! Better than I thought! Would order again! Go Texans!
B00U24MEQC|5|Looks great! Super fast install! Does come with instructions.<br /><br />Installed on a 2014 Countryman S
B0000AXTUY|4|Good price and does the job as a trickle charger for our Smart Car that we seldom drive.  Due to it's small size, we were able to fit it in the battery compartment with the battery and have the plug stick out on the floor of the passenger seat.
B0094JIWFI|4|Works great under heavy load with hot engin. Plastic output planetary gear was a surprise but it works. Packaging wasn't good and some damage was under the&#34;loving&#34; care of the shipping
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Major upgrade for my parents car. Not an exact fit, but close enough.
B00AQJYF2E|5|Had it cut and programmed at the dealer for $22.00.  Service manager told me that I would have had $150.00 in the OEM key.  Works great. As good as OEM but much more economical.
B000C5C2E0|5|ok
B00062YZXU|3|Never used it....don't know why not.  Illegal in my state.
B000EDQQCY|3|The plastic is too thin.
B00009PGNR|5|Works Great been using this in my car and keeps everything cool even during the hottest summer
B007FFS8BQ|5|The ignition wire was shorter than the oem part- only complaint
B002NBR68I|5|awesome
B0094JKMII|5|Easy install. Perfect fit.
B00GI2IJTI|5|Wife got it on her car. Not gonna lie, it's kinda cool. I'm usually against decals but it's kinda funny yet badass at the same time.
B000WN2OBI|5|works as advertised
B006I24QAO|5|Nicely made, good price, but what a crap event to get installed. Good Luck with installation.  THE PRODUCT IS GREAT!  ((the old ones that came out were filthy))
B00042JSNY|2|What HI_LIFT Jack  does not tell you is that where to place the hook in order to safely  raise your vehicle. And that's the point. There is no place on my 2008 jeep wrangler to place the hook. Did anyone inform HI-LIFT JACK  that US auto makers stopped producing front & rear bumpers  years ago. I'M  giving it 2 Stars because  it's  well made but totally  useless.
B003S838HI|3|Do your homework. Didn't work for me due to the code.
B003YNET98|5|Good product and nice price.
B001V8U12M|4|would have given 5 stars had it been chromed
B008LG8TRQ|4|Works well
B002XLGR4W|1|If I could give this zero stars I would. I've had 2 on my brand new 2015 travel trailer and both snapped off. I've ordered the metal style one with hopes it will remedy this horrible plastic design.
B000WJX29U|5|You can't make a mistake if you spend a minute reading the instructions. Delivery was quick and its exactly what I needed. Can't speak to its longevity as I just bought it.<br />I like having to add the electrolyte... It means the battery is as fresh as can be!
B000182EW8|5|Just right.
B000FQ7IZE|1|Do not buy this! I doesn't hold adjustment-the ball socket is loose and cannot be fixed.
B000EBKG90|5|love
B005FMTX4M|3|Very limited adjustment range, will not work on the intended application as its handlebars are angled back. The ability to set the adjustment and tighten the joints down is nice though and the double compression sleeve was also a nice touch as I had to remove the outer one in order for it to fit in my handlebars.
B002ZTNV6Y|1|did NOT i repeat did NOT fit my car like it said it would , by the time i got ready to ship back it was too late to return item
B003YLMPPA|5|Great quality, very easy to install.
B00A2URZEW|5|Well worth the money. HE LOVES IT
B001CF3IZ6|2|Way too wide for the jeep wrangler!  Huge pain in the ass to install.  Stereo box says it's for a cb but it's way too small and had to be modified.
B001OML4BW|2|Storage case was not included
B001Y91MFI|5|What a great alternative to pricier OEM wheel covers. Looks great, easy to install. Took a couple of minutes.
B002MEN3F6|5|Awesome fit no shake. Did a mod to level them due to not being oem they tilted up but 10 min mod fixed that.
B000AM8BLI|5|Exactly what I needed
B002Z372CY|5|Great tank logo. I haven't installed it yet, because it looks a tad more involved.  I need to remove the &#34;V&#34; badge first, then prep the surface.  Once that's done I need to be very careful.<br /><br />Its going to be black on black, I'll post pics afterwards.
B002NEV6GS|5|Work perfectly for what I was using it for and great value as I have seen it selling for much more at auto parts stores.
B00J3218PC|5|Love this product.
B00VBN7M6A|5|Works great, sticks to the tank, doesn't peel, 1/3 the price of what you would pay in a motorycle parts store.
B00JIGJKP8|5|5 stars even though one went out after a few months, JDM will replace for free, perfect deep blue color and very bright. My Comander has ALL JDM lights from headlights to taillights and in between, but these are my fav, use them in the foot well under dash
B000CPCRB8|5|good job for me
B004X5QWAA|3|Is about a 95% solution... took some bracket grinding, and washers to make fit. Actual build is OK, but if you are looking for a quick swap, with no need for extra effort, shy away....
B0094JKMII|5|I am a woman and installed these alone. The cross rails are perfect and I saved myself lots of money doing it myself.
B00LT03MBO|5|Excellent product
B003V5S7Z6|5|Good stuff
B001C6E796|5|Great discs, assembled on a 2010 VW EOS, the difference in Left and Right for the front axles is important, these brakes are 'double' layer with a vent in the middle. Keep in mind, that the wear on the pads will be slightly higher than before (eg more dust).
B001O7PNNM|5|Best product to use on your car
B00JIIZCM6|5|got sunscreen all over the back seat of my car. this cleaned everything up and did such a great job i cleaned the whole back bench seat. made the seat look like new
B008VONUXG|4|Purchased so I could find my vehicle in parking lots - It twists around - when facing full front the antenna on my vehicle bends in the wind - have to check it periodically to make sure width is facing forward
B0002I94DE|4|Using on travel trailer awning to hold up decorative lights.  Work great!
B0022ZXOE0|5|Smaller holes than other products.  Holds a duffle bag onto motorcycle seat tight.  The plastic hooks didn't scratch the paint.
B00230MXIW|5|Fit and installation was great
B000BZ97BW|5|Right on
B00KUBKUQ8|5|worked great, i like the color! :D is deep blue!
B004I0DB6I|5|Fits perfectly on my Toyota Tacoma Pre-Runner.  You can't tell it from OEM.  Great price
B008BWGK6M|5|This bike rack worked great for us.  We have a vintage camper and the railing was smaller but just cut a piece of hose and used that inside the clamp.  went off road and had no problems.  Carried two adult mountain bikes.
B00CDWGOKS|4|It's not very big, but my dad is a fireman, and loved it!
B009AA9J5I|5|fit perfectly
B001550DVU|5|Love them! Work well!
B00EDTHDZ4|5|Used for a 6 day road trip to bring power from the back of our Ford Expedition to the 3 row seats so my oldest son in the back could charge his phone, gameboy, and tablet during those endless days on the road. It worked perfectly, the cord feels heavy and flexible, and appears to be of quality construction.
B00OYC58XO|5|Love this product! Heavy duty!
B00IJEKCTS|4|Little hard to get on w one person , other than that works , fits and functions as expected
B00PD2Q93W|5|Excellent quality and customer service. Had issue with screws coming loose but customer service is excellent and addressed issues right away.
B000H0RC8Q|1|The lights were not blue at all not even white. They were yellow.
B00O99UR5G|5|Great product. I have bought them for all my vehicles.
B009PF8G8E|5|Very good product, it fits perfectly to my Nissan Murano 2006

B005UO6EWE|5|Great
B00A49C40G|1|Well this company and three other company's were not able to match the color of my truck still it's really sad
B00HM92O06|5|Nice
B00FQ0ROZS|5|excellent
B009FREAGO|5|Given as a gift...she loved it!  She liked how it folded shut.
B001EAQTRI|5|It worked great, I can barely hear the high pitch  sound if the radio is cranked all the way up and the engine is at 4,000 ram or higher. Other wise I can't hear it during normal use, I highly recommend this product of you need an in line filter for your audio input while you are trying to charge the device.
B00A82JNRQ|5|Very good
B00BITI6Q2|4|Installed just as expected.  No problems.  I'm hoping that it holds up over time.
B003GBJ3V2|5|A+
B000Z0HVHA|5|Good

B003AP7PYQ|5|I am very happy with the part I got and it was a quick service
B000LG5O2W|5|Works great , easy to follow programming instructions too!
B00OJ7053M|5|Exactly As Described
B00BG4LE4U|1|The tread depth reading is not accurate.
B00WZXA8OI|5|Fit perfectly and were easy to install.  Very pleased, look great!!
B00FH43U0G|5|Perfect!!
B00KCQSM9S|1|Seat covers are a very cheap fabric!
B0010T7Q1G|5|Worked well on my 1998 S-10.
B000WKATCM|4|Use this along with a motorcycle chain brush.  It provides a deep clean & it's safe for o-rings.  It does the job!  However, I'm skeptical about the &#34;warning&#34; label saying this product can discolor paint & plastic.  So ensure that you do not overspray any of this, and make sure the chain is dry before applying motorcycle chain lubricant.  4 stars for making me have to be perfect when applying it.  lol
B004AE0KS4|5|The color, the quality of the plastic (soft and rugged, not brittle) and the fitment are excellent. They also arrived well-packaged. The price is also far, far better than OEM. I like the fact that the housings don't come with bulbs pre-installed. It allows the buyer to select whatever bulb they want.  While installing these on my car, which took at most 90 seconds each, I did have to wonder why Honda made the originals out of glass and not plastic like the headlights. (Plastic being more resilient.) These replacements also use glass, which, being aftermarket, I trust glass more than plastic because you can see a lot of OEM plastics on the road and they can quickly turn yellow and haze over.  Before installing these on the car I also applied Headlight Armor protective film to 'cushion' another impact, hopefully preventing another break. The film was easy to apply, especially when the lights are on the kitchen counter and not under a bumper. (Same goes for installing new bulbs: Do it indoors before mounting where the environment is clean.)
B008L5YDM2|4|I love it, there're 2 stickers and it's useful because I can apply it for both my husband's car and mine. However, be careful with the letters, it will fell off the plastic when we take it off the paper.
B001NYNFRC|5|fit perfectly. used to replace identical part.
B00JZZLHRQ|5|Love It
B0024E6W02|5|Great product, great price.
B00XDZPOZU|4|I love it!! It fits well and looks cute, definitely my favorite helmet I have rocked so far :) the only if any bad quality are the goggles, they're cheaply made but it's okay because I have my own set. Totally worth it
B00C59RT1C|4|It works OK.  Not the best for a transfer pump.
B0055DMZYQ|4|Great
B005DJIBYA|5|Exactly what I wanted and needed. Arrived on time and in great condition. Good purchase
B00LDR8M6I|5|great quality
B001FIDNGO|1|Even when pressed together extremely well, the button stop does not stay together.<br />The seat belt buckle button stop did not last two weeks and the two pieces separated.
B003BZ9LRO|5|Loud and a good product , best yet so far
B0097CE2NS|5|Battery came loose during shipping other than that easy to program and works great.  Better than paying $$$$ to the dealership!
B00L32LGKM|5|It fit my truck great and had it put on in about 30 minutes.  Been in a lot of hard rain and does not leak.
B004TGVP14|5|Great product.
B00L3K3OD6|5|I purchased these for my husbands boat.  He lives them and said that they are bright and helps him see to drive the boat down the river at night.  Easy to install, and so far durable and dependable.
B0006MTRJ2|1|It did not work for my purpose - water trough.
B005GL8DFC|5|Fit my 1993 Miata perfectly!<br />After reading some of the negative reviews I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised . My car is already in a carport but exposed to the sun in late afternoon . For this it works nicely .
B00KOA96C4|5|Just as I expected it to be.  Went on without a problem, looks great!
B007USCM7E|2|Very competitive price. Pressure dial either did not work or was confusing. Initially pressure rose as refrigerant was filled. However, after a certain point, the pressure needle did not go up even when I kept filling. There was still refrigerant in the can when I quit.
B00J3NPOM4|4|Purchased the spare tire cover for UV protection and liked the material and the affordable price. The fit is pretty good on the 215/75R15 spare tire on my 1995 Jeep Wrangler
B00B3O607E|5|Everyone at my dealership wants one.
B004LEMPL8|5|Good product fast shipping. Happy customer
B0049IZSS8|5|Works very well. Keeps my scooter platform very stable.
B001V8U3J8|5|Perfect replacement
B009SQO26K|5|Great buy, makes it easy to keep the trunk clean now as I use it a lot to buy spil and stuff for gardening.
B00BR1TQBA|5|Works great.
B00XZ70V5O|5|Excellent fit - 20 minute install (first time, reading instructions as you go), big difference in keeping mud out of body panels, frame parts and other components, also adds to street appeal - smooth black backing behind wheel really makes the truck look better.  Good product, promptly shipped, delivered to the door.  Installation requires only 1 short Phillips #2 screwdriver - holes provided by Ford (uses existing mounting holes - 2015 F150 FX4).
B00LNNR9GG|1|don't waste your money. this is junk. have been used about three times for short period of time, and already half of the front LEDs are burnt. Also, the front projector on one of them fell off.
B00062YNRI|5|This fit Roadstar perfect. Looks really good imo. Clamps on really fast. I spent few minutes and made quick bracket for extra security.
B000C9SR90|4|No issues work great.
B008DREOKE|5|Great item
B00HJLWXKS|1|1 of the two burned out as soon as I plugged them in.
B0094HB12G|5|Rotors fit fine and go round and round.  Great value for the price.
B0006V2BLE|1|Did not work when tried to turn it on. Returned it as Defective. Questionable quality control!
B00C5ASBEU|5|These parts arrived quickly and fit perfectly
B000Q86IQQ|5|formidable
B00N399Z9C|5|Great fitting product and appears to be well made. Made a big difference in how my FJ Cruiser looks.
B00NEL6HK4|5|Very easy install
B000GV09R2|5|Rcvd quickly and as advertised.
B009D3CNHS|5|Nice and light, great for the trail.
B00OUE1PXI|4|Look kinda magenta
B000EDOSKG|5|We go to state and federal campgrounds quite often and if your camper needs water and the water faucets don't have threads on them we use this to fill our fresh water tank with no problem
B008BE04C6|5|These headlights are much brighter than the stock headlights.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants to see better at night.
B00EUVYPV0|1|don't fit right, leak little water inside.
B007RW3KJM|5|This is my second purchase with this company. Can I say GREAT PERFECT!!<br />Filter on the left is the new filter.<br />Filter on the right is the old dirty filter.
B009WEV5AO|4|It was fitting my motorcycle wel, but the screws cam loose after a couple miles by the vibrations, I had to put some locketit on it by my self.
B00JL803RC|5|This bar worked perfectly. The install was easy. The fit wad perfect. I highly recommend it.
B000636OR4|5|Been buying this product for many years, works as intended.
B00E0NSL54|2|Stoners Invisible Glass works better. Still streaks even after a good cleaning and re-wiping with a microfiber towel.
B001NZQIDE|5|Way better than cutting up your wiring harness and quicker too
B00N2DI2DE|1|They didn't fit right on my 2011 GMC Terrain. Showed up all scratched and looked used. If I mounted it so the outside of the bracket was positioned properly then the inside bracket was too low to fit into the groove.  If i put the inside bracket into the groove then the outside bracket didn't sit down all the way. I am just not comfortable driving down the road with my stuff mounted to these brackets. I ordered the factory ones.
B00WH24LEU|5|I purchased this as it is the same as the one I borrowed from a co-worker.. the grip is awesome !! work well -- does the job
B00QL3QJA0|5|Came in handy for some exhaust work I did. This is a good complete O2 kit. Only complaint I have is that the &#34;slit&#34; in the socket could be maybe a little wider and less sharp. I used another socket of a friends that had a wider slit and it put less strain on the wires and made it easier to keep them out of the way.<br /><br />Good kit through,  has everything you would need
B008A7U13G|5|Very nice
B00HJ15AEO|5|The only problem the smile pink dots fell off when installing.
B000JD53IC|4|Product is good and was delivered before time. The only concern is that the edges are not perfect.!! But it is hard to notice.. Thank you AVS
B003YLH96U|5|Tricky to reach all the screws, but was an easy job and now my fan works in all settings (1-2-3-4) not just in 4!
B001C8YR26|3|So far so good!!
B000CGKP02|5|Fit my 03 Buick Century perfect
B00763NI3A|5|Worked fine and are fairly bright for being the size they are. Will buy again if needed to.
B00PZDLCSQ|1|2 of 5 bulbs worked, the rest didn't. took forever to get them
B00NHY745A|4|Convenient and fast
B00PCYENOS|5|It was hard to put it on but its good
B00QR08GAI|5|I. Like this tree can't find them at stores
B00RPGWI0C|5|Outstanding fit and quality
B000JFNAIU|5|GR8
B000C41JIG|4|The unit performs as advertised, no leaks, tight  tolerances. But listing more  technical information  like how many turns lock to lock. Also way to contact manufacturer directly if there's an issue but other then sending it back. I need a 2 1/2 lock to lock and the one I receive was a 3 1/2.<br /> He said it was for 1989 Pontiac Firebird so I thought there was only one gearbox available for that vehicle.  Its my daily driver so I didn't have time to pull it out and check it first,  but I didn't know I needed to
B00DTEFSWY|5|Bought these while doing a head gasket on my LT1.  Worked better than a modified head bolt, seems like a quality set.
B002O5P8BA|2|Why I purchased the PROwatt<br /><br />I bought this inverter to replace a cheap modified sinewave inverter for multipurpose use (i.e. family vacations, travel, etc.) The modified sinewave inverter was noisy. Any audio/video devices plugged into it had an annoying hum. Portable electronics such as iPhones or Androids charging through USB were particularly bad, with so much hum that earphones were unusable. So I bought the PROwatt sinewave inverter to solve those problems.<br /><br />Initial Impressions<br /><br />It's big. Not heavy, but it's twice the size than other similarly-powered inverters. The PROwatt has a very simple input voltage display. The unit goes into undervoltage shutdown if the input votlage sags too low. Be sure your wires can support the currents the PROwatt can draw. A cigarette lighter is usually good for 150-200 Watts, so don’t be surprised if the PROwatt shuts down early if you’re using a cigarette lighter socket. This display also shows output power in kilowatts, which is essentially useless for a 600W unit.<br /><br />The PROwatt has as flimsy membrane power button. It needs to be manually actuated every time power is applied. Either locate the PROwatt so it is easy-to-reach, or separately purchase the remote power-on switch. I would not be surprised if many PROwatt failures are due to the flimsy button. Even brand-new, I sometimes need to hit the button a few times until it powers on. This is a failure waiting to happen.<br /><br />The 12V input terminals are beefy and inspires confidence that they will last. Since they protrude from the back of the PROwatt, take care the unit is not positioned by anything metal or conductive. If you leave this in the floorboard of your car, expect it to slide under your seat and short-circuit on something. If you bolt it down in your trunk, make sure your tire iron or can of fix-a-flat doesn’t roll into the exposed terminals and short-circuit your car’s electrical system.<br /><br />Measurements<br /><br />The PROwatt was tested on my lab bench using a Keysight 34481A and an [[ASIN:B00DED64G4 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES DSOX2002A OSCILLOSCOPE, 2 ANLG, 70MHZ, 1GSPS]] oscilloscope. Data was measured then processed in MATLAB to determine frequency content. The PROwatt was powered by a 13.6V power supply buffered through an AGM lead-acid battery. The load was a 335W resistive load bank.<br /><br />The PROwatt had a “somewhat” clean 60Hz sine wave at no load. The voltage measured 123VAC. The 34481A reported the frequency at 59.8Hz, so the PROwatt should not be used for highly frequency-dependent devices (i.e. motor powered clocks or telescope alignment devices). See attached screenshot for no-load sine wave. The sine wave has some distortion present, which I wondered would be audible.<br /><br />I attached a pair of Bose Roommate powered speakers to the PROwatt. The speakers draw very little power at idle (a few watts). The PROwatt barely registered the load and the output sinewave stayed the same. The Bose speakers had an audible hum that was measured with an iPad Spectrum Analyzer app. The hum shows up at 120Hz at -60dB with following even-order harmonics at 240Hz and beyond. Not very loud, but audible nonetheless. iPad Screenshot attached. It doesn’t sound like a ground loop (60Hz hum). Instead, it is a nastier sounding hum with higher-frequency components. The PROwatt should not be used to power outdoor or high-efficiency sound systems, because the hum would be audible and undesirable.<br /><br />The next test was to measure the hum produced by the PROwatt to devices charging over USB. Modified sine wave inverters have a big problem with this. An iPhone and charger was connected to the PROwatt. This draws very little power and PROwatt barely noticed. I connected [[ASIN:B0081XAXXM Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones, Black]] headphones and a battery-powered [[ASIN:B00MFMW29I FiiO E11K Portable Headphone Amplifier (Black)]] to the iPhone when charging with the PROwatt. I could not hear any hum. Since it was under the audible threshold, I did not make any measurements.<br /><br />When loaded with 335W resistive load, the PROwatt output got significantly more nasty, with both even and odd order harmonics.  Screenshots attached. The output waveform gets asymmetrically “squashed”, producing broad-spectrum distortion byproducts. Many audio/video systems would be adversely affected by this strong distortion. Professional audio amplifiers with high-efficiency switch-mode suppliers (i.e. the [[ASIN:B003HZPKSM Crown XLS1000 Power Amplifier]]) might be immune, but be careful to not exceed the PROwatt’s maximum output power. The PROwatt would more likely be used with signal sources (mixers, preamplifiers, power speakers), which are more susceptible to the PROwatt’s high output distortion.<br /><br />During the 335W testing, the output votlage dropped slightly to 119VAC. The fan was slightly noisy but won’t be bothersome in a moving vehicle, especially if the PROwatt is mounted in an inconspicuous location.<br /><br />Conclusions<br /><br />Although not producing a clean “ideal” sinewave, especially within its operating power band, the PROwatt is “clean enough” to satisfy many usage scenarios. I envision this inverter might have problems with powering larger A/V systems without introducing audible hum or visible distortion byproducts. This is a direct result of the “squashed” sine wave when under load. Other electronics, such as computers or laptops, should have no problem whatsoever with the PROwatt.<br /><br />My return window closed a week before my laboratory testing. I would readily return the PROwatt in exchange for a [[ASIN:B00AYH6BSO Samlex 600W Pure Sine Wave Inverter PST-600-12]] for the following reasons, but I guess I'm stuck with the PROwatt now. Don't buy the PROwatt until you  at least look at the Samlex, otherwise, you'll be stuck with something you don't want, like me. Buyer beware.<br /><br />- Flimsy power button vs. the Samalex’s mechanical rocker switch.<br />- Noisy output waveform<br />- Lots of high frequency distortion harmonicsid not make any measurements.

B00EELM7PM|1|Wrong. Did not fit
B003ODO3Z8|5|Still can't believe what a great price discount this was. Brand new cover that cost me less than $100. Thanks again seller!
B00JVI00CU|2|I liked the small compact size, but the lid does not stay latched. It works great for small items such as straw wrappers
B00BUHLX94|5|Works great on a 2003 Toyota 4Runner Sport V8 upper control arm.
B00LFSIKMQ|5|They fit perfectly and are SO easy to &#34;install.&#34; Can also remove them just as easily. The car isn't used for too much camping but def. used for roadtrips, surfing trips etc. and it serves the purpose well enough for the price.
B000L7JQMU|5|quick shipping and a must have for anyone in the automobile industry
B00XJDUJ2Y|1|I was extremely dissatisfied with this product.  I did not function correctly, and the wire harness did not fit correctly.  I returned it to the vendor for credit.
B007TY6A72|5|former gm tech just retired. works and installed like OMC.
B004E2EKGA|5|This worked out great for my 97 Honda XR600! With a few small modifications on the tail I got it on and it looks great! Very happy with this purchase!!
B00GBVHPNW|4|My hands are little to big for the size I ordered so the knuckle guards rub and are a little uncomfortable but I think that if I ordered an XL these gloves would be just fine. Overall they are good gloves, I just need to order the correct size next time.
B008A15XJE|1|Do not buy this product, very poor quality. After only 2 months as a cover on my RV the material disintegrated to almost powder. This is not designed for outdoor use and cannot hold up to Sun or weather elements. Very disappointed in this purchase.
B00062Z2M8|5|Great way to apply tire dressing. While spray is easy - it can make waterproof marks on your driveway. Instead, just spray on these handy sponges and wipe on your tires!  Wear disposable gloves.
B0007OWD2M|5|For the price, this is the BEST glass and mirror cleaner I have tried. It is a great find, and if you hate streaks and shmutz on glass and mirrors, use this product, at least try it for the price. I have tried dozens, and love this one the most.
B00H6XPZN6|4|These don't want to stay stuck in my truck, but I'm having this issue with a lot of these shades. But they did work great on our camper door windows. Now maybe my kids will sleep past daylight when we're camping. But probably not.
B00K56PSI8|5|I love this Sun shield.  Not only is it very cute, it is sturdy and does a great job.
B001NZTZBQ|5|Strong rigid structure with a soft pliable seal makes for a great air filter. The paper element looks tight and well made, just like OEM. Some vehicles like the Nissan 370z & G37 require two.
B009X1S040|5|Good kit for the money and easy install. Does more than what is needed on my mom's jeep just to set it apart a little from the others
B00G6IUIAM|5|Great
B00EDFM83A|4|4 stars just because I was expecting more light lumens but it Does the job so far ;)<br /><br />Is cold yellow light;) as advertised
B006R2RZOY|4|Super bright like the color it.gives off not a clear but.more of a lighter blue Looks.good and.doesn't.look like a black.ligbt.like the dsrk.blue ones do here's some pics. Of night.I.got.the.whole cab lit up dome.light and pilot light looks super sharp
B00Y74UY6U|1|Despite the list of cars this absolutely does not fit a 2013 Dodge Dart. I was OK to have the Reverse designator on the wrong side (for 2013 Darts you pull up on the sleeve and shove it all the way to the *left* and up) but this thing is way too large to fit the screw on the dart's shifter.<br /><br />Perhaps with the right accessories it could work but as is this does not work.<br /><br />:-(
B00D3298A0|5|Four rugged and well made floor mats. Easy to use and easy to clean. They are thick and ridged to keep your floors from getting all the random junk on your shoes or feet on the carpet. They bend well and don't crack. Fits most vehicles from what I can tell from using them on all my family's cars.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love it and keeps the car nice and cool!
B0119C8P9U|5|I drive a 2015 F-250 FX4, these are the ONLY mirror covers I have found that fit and look like the factory ones.  They appear to be quite durable, I drive about 50k miles a year in sales on oil rig leases down terrible roads, made it through 20 car washes where the spinning arms have pulled off my antenna but not the mirror covers. They have 3M double sided tape that seems to be strategically placed so the edges DO NOT push out and look aftermarket cheap.  Other covers I have seen have been over-sized, sloppy and go over the factory edges. I had an issue with the install being in Texas with the average 110 degree heat lately, but got it fixed.  The product was shipped super fast, and when talking with their customer service they responded instantly.
B000931OEO|5|good job for me
B00I4LO454|5|Does what it should do.
B00QPV8B22|3|No point reviewing until the snow flies
B004VROJ32|5|I use it when I frst crank up the engine to raise the idle a smidge while the bike warms up.  It is perfect for a quick mirrow adjustment or just to relax your right hand for a moment..  I have tried to cruise along with it on but it tends to loose its grip slowly as you ride. I would not guarantee it to be a good choice if you looking for a &#34;cruise control&#34;.
B00CEX5J6Q|4|Hold on well but the outer sides doesnt hold but most likely i missed aligned it. But no issues.
B0013RIOPC|4|I looked everywhere for replacement door straps for the rear doors on my 70's Chevy van.  These were the correct link so I tried them.  They fit perfectly.  My only issue is that they are thinner than the original equipment straps, but they were not made for the Chevy van doors.  If anyone is looking as I did, for replacement straps for the van doors, these will work.  I probably wouldn't put a lot a stress on them, but they will stop the doors from hitting my fenders under normal use.
B000BKZHCA|5|High quality replacement headlight housing. Night and day difference to the old yellowed unit it replaced. It was not easy to install into the motor home but it was worth the effort.
B00CKML4CE|5|pull strap works great
B000WJH4BC|5|I ordered these for my 93 XR650L after I relocated my battery under the seat. The trick to make these work for the XR650L, is you have to drill out the rivets that's old on the panel extension and rivet the retainer to the air box. Once you do that, these panels will bolt right up and give the bike a nice modern look.  The panels are good quality at a fair price. Shipping speed for ground was normal and I have no complaints about the transaction. My only concern about the product, is that the exhaust side panel doesn't have the heat shield tape inside like the stock panel. I will have to buy the aluminum tape and install it to protect the new panel.
B000C1LLPA|5|Nice and quiet. No brake dust.
B003TPQYPI|5|I use this in both the soap and the rinse buckets and it fits perfectly in a Home Depot &#34;homer&#34; bucket. I use a knobby microfiber mitt and the little &#34;knobs&#34; on the Mit make contact with the fins on this guard and you can see at the bottom of the bucket that the dirt settles and agitates up much less than without it. It's pricey for a cheap piece of plastic but it does clearly work.
B00590U7OK|5|Perfect fit.
B00Z7KIZPA|1|I didn't like the product.
B00N2DFMJ6|5|great product for the price.  fits as advertised. was actually of better material than I expected.  I would definitely recommend.
B000K046G4|5|Exact replacement for 2005 Silverado double cab 5.3 engine. Plug and play, easy installation.
B00F84XZOQ|5|worked perfect
B000IG20T0|5|good product
B001P11SCM|5|Easy to install (especially with vehicle specific harness sold separately) and easy to setup.  I am using this controller on a 1999 F-350 with a 19' 4000lb dual axle travel trailer.<br /><br />I have used the controller multiple times now for our travel trailer and it has performed flawlessly.  We have towed in mountains and in stop and go traffic and it has made towing our trailer stress free.  The boost feature has been beneficial when towing on winding steep mountain roads and on the highway the normal setting works perfectly.  During rapid braking (almost missed a turnoff) everything felt stable and braking distance felt similar to towing without the trailer.  The flexibility in mounting angles is much appreciated as well and makes finding a mounting location much easier.
B009W3Q4RO|5|Great product
B00B2AF00M|5|Fit & works perfectly!
B007ZD2RR4|2|Cleaned car, prepped window with alcohol pads and installed rear window deflectors. Both have fallen off, luckily was on side streets, bad double sided sticky tape. Bought 3M VHB tape and had to reinstall.
B00JV6OW44|2|THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DIRECT REPLACEMENT, BUT IT'S NOT.  THE ORIGINAL  UPPER RADIATOR BRACKETS WILL NOT WORK WITH IT. THE QUALITY ISN'T VERY GOOD, I THOUGHT THAT SINCE THIS RADIATOR IS ALUMINUM AND 2 ROW THAT MY CAR WOULD RUN COOLER, BUT IT DOESN'T. IT RUNS ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES HOTTER.
B001NQQ9UA|5|I don't have tattoos, my gf does.  I love the disapproving looks I get sometimes.  I even had a librarian-looking woman angrily confront me once, She said, &#34;Really?  AND your tattoos?&#34;  She was pretty mad.  I smiled and said, &#34;actually I don't have any,&#34; and walked off.
B004FJT242|5|OEM crossbar. No cutting needed. You'll need a torx bit to install.
B0006SU3QW|5|worked great! :D
B003COQAKA|5|Mounted on my Can Am Maverick, sure does pull those Kawasaki's out! We have put it to the test over the last year, and so far it hasn't let me down. I didn't realize at the time that I bought it that they have one that's a 'plug and play' for the Can AMs....would have really saved some installation time!
B004GFS2C8|5|Works as expected. Great product.
B00DWVN08I|5|Adds a nice touch.
B00KY98S06|5|Durable (so far....). As described.
B00KTIAREM|2|The Key phobs will not both program at the same time
B000ZN4PV2|5|Great kit, assembled on a 2010 VW EOS caliper. They look different than the OEM parts, have a greater bolt head but nevertheless work seamlessly. I used them when installing the StopTech 126.33131SR/L Brake Rotor, as one has to remove rear caliper for this.
B00QIPO638|5|excellent product!
B007YZLXHI|5|Very nice product, fast shipping.  Worked nicely on my Altima engine rebuild as a crankcase breather.  Ty
B000BYD9OE|3|Some of the wires were longer than needed and being Motorcraft, I was expecting them to have the cylinder numbers marked on them.
B00GHQBW6M|5|Great price and exact match to OEM
B003KKQA56|5|excellent!!
B00HE1C146|5|Was easy to snap right in!
B000EVGFTU|5|Exactly as advertised.

B00NRVBKI0|4|Good product
B00VN140P6|5|Awesome hat. Just what I was looking for
B0022ZYUFW|5|great quality!
B001LTTTZQ|5|went on well and works well
B005PZMLDY|5|good cover
B0068EQCPO|5|Installed without any modification to cables or wiring. All I needed to do was reroute the clutch cable through fairing to facilitate using stock length.
B00GZRZQ9C|5|Worked great!
B003YCEMUA|2|NOT Colorfast as described!  I received these yesterday and machine washed separately even giving a white vinegar rinse which generally always makes colors MORE colorfast.  I used one today to mop up some water from the floor and when I rinsed the cloth out under running water the water was vivid blue.  I have such high hopes for these towels as I'm trying to reduce paper towel usage at my house.  I'm hoping after a few more wash cycles they will improve but my opinion for now is &#34;Not So Good&#34;
B00BFEGPIG|5|Worked great to round out the pipes. Just sprayed a little oil on the threads and they worked perfectly.
B0006Z9SQQ|5|Good wipes. Especially on subcribe and save, cheaper that way.
B004BAUCUS|1|They do not fit properly. It said it fit my accord but my car doesnt sit right anymore. My car squeaks a lot now.
B005I5UAJI|5|Super cute!  Nice weight and does not look Chao.
B00F8U17S6|5|Very sturdy and excellent quality.  I highly recommend it.
B00E63TI32|5|Just love this unit its nice and big and easy to get Ice in for cold drinks. I did change out the cap to a flip top for drinking...nice unit for the price for sure
B0019I33FQ|5|Great fit on 2002 highlander- 6 cylinder.
B00M9PDYJ8|5|These are excellent LED bulbs. Fairly bright and a nice clean, white look to them. No more yellow looking stock bulbs!
B005CDSWX2|5|Did enough research to find that changing this will fix the check engine light if the error codes appearing ar erros 441 and 445.
B00PGH0YC6|5|The quality of this part is great,it showed up on time and looks awesome.i like that they leave the sticker off of the cap,that allowed me to put it on straight once i got it snug.
B00QVQMWM6|5|I've had excellent results using Redline products in my Nissan truck.
B00IZRJ6FU|5|Easy to assemble and great lighting.
B00ISJXBD8|2|Lights began fogging up (moisture inside) not at all happy with that.  The look is great, it's exactly what I wanted but I didn't expect poor seals on the lights.  I'm probably going to mount the old headlights back on as I'm sure the problem will get worse as we start to change seasons.
B00Q1F6LM4|5|Fit perfectly!
B0073W7ZLA|1|Although specifically advertised as compatible with a 2015 Jeep Patriot, the threaded portion of the antenna was not long enough to screw into the radio antenna cable.  It was returned.
B00K5A9B4Q|5|This fit perfect in my husbands 09 chevy!
B00JLJQYMY|5|great price didn't even need tools to install.
B005P7CL6O|3|This product is a PAIN to handle and install.  I believe after several uses a person may become very efficient with the wrap, but that means to me it is not as simple as advertised.  I'll leave my very honest opinion and insight to hopefully help others.<br /><br />Once the pain of installation is done this product literally transforms your gun!  I am very pleased with how it looks on my bird gun! My buddies thought I bought a new shotgun.  Almost all of the air bubbles resided after the install and the only creases were where the material over lapped. You do lose some grip one the gun because of the wrap, not enough to complain about. The reason I could not give it a 5 star rating was due to the materials inability to withstand the heat of the hot gun after the install.  I went to a pigeon shoot and was really proud of my gun.  I shot often and well that day.  After 5 boxes of shells the gun gets hot [Duh].  Much to my dismay, the wrap began to come &#34;un-glued&#34; to the barrel of the gun around the muzzle, foregrip, and the vented rib.  I tried to ignore it but when a buddy used it and brought it back pointing out the flaw I was over it.  If you put this on a gun and you don't plan on running to the point of getting hot you'll be fine.  But to me, its on a gun and I had hoped (not using common since) that it would hold up to my idea of typical use.<br /><br />1st, the instructions tell you to clean all surfaces of oil before you apply... and they mean it.  It seems taboo to do this to your firearm, but it is a must.  Use your favorite oil cleaner as long as its not abrasive to any of the surfaces.  If there is any oil, or even residue, it will effect the adhesive.<br /><br />2nd, leave yourself at least 3 hours to do this.  It is very tedious so take your time if you want it done right.<br /><br />3rd, measure TWICE, cut ONCE.  There is a little material to spare and you can use to fill in gaps but it makes this even harder and more time consuming.  Also, when making cuts where material overlaps, make your cut a wavy line cute rather than a straight line.  This helps the pattern transition and really decreases the visibility of the crease and overlap.<br /><br />4th, HEAT IS YOUR FRIEND!!!  Use a hairdryer or heatgun to &#34;warm&#34; the material and surface when applying.  This will help you stretch the material into place because you will never be able to make perfect cuts with this stuff.  Just don't get crazy with the heating and stretching, it will MELT the material and it will loose its adhesive.  When you are all done, hit with more heat and give it some final touches.  I did a Ruger 10/22 as well as my 11-87 and had good results by leaving the gun in the hot car all day the next day to help the material set in and memorize its surface.ke your cut a wavy line cute rather than a straight line.

B0010E00T6|5|excellent
B003XGYDE2|5|My husband purchased this and it's just what he was looking for.  He likes the accessories that came with it and the price was right.  Would recommend.
B009LQG57G|5|Great flasher. Love the pattern override function.
B00BTGSGFK|3|These don't really hold up to more than 3 or 4 washing's before the stitching comes apart.
B00RZ4YWI0|3|Alright switch. Would be nervous about using at 30 amp due to small terminals. Also I only needed 2 immediatly, but one of the 5 does not work, 2 of them do, and 2 are untested.
B000F5DQWY|5|LOUD & COMPACT
B000B8JUAW|5|What's to say about a gas cap? It fits well, keeps gas in the tank, locks, and time will tell about it's longevity.
B009X21U14|1|Arrived with a hole in the air hose.  Useless.
B00GZLMEPM|5|This kit cleaned up my 8 year old, very yellowed headlights in minutes.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Arrived quickly.<br />*Lens are clear with no molding blemishes and unscratched.<br />*Fit/Sit securely on my face with no slip and enough retention to allow for turning head completely to the side, to check lanes before a lane change.<br />*Foam gaskets provide good wind blockage but, still allow enough airflow through small notches in gasket, to prevent fogging.<br />  NOTE: Fogging may still occur if sitting still with no airflow.<br /><br />I recently paid as much for one pair of glasses of similar/equal quality, at a local brick and mortar, as I paid for this set of 3!  I may just order another set to put on a shelf, to make sure I have a backup for when I need to replace a pair after damage/loss.  At the price you're paying here, you simply can't beat this set of glasses.
B005XINQH8|1|This part does not work  make the car go into lip could  make your  car turn off while driving  and the vender try getting  in contact  with  them more then once to resolve  the  metter not one  response  yet
B00BB1UMEG|5|Fit very well
B00JNYTQ90|5|Love the smell!!!!!
B00QLIRNLY|5|Perfect! Fit right on and blend in nicely I love them it brings great relief not having to worry about someone stealing my wheels

B00AOA6A32|5|Great product
B006DD95YK|4|Great product right here
B004Y4WK4W|3|good fit
B006XXV5W0|5|These are awesome, much better than those offered by auto parts chain stores.  I highly recommend Brembo drums and rotors.
B009IFIOB0|5|An exact fit, super.
B00QN8L6J2|3|Good look. Didn't' expect it to be just a stick on though.
B00WSQBG8Y|5|Great Replacement for 2009 Lexus GS 350 front Parking Sensor. My front right parking sensor stopped working causing it to<br /> beep all the time. Dealer wanted around $500 since the front bumper has to come off to replace the parking sensor.<br /><br />I ended up completing the job in 50min with the help of a youtube video, and only spent $34 on the part.<br /><br />Also, I have a Silver Lexus and this matched the other parking sensors.
B006N95S9A|1|Don't waste your money
B006XKNXXW|5|Verry good
B007CTF084|5|Looks great
B000GZNG28|4|I DIDN'T  install it correctly and it came off while I was trying to engage it.
B00BEXLL8C|5|NIce for back plate
B007FHSABC|1|The cap I received is reverse-threaded.  Useless.
B00QNW68UK|5|Fit my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic perfectly!! Included adhesive pads made installation very simple!
B0068FV60Y|4|Great product took longer to ship then was estimated but happy with the purchase
B000W0OFXG|5|Works exactly as advertised.
B00IAZ4MDS|5|Havent installed as of yet, but is what my son was looking for.
B00YBGAU2W|5|Fits perfect, now you have a place for your drink while relaxing.
B009II5DMK|5|Bought this after my security system gave me the BAT display. Easy install and seems to be working perfectly.<br /><br />Just be sure to double check what connector you need (F1/F2). Then check it again.
B00VHKKFNO|5|[[VIDEOID:b96cc76d71fc2a24466fdebc54b20e38]]This battery charge is a great item to have, it is small and light weight.  I love the LCD screen display that is on this item, it is easier to read than a bouncing needle.  It crazy how something so small is so powerful.  As you can see in the video it comes with two sets of cables that you can easily connect and disconnect.  This item just plugs into your normal 110 outlet.  This is nice because it can charge 6/12v, it also have 4 modes!<br />I got this item for a discounted price for a honest review.
B000RXNLK6|5|Great product, makes your car shine when you need a quick detail shine. You will still want to wash your car, though.
B00DU0EQWA|4|Very good
B0089C30EY|4|Good product. Used it twice this summer and helps with the bugs and rock chips. One side near head light doesn't fit great, some gaps but over all good.
B001DBTXK8|5|Works perfect on 2003 Toyota 4Runner Sport V8.
B00SVRHD22|5|Love them
B007Y0MYLW|5|Excellent truly heavy duty straps that are also outdoor safe (many aren't).  Worst mistake people often make is using regular bungee cords (even seemingly heavy duty ones) that are not designed for lengthy outdoor weather use.  These are safe for securing cargo in a pickup over long distances even in bad weather.  They are at an excellent price point and the best you can get when safety of your cargo is important.
B009PQ91O6|4|An inexpensive substitute. No visible difference in quality of manufacture.
B0066SOGMS|5|matched the OEM part really well. No trouble installing.
B00VNBDWPK|1|Bad experience i bought 2 pairs one for my truck one for my car.. They look really good if u look at them but not bright on road... $99 is too much for them i am returning them ... Don't buy them because of there 78% positive reviews.. I am a professional driver and i know what i am talking about
B001OMVCIC|5|Money well spent!!!!! Made a huge difference  inthe feel and comfort  of the truck. We tow a  flagstaff classic  super light  28rks.  1000lb hitch weight  empty  closer to  1300lbs loaded. Towed almost 1000mi  on last trip  . Would recommend to everyone
B000VHHU0A|5|Works great, glad I purchased this machine.
B00080QHMM|5|Love the digital read-out that seems much more accurate than the usual tire gauges!
B00E6A7E0E|4|Mostly as expected. Print quality can improve.
B00J6C0DKK|4|Moves mucho air! Little loud, for a garbage fan it's worth it on a hot day!
B00NQQXBVU|3|Really nice
B002IV6ER2|5|Very well built, fast shipping
B002ZRQ4WO|5|For the Price I am very happy. I took it on a 5 day backpacking trip in the boundary waters, and this thing kept me dry even through a heavy rainstorm! Its material is semi thick(Which is good!) It can hold up with mild thorns. Mine doesn't have any tears or cuts and I put it through a lot!
B003PA07DC|5|enjoy much
B000P7O5DG|1|Did not work at all. Only heated up the cord middle part but the oven lunch box did not heat up ams my food remained cold for 40 minutes of heating up.
B00LT62B6K|5|The system came with everything needed for the installation, including vehicle specific wiring instructions. Great product, but most of all the best customer support I have ever encountered. If I had a question, I would pick up the phone and call, and my question would be quickly answered.
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Looks awesome on factory tinted windows plus speedy shipping
B008Y7Q9UG|5|Fast shipping, great product!
B000CMJ1WO|1|kit does not work on 66 gto as described by Grant .
B00066UKM6|3|Decent
B00C43BR2G|5|On time and good price!!!!
B001F79APS|5|Very happy!  Solved my problem and good quality!
B000C5G9M6|1|I order the 180 degrees thermostat cause my old one wouldn't open till it hit 200 so when i installed this one thinking it was gonna fix, it made it worse! When the engine is at idle the temperature needle goes 3/4 of the way like around 220 degrees so my engine is making a knocking noise now i live in texas so that's really bad for my engine, thanks motorad for sending me the wrong thing and messing up my engine
B004I5Q27I|5|Nice
B00NIDNV5C|5|Great product, shipped out fast
B000C2CCHU|3|cant really give a good review, looks like a nice piece. I ordered the wrong seal and shipping back is same cost as gasket. so its sitting on the shelf, looking pretty.
B00029WVHY|4|Nicely made product.  Good value for the money.
B004HCM9H4|5|Best product to use on your car
B000YQT6RS|5|Perfect addition to our Eurovan travels
B00A8NISXA|5|Love this. It is awesome. Looks great on my truck. Fit great and the quality is good. I have had it for a while and there is no fading or rusting. This is a good quality item and I would purchase again if I had to replace it.
B00H1IC05W|5|These are excellent. Great quality and great price. Better than the cheap OEM version with the crimped on outer cover.
B004ZT5ZP2|5|Tried something else which was cheaper 1st and did not like the result, these fit and look a whole lot better
B003SZVKEE|1|I have one of these in my 2006 DTS and it hyper flashes on the turn signal in 60 degree or below ambient temperature.  Don't bother trying load resistors as this does not solve the problem.  I switched this RH with the OEM LH tail light assembly and the problem is definitely in the cheap ...<br />Taiwan made light.  Buy a used OEM light and save yourself a lot of frustration.
B000BZZPRM|5|Great price for a solid rotor. Replaced OEM Lexus GX470 with centric blank rotors and couldn't be happier.
B00J3FMHN6|5|Good product, but take awhile to get.
B004PAFXVC|5|Worked perfect for My 2005 mercury mountaineer 4.0 L
B00DLMM1DI|5|These lights work great on my 2005 f150. They don't have the best instructions but are built pretty semi idiot proof. In little to no time I had mine swapped and shining bright.
B007MOCVW2|5|Great value, works on my 2015 Prius C
B0050SFVO2|5|worked like a champ. saved me time and money
B00363M0TC|5|Sprayed the rollers on my Laserjet 1200 and it started pulling the pages out of the tray correctly.
B001RITO1A|5|Have not used the lights yet but am restoring an old truck and need to tow it several placesto have work done.
B00XXLZ2EM|5|These are great cleaning towels.  My husband and I use these after taking our vehicles through our local touch-less car-wash.  I have ordered multiple sets of these towels for cleaning around the house, but this set is much thicker and made of better material than some of the others I've come across. I received these items at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review.  I provide impartial reviews based upon my actual product satisfaction and am in no way swayed by the discount received.
B00QL6HXJI|1|too big again
B001LQMWW6|5|Great product
B000GZBZOE|5|Great fit, easy install, fast delivery.
B00FPR1SXG|5|I'd seen a few folks on car forums talking about these Japanese air fresheners. We have a 2001 Volvo S60 which (as all of these seem to) has an odor that you can't get rid of, it's an old plastic smell that some have compared to melted crayons. I think it comes from the foam padding on the carpet as it ages but wherever it is you cannot get rid of it easily.<br /><br />I decided to purchase these. They are much larger than I thought, I figured they were the size of a tin of mints but they are actually closer to the size of a VHS tape. Anyway, size doesn't matter in this situation since I just slid one under the passenger seat in the Volvo. At first I thought the smell was a too strong but you get used to it. It's been in the car a couple of months now and I no longer notice the bad odor so that is a thumbs up in my book.
B00JAXRA42|5|I bought this along with the floor liner set for my car.  I've always been a WeatherTech fan, so this was a no-brainer.  I've had the thing for a year and it's really put to the test.  Outside of normal use, grocery shopping, storing winter shovels, brushes, etc, we really put it to the test on our wedding.  I did a lot of the decorations/planning on my own, so my car carried cases of booze, ceramics, glasses, flowers, and all kinds of decorations.  Without this liner, my car trunk probably would've taken a beating.  But you lift up the liner, and everything is perfect under.  Don't buy the dealer ones.  WeatherTech is much better quality.
B00K29FTBE|5|It looks like it does in the picture.  Feels sturdy.  The red piece seems to be glued into place on the silver piece, but it doesn't feel loose or wobbly.  It's a nice little accent keychain.
B005WTPDOM|1|Terrible.  I have had these wiper blades for 3 months.  Within 2 months of having them, in a light yet steady rain, the driver wiper blade gets stuck to my windshield, thus stopping the wiper blades from properly cleaning my windshield.  The passenger side blade seems to be fine, but the most important side, the driver side, is giving me issues... even when the wiper setting is intermittent.  The first time this happened, I was driving home late at night with my daughter, in a rainstorm.  I had to pull over to the side of the road.  The next day, I cleaned the wiper blades to make sure no build up was on them, but the problems persists.  I do NOT put anything on my windshields to aid in the water beading off that my build up on the wiper blade.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, this is a driving safety hazard, thus I cannot recommend these wiper blades.<br /><br />Let me add that I change my wiper bladed every 6 mos, regardless of the blade cleaning well or not, as I live in South Florida and my car is parked outside, so I am observant to the fact that the sun and high temperatures, especially in the summer, can degrade the performance of the  blade more quikcly than other areas of the country.
B010CA65P6|1|Seat are hard to install. The picture you see is not what the covers look like when you try to install them.
B009TH7QSO|5|excelent product
B00JVTCQVC|5|except for new valves It has everything you need to refresh that high revving top end
B005NLQAHS|5|gets the job done every time i need it with the torque app
B005IUE8Z0|4|Good product but don't buy it here. Way over priced. I buy this for $52.00 for a case of 2 rolls.
B0032H56B6|5|Bought this cover 4 years ago and it still fits perfectly and looks great. We haul a 5th wheel trailer with our 2005 Silverado and needed something that would just fold out of the way. This works great and have never had an issue with taking it on and off or leaks. GREAT cover!
B00MEV3D6G|5|I used this in a truck we bought to get out the odors I didn't like. Worked great!
B00LHUI4XM|5|Nice product. Easy to install. Security screw covers are not an issue. Seems high quality and has a lifetime warranty, so I don't think you can go wrong buying.
B0072UHJ2I|5|worked out great. excellent construction, welding and met my specifications. shipping. wonderfIL and on-time. very pleased with product. first car as specified.
B00869A60G|4|It's Light, it's not really have.  But it starts falling apart from some reason.
B00HSQYI1Q|5|Very good quality, placed it on window with no problems.
B000VB8C80|5|great product!
B010VUZ99U|5|They look great!
B00FJFD6K2|5|GREAT PRICE
B00LX28WAO|5|These are great lights! I've heard reviews with people saying how they begin to condensate from the rain, but I've driven in numerous storms and have had my car sitting in the rain for long periods of time and nothing has happened to these lights yet. Definitely not top of the line, but neither is the price. These are very bright FLOOD lights (not spot), very solid construction, and very well worth the money.
B00L2G3YAO|5|Perfect Foyt and quick shipping
B007GLCTPK|5|Love this product!
B00279J3GE|5|Worked perfectly in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler.  Shipping occurred much quicker that was originally advertised which allowed me to replace my existing unit to help my family out here during the sweltering Florida summer.  Removal and replacement of unit into my Jeep took less than 15 minutes.
B003NKHOSU|5|Great I already used it to cover my two 10&#34; box speakers
B00UW09L8U|4|No issues with the light.<br />Alright I did have to remove the adjustment tabs from my stock ones to apply on to these.
B00BD5GU82|5|I love them. I have a Chystler 300 and they fit the front seats perfectly.
B00306YESK|5|Great and comfortable
B006B2XVB6|5|Easy up and and easy down. Space around the mirror is a little bigger than in photo, but other than that, fits my 2015 300S extremely well and looks very clean compared to many of the other shades.
B005VPS1GO|5|Arrived quickly, and it matches the original.
B00KTIW7SQ|5|OK Worked Good Had programmed for $35 @ dealer
B00NNYLBS0|5|WORKS GREAT ON BMW 335i
B003AN1UA8|5|I just replaced my junction box with it. Protects surges from shore or my 50amp generator without issue.<br /><br />I thought I might have issues with it protecting from the generator due to a couple of reviews on here, but I was more worried about surges from shore stations than my generator.<br /><br />Anyway it works fine with my generator and detailed instructions for use with a generator or external source or both is included.<br /><br />I did not put the wired remote in the interior - I kept it in the bay. Who needs a bright cycling light flashing at all times?<br /><br />Installation was straightforward as far as what to do - doing it was more challenging than I thought. When other reviewers mention the difficulty of working with the wires they are not kidding, so have your RV guys do it if you don't feel like grumbling a bit.<br /><br />I have used it 8+ hours on the generator Onan Marquis Gold 5500 without issue and had it hooked to both a 50amp and 30amp (with adapter) power station. No issues or cut-offs, but if there's any errors it gives you codes to troubleshoot.<br /><br />Last year I had a microwave &#34;pop&#34; and die at a park, so I got this guy because while they're a bit pricey - they're not as bad as these appliances, as you probably know.
B00ELPFIKC|4|For a lifted truck gen y is the way to go, people always asking me where they can get one!
B000C5HJTS|5|It fit
B001DRHMMS|5|Late model e90 335i.  A little tricky to install. Get a guide.
B001HLIMD8|5|Just what they said it was -- comfortable, fits just right, and good summer and winter
B00J9PKYYE|5|The tire cover was everything I expected. Fit like a glove and matched the factory distressed look.
B005OL7K4E|5|I've bought this more than once. Great Car Decal.
B001NYP6VU|5|What can you say about a drainplug? It does come with the attached O-ring style gasket & appears to be as good as OEM.  Won't be installing it for a little while since I just changed the oil & re-used the original.  (Had the oil changed when out of town by a ham handed chap who did a terrific job of rounding it off, hence the replacement plug)
B0027ID0RI|5|easy to install, did it myself in about 1 hour
B002XLHUQG|5|Works good on campers
B0081HPGBW|5|Other than not being spring loaded, I am extremely happy with this product.
B005JL2XBO|5|Keep the lizards away!!!!
B000C55L2A|1|Purchased these shocks for 2006 half ton Chevy Silverado. Both Monroe and Amazon said that these were the correct shocks. I opened the new shock box after removing one of the old shocks from my truck and discovered that these were the wrong shocks. These shocks have a cross bar at the bottom to bolt in place. My truck shocks have a inverted U shaped bracket to bolt on the frame. Amazon even made me pay to return the incorrect shocks. I went to my local auto parts store and even their computer said that this was the right part number. We had to search his computer for the correct Monroe part number. Correct number is 34501. Check your vehicle shocks to find out if you have the cross bar or the inverted U bracket before ordering. My truck handles more like a car with these (34501) shocks installed. Very pleased with my purchase from the auto parts store.
B0066QWDE8|5|Much cheaper to buy these sensors here for my bmw 750i than going to the dealer.<br /><br />Works as advertised for a fraction of the stealership costs.
B010MF74KQ|5|Better than promised.Easy to apply looks great!
B00JLJOPAW|5|Perfect fit for my Acura RSX, and I have AC now :)
B004DRWP54|5|Everything is as it should be, No issues.
B0023TQEFQ|3|Once again these are only one type of valve. These will not fit all models. They do not fit 2001 Ford Ranger truck.
B006P0WNMW|5|Did not leak during shipment.  Looks to be of good quality and was a decent price.
B001C7WR4W|5|Quick shipping, exactly as described. Great purchase...will be ordering more for my other vehicles.

B00FZQAKJA|5|Worked perfect for 08 dodge caliber
B008FQ6BAY|4|Quick shipping and easy install
B00XT6A5S4|5|All that was needed was a white sheet magnet and this decal and I now have a removable classic Autobot emblem for my car. I'm going to get 2 more of the 5&#34; version for my car.
B000HEBR3I|2|one battery compartment is damaged in that the contact & spring needed to make the battery work is missing
B002UJVNFA|5|Good product, great price
B004W4OP4W|4|Halos are not very bright.
B00757KJTI|3|reception isn't to bad in open spaces, but if you get in a city or on back roads it will be difficult to get reception
B00QQ6V7N6|3|Very bright lights! I use them as work lights on my truck and they serve their purpose. The only issue is that water got inside and made condensation in the lens.
B00WTCZK8Y|4|Shield could be 1/2 to 3/4 inches longer.  Other wise they are great!
B002UJVNFA|5|Three pairs for $10?? Can't go wrong. They are exactly as described in the listing. They look good, they fit, and you can chose from three different glasses. Can't go wrong!
B000C7ULO6|5|Fit my 03 Buick century perfect
B005XZX8RY|5|Great product! Works as we expected it to.
B004XJ0EF0|5|Just what I needed  to prevent me from being strangled from my car seatbelt
B0087PALFY|5|Great
B000A0CAWQ|5|Good Product for price.
B007SKAKPU|3|Did not work on my 2008 Honda Accord, but worked on Ford Escape
B00K0VMXDQ|5|This gadget already helped me to start the engine in my car twice. We are using it for trips and everything else that works on power; excellent product at a good price.
B008VQP2ZS|5|Great and heavy duty
B00524WTO4|5|A good product.  Very tough and works well.
B006PHM1M2|1|For this price I expected something more substantial.  These compare to $19.99 big box store floor mats.
B001OK6Q2Q|5|didn't need it but it's good to have a spare.
B007V6AR9U|5|Sturdy, not cheaply made and my husband loves this.
B00YJL5ZQK|5|Great
B007L68ZR6|5|Nicely made and good size
B0006V2BK0|4|good product at a good price. did try to use it ,but my vehicle was not as willing as I was .fuel line was hard lined in and would not allow for the adaptor. will try again
B004A66JSC|5|great pads, not much else I can say
B0001EXGZG|4|Great value! It fits our truck but it doesn't go as far across the front end as our previous one but looks nice. It's easy to install.
B001B5EPZE|5|I am extremely happy with this clutch. I had a mechanic come out and install it in a few hours with no problem. Gave it a nice 500 mile break in and now I can drive like I want to :)
B00NPIUFMM|5|Bright as expected.
B00KMDES8K|5|My husband was so excited to get this and put it on his car.  Wish there were more saprissa items for the fan in our home.  Vamos Monstros!
B00GONFTTE|5|Very nice thank you
B000NJ9XEC|5|Old pull had lock, did not what lock. Fit right, same screw holes.
B00KT1BH1Q|5|Looks good in the cluster but could be brighter
B001N729FS|5|Works great and easy to operate
B000HBGHFY|5|I could not locate the low strength anywhere local, even local gun stores want to use blue on scope mounts, I just don't want to run the risk of stripping out a screw trying to get it loose. It is very nice to have the peace of mind that the mounts will stay put.
B0101A484C|5|Up yours Yeb!
B00F47Z1PS|5|Great product and easy installation. Great communication with the company. I ordered the wrong product and they overnighted the right one.
B00CCYWJQK|5|Was highly recommended to us as the answer for RV toilet tank emptying
B00EQ4IQ7U|5|Will definitely encourage the common opportunistic criminal to move on to an easier target, but I'm pretty sure a professional will have the keys on hand. Solved that by tig welding a spot to make standard keys not work.
B0000AXVCB|5|After driving on quite a few gravel roads leaving the lake my boat was quit dirty. I tried just washing it off with a hose and water without any luck.<br /><br />This boat was was amazing,  just rinse, apply with soft MIT or sponge  and rinse off. Boat was as clean or cleaner than when I purchased it.
B00QWVGSKW|2|So I got this led light on Aug25 2015 it worked fine till now it started flickering the hole time I checked all the connections check old the connection and everything seems fine so the only think I can think of is that the transformer is bad, But so fast?.......
B00BG07E5M|5|Most Awesome Product Mild to Wild in 10 mins!
B009DJQPF8|5|GREAT
B00EC0Z28O|5|Perfect fit fast delivery
B0055XHBHC|5|Replace the cheap mattress that came with the RV which had less than a year's use. What a difference! Have used it for about a month now, great mattress. Does not bottom out, not even close to it. If you need to replace your RV mattress this is the one.
B008G1Z2Z8|5|Wanted stock light s and they fit perfect on my chevy!
B00APO9Y6C|5|I ordered (2) of these chrome frames for my new Denali truck. Delivered 2 days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. Looks good on my truck!<br />I will order another chrome frame with the Logo on the bottom to replace the front frame. The positioning of the Logo on the front frame for the 2015 Denali trucks in my opinion needs to be on the bottom of the frame, as being on the top it's not visible when standing near the truck. The rear frame needs the Logo on the top due to the bumper design to make it visible and not hidden by the bumper. I am very pleased with this seller!
B0060HVFO2|4|works wonderfuly
B00OTZS2DE|5|I have a 2004 Lancer I have to say this looks really good considering that I do have this submodel and Price cannot be beat and they are pretty comfortable though they do have a tendency to slide
B000PUKTLU|5|Fit is perfect and they come with the tabs that secure them to the floorboard. Don't understand why 2 strips or rubber are so expensive.. oh wait, because they CAN be...
B000SL4AA2|4|Gauge not so accurate.
B000E2AOQO|5|I changed out the factory filter on my 2002 Yamaha with this K&N for two reasons. A better breathing filter, and the last filter I'll have to buy. Clean the filter every couple of years with K&N's recharger kit and that's it.  I have used K&N filters for years In all my vehicles and have never been disappointed.  I also use their oil filters in the Yamaha as well.
B00480N0E6|5|Exact replacement for my headlight that burned out.  Works great.  I do not notice any difference from my other headlight.  I like this headlight for the value and the longer life that it will have over some of the more expensive models.  The bulb plugged right in with no problem. Will buy again in the future if I ever need another headlight.
B0049MZBY0|5|great hitch, fast shipping.
B000OR18BE|4|It's worked out perfect.
B00M4K4KWI|5|Looks so much better in person and the convenient bag is a plus. Helps keep our truck cooler during these hot summer days, and protects the dash! Top quality materials and well worth the price. We recommend this product to Chevy truck owners!
B00A9T28S4|5|Discolored headlights are a real problem and Turtle Wax introduced this product a few years ago as a solution. Its strange that only the headlight restoration kit is promoted.. To use this headlight cleaner by hand, it requires some elbow grease to clean up the plastic. This is more like a cleaner wax for cloudy headlights and red tail lights that have yellowed from the sun. Keep in mind this is a fine plastic polish and not a heavy rubbing compound.<br /><br />This T-43 product is also effective on a rotary foam polishing pad with excellent results. This is the drill kit I use to polish my plastic lens to very good condition [[ASIN:B00Y443ZDW ZFE 3&#34; Polishing Pad Kit]] TIP: when using a drill powered polishing pad, use low speed to prevent splatter as this polish is quite thin. Wash off any splatter because it may dry and become difficult to remove (typical of most polish or compounds).<br /><br />This cleaner sealant also does a great job cleaning plastic chrome on your vehicle and making it sparkle with a protective coating. Turtle Wax has made this product with ease of use and value in mind. Considering the price for this 9-oz bottle, it will last for a long time because I use about a teaspoon of product on each headlight for a maintenance cleaning. Reapply often to prevent your headlights from looking bad, this also helps with improved visibility after dark.
B000CO96SG|5|They worked.  A lot cheaper than a new regulator.
B00WDY9X9U|1|If your seat doesn't fold down they don't fit right
B00069IASY|5|Have been using for years and have yet to see rust on anything.  It does need to be changed annually for maximum effectiveness.
B00E9I960E|2|It's not bad for the price but I'd look else where for one
B009681GM8|5|Alot of people are giving this product a bad rep but i honestly think it depends on the vehicle you want to put this into i have a 2004 jeep wrangler with this supercharger installe and i have seen a significant change on its performance plus it does saves me alot of gas when i drive far which is every weekend almost half of what i waist
B0067XNVA0|2|Was a nice gauge I loved the way it looked but on this one you get what you paid for. It didn't last long and then quit working
B0002JMV06|4|works wonderfully helped get my 2003 Ford Focus running better after learning my car still had the original fuel filter
B00C0T2V1U|5|Perfect color and fit. They look Great!
B00PD8AWGQ|5|Great
B00GNJ2XT8|5|Had to return, easy to return and get my money back!<br />Good item, just wouldn't work with my car... not the seller's fault, it was a defect in my remote starter!<br />This seller offers like new products at a more than fair price!!!
B000CPJLEY|5|good job for me
B001O0TZ7E|5|Brakes are quiet now.
B00DIGV4MG|5|Exactly what I needed.  Great price to replace old worn seat belts on our CJ.
B00HR06E1K|1|This product DOES NOT WORK!! EVEN AFTER CURING! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B00OCI1AA0|4|Got this for my atv,  works great even in fog.
B000F17HQE|5|Fits perfectly! Color is spot on!  Love this company and product!!!
B0085KGOH0|5|great waste transport use all the time
B00EFA1ZH8|5|Looks great on my new truck!
B000VKZNHE|5|Fit perfectly!
B0082K00WS|5|No chirpping like the old factory belt.
B009R566KW|4|Does what it is supposed to
B008UR7J6I|1|did not work with mac. software would not install
B0053GL4YC|2|I'm a flatbed driver and these were kind of cheap they break really fast I would recommend buying the orange corner protector,s from truck stops not these you get alot of them but it's kind of a one time use
B004C6S1HM|1|READ!!! These are not a direct bolt on for 2011 and up F250/F350 series trucks. I previously had a 2006 F250 and they were perfect. I expected the same with my newer 2011. There are no matching bolt holes in the newer frame. Plan to have to drill holes to make these work. Also note that the Ford frame rails are hardened steel and will require a high quality drill bit. I spoke with Curt and they swear the ford frames are the same. They are not. If you are a mechanic these are still a much better option to start with than the hassle of a universal kit but if you are a shade tree mechanic I suggest acquiring some help. Curt makes great stuff but this item fell short of expectations.
B0047DGVPY|5|not the problem
B00CMSPFFS|5|Was a snap to install and looks great. I have already used for my SUP and kayak.
B00AAMH704|5|So, I read where people say replace the entire arm. I am too cheap. Here is a simple explanation for how to replace THIS blade:<br />http://www.carcarekiosk.com/video/2004_Mini_Cooper_S_1.6L_4_Cyl._Supercharged/windshield_wiper_blade_rear/replace_wiper_blade<br /><br />Worked like a champ - 2 minutes max time to fix it, and the price was great!
B001QII1II|5|Was looking to upgrade from my cheap helmet & looked quite a while before settling on this helmet. Are there better styled helmets? Sure, a few. Are there helmets with better safety ratings, probably. Can you get those helmets for under $150? I never saw one. When the HJC arrived rather than travel with a helmet I knew fit, I took my chances and left on a 1500 mile road trip with this helmet out of the box and could not have been happier. It's quiet and unintrusive (there was a time or two I tried to take a drink and forgot the shield was down.) I like the satin black and the lines on the helmet. The vents kept my head cool and the helmet is light enough that there was no major neck or shoulder strain. Given it wasn't broken in when I left I was shocked at how well this fit. I've seen a review or two that the shell is fairly large which is a fair statement, but it's no larger than a typical full face helmet. If you have a small head you might look like Dark Helmet from Spaceballs, but I'm a 6' / 195 lb dude with a normal sized head and I don't think it's overly massive on my noodle. Really like this helmet, very glad I bought one and will probably get another soon for my slightly smaller noodled wife so we can nickname HER Dark Helmet.
B008B5WQMQ|5|Great price. Saved about $20.00 per jug
B000OO2NZC|5|works great
B00XZ9PKW6|5|Feels good on the key fob.  Provides protection
B00G186POK|1|1 of the 4 were defective.  No brighter than the existing done light,  possibly even dimmer.
B0045UY8MC|5|Great product . Keeps my windshield clean without streaks . Easy to install .
B000BN3A4Y|5|Very useful
B00OPMIR2M|5|Tested this one against gauges that cost 3x as much and it had same pressure results. Very happy with it!
B00HSHW3BM|5|Great product, exact fit on Aurion.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Great product
B0027A6N4I|5|Excellent fit on my 2002  highlander- 6 cylinder. Greta price point.
B006K8YQYW|5|good product for the price
B003YDY89Y|5|Exactly what we needed.<br />Works great!
B00NRVB846|1|The lights work half the time
B00HDMEUCW|1|If i could pick negative stars i would.  This is an absolute terrible product.  Almost immediately after i put this cover over my seats the back of it started to disintegrate.  This left little white pieces of the back all over my car.  I would never buy this again or recommend anyone else to either.
B005FM1066|5|Great just that I cant figure out how to secure the bottom of the grille.
B009OBW29S|5|Great product! My 10 year old 4Runner's paint looks new with a mirror finish and it makes minor scratches all but disappear. A little goes a long way.
B00FT6AYCO|5|Good
B00KTIUG5C|5|They both work flawlessly, just what I expected!
B003TUCFDI|5|Just what I needed to correct a squeaking belt at startup in my Pathfinder. Only thing is Nissan should have paid for this since we did complain about the issue when the vehicle was under warranty.
B000EDOT8C|5|Worked great in our RV, didn't even move around while towing it.  Gives a little extra prep space in tight kitchens.  The plastic flexible mat is great cuz it keeps the board looking good and easier to clean.
B0013KOHMI|3|These lights are absolutely NOT 5000K. If they were they would be pure white with no yellow or blue tinges. These definitely have yellow in them. I would estimate they are about 4000K. Sitting next to my 5000K LED running lights the difference is painfully obvious. I am very disappointed since the whole reason I bought them was to match the running lights.<br /><br />That said, they are very bright so I still gave them three stars. Just don't buy them expecting true 5000K.
B00GVV4LMK|5|👍🏻
B004BP5GAY|3|It came with a small cosmetic flaw on the face of the cross plate, but decided it can be buffed out.  Just bummed it was shipped that way.
B0023UO0II|3|Not much fragrance, poorly packaged.
B011TX5JRU|5|Great price, fast shipping.  Was part of my altima engine rebuild.  TY
B00HD9BCPS|5|Great shield looks awesome suggested product
B000COTXPM|4|I took a chance with these, not being able to smell them virtually of course, and I must say I was pretty impressed!<br /><br />They're certainly much more aesthetically appealing than other car fresheners I've purchased, and they don't have any gel or residue that rubs off.  Since then I have tried a few other fresheners and I found that these ones lasted a little longer than my other ones, even though they have no visible substance on them.<br /><br />I had no issues with them staying in place and they even fit in my oddly shaped air vents.  I was able to leave two in the package and I placed something on the package while storing it to 'seal' or 'preserve' the scent inside - when my first two ran out I pulled out the two I stored and they were just as effective.<br /><br />A product this simple doesn't need to be overly evaluated in my opinion - it has a pleasant smell to it that even my roommate who is direly sensitive to these things was able to withstand it - which is truly saying something.  Overall, a good buy.
B007RY873Y|5|the filler neck makes the difference . so easy to fill side by sides
B006FG2EOS|2|Previously used box and not even sure product is new. Mechanic grime on box. Will Return for new item.
B000C9WJ3A|5|This a fine Cabin Air Filter, it fits perfectly in my Civic Honda 2012, way less expensive that the Dealer option (around 120USD). Works fine and only take like 2 minutes to replace the old one, I have been buying this product for the last two years (each six months), Never have a problem.
B000OQKJB0|5|Worked fine
B004RNR9QY|5|Work great, but when they get kinked the kink kind of stays there as a visible fold
B001CF3NSS|5|Covers all the farm and components, not to much of the tire, but for the price its good! Cant complain, it will mostly be used for storage so it won't get to many elements
B0049CFV54|5|Perfect match to original part.
B0006GF5SK|5|Works great.
B004VSF5I4|3|Dosen't last as long as the powder blue I used to buy!
B008G348WO|5|Looks nice
B0046NNMCA|4|It is missing a bolt to hold it in place. Easy fix but odd to be missing
B006DX3R44|4|Replaced the wiper om the back of the Santa Fe perfectly.
B008XLGQM4|4|Lightweight, comfortable and does the job (although this has not been thoroughly tested...and I hope it never is!).  The visor has to be attached, which I wasn't expecting...and it is flimsy.  Otherwise, a decent product for the price!
B00AQ29FOY|1|Complete garbage.
B004YIDI76|3|License plate hits on my hella lights wiring. Had to bend bracket 😕
B007Y5SBFA|5|So far so good, good quality and fitment.
B00DOOY88E|2|They are powerful, but are slow to open compared to the OED parts, and the don't seem to open the gate as wide.
B00NXRY5GW|5|These are as good as wipers I've paid double the price for. No issues installing on our car (Avalon) or our truck (F250).
B00C2NRQUK|5|Took away the belt squeaking of my Dodge Ram truck. Amazing product.
B00S5UYAJO|1|it said the paint color was blue granite metallic but it was not
B00L2LM59U|5|Great bed liner
B0069SMLRC|3|The price was right. Be sure to put the water in your jug FIRST (as instructed) then add the washer fluid. Otherwise you will be fighting a lot of suds squirting out the top as you fill the jug. (Just a friendly piece of advice for my fellow guys who also don't read instructions.)
B00BLBR9KQ|5|Great clear coat.
B000E4PV6A|5|Fit like it was supposed to
B007KPUHMY|4|I've had this on my 99 Fatboy since 2002.  No issues, chrome has held up well and no issues in working with the brake line or caliper.  I'd would have given it 5 stars, however I cannot find a matching clutch perch.  Chrome is chrome right; well that's not the issue.  If you look at this from the back side where the clamp bolts onto the body around the bars, you'll notice the half moon clamp piece has a tapered shape.  It does not match the Harley half moon piece, nor any other aftermarket piece.  If DBI made a matching clutch perch then it would be great for the perfectionists out there.  I've got to replace my clutch perch so I'm going to try and mess around with some extra parts to see if the original Harley half moon piece will fit on this master cylinder. Will post results later.
B000VBIWYY|5|Best price, easy to install, quick delivery
B00EECM3QY|5|Love the lights. Fast delivery
B00X2TUW1I|3|OK for the Price
B00BTJQ1HC|4|This is the best paint supplier for my BMW motorcycle
B00SFSQ21K|5|Very bright. Switchback function works correctly except for a slight delay around 1 Second, which I think all switchbacks do anyway. Just need front resistors. You almost certainly WILL have hyperflash if your car was not manufactured with LED already installed.
B00Z8TGYR6|5|This is wonderful-had it delivered today and installed by the boys at Tint World in Coral Springs,FL. They did a great job as always.Really like the back up feature. This adds safety to the rear end and may save a life...from someone behind you &#34;texting&#34; or just not paying attention.Thats piece of mind.
B009DJ1OWC|5|Works great in my 2010 328i, I will say in the same league as the K&N.
B0006JLW84|5|Time to replace alot on the old camp trailer. Everything we ordered is working out.
B00JI4ADUG|5|excellent , really woke the car up
B003UTH088|5|While I don't believe this item is the EXACT FOB given by the GM dealership, it does work as intended, including the remote start and back door functionalities.  Will buy from here again if I decide to was my keys for a second time.
B0017R5EQK|5|Easy to use. Together with other tools, confirmed bad battery.
B00ENAXW7Q|2|Don't fit my thread size but it said it fits my bike. Looks nice though
B00N31S0M8|4|Timing belt marks did not line up exact, all of the other components fit properly
B00J59GYG6|5|Looks nice and works well....
B00BLAG3D6|1|This is a Federal Signal Viper S2 that retails for over $200 but its one that's defective and been returned or never made it passed quality control and then sold off to a wholesaler for cheap rather than throw it away is my guess.  While it works, one of the LED's on the left bulb is out and two on the right are very weak.  It's hard to notice and took me several seconds of looking for defects to spot it.  I would return it had I paid full price but for $22 shipped, I can't really complain.  They're fairly bright and show up well enough in the daytime.  Not great but better than average.  I wouldn't use them as anything other than secondary lighting though.  If you can afford a brand spankin' new dashlight like the Whelen Slim-Miser ($85) then I'd go for it instead as it would be defect free but if you're needing something on the cheap then these are hard to beat.  I do however believe it will be a crap shoot as to which defect you get.  I'm sure they will all be defective to some degree, its just a matter of how bad it is.  *edit* Had it 2 days and it died. Didn't expect much for $22 but expected it to work at least.
B004ZJZOQM|5|Exactly what I needed for my Honda 350X
B00SQTXY7S|5|These are a  beautiful on our 1968 Cougar.  We are all ready to show them off at the Burn the Point event in Billings, Monatana over the Labor Day Holiday.
B0002SQYV4|5|If you're like me and you got silicone wax on your trim and plastics this is what you need to correct that. It will remove the chalky white buildup with just a little gentle scrubbing. Then it will leave anything dark looking absolutely brand new. Worth every penny.
B00AC6SAZE|1|Bad deal. Every time I want to use this I have to go to settings to make sure it is on . It shuts off on its on. As others had said,  headset too oo big. Very little adjustment. Just not worth foolin with. Really disappointed.
B00J06CHM4|1|Fine if you don't use the LATCH - missing center cutouts.  Wet Okole next time...
B00CU4KETQ|3|Fits perfectly but boy does it get hot. Almost too hot too touch. We live in SoCal desert so the shield sees intense sun. Interior is cooler, for sure, but removing the shield is difficult because it is blazing hot. Should have probably purchased a white shield instead of one that absorbs the heat like this. We thought the silver e terror would reflect instead of absorb I'll keep it though because it was expensive.
B00QJFB2YI|5|Excellent! Super Bright and Well Constructed. Perfectly fits inside a Porsche Cayenne grill.
B0001WW37U|3|A little flimsy.
B000CIOA0Q|4|NICE QUALITY PRODUCT, MADE USA..
B00BR1TLS8|1|Let me preface this by saying I don't think the people who made this are going to stand behind it when I call them tomorrow, despite posting on here &#34;Please call us and we will make all your problems vanish (After you mail it to china, wait 7 months, and sacrifice your first born child.) LETS BE REAL: if they ACTUALLY cared about the &#34;Customer Experience&#34; they wouldn't use the POOREST QUALITY CHINESE LITHIUM ION cells to be had on the market. I just pulled the battery out of mine and checked. Really, I bet they paid less than 33 cents per cell, they are THAT bad of batteries. ITS A WONDER THEY LASTED THREE DISCHARGE CYCLES WITHOUT BURNING DOWN MY HOUSE<br /><br />Used the light three times for 5-7 minutes each time, recharging after each. The fourth time, a utility transformer exploded next to my house and I went outside with my spotlight to investigate the explosion, and the light engaged, fired for 6 seconds, then shut down. Tried again: The same. I thought it was strange, as I cannot remember it ever having done that: Took it apart and stuck the old digital multi-meter in: Sure enough: Bad batteries.<br /><br />I am going to tell them to send out a replacement, send me new battery pack, Or I am sending a 3 page letter to the better business bureau and the president of Black and Decker. I am not waiting 7 months and mailing it to china. They can either help me, or I will box this, and the other two Black and Decker spotlights I bought up and take them all back to wally world to be lovingly returned to the proprietors of such crap. Can I say crap?
B000CLOH4C|5|Good  set of pads ( 4 pads for both front breaks) . Installation was fairly simple . The only thing is it does NOT come with replacement shims other then that there well packaged ,even came with a little pack of grease
B00BTIPLDI|5|Very satisfied with my purchase!  Highly recommend it.
B000EDUUHQ|5|solves my medicine cabinet problem!
B005OV4Q1E|4|I thought ACDelco made all of their filters in the US/Canada? This one was made in China...<br /><br />Besides that, the filter fit my 2010 Honda Accord Ex-L perfectly.  I read ACDelco filters better than most other filters. Granted the article was from 2006, I would hope most of it still holds true today.  In any case, I'm happy with the filter, just wish it was American made.<br />http://forums.nicoclub.com/debunking-the-k-n-myth-why-oem-is-better-t180100.html
B009SQAGUG|3|Kind of good, this says a fairing kit but I had to buy a lot of extras cause there was not enough, and some bolts are not the right size!
B0040CYTFQ|5|Good item to have for future use as new ones came with the mud flap I ordered.
B00GHT0VDY|2|The quality is cheap.  And it does not light up
B00IKKS4W8|5|These are much better than the original equipment.  Did have to drill new holes as these did not match up completely with the originals.
B0018C85VK|5|Easy snap on installation. Pop my tool box lid right open without any trouble.
B003L2ZQEY|5|Solid product.
B006B9Z2CA|5|I love the scent<br />Fast delivery
B004KG4BNC|1|broke within 10 miles, sent back never got a replacement
B000GU7DGS|5|As like the Dowco cover purchased, this is a well made quality product. Alarm works as described in the company product description.
B004NGWPE6|5|work perfectly
B00VU7LFWE|5|I was very pleased with the result from these coil spacers.  Installed on my 2009 Ram 1500 SLT Crew Cab.  Front end stock was 35 3/4&#34; and rear was 39 1/4&#34;.  After the install I now sit at 38 1/2&#34; in the front, nearly level.  Install with all hand tools in my garage took about 5.5 hours with tear down and install.  As long as you torque to specs you will be set.  Again very pleased with this product.
B00DBEODMI|3|Okay
B004A30LS4|5|The board was an exact fit. there are so many to choose from the pictures helped. To find a part for an older RV so easily was great
B00JX2TZZC|5|They fit Well and are really a pretty bright white. They have popped out you can check on them and secure them. The plastic on everyone's fender are going to be different but its not hard to secure this a little more. It came in quality packaging with everything you need.
B00NJRGD70|4|This is a good car sun shade. It's a little big for a 2012 VW Jetta but it still provides more than the cheaper sun shades.
B004YJ08GO|3|Doesn't fit too well on my steering wheel, so it rotates. However, it looks nice and wasn't hard to put on.
B004A4XQOE|4|not the problem
B000BOAQUE|1|I received the wrong fuses ... I ordered a second set of mini fuses but received large fuses
B0024E6QX0|4|Works as intended.
B004DA1AIY|5|Ads a very nice touch to the bike. it is very well maid, I love it.
B00VGMLOB0|5|Good seat covers, protects the seat from the dog nails.
B0066SOHVI|5|matched the OEM part really well. No trouble installing.
B00OM1GI0Y|5|It's perfect!
B000A1794E|4|Since I just received this item and installed it today, this review is only on the instructions and the install process.  The instructions cover a broad spectrum of vehicles so much of the instructions do not apply to my vehicle.  Once I understood that part, it was simple.  The rocker panel is the main attachment point but it does come with hardware to brace against the frame.  Instructions say the additional bracing should be used  if more than 350 lbs will be applied to the steps.  We both together don't weigh quite that much but I installed the extra bracing anyway because it just feels more solid.  The install was done in about three hours with no major problems.  Broke several 1/8 in bits drilling through the rocker panel but otherwise it was simple.
B000CITK8S|5|Good product and delivered on time.
B004GEHPCC|4|Mine did not come with clips. Which I needed a few of. Otherwise it fits perfectly.
B001FKSNUI|5|Works as advertised and great price.
B001G6MYX8|5|Great price and OEM made.  I have seen these advertised for much more, and they are exactly the same as Genuine BMW control arms.  I couldn't be more pleased!
B00UZYIJ68|5|Great filter, awesome price!
B004AHC57K|5|Good fuses not crappie Chinese ones that melt into you fuse box will buy again hahaha after I us up the 500 I just bought
B008SO6BDK|5|Unfortunately I didn't  read the description close enough and pay attention to the dimensions. However that is MY fault not the product. The product functions perfectly. They work great, came in good condition. So they will remain in my electronics kit until I need them. Price was too good to bother sending back, and they WILL be used eventually.
B000GD5FMY|2|Their cheap, but they don't protect from the wind very well above 30ish mph.

B0091OE6K6|5|these solved my problem-- love them
B0055DO0UI|5|no problem install and working great
B000MK4GPI|5|This fit my 2003 GMC Sierra, 5.3L. I bought this as a replacement for one I had years ago, that one fell out on the highway I guess. This model seems to be updated. You remove the single tow hook bolt from the bottom with a 18mm wrench and slide the scoop in behind the tow hook and replace the bolt thru the scoop into the tow hook. I don't remember the old model having this hole for the bolt. This is a good update so the scoop can't fall out. The tube fit well, there was only a gap of 1/2&#34; or so between the scoop tube and the tube out of the bottom of the air box. So the 3&#34; silicon sleeve easily sealed that up. I also purchased the pre filter (Volant 51906) as recommended to stop water infiltration.
B011BWFNWU|4|Works great, fits on visor perfect.  Clamping power could be a lil more but none the less a good product
B000CNN106|4|I watched countless youtube videos prior to purchasing this exhaust for my 2005 Dodge Magnum RT.  I knew I didn't want the way too aggressive sound of the American Thunder system but I wish there had been a level in between.  This system is a little on the quiet side.  I know that's probably a good thing, being that I have neighbors and all, but a small part of me really wishes it had just a little more growl.  I have a K&N cold air intake so that helps, I imagine it would be way quieter without that.  I might add straight pipe where the resonators are to see if that livens it up a bit.  I should mention that all of this commentary is about idle, mild acceleration, and cruising.  When you put your foot in it, this system definitely lets everyone know you've got a Hemi under the hood.<br />As for the installation, it went super smooth.  It is definitely a 2 person job though.  The hardest part was the removal of the stock system.  Once we got that out the actual install only took about a half hour.  Granted, we're pretty handy with a wrench and we had all the tools we needed, but if this takes you more than 2-3 hours total (including beer breaks) something went terribly wrong.<br />Overall, this system is great, I gained a few MPG, the car sounds great and I haven't annoyed my wife or the neighbors too badly.
B00KTHXW0E|5|Worked perfect
B00F9LPJ8S|5|Great improvement over stock battery! Much lighter and takes up less space inside the battery box.
B002716MKM|5|Great way to hold onto a key fob.

B00T4DIVJQ|3|They work. You get what you pay for.  But I'd recommend buying a more sturdy version, a model where the hinges are intigrated into the structure of the door assembly. Wouldn't recommend them to a friend.
B00GHT8NAC|5|fit perfect in my 06' GMC 1500. easy install and working great.

B00O8JT13G|5|Works.
B000RD906K|4|No issues
B0012ILUO4|5|I always wanted to get rid of my 02 ram 1500 4.7L because I wasn't happy with the performance till I bought the superchips cortex with the spark plugs advance and octane tuning tire size it really makes a big difference on performance now I have air cooling 180 jet thermostat cat back and Gibson headers
B008VN1BXS|4|The cap is wider than the one on my mazda 6, I had to grind it to make it fit, but so far works great.
B00SN9FUBO|3|Its a great looking hat, but I do not like the plastic inner shell.  The plastic inner shell is on the front of the hat, its apparently to keep its shape, but when worn it give the hat a high top and looks odd from the side.  I can't find a way to remove it, since its glued to the front panels.  Otherwise a sharp looking hat, until worn.
B00KBB6HNC|4|Too expensive but as near as can be told it is new and OEM.  Installation was not all that difficult but now I wonder what made the first one break.  The shipping was fast.
B003DUFD6K|3|It didn't fit in my Jeep due to my roll cage being SLIGHTLY too wide where it mounts.
B008OY8VDC|5|the flasher is fast, and very easy to put on
B005G6J3EM|5|Very lovely. I stuck it on my laptop.
B008NMHDYS|5|Fit and works...!  Saved over $400..!
B008XN7EJQ|1|dose not fit what you say it dose 2 times the size !!!
B00KJVOQO6|2|These work well enough, but aren't really an accurate depiction on the islands.  However, I've yet to see a sticker get it right.
B007AORLC4|5|Easy install.  Extremely handy and much better than my old booster.  I do miss the 12V cigarette lighter plug though.
B004GZKWAI|4|Nice
B0012INQG4|4|Very nice horn, sturdy and rugged, shipping was great. The only reason I'm not giving it a five star is because mine did not come with any hardware for mounting. Even so, I am very satisfied.
B004K8MLF0|5|It fit just right.
B000CQPNI6|1|Lots of dust! Also activating my abs for no reason.  I've had them and the system inspected and nobody can find a cause.
B0024E6QX0|5|These are fantastic to block the heat coming in from the vents in our RV! Especially in Florida. Easy to remove when we get to a cooler place!
B00NMBVPR6|2|Very thin, and not all connected
B000Q86IQQ|5|Works great in our RV!
B001U8QS9I|1|tears easily and the vinyl part peels. not durable. I guess I should have paid same price some where else and gotten a higher grade material,
B001PWA0IO|1|Broke in a week. Very fragile. Update.. I wish I could give it negative stars as it broke my turn signal when it popped off for the second time. TERRIBLE PRODUCT!
B003TTL0TE|5|works perfect!!!
B00OZD6KYI|5|It was a perfect fit just like the original
B00JU4NJ7I|5|Used in on my car. It was easy to apply and looks good

B00QJAKFLY|5|This fits older Dodge Durango blower motor resistors.
B0006IE4RQ|5|INSTALLED IN MINUTES
B004GYBFQO|5|This was purchased to replace one that came on my son's car due to it's paint & sealer peeling and the mounting screws falling off. This spoiler arrived in record time and ready to paint. After it was painted, sealed and mounted on the car, it matches beautifully and is very securely attached.
B009DK4VVW|5|Godd product..low price
B001KW00NY|5|Amazing product. Great price and keeps everything dry. It is very secure on the top of the vehicle and it is pretty impressive just how much stuff you can pack in there.
B00IJJP4XC|5|Good quality and easy to use
B00OK702NO|4|Shipping was a bit slow, but the product arrived in good shape. Seems to be a sturdy housing that is sealed well. It has been through some water with no issues so far. Light output is excellent and does what it is supposed to.
B00KH2X8W8|4|perfect
B00199JJ1C|5|Worked and installed fine. No issues or grinding.
B005E40BBA|5|My husband really likes this Plate frame. Looks good....easy to install
B003VMZFUE|5|This is a great lightweight but protective motorcycle jacket. Has protection but not hot on a summer day, the mesh is awesome- it lets air flow right through it and keeps you nice and cool.I actually bought a lightweight sweater to wear under it for summer nights when it is a little cooler.  I did as others suggested and ordered a size up than I normally wear and was happy that I did, fits me perfectly. Very happpy with this purchase. The colors  are well represented online.
B0002NUO5Q|5|seems to work very good so far
B004W4ONHQ|1|I like the style but when I got a headlight adjustment the dealership could not align them all the way because the screw was all the way in that adjusts the beam
B006N9IENC|2|Installed these on my Envoy Denali XL. Very good quality for the price and made by AC Delco.<br />(UPDATE)<br />After installing these 3 months ago the rubber boots are weather and rotted through and no long hold in grease. The most inexpensive component of this part was the boot and they skimped on that. I have worked at GM dealers as a Tech for 17 years and I figured the advantage line was a decent alternative to the professional which is essentially the real OEM replacement part line. Unfortunately this part is not I keeping with the promised standards of AC Delco. I have never seen the rubber rot out so fast on any AC Delco part like it has on these ball joints.<br /><br />I haven't contacted Amazon about the issue yet so I can not comment on what the outcome will be, but I will update as soon as I do.  But as far as the part goes it the initial quality was great. Good install and better ride, but the rubber is bad  allowing grease to leak out and water and dirt to enter which will lead to premature wear significantly reducing  the life of the joint.
B011WZSTD6|1|Unfortunately, these are no good. I bought the 48mm version, and I was impressed with the build quality and fit, until I held it up to the light. The filter element does not extend down to the bottom of the filter, where the chrome end cap is. Consequentially, if you use these, your engine will be sucking everything right in through the bottom and down into your engine. It's really unfortunate as it fit my bike perfectly.
B004SUO5QS|5|They worked and easier to install then expected!
B00KTHU1QM|5|Great Product for the price. Defiantly not the original and the only reason I say that is the button quality. You can actually feel the click. Some people may like or dislike it. To me it doesn't matter. Does what it's supposed to do and for a good price.
B000WP1O0S|5|Worked great...sounds great! Installation took a little longer than expected...don't forget to jet the carbs
B000BQYH3Y|5|Its just as I expected it to be
B00KTIBFQG|5|Just what we needed!
B000C91G7K|5|Perfect fit on my 99 TJ. Matches the original too the tee.. Fits all original hanger brackets perfectly. I used a high heat enamel on it to give it a little more protection from the elements.
B00IJET046|5|Did the trick!
B009KP77WU|1|Easy to install, but it is a POS! Worked great for about 200 miles of my 550 mile trip. It shorted out my Patriot's taillights so I hat to unhook it on the side of the road and continue my trip with no trailer lights. Called and emailed Curt a few times, still waiting for them to contact me back!!
B000MBTY1I|5|Never had a Tonneau cover before but am glad I picked this one. Works and fits great. The seller delivered it VERY promptly and would definitely recommend both this seller and the cover.
B0002U1TXK|1|Black streaks when it rains
B00CTLGSZO|5|Looked up a video online on how to install and am extremely happy with the product and the install.
B00KVWQCCC|4|Ordered these to replace my burnt bulbs on my 04 TSX. Expected them to be at least a little brighter but they provide sufficient lighting at night and look better than the yellow incandescent ones. They are polar sensitive just like all LEDs, so if you think you got bad ones, make sure to spin them around until they work, I noticed a lot of people have complained about this issue but most likely they aren't making sure they are in their right polar.
B00192JFBI|5|if youve ever experienced the headache of birds nesting in ur outside heater intake and heater turns on its a mess and verry much a pain in the butt to clean the nest out had i known this was possible i woulda used thhese years ago... great investment to any camper

B0117RZBKS|5|Excellent
B00BXPRWZC|5|Great item my wife loved it
B003EP2UL0|4|I installed on a 2000 Tundra only needed the lower bushings cause i have an upgraded UCA. Well the Lower control arm (LCA) has the adjustment for the Camber and Caster so you need the special washers, it was a pain to do this correctly. The washers and sleeves are not what you will need for the LCA so you will need to find a way to make the old ones work. There are tutorials and write ups out there. Tundrasolutions.com was a huge help!
B004ZG7TH2|5|Fits my Heratige Softail perfect. I love the elastic bottom. It gives it a nice snug fit.
B00GKRQ7DG|5|My daughter grew up watching Sailor Moon, she loves the decal and it's a conversation starter. :)
B00KAO0U9M|5|Sticker came quickly, attached to my metal cabinet without any issue.
B00HSFB1M6|4|Pretty good unit. I drive through rural areas where there are farms. I used to get the foul smell of manure come through my vents. Not anymore. The filter does a good job in keeping the air in the cabin clean.
B00GJ1FJM8|5|Fit perfect for my 2006 Crown Vic
B00A6WTK2G|4|4 stars just because I was expecting more light lumens but it Does the job so far ;)
B000EDQR2I|5|Just what I needed. Unfortunately it is a bit short for my stove but the width was perfect. Very good quality.
B00HF40ZW2|5|I bought a bunch of this stuff for cheap back in 06 or 07 and sprayed it on every somewhat vulnerable spot on my mostly rust-free 1981 VW rabbit.  It lasted for 2-3 seasons without any real change in the amount of rust and I only applied it maybe twice in that time period.  When I couldn't find it anywhere and didn't spray the car for 1 winter, it was very noticeable.  I finally rebought this 6 pack, and even though the car has some parts beyond a hobbyist repair, I will be spraying this all over again for this winter so the next owner has the option to restore it instead of just junk it.  After 10 years in the midwest and driven most winters, this was the only reasonably priced product that kept the rust at bay.  My newer bmw rusted out much faster since I never treated the old metal, and the VW has much more rust-prone metal.
B000BZL9PO|5|Perfect fit for 94 volvo 940
B001EOWQAS|5|This is an extremely solidly made and well-fitted product.  I watched the installation video and was able to complete the job by myself, without a lift, in about 40 minutes.
B0009IBJE4|5|Works great. When using trolling motor shows full charged for a very long time. I like that percent of charge reading. My motor percent charge seems relevant to me when I use it and this charger seems to make battery last. ( before this I used a 6 amp fixed charger for 24 hrs.  )
