B00005JLF5|4.0|Deep Space Nine is neck and neck with Next Generation for being my favorite Trek.  The actors that make up the regular cast are incredibly talented. So are the Guest Stars.  While I love DS9, the first season is not as good as the subsequent seasons.  It relied a lot on the legacy of Next Gen to get it moving.  While this is true there were some truly fine episodes:<br />Emissary:  This pilot was better than Encounter at Farpoint.  Avery gives a poignant performance as a grief-stricken man who lost his wife.<br />Past Prologue:  It introduced Garak.  This alone made it important.  It was the first episode that dealt with disgruntled Bajorans, friction between the crew and intrigue.  <br />Q-Less: I love Q. It relied a lot on Next Gen, but hey it was entertaining.<br />Dramatis Personae:  Everyone just went nuts on this.  Sisko and Kira went at it and the whole crew just got dragged in.<br />Duet:  This was a good episode.  It talked about the importance of forgiveness, and with the realization that not everybody of a certan race (Cardassian in this case) are the same. <br />In the hands of the Prophets:  This along with the three part premiere of season 2, talked about the more negative aspects of religion.<br />The first season was laying the ground work.  as with other treks, it got better from here.

B00008PX8P|5.0|I can now die a happy man - well, I take that back - Zeppelin still has to do a reunion tour and an album! All kidding aside, this is what I've been waiting for. As the title of my review suggests, this is my first review of anything, period. I just finished watching HTWWW for the umpteenth time and just felt compelled to let everyone know how much I enjoy it. I have been a Zeppelin fan for let's just say quite a while. Jimmy Page is the reason I picked up a guitar 16 years ago and now I remember why. I saw Robert and Jimmy play live in Atlanta on their &quot;Walking into Clarkesdale&quot; tour. At that time I realized that all of the live recordings out at that time did not do justice to the band. This new DVD comes as close as you can get without seeing them live - especially in DTS. Both DVDs are great, but my favorite is the second one. One of my favorite Zeppelin songs has always been Achille's Last Stand, and I have watched the Knebworth performance of that song at least 30 times in the last two months. It is simply amazing how Zeppelin can create so much sound from just three instruments when so many other bands would be helpless without their synthesizer and dual guitars. It's really a testament to Jimmy Page. Songwriters just don't take the time to arrange their music anymore. Thank God we still have Page!
B00005MP58|3.0|Colin Firth is outstanding, but the others in the cast? The female lead goes through most of the movie with the same blushing smirk. Expression to show dislike of Darcy: smirk. Expression to show love of Darcy: smirk. Love for Wickham: smirk. Contempt of Wickham: smirk. This is fatal, because her change of heart re Darcy is the heart of the story. <BR>Am not sure I approve of the way the director tries to put a modern day spin on Lizzie's materialism. In the book she says she began to love Darcy when she saw his huge estate. I know, it's also a very well designed, landscaped estate - but Darcy's father or grandfather did the designing, so it's hard to accept this as anything other than a sign that Lizzie is not as much a romantic as she claims to be. But the movie has Lizzie laughing as she says this - a cop out. Anyway - Firth is great, but the scenes without him are either dull or over-the-top, and Lizzie's mother seems to be doing a Dame Edna impression.
0385504209|5.0|Are you sure that youre going to finish a book this time? Ive heard many versions of this same question since my interest in Freemasonry first began by reading Holy Blood, Holy Grail over ten years ago.<br />My wife is the first to remind me that out of my entire book collection, which is quite extensive, I rarely finish a book before becoming sidetracked by another. My library, like most who are on their quest for more light has become a hodgepodge of religion, philosophy, esoteric materials, Gnostic gospels, and volumes of Masonic works. Some fanciful, others, as near as I can tell, historically factual. Almost all, controversial to my family and friends. My library is an oddity to them, yet deeply personal to me, and last week I added yet another book to my every growing collection.<br />I normally dont read novels. I enjoy the facts and generally feel that novels are a waste of good study time, however, as I was surfing Amazon.com one day a title grabbed my attention; The DaVinci Code. NowI just had to read the description, and am I glad that I did!<br />Dan Brown is a superb author! He has spun a web of fiction on the bedrock of historical fact. The story centers around a leading Symbologist named Robert Langdon and the granddaughter of an elderly art museum curator Sophie Neveu.<br />Sophies grandfather is killed, and Sophie, a Cryptologist for French law enforcement, teams up with Robert Langdon, a Symbologist for Harvard University on a quest to find his killer, escape capture under false pretences, and discover the true hiding place of the Holy Grail!<br />Quite honestly, this is one book that is difficult to set down and my wife was pleasantly surprised when I told her that I had finished The DaVinci Code. It was as if I had been thrust into this story with the characters! I lived every heart pounding minute. With heroes, villains, knights, maidens, secret societies, and ancient truths to boot, this is a real barn burner! The twists, turns, and energy put into this book will keep you turning the pages for more action and answers! Every free thinker should grab a copy of this book and indulge himself in a fact driven gem of fiction in pursuit of Truth. This book may challenge some peoples preconceptions of history, but it will stretch your mind to new dimensions from which it will never return to its former state. This book is bound to thrust the reader onto a path of new discoveries.<br />Dont just buy this bookRead it! Start reading early, grab a cup of coffee and a comfortable chair because once you start reading The DaVinci Code youll have a difficult time setting it down!The twists, turns, and energy put into this book will keep you turning the pages for more action and answers!

B0000959N0|3.0|After X-Men blew everyone away by actually being GOOD, movie rights to comic books started popping up all over the place. It was like after Survivor, one after another a new reality show came out and it's still going. Then came a very good adaption of Spiderman. Then came this. Well this...eh.<br />Matt Murdock is 12 or so with a prize boxer fighter of a dad. After witnessing something a bit troubling that his dad is doing, he runs off and gets blinded by toxic. Only instead of being permanently blinded, his other 4 senses actually are heightened and his vision becomes like a radar using sound. In one scene, a train makes his vision go all screwy, a simple tap on some bars creates a wave which &quot;clears&quot; the vision and keeps it normal.<br />Murdock now grown up, is getting a bad name on the streets and also meets the gorgeous Elektra, the daughter of a wealthy tycoon. Due to some bad timing, Elektra sees Daredevil escaping, thinking he killed her father. Not only dealing with Elektra's revenge, he must tend with Bullseye, a psychotic who has extreme accuracy with anything he throws, and Kingpin, the head honcho and a massive man.<br />After watching this film, I didn't really have desire to watch it again, unlike the first 2 Batman's or Spiderman. Despite some fine acting(and very good looks) from Jennifer Garner and a very nice job from Colin Farrell and a rather surprisingly good Ben Affleck, watch this once
B00004U2NX|2.0|This 1979 German sound remake of the 1922 Murnau silent classic (The making of which was later to be the basis for the ficticious film SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE) is again closely based on Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA.<BR>Klaus Kinski plays the Count as a victim doomed by circumstance to be one of the undead. A lonely, brooding soul craving love. After a meeting with businessman Jonathan Harker, the Count soon sets upon his fiancee Lucy (the stunning Isabelle Adjani) to be his next conquest/unsuspecting prey.<BR>Written, Produced and Directed by Werner Herzog; the film begins promisingly with its hypnotic & chilling opening credits; but despite eeriely effective photography by Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein this version is slow, arty, pretentious and just not scary.<BR>The movie's highlight is the sequence featuring the pack of rats. Apparently there's some deep meaning to it- probably tied in to the sickness and decay brought on by the plague. But I'm not in a deep and meaningful frame of mind at the moment. When a movie is this self-absorbed, is it truly deserving of that kind of analysis? <BR>This version is poorly dubbed in English and is 10 minutes shorter than the German print. The ending does come as a surprise however.<BR>The classical score is also worth noting, as Herzog appears to be using it as a means to pay homage to the Max Schreck version: Murnau's superior feature was sub-titled A SYMPHONY OF TERROR.<BR>But in the long run you're probably better off watching the original version or Coppola's BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA instead. Kinski is good in the role (his interpretation of Count Dracula is closer to Jack Palance's than Lugosi or Lee), but even this slightly truncated version will test the patience of horror fans who prefer lashings of blood & bulging bodices in their vampire flicks.<BR>NOSFERATU is more arthouse fare than a traditional horror flick, so it's probably more geared towards audiences of that persuasion. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea (or chalice of blood) you may want to check out one of the old Hammer movies starring Christopher Lee instead. I also recommended George A. Romero's MARTIN (1978) & Kathryn Bigelow's NEAR DARK(1987).
B00004RFFS|5.0|Book to movie adaptions rarely work. Only in a handful of cases does it actually satisfy the reader of the book. I have not read the book so I can't compare but if it's anything like that film, should be an interesting read.<br />Film begins as Louis, a 200 and some year vampire is being interviewed by a man(his name's Malloy, apparently, watch the end credits), and Louis tells Malloy all about how he became to be a vampire, having a little girl as a daughter type figure, and hatred for the man who made him what he is. <br />Kind of slow but the performances more than stand out through it all. This however is not for little eyes. There's a scene near the end where Louis does this big revenge exacting with some big gore moments. However, this should be watched if you're not a Rice fan and watched to compare the book to the film
B0000959N0|3.0|I had low expectations for this film, and watching it didn't do much to change them. I did however catch the directors cut, and it was a little better ........ I said a little.<br />Problem number one - casting Ben Affleck in the lead role for any movie is a bad decision. But the casting of a great supporting cast including Colin Farrell, Jennifer Garner, Joe Pantoliano, and Michael Clark Duncan, more than makes up for that mistake.<br />Problem number two - The amazing ability of anyone in a fight scene to do unbeleivable acrobatic moves. Daredevil was given powers, Bullseye may have had special powers (his character wasn't really explored), but Electra (Garner) was a normal everyday human. When she \\"lept a building in a single bound\\", I felt that the movie had just taken a dramatic turn for the worse.<br /><br />The positive aspect of this film? The storyline was good and easily followed (except the mystery behind the most intersting character - Bullseye). The acting was solid. The special effects were good, they didn't go overboard (George Lucas, are you listening?). And last, there is finally a role which requires Ben Affleck to appear to be in a drunken stare, so he did well.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Return to ancient Rome as we follow one man's life from noble general, to owned slave to triumphant gladiator. Thing is, I don't care. Bring on the fights!<br />We follow Maximus, a general for Rome, and very good friend of the Emperor. The emperor's son, Commodus, however is extremely jealous of him, so he kills the emperor and orders Maximus's death. When he escapes, he's bought as a slave that fights to the death for sport and entertainment. He builds a big reputation and gets to fight in Rome's Colliseum to get revenge.<br />Personally, I didn't care that much for the story or the acting. However, the fight scenes were very thrilling to watch. Only problem? It's Rated R, they do show gore but VERY brief. Why could'nt they show the full scene since it's Rated R anyway?
B000002UUX|5.0|Simply brilliant. <BR>The composition is incredible by any genre's standards.<BR>Mustaine is a wordsmith, a poet and an angry but stoic preacher of the \\"last days\\".<BR>Friedman plays perfectly. To write guitar pieces so melodic and so fluid to accomany the themes and rhythms that are so sharp and so harsh is the work of passion and genius.<BR>Ellefson is marvelous - never over-playing but keeping a consistent and simple groove while his counterpart Menza leaves no void unfilled as his relentlessly intricate an mind-bending rhythms bind the chaos together. <br />If I had but one wish for this album, it would be for a re-mixed version. <BR>While Max Norman captures the aggression and the angst present in the music, the highs are very dominant and the low end suffers throughout (a la the genre's style). <BR>I would love to hear to hear how Dan Huff or Mustaine himself would have mixed the same compositions and wonder if it would have made the album more \\"accessible\\" to a larger audience.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Ok the movie is great but this DVD is awesome! There are hours of bonus features that are actually worth watching! The making of the movie is very detailed and the making of the comic is excellent! Writers and artists talk about their thoughts and experiences while working on the comic. It's all very fascinating. I guess I liked the movie more that most people. It brought me back to the same feeling I had when I was watching the first Batman movie. It has some REALLY bad looking stunts that involve wires but the look and feel of Daredevil is wonderful. I can't wait for Daredevil 2.
B000002I97|5.0|I didn't like this album when I first heard it.  It sounded country to me and I had never cared for country music.  But a friend played it a lot and it finally started to sink in.  It's not about the sound, it's about the lyrics.  Every song on this album is no less than brilliant and all were written by John Prine by the time he was twenty.  I've listened to it more times than I can count and heard it in my head more often than that and it still amazes me, makes me smile and brings tears to my eyes.<br />I was and am a big fan of Kris Kristoferson and it was he who discovered John Prine.  His liner notes were a big part of what really made me pay attention to John's lyrics.<br />I got to see him live in the cafeteria of Long Beach State University in California in 1971.  Literally in the cafeteria.  He sat on a cafeteria chair about 4 or 5 feet from me and a number of other fans. It was a wonderful experience.<br />If you haven't heard it before, get it by all means and play it through headphones late at night.  If you listen to any song on it and think it less than superb, listen to it again.  It only means you missed something.
B00006YXEK|4.0|Of course the CD is great and in my opinion is one of George Harrison's best solo album. When I decided to buy the Brainwashed Special Edition, I was expecting a lot of material about George and his music on the DVD!!<br />I have to confess I felt quite disappointed after watching the video because all the great updated new material I was anxious for were almost nothing: the material in the entire DVD is only seven minutes long... and I do believe there are lots of new material that could be included in this DVD - certainly the fans deserve and are anxious for more!!<br />The material in the the box and in the DVD itself is great, no doubt about it, but I rated this Special Edition with only 4 stars truly because I found the DVD to be too short for this anxious fan...
B000001FND|4.0|Debió haber sido muy difícil para los Bee Gees (como lo fue para muchos otros grupos) hacer un segundo álbum después del aclamado (por la crítica y el público) First, y si bien lo considero ligeramente inferior, sigue siendo un espectacular trabajo que aporta nuevas dimensiones a su característico sonido.<br />World inicia todo con una majestuosidad única y es tal vez el mejor tema. Lemons Never Forget y Earnest of Being George muestran su lado mas rock y sicodélico, lo mismo que la espectacular Change is Made, esta última como para demostrar que los Bee Gees también pueden hacer cosas con guitarras acercándose incluso al blues. Daytime Girl y Birdie Told Me son reposados temas difíciles de pasar por alto, mientras Horizontal cierra el show con una bella y al mismo tiempo inquietante atmósfera. Massachusetts, pese a ser el gran éxito no resalta demasiado entre el resto.<br />Si First impresiona por su novedad, Horizontal lo hace por un mayor uso instrumental (mellotron, guitarra, piano) y más que nada por ser una gran colección de temas que en el fondo es lo que importa y lo que mejor hacen los Gibb.
B00005JMCR|5.0|Being a huge fan of the American Pie movies I decided that I had to see the third and final one. I wasn't that excited about it because I thought that it would be impossible to top, let alone, compare to the first and second. This movie was not as good as the second(my favorite of the series), though it lives up to it's predecesors(I'm a bad speller). The movie was crudely disgusting like the others(never said that was a bad thing).  The movie had very few moments where I wasn't laughing my (butt)off, but only because they were working up to a joke and because it needed to be serious at a couple times.  Most of the characters are back which surprised me for I had heard that only Stiffler, Jim, Jim's Dad, and Michelle were going to be the only returning characters; Finch, Kevin, and Stiffler's Mom(for a few minutes) returned for the movie. I was disapointed to hear that Vicki and Oz didn't return.  Though some new characters were added for only this movie like Michelle's parents and sister. <BR>     Now to give you the idea of the movie, which is not really given during the trailers.  The movie was ofcourse about Jim proposing to Michelle, but is placed from the proposal through the wedding. It is placed after college, showing where everyone is in life(the movie is not based on it, the movie just tells where everyone is at the moment the goes on). During the movie Finch and Stiffler fight over Michelle's beautiful and intelligent younger sister, going extremely far to try to get her. <BR>     I feel that this movie was probably the best 3rd movie of a trilogy considering it is very hard to make a sequel to a sequel good without being repetative of the first 2.  Thank you for reading my review and I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.
B00005JKN9|4.0|never liked leo...still don't but he did a fine job in this movie. Lewis on the other hand Was the movie. bill cutting is one of the best characters to come along in a good while. can't get enough of this movie, although, they could have played down the love story.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I hate Rage and I was never into Soundgarden, so These guys are really new to me. I decided to give the album a try when my friend levi told me Tom was his favorite guitarist and alos becausemy friend was listening to the CD at school almost every day. I got it, and I listened. There are some great numbers, and I think more bands should head in this direction instead or numetal or retro crap... but I just didn't feel this album as a whole. Sort of sloppy when conceived with a good deal of generic filler. I will be looking forward to their next music outing together, that is if they do one.
B000066NW0|1.0|I'm not really into punk, I like more metal, (In Flames, Slayer, Iced Earth), but even though, I do listen to some punk, such as The Casualties, Flogging Molly, and Dropkick Murphy, and let me tell you, Avril is definitly not punk, even Blink is more punk than her. lyrics are deep, she plays her own instruments, writes her own songs, is punk.  This is all Sh*t,  Her managers are spreading more sh*t than a farmer.  Now I see all these little girls wearing ties and those watchyamacallits around their wrists, (like the pointy ... girl, mardonna, I think, don't listen to that music) stating that they are hardcore and watch them do things that don't even qualify as semi naughty though they are trying to be bad*ss.  Excuse me, but knocking over a trashcan, is not bad*ss.  Try putting a m-80 in the exhaust pipe of a rappers low-rider, or lighting a few bottle rockets in a movie theatre.  Now that is fun.  Find better music, you god forsaken ....
B00005R2M3|5.0|WOW!!  Shakira's voice, rythym and melody are so hypnotic and moving, I don't know what to say!  Her lovely messages are inspiring to me.  When I listen, I just don't hear a woman singing from her vocal cords, I see a woman singing from her soul.   THe same goes for her dancing.  I'm blown away by it.  I hope I can be as wonderful, moving and soulful and Shakira.  And someday I hope I'll be as comfortable with myself as her.  This CD has a permanent habitat in my boom box and has changed my life.  The lullabys lull me to sleep at night, the upbeat songs cheer me up when I felling crappy and make me feel like a beautiful woamn, just like Shakira.<br />If you have ANY commom sense, BUY THIS CD!!  It will change your life.<br />THANK YOU, SHAKIRA!<br />SO MOTE IT BE!
B00005JMCR|5.0|Wow! This movie definitely holds up the high standards set by the first 2 movies. I think that this movie was just as good as the previous two, with just as many laughs! The only disappointment I have is that not all of the cast came back, however, with all the guys back but Oz you still get the good friendship and jokes with them. This movie makes many references to the past 2 movies, which I enjoyed. I was really worried that this third movie might be disappointing compared to the other two, but it wasn't! If you're a fan of the pie movies, definitely check this one out.
B000094DUP|5.0|This is an outstanding piece of music.I recommend you to buy this if you are interested in artists such as celine dion and Norah Jones.You can easily sing along to this kind of music and i think her best songs are \\"Lost without you\\" and \\"innocent eyes\\".Delta Goodrem has a good strong voice and i really admire her.
0553260111|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie, simple plot, great story, good cast. But a different story is being told in the book. It's far more complicated: one really has to concentrate and read carefully every sentence in order to understand what's going on. I'm almost done reading it and I still don't have a clear picture on who's who. There's so much confusion and the story is so complicated it's almost annoying. I also don't like the long dialogues between Jason and Marie. They slow the book down enormously. Reading this book should be a heart-pounding experience, but instead it becomes incredibly boring. <BR> <BR>Speaking of Marie, I don't like her character either. All that happens between Jason and her, seems so unlikely it's almost funny and ridiculous. She is portrayed as this superwoman, sometimes casting a big dark shadow upon Jason's figure (which should be the strong one). She practically leads him by hand, tells him what to do. <br />Jason is supposed to be very bright, very strong...a superman without memory. Instead he seems like a frightened child, who needs help from a woman in order to understand what's going on. He therefore becomes weak and dependent upon others. It's not the Jason I saw and liked in the movie.<br />The plot also never seems to go past Paris, everything is being played out there. I think this book lacks on mobility and tension. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's looking for the same story of the movie.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This CD is aptly named the Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. It contains their very best hits from the 60's and 70's.

B00005JLXE|2.0|I'm not sure whether or not this movie holds up with the comics but regardless, I really didn't care for it. Sure, alot of people probably didn't like ...  but that was just one of the things wrong with this movie. ... I'm not a Ben Affleck fan either but he is not the reason Daredevil wasn't good in my opinion. The plot seemed completely thrown together as if the producers were in a hurry to get this movie done so that money could be made at the box office. Not much was put into the development of the characters and I found some of the dialogue to be a somewhat slow at times. However, I do agree that making a movie about a blind superhero along with a babe for a sidekick and a villan from another comic series was a great idea. Sadly though, I felt there was much that should have been done with Daredevil.
0688163173|4.0|&quot;Shutter Island&quot; is a departure for Dennis Lehane from the Kenzie and Gennaro mysteries set in Boston. In &quot;Shutter Island&quot; U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, along with his partner Chuck Aule go to Shutter Island to find Rachel Solando who had escaped from the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Nothing is at all as it seems throughout the book. It is part suspense, part psychological thriller, and part horror. This novel is one that could have come from the pen of Stephen King. It will definetely make you shudder. I prefer the Kenzie/Gennaro novels, but 'Shutter Island&quot; is a novel you won't soon forget.

0425098478|5.0|'The One Minute Manager', written in 1981 by highly-regarded author and consultant Kenneth H. Blanchard and by Spencer Johnson, is an excellent book on improving management effectiveness and employee productivity. And, while increased 'knowledge worker' efficiency may have made it simple enough in the 80s and early 90s for companies to simply dismiss below-average workers (they didn't require replacing, as fewer total knowledge workers were required to perform the same tasks as before), the 21st century challenge will be to optimize the performance of employees already in the organization, as profitable businesses will likely need to replace dismissed workers. This will involve improved management practices, such as the ones espoused in this book.<br />'One Minute Manager' is very short (can be read in less than one hour), yet has the potential to greatly improve management efficiency. The book discusses three 'secrets' -- one minute goals, one minute praising, and one minute reprimands. To briefly summarize, the theory espoused in the book is for the manager to set one-page goals with each employee for the top 20% of tasks which, according to Pareto, account for 80% of the productivity of the employee. Next, the manager follows up with either immediate one minute praise or an immediate behavior-based (rather than personal) one minute reprimand. The praise is designed to focus the employee behavior toward continuous improvement. As such, a less-capable employee (typically a newer one) would receive praise for lesser accomplishments than would a more seasoned one. The reprimand is to reinforce the goals of the organization.<br />The theories made a lot of sense. They espouse the true vision of 'leadership', which is to guide the organization in a specific direction, toward specific goals and achievement. I recommend this book to anyone interested in leadership or effectiveness.
B00003ZKSP|5.0|Slipknot debut is wild. It's heavy, it's hard, and it's fun to listen to. <br />The album has very strong dumming, well they have 2 extra percusionists. Heavy distorted guitar sounds. It's got good singing, screaming and growling. And on top of that they added crazy keyboards, effects, loops and electronic sounds.<br />I believe this album is the best mix of everything that is metal this days, there is some rapping, there are some industrial elements, there is some singing, and there is lots of anger.<br />Highlights: the first 4 real tracks! and the bonus tracks!
0783114222|5.0|When I was in the first grade in Orlando, Florida our class would go outside to watch the Mercury flights take off from Cape Canaveral, so the American space program made a big impression on me as a child.  Of course, now I have a daughter who is surprised to learn that human beings have walked on the moon while I remember \\"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\\" being interrupted by a news bulletin about the fatal fire that killed the crew of Apollo 1.  My father was stationed in Japan for most of the Apollo flights, so except for Apollo 11 we did not get to see a lot of what everybody saw back home.  Consequently, for me \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" is a combination of vague memories and new information.<br /><br />Having also watched \\"Band of Brothers,\\" the other HBO documentary in which Tom Hanks had a significant hand, I am struck by how these two mini-series have essentially redefined the term more towards its original meaning.  Unlike landmark mini-series such as \\"Shogun\\" and \\"Winds of War,\\" where each episode picks up the main characters pretty much where they were left at the end of the previous episode, \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" and \\"Band of Brothers\\" clearly offer up distinct episodes in telling the story of the Apollo space program.  The only constant characters are really Eugene Cernan (Daniel Hugh Kelly), the astronaut who ended up heading the program, and the fictional television anchorman Emmett Seaborn (Lane Smith), who represents an amalgam of all the newscasters who were big boosters of the space program (such as Walter Cronkite).<br /><br />Most of the episodes focus on a specific Apollo flight, but there are also episodes on different topics, like the development of the lunar module.  There are episodes that of surprising comedy, such as when the crazy Pete Conrad (Paul McCrane) takes Al Bean (Dave Foley) and Apollo 12 to the moon, and one devoted to the pathos of the shattered lives of the wives of the third group of Astronauts.  The episode on Apollo 13 is interesting in how it effectively avoids covering the same ground as the movie.  We never see the astronauts, we only hear their voices, and since we all \\"know\\" the story now the focus of the episode is to show how the space program was confronted with the \\"new\\" brand of journalism that was not going to be spoon fed information and heroes by NASA.  However, my favorite was the episode in which Lee Silver (David Clennon), a professor of geology, teaches the astronauts how to read the story of rocks as the test pilots being sent to the moon learn to be \\"scientists.\\"  There are lots of familiar faces in these episodes (the proverbial too many to name), but for those who remember the indelible bad boy characters created by McCrane and Clennon on \\"E.R.\\" and \\"thirtysomething,\\" there is a special joy in which them play good guys.<br /><br />\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" is not as informative as a documentary, but it certainly focus on the actual nuts and bolts of sending men to the moon.  Actually it does this in a rather engaging manner, and the way in which it combines NASA technology with human drama is one of the strengths of the mini-series.  Almost all of the astronauts come out of the series with their images as heroes intact (providing you do not ask their ex-wives), the exceptions being Buzz Aldrin (Bryan Cranston), who really wanted to get out on the moon before Neil Armstrong (Tony Goldwyn), and Alan Shepard (Ted Levine), who we always knew was the grand old S.O.B. of the space program.  But even so both men merely come across as being decidedly human.  Whether you actually were around at the time to go outside and look up at the moon knowing there were a couple of Americans walking around hitting a golf ball, picking up rocks, and dropping a hammer and a feather at the same time, or this is all just history come alive, you should find this an excellent series of adventures in and about outer space.how it effectively avoids covering the same ground as the movie.

B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD breaking one of my cardinal rules: wait until two singles come out and you like both before you purchse the album of a new artist.  That usually kept me from making a mistake in what i wanted.  However, i knew i wanted a new CD and after asking around i finally decided on Evanescence, as i heard great things about it.  It didn't leave me disappointed!  This CD is fantastic and one of my favorites of all time.  I can listen to it over and over again without becoming bored.  Amy Lee's soaring voice along with Ben Moody's incredible guitar create a sound that is 'a breath of fresh air' for rock fans and mainstream alike.  Listen to clips of the songs on ... if uur still unsure... imaginary, tourniquet, and taking over me are particulary good.  Don't forget to check out the new video for going under!
B00005OAA6|4.0|She's pretty popular in England so after visiting I decided to give it a listen.  Who would've guessed the one they only showcased for appearance actually has a really good voice.  Her songs are good and she definitely has the ability to go it alone.  Looking forward to the next one.
B00003CXXM|4.0|This movie does not get too many great reviews from the press, but it is a very good movie.<br />For the spy story and such, well its good and entertaining, so I would give it a three for that. But I would give it a five for the other storyline. <br />Its a movie that, well. maybe I should not say, but it is an intriuging back story. Well ok, I will tell, but if you do not want to know and would rather watch the movie first, by all means I recomend it and dont read past this line.<br />Its a movie about a guy whose memory gets erased somehow and when he finds out who he is, he doesn't like it, so he trys to become a different person. Pretty intruiging, at least for me. Think about it, if you did not know who you were, then found out, would you like yourself?
0743244249|1.0|This book is just...pititful, an unmitigated disaster in the areas of dialogue, plot, setting and especially character.  It reminds one of Proust's streams of consciousness except that there is zero/zilch/nada literary quality present.<br />The main character is a multi-billionaire introspect with a retinue of worshipful aides (though why this narcissistic non-entity should command so much as a second glance is beyond me).  His mental gyrations are presented as having import when they are simply the inklings of a madman. Our hero lives in a 48 room modern palace and is bored with everything - career,  marriage, relationships, sex, life.  <br />It's 2001, the brink of financial Armageddon, and Eric wants a haircut after investing the whole wad in the currency futures market - you figure out the connection. He spots his wife of 22 days in another car, pops over for a chat and implies that their marriage has yet to be consumated. A presidential visit creates a traffic jam and we hear the ravings of the anti-industrial crowd protesting global capitalism.  Interspersed in this drivel are the ruminations of a lone soul who seems as confused as the main character except he is not a multi-bilionaire.<br />Our hero proceeds (in no certain order) to have sex with someone (female), undergo a physical while chatting semi-erotically with a female aide who for some reason is present, murders his bodyguard (he felt like it), laughs at the stabbing death of a bigwig, tells his wife he married her for money then meets his stalker, the confused man mentioned above. The ending is simultaneously confusing and boring - death by ennui.<br />The \\"writing\\" reminds one of a middle-school paper - absolutely no subtlety or literary grace, just word after word to fill up space. Towards the end you think that this is nothing more than paragraphs, then it is reduced to sentences, then words and finally one suddenly realizes it is the alphabet, clumsily arranged so as to resemble a book.  I wishthere were a negative score for this horrendous thing.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I did expect quite a lot more of this movie as I went through all these reviews in amazon. It definitely wasnt bad, but not thought provoking either. Though it claims to have transcended all genres, this topic was fairly bordering postmodernistic thought (for eg, darko's nihilistic imaginary pal, Frank, the caricature of the determinist, Jim Cunningham, and the meaningless destruction of donnie's room by an unknown aeriel vessel emphasizing dissociation with rootedness), and so this movie immediately springs to one's mind, masterpieces like \\"un chien andalou\\", \\"lost highway\\" or \\"trainspotting\\". However, there is very little basis for comparison as the concept was treated in a very simplistic and linear fashion. Not even vaguely stunning or fascinating. The direction was original but the pace and stylization were mediocre and the concept of time warps and worm holes was treated too simplistically. <br />The characters didnt unfold many surprises either. The treatment of characters was like that in a Television serial with no mysterious aura around anyone else other than the protagonist and his imaginary pal, Frank. The picturization was not even vaguely aesthetically pleasing nor shocking. <br />Regarding performances, Jake Gylenhaal definitely stood out and did an above average job with his role. And so did Drew Barrymore lending some dignified charm to her role as a school teacher intent on breaking deep seated conformistic moulds. <br />On the whole, this movie deserves to be watched once (if you cant get a copy of any other intellectually stimulating masterpieces of lynch, kubrick, jodorovsky, etc). Wanna-be (pseudo)intellectuals who wanna impress their girls, could definitely find some use for a late nite show of this movie.
B00008R9M0|2.0|I loved MIB, but I avoided MIBII because of the bad reviews. I finally saw it on cable tonight. Bleah! I knew it wasn't going to be great, but I didn't think it could possibly be as dull as it ended up being. There were a few good lines and some semi-interesting special effects, but good SFX are a dime a dozen these days. Otherwise... <br />Tommy Lee Jones sleepwalked through this one. Will Smith I usually like, but he's turned into a one-note actor. The chick who played the pizza girl had no function in the movie besides providing a temporary love interest for Agent J and a ridiculous heartbreak for both J and K at the end; she pretty much got toted around by the other characters. The script is creatively bankrupt; it's a terribly short movie (about an hour and a half), yet feels padded with useless moments and unnecessary characters. The story (what there was of it) could have been told in one of the half-hour episodes of the MIB cartoon. The action had an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink feel of sheer desperation. One can imagine the \\"creative\\" minds behind this turkey saying, \\"Ooh, let's flush the agents down a big toilet! Ooh, let's show Michael Jackson as an alien!\\" (now there's a stretch) \\"Ooh, won't Tommy Lee Jones look funny in a mailman outfit?\\" Ho ho, hee hee.<br />MIB II is like a tossed salad made of everything in your fridge. Every so often you bite into a tasty bit, but the rest is just one big odd-smelling, unpalatable mess.
0385504209|1.0|Poorly written drivel with a plot full of holes<br />(The discussion of the clues on the private plane ride from Versailles to Kent took longer than the flight itself takes, approx 35 min. It takes longer to read the chapter than the flight)<br />The riddles and clues are amusing but still don't add up to the truth and the time frame of the story (basically 24+ hours) is not believable.<br />Junk for the gullible
B000053VAZ|5.0|I love this movie so much!  Johnny Depp is the most incredible actor alive today not to mention the most gorgeous.  This story shines, it's comical, dramatic, and classy.  I think anyone can enjoy this movie and its characters quirky antics.
B00005JM1Y|4.0|Do not confuse this intelligent movie with the James Bond spoofs like Austin Powers. The subject matter seems similar but the comic genious of Mr. Atkinson demonstrates that a movie can be funny without using [physical]inuendo and [stuff]. If you followed the Blackadder series you already know that Atkinson's character acting is beyond Mr. Bean. Too bad that this movie has been advertised as \\"Bean meets Bond for American audiences. Unfortunately he is stuck with that image of Bean. His wit and vocal characterizations are in the same class with the finest comic and dramatic actors. If you want to see a clean movie for the whole family this is for you. Even there is some harmless bath room humor. If you want to explore the intelligent comedy of Rowan Atkinson go beyond Mr. Bean and see his hilarous Blackadder series. You would also have the opportunity to learn some British history.
0441009425|4.0|Reynolds provides an engrossing, fast-paced tale that keeps you reading through the nearly 600 pages.  The plot twists are labarynthine but for the most part remain believable.  The characters have the typical post-modern combination of likeable and not-so-likeable traits that have the reader cheering them on at one moment and recoiling from them at another.  There's certainly no lack of imagination here, as Reynolds brings together exotic astrophysics, cybernetics, and literature in a engaging blend of enjoyable SF.
0380733358|5.0|Follett has written a very well-paced adventure novel that focuses more on the villainous Nazi spy than it does on the good guys: which is probably for the best since his action is more interesting anyway, especially when he meets a feisty farmer's wife on a storm battered island. Not only does the spy cold-heartedly kill his landlady, and stiletto countless other hapless Brits--he cuckolds a cripple and kills a dog! I'll never like Nazis again.

B000003TAR|5.0|I reviewd this before and I thought well now I didnt even do it justice! This is truly the best Nirvana album, well its not Nevermind you say well dam,n right its not Nevermind, dont get me wrong I love that album but it is way to commercial, In Utero is the most personal, and heart felt, and hardest rocking! Their is not one bad song here much like Nevermind, but the songs here are all better then that of Nevermind, I mean if you were to here 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' live you'd say the studio version [is horrible]! I dont know what to say else besides 'Rape Me' 'Dumb' and All Apologies' are the key tracks here, but 'Rape Me' is Nervanas second best song, first being 'Come As You' Are from Nevermind! I am going to finish by saying this if you dont own this there is something wrong you and you need to be checked out by a doctor or something!
0385720920|5.0|This is probally Palahniuk's best work. Although I may have said Fight Club but the film spoiled the ending for me (still an incrediable book). He shows the addicts place in society so perfectly you have to wonder about Palahniuk's own skeletons in the closet. The most brilliant I have ever heard regarding addiction in America reads:<BR>My point is this America. You start off with hand jobs and progress to orgies. You smoke dope and then the big H. This is our society of bigger, better, faster, newer. In America is your addiction isn't always new and improved you're a failure.<BR>In this book, Palahniuk also writes about stem cell research and the resuraction of Christ, all while the narrator (Victor Manchini) copes with his addiction, his dying mother that he must support, and the possibality that he may be the next masia. A chilling and brillant book.

The songs are different, and yes, not as good as The Who's outstanding previous efforts, but let's face it, this stuff is much better than the prominent force of mainstream music today. Sure it's different, but it's still great. By the way, John was and always will be an amazing bassist.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|Hard to put Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman together in a movie with a moral issue at stake and not come up with a sure winner. And that?s what The Unforgiven is: a winner. Hackman plays the sleazy and sadistic local sheriff of Big Whiskey, a town somewhere in the outback of Wyoming where the local prostitutes are determined to seek revenge on the guys who maimed one of them - and they've pooled their savings and have offered a bounty. Eastwood and Freeman, old partners, have retired but, down on their luck, they are persuaded by circumstances to take aim on the bad guys one last time. Then, when they meet Hackman's style of resistance, it becomes bigger than just a bounty hunt; it turns into the usual Eastwood confrontation: Good vs. Evil.<BR>A winner, not to be missed. All the Academy Awards it won were not a mistake.
B0000797IO|5.0|I got this film because I really enjoyed Mike White's first script, Chuck and Buck, but I have to admit I was skeptical about Jennifer Aniston; however, the script was as good as I'd hoped and Aniston did a wonderful job as Justine, a bored clerk at Retail Rodeo and the childless wife of stoned housepainter Phil (John C. Reilly). She even wears horrible clothes! Aniston's voiceover is very good, and adds to the story, and the cast is flawless, from Phil's friend Bubba and Jake Gyllenhall's Holden/Tom to all the interesting characters at Retail Rodeo. The subplot of the store's cosmetic makeovers is also very funny. There are some great visuals here, incuding an overhead shot of employees pouring out of the store to grieve a coworker.<br /><br />I think this film is similar to About Schmidt but with some crucial differences. While Schmidt has been detached from his family and is trying to connect again, Justine has been bled dry by her boring work and her marriage and her friends, and she seeks instead to detach herself -- if only she had the energy to do something desperate! Then she meets a new employee, Holden, an attractive but troubled young guy who brings her excitement and joy -- for a while.  As Justine realizes that other people know about her indiscretion, she sees that what was once fun has become complicated and tawdry.<br /><br />MILD SPOILER: In one incredible series of scenes, Justine makes love to Holden, then is blackmailed by Bubba into having sex with him (the look on her face while she waits for him to finish is wonderful), and then she has to let Phil hold her breast while he masters his domain at a fertility clinic.  (These scenes are reminiscent of a funny little movie that come out in 1968 called Candy, in which every guy Candy meets wants to seduce her and uses his own bizarre line/style to get her into bed.)<br /><br />You can watch the film in English or Spanish, and you have the same choices for subtitles.  There is a commentary track featuring writer/actor Mike White and director Miguel Arteta as well as 14 minutes of comments by Aniston; 9 deleted scenes totalling about 8 minutes; and a  2-1/2-minute gag reel (including a very brief shot of two unfamiliar young guys sitting on a bed -- anybody know what that is?).and director Miguel Arteta as well as 14 minutes of comments by Aniston; 9 deleted scenes totalling about 8 minutes; and a  2-1/2-minute gag reel (including a very brief shot of two unfamiliar young guys sitting on a bed -- anybody know what that is?).
6305313687|5.0|I first saw Edward Norton in that terrible movie, Death To Smoochy. I was thinking: Who the heck is the guy in the purple rhino suit? Then I saw him in Red Dragon: Well, he did a good job in Red Dragon but Red Dragon wasn't that good anyway. Then I saw him in American History X, and just let me say this, this is his best role ever. Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, and the entire cast puts on an outstanding performance. It's about a neo-nazi who gets put in prison for killing two black men trying to steal his truck. Later, he begans to see that what he was doing is wrong and once released, tries to keep his younger brother from being a Nazi himself. There are flashback scenes done in black and white. This is good because it actually feels like you're seeing a flashback and there's no flashbacks within a flashback either. The ending was pretty depressing, but that's something you'll have to see for yourself. Highly recommended.
B00005JLTN|5.0|When you go see a sequel your hopes are never high. Many people this year have set their hopes high to see this movie. This movie is really one movie cut in half. With an amazing plot twist and angles that look like your watching a comic book the matrix reloaded is definitly the Godfather II of its time. Though the dance scene is slightly disapointing the rest of the movie makes up for it with and outstanding plot. A must buy for any DVD collection
B000002KY8|5.0|The prelude to best album of all time PURPLE RAIN.<BR>Though this album may not have the same sex-starved emotional grit and genious and testosterone as PURPLE RAIN, it is Creative with a capital C!!  Synthesizers are perfectly employed in this album to a T. Why do people say that synthesizers are outdated?<BR>This album shows you what kind of mastery comes out of SMART and careful use of synths. So all you ignorant people who only listen to current music that criticize synths as \\"outdated\\".<br />Take a hint....put some headphones on, put in 1999, and listen to the CD!  <BR>Best songs are LITTLE RED CORVETTE, FREE, LADY CAB DRIVER and the must have bedroom theme INTERNATIONAL LOVER!<BR>This album almost didnt get my 5 stars because of weak tunes like<BR>DELIRIOUS and AUTOMATIC. However because of the sheer genious of Prince executing raunchy, funky, provocative marerial with style,  it gets a well deserved 5 stars.<BR>Here is a song by song review...read on.<BR>1999  - This catchy tune gets the imagination and the mental visagery prepared for the rest of the album.<BR>LITTLE RED CORVETTE  -  Smooth intro, portrays one night stand lover as a fast, sleek corvette. Glamourous pop flavour.<BR>DELIRIOUS  -  Definately the weak spot on the album! Maybe the Pointer Sisters could've borrowed this one. Or maybe this one should've made its way onto the Beverley Hills Cop Soundtrack. Oh well, it only lasts 3:56 seconds.<BR>LET'S PRETEND WE'RE MARRIED  -  High tempo zip-zip synths keep this one pumpin'. Great subject matter. I want my lovely hairdresser Barb to hear this while She's cutting my hair.Mmmm.<BR>D.M.S.R  - Vibrant synths, strong and proud hand clappin' \\"Dance Music Sex Romance!!\\"<BR>AUTOMATIC  -  I like the short guitar strokes used. The song changes now and then with great little tidbits, but it's a little long. 6 minutes would've been better.<BR>SOMETHING IN THE WATER(Does Not Compute)  -  Again Synthesizer mastery, this is where the imagery juices get flowing. It's so easy to picture Prince in some futuristic movie singing this song on a haunting foggy night in NY or some Megalopolis. Would've been great on the BATMAN Soundtrack...No, really!!<BR>FREE  -  I like this one, Prince gets into it, vocals and superb guitars along with a sweet melodic chorus. <BR>LADY CAB DRIVER  -  Slick, Funky and Fun! Prince really should've kept with this formula throughout his career. And the sweet part?! \\"This is for the Politicians who are bored and believe in war, This ones for etc.etc etc,\\" All while He's Givin it to the Lady Cab Driver...Sheer genious! Guitars are superb!<BR>ALL THE CRITICS LOVE YOU IN NEW YORK  -   Love the beats. A wonderful bashing of those phoney critics! Aggressive guitars let you feel the vibes. <BR>INTERNATIONAL LOVER  - The grand finale. Best song. Funky and Fresh. A Gyrating and explosive raunchfest. Prince at his best.<BR>Corrupt, Scandalous Ballroom Seductiveness. It just emanates stinky hot lovemaking to the extreme!!!!!! If you havent gotten into this one, you really dont know what you are missing! It is an anthem of the bedroom for the masses!<BR>---------------------------<BR>One thing about this 1999 album I must mention, is that the more you listen to it, the more it draws you in! It grows on you. So be patient, the reward is a solid album that will fill you with a lifetime of listening wonderment.
0312983867|4.0|Like previous books, this one is excellent, full of humor and a delight to read. Romantically...I found this one trivialized Plum's relationship with the men in her life and the romance part felt contrived--ie force in the events readers have been asking for or expecting rather than any surprise or creativity. Stephanie was doing just fine in developing some depth to her  relationships with the men in her life.  This one was bordering on filler to keep the suspense going.
B000002GBB|5.0|Most fans rate &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; as Styx' best album.  I would tend to disagree.  From a purely musical standpoint, &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; is the more complete work and shows the talents of the band at their prime.  It is a complete work, one that lends itself to listening to it in its entirety, almost as if the individual songs were intended as movements in a symphony.<br />The album begins with the fast, hard-driving &quot;Great White Hope&quot;.  This song really gets your attention and gets the album going.  This is contrasted with the slower, more majestic &quot;I'm OK&quot; which features a pipe organ solo performed by Dennis DeYoung recorded in a cathedral.  If there is a weak link on the album, it is the third cut, &quot;Sing for the Day&quot;, a lighter tune in 6/8.  While a nice, sparsely textured and upbeat follow up to &quot;I'm OK&quot;, it doesn't seem to demonstrate the same level of compositional talent as the rest of the album.  The tour de force of the album is &quot;The Message/Lord of the Rings&quot;.  Here Styx continues its exploration of fantasy and storytelling, just as it had in earlier days with tracks such as &quot;Jonas Psalter&quot;, and &quot;Castle Walls&quot;.  &quot;The Message&quot; demonstrates Dennis DeYoung's mastery of the synthesizer, both in technique and in creativity with timbres.  &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is simply majestic and inspiring, and is probably the best example of all the voices within the band working together.  If you aren't motivated by listening to this cut, you must not be a Styx fan.  Incidentally, this first side consists entirely of songs in major keys.  Side one is clearly uplifting both in musical mood, texture, and in lyrics.<br />Side 2 takes us on a journey into the minor keys.  &quot;Blue Collar Man&quot; may be Tommy Shaw's finest work- one of those rare moments of inspired genius.  Musically the song perfectly depicts the lyrical content of a desperate man fighting against all odds to make ends meet and the determination and will to get the job done.  &quot;Queen of Spades&quot; is a minor-key soliloquy on the dangers of gambling addictions (or is it?).  The vocal harmonies on this song (as throughout the album) really serve to bring home the message.  &quot;Renegade&quot; is another song in a minor key and features blazing guitar work.  I can remember being ten years old and hearing this song booming out of a chevy camaro going down the street- exciting!  We end the album with the title track, which again starts out in a minor key as Dennis DeYoung recounts the events of a day with accoustic guitar accompaniment- we hear two stanzas of this, the second complimented with a bass countermelody, building anticipation.  Psychologically, we've been in minor keys for an awfully long time, so when the chorus comes in in major, it is the perfect release of tension which has built up over eleven minutes.  But they don't end there!  We are treated to a developmental section where a melody is played by Dennis on the Piano, and each other voice enters sucessively with accompanying material including another bass countermelody.  Dennis really out-does himself at the conclusion of this section with a rapid virtuosic passage.  A majestic guitar solo (JY I believe?) ushers us back to the chorus, which repeats in all its glory until a cadence which ends on a suspension, resolves, and then Dennis plays a cadenza which ends leaving just one lone synthesizer note- this leads into the &quot;Coda&quot; of the album, a hauntingly relaxing Shaw composition entitled &quot;Aku Aku&quot;.  One is left with a feeling of completeness.  &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; is a true harmonic journey, THE masterwork of real musicians at the height of their compositional abilities.

B00005JMCR|4.0|American Wedding is a worthy followup to the earlier American Pie films. There are plenty of laughs to be found, and the actors are all terrific. I highly recommend this film to anyone who liked the previous movies.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I'll grant you that The Parent Trap is gushy, syrupy, silly in parts and far-fetched. But none of it makes the slightest bit of difference, because this is a truly classic film! It's a microcosm of the 60's and for anyone who grew up in that crazy decade, you will adore the clothes, slang and general feel of the movie. Hayley Mills delivers her best performance in dual roles as wealthy twins who meet by chance at camp. They had been separated as tiny tots and only realize they are sisters when they compare photo of their parents. The scenes at camp are a little contrived, but they still will make you laugh.<br />The best parts of the movie are with Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara, still beautiful and charming in the role of the mother. The twins plot on how to reunite their parents and their vicious tricks on witchy Vicky (Keith's fianc&eacute;e) are hilarious. The camping scenes are really funny and even though a little mean-spirited, who wouldn't root against the vain, frivolous Vicky? Keith and O'Hara have real screen chemistry and their scenes together are delightful.<br />I have seen this movie dozens of times and never weary of it. Kids of all ages should love it, and so should the seniors and anyone in between. A true Disney classic!

B00006CJOY|5.0|Listening to Manu Chao is synonimous with party. His music is packed with chords and choruses that promise to make you smile, make your feet move and make you want to clap the night away, looking at the stars with your friends. Recorded around the world live between 2000 and 2002, with a powerful ensemble consisting of no less than 25 band members bursting in sounds that show the influences of reggae, ska, flamenco and all sorts of world music, the former front man of Mano Negra, Manu Chao came back in 2002 with the very contagious album 'Radio Bemba Sound System'. Tastefully handpicked arrangements for the live versions blow new life into several of his classic songs and a few borrowed from his Mano Negra years. Listening to the album is transporting yourself to the 'ramblas' in Barcelona or by the beach in Rio de Janeiro, dancing to his music with the crowd. Enjoy it!

0385504209|4.0|The protagonists in Dan Brown's best selling novel, \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" are Robert Langdon, a brilliant symbologist from Harvard and Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist.  Sophie's grandfather, Jacques Sauniere, was brutally murdered in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where he was curator. The French police suspect that Langdon may be the killer, but Langdon flees after protesting his innocence.  He teams up with Sophie to decipher the clues that Sauniere left behind in the minutes before he died.  The two then embark on a difficult and dangerous search that leads them through France and London on the trail of the real killer.<br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is filled with complex puzzles and arcane facts about such subjects as the history of the Roman Catholic Church, Leonardo Da Vinci's genius, and the origins of such words as \\"villain\\" and \\"heretic\\".  If you like puzzles and obscure history as I do, then you may find these parts of the book intriguing.<br />However, Brown does not completely succeed in writing a great thriller.  The characters of Sophie and Robert are poorly developed.  We get no sense of them as human beings.  They are merely vehicles for the many set speeches that they make throughout the book, often along the lines of, \\"I've got it! Let me explain what this code means!\\"  The dialogue is stilted, the villains are stock characters, and the author overuses italics and exclamation points to show the reader that a very important event is occurring. On the plus side, Brown certainly piqued my interest with his fascinating and tantalizing codes and his unusual tale of a secret so earthshattering that it drives people to kill.

0060012218|5.0|I loved this book!!  It has a heart, and a serious point, but it's also laugh-out-loud funny.  It's also a real page-turner!  Russel Middlebrook is the most appealing main character I've read in years--and his friends are pretty interesting too.  Definitely not just for teens.
B0000844I8|4.0|Others have more than adequately discussed the movie itself - which I love - so I'm going to largely limit this to technical aspects of the 'Ultimate Edition' release.<br />The Ultimate Edition brings what many (including myself) were waiting for: an anamorphic version of this movie. Unfortunately, the quality of the anamorphic relase is largely wasted on a very poor transfer in this 'remastered' DVD.<br />Apparently, someone decided that the original film was too dark visually: The problems with this new version are all the result of trying to brighten and lighten the image. The contrast is too high, with some scenes blatantly posterized. Once they lightened the image, they 'pushed' the color saturation very hard to make up for the washed-out quality lightening the image produced. Some scenes are so over saturated that the flesh tones almost 'glow.' The effect is cartoonish at its worst. <br />Oddly, the theatrical release on disk 2 isn't quite as bad - but the effect is still very noticable. The original non-anamorphic DVD relase has none of these problems and preserves the wonderful subtle colors that this film showed in the theater. But it's not anamorphic...<br />Another review mentioned the muddled and inconsistent balance of the sound in this version. I agree completely. I was constantly having to adjust the volume, even with the dynamic range compression engaged on my amplifier - which I generally loathe to turn on.<br />Is this DVD worth it? Depends. The poor quality of the Director's Cut transfer means I probably won't watch it much. The added scenes add little or nothing to the film, so this won't be much of a loss. The Theatrical Release is probably the best balance of anamorphic quality vs. transfer quality, so it's probably worth it to home theater fans who can take advantage of that. The special features are the main reason for fans of the film to purchase this release. If you're neither a videophile nor a rabid fan of the film, save your bucks and buy the Special Edition DVD.

B00009V8Z9|4.0|Pop records bore me to death.  The truth is that hook-laden songs have no substance.  There is nothing to enjoy after the 3rd or 4th listen.  I only got Gavin's new CD because I really didn't know that it was a pop record.  I read his article in the July issue of Keyboard magazine and convinced myself he might be worth listening to.  He talked about artists like Jeff Beck and Van Morrison.  He talked about making inspiring records like his influences had.  Keyboard's staff writer declared that this kid was a supreme songwriter who was devoted to his craft.  Although  &quot;Chariot&quot; was a shot in the dark I'd say my expectations were right on the mark.  I immediately drew a comparison to the immortal Jeff Buckley.  Gavin can sing, and his voice truely saved this album from being another pop record.  But as for being a great songwriter I think I would have liked a little more instrumental integrity and variety; his straight forward rock riffs won't get him very far with music fans like me.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought Gavin's c.d after hearing a friend play chariot.  Usually when buy an entire cd after only hearing one or two songs it turns out i hate the rest of it.  NOT TRUE.  I own cd's by John Mayer, Ben Folds, and Josh Kelley, but my reaction to Gavin's CD was one of awe.  His voice, his lyrics, his talent! There is not much to say other than: GO BUY THIS CD.  It'll only make you a happier person (=.
0783226888|2.0|In 1971, Frederick Forsyth thrilled readers the world over with \\"The Day of the Jackal,\\" a highly detailed story of a mysterious assassin hired to kill French President Charles de Gaulle. Two years later, Fred Zinnemann directed an excellent film version of the novel, with Edward Fox as the Jackal and Michael Lonsdale as the French police detective trying to find him before it's too late.<br />And now we have this.<br />Bruce Willis stars in \\"The Jackal\\" as an enigmatic gunman hired by the Russian mafia to kill the director of the FBI. (Why the head of the FBI and not someone Russian? The mafia chief says it will \\"send a message,\\" as the FBI is cooperating with the Russian police, but that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.) Trying to find him before the kill takes place are Sidney Poitier as the FBI deputy director, Diane Venora as a Russian police colonel, and Richard Gere (sporting an Irish accent) as an IRA terrorist who is sprung from prison to help in the search.<br />Willis tries to play the Jackal as a cold, calculating killer, but a lot of the time he just appears to be sleepwalking. Poitier gnashes his teeth and chews the scenery, but he really doesn't have a lot to do in this film, and he knows it. Venora is there simply to add a bridge between the Russians and Americans, and Gere -- I have no idea why he's in this movie to begin with. After all, the original novel and film did quite well without throwing a character like his into the mix. Why the filmmakers decided to start overhauling the story and add entirely new major characters is beyond me; perhaps they thought they were updating it somehow. Plot holes exist in abundance, as do a few utterly inexplicable scenes which feel like they have nothing to do with the rest of the film.<br />Now, if all this sounds like it doesn't have much to do with the 1973 film, let alone the novel, you're right. Both Forsyth and Zinnemann were reportedly extremely unhappy with this remake and asked that their names be removed from the credits. They also demanded that the film's title be changed from the original \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" to play down any connection with the 1973 film.<br />The best that can be said about \\"The Jackal\\" is that it's not a complete failure, as it maintains a reasonable level of suspense, but it simply cannot be compared to the 1973 film. Viewers are advised to skip this ill-advised remake and stick with the original.
0307120007|3.0|I know this is a classic, but I have to say, it's not the best for small children ... too many parts and pieces to get torn or ripped, or lost.  Better for older children who are gentle on books (3 and up?  and no younger kids who can/will get their hands on it).  It's very sweet and I certainly have fond memories of it from when I was a child/babysitter.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Let's start with the good. Jennifer Garner is stunning in this film. With her sensual pout, and kick ... moves, she portrays a strong woman that all men will fall in love with. Colin Farrell. A little over the top, but he looks like he is having a ball playing Bullseye, and brings some life and energy to an otherwise pointless and boring superhero film. <BR> Now with the bad. Ben Affleck is miscast as the title character Daredevil. First of all, he looks rediculous in the costume. Second, he is so boring in the role, that it seems obvious he did not want to make this film, and only wanted to capitalize on the success of Spiderman. Michael Clarke Duncan, so amazing in The Green Mile, is laughable as the villain KingPin. The stunts are nothing spectacular. They are choppy and slow, and are not exciting at all. The sets look fake, and the story is just pointless. The only thing that makes this film redeem itself is Jennifer Garner and Colin Ferrell. See the film for them only, but if you want to see a great Superhero film, then watch Spiderman again. Extremly disappointed in this film, and I was so excited to see it. The trailer makes it look amazing, but it is certainly not.
B00006RIO7|5.0|CHICAGO is brash, teasing, sensual, dark, demanding, and manipulating...and I'm only describing the music!!<br />The songs don't just start playing over the speaker, they are subtly introduced by the bandleader (played by Taye Diggs).  Then you experience the color and pizzazz of classic Broadway music numbers!<br />Now really I was never much for musicals but after seeing Chicago<br />(3 times) I rushed to get the soundtrack and I am still blown away!<br />Standout tracks:<br />\\"ALL THAT JAZZ\\" delivered by Catherine Zeta-Jones opens you up to the 1920s when nights meant going wild and music was loud and sexy.<br />\\"FUNNY HONEY\\" delivered by Renee Zellweger is an ode to a husband that begins as sweet but turns ugly when he becomes a stool pigeon!!<br />\\"WHEN YOU'RE GOOD TO MAMA\\" sung by Queen Latifah is an amazing number!  Sexy and funny as the Queen delivers her threat or rather \\"suggestion\\" of \\"when you're good to mama....mama's good to you!\\".<br />\\"CELL BLOCK TANGO\\" is a piece sung by six women who each in turn explain why they either accidentilly, or was forced or have no recollection of killing their mates.  The song is darkly funny, brutal yet completly entertaining!<br />\\"ALL I CARE ABOUT\\"  a song performed by Richard Gere recalls some of the early 1920's cloying love tunes-but the performance of the song and the action in the movie tell two different stories!<br />\\"WE BOTH REACHED FOR THE GUN\\" is another Gere performance where he sings in two voices backed by a company of more voices.  The words are hilarious and the rhythm is addictive!<br />\\"MR. CELLOPHANE\\" sung by John C. Riley is an ode to the \\"looked over\\" in life.  Bittersweet but brillantly delivered....agurably one of the best songs on the CD!<br />\\"I MOVE ON\\" is a new song in CHICAGO's history, a duet by Catherine and Renee which fits in with the theme very beautifully!<br />There are other songs I didn't mention only to save space for my faves!  In whole the CD is fun, entertaining and has staying power!  In other words, you won't get tired of hearing it!<br />That's what makes a CD worth buying...<br />That's CHICAGO!ng power!

B00000IO4J|5.0|I loved this movie I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel this summer and I thought it was great.  It was also good because you wouldn't think the alien queen was the alien queen.  You gotta love the character match-up, the geek, the goth chick, the sensitive jock, the head cheerleader, the new kid in town, and the druggie who turns out to be the hero.  <br />I usually don't lyk the alien type stuff but especially loved this movie.  It was great, okay now this is what it was like.  The place it took place was a small town and an alien lands on on this small town and takes out one person then they do and it starts out in high school, and six very different people band together to take out the aliens that are taking over the town.  What kills them seems to be very ironic.

B00005JM1F|5.0|My first thought when mom and dad rented this was tiredness. They had started it, i missed the first 10 minutes, but right when I came in I was hooked. I haven't seen animal house, so I really cant compare them at all, but this movie does a really good job in entertainment.<br />It's basically about how Luke Wilson(Mitch) had his girlfriend doing nasty stuff when he wasn't around. He basically leaves and gets a new house. Here, he Vince, and Will all start a ferternity. Mitch isn't really into it, and Dean Pritcher trys to shut it down. The comedy is fresh though, and not moronic. The whole weddinggift/present thing I saw coming a mile away, still all 3 of the guys did an awesome job acting it out.<br />Will Farrel(Frank the Tank) does an awesome job. He portrays the crazy guy perfectly. He isn't too crazy, has his composure, but does crazy stuff. Anyways, he basically does mostly all of the comedy, and really makes the dvd a hilarious movie. Go buy it, there is some minor nudity, nothing too big though.
0609610570|3.0|I bought this book because I thought I could learn something new from a couple of high level people.  Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on that premise for me, though reading this book was not a waste of time.<br />My wife and I own a relatively small service business.  Many of the techniques and suggestions in this book are best for a large organization with lots of resources.  For instance, the book talks about conducting strategy and reveiw sessions several times a year.  If we took our top 10 people out for a couple of days each quarter, we'd close because we only have 10 employees, including us!  In fact, much of the analysis suggested can be done even more regularly for a small business since your focus is on your business only and not several units.<br />However, the chapters on the people process were helpful. Having the right person in the right job is important in any organization, no matter how small.  I intend to use several ideas from this section, scaled down for a small business like ours.<br />I found some of the writing occasionally pompous and filled with cliches.  Phrases like &quot;robust dialogue&quot; and &quot;social software&quot; sound like high-priced consultant double-speak.  Also, I got the feeling that Mr. Bossidy always knows he's the smartest guy in the room.  <br />The bottom line, however, is that if you are a rising executive at some big manufacturing corporation that is implementing Six Sigma processes, you will probably find this book helpful.  If you own a small service business like we do, you could probably spend your reading time in better ways.
B00005NQLP|2.0|Well, we've waited a long time for this one to be on CD, and musically speaking it's well worth the wait. But I have doubts about the source tapes used for the remastering process.

0783226063|3.0|Well I'm definitely &quot;not&quot; here to make apologies for either the David Lynch original nor the Alan Smithee after-thought.<BR>However I &quot;am&quot; here to state that with all of this &quot;extra&quot; footage , why oh why couldn't the publishers of this DVD just   include the extra footage sans that gawd-awful failed attempt at an Orson Wellsian narration. This is because one of the key features that is so very striking about this production is its &quot;Look&quot;. <BR> What separates out truly classic science fiction cinema is its ability to transport you into another world and Lynch's &quot;Dune&quot; has &quot;always&quot; succeeded on that front. That is why it would've been a classier choice to include the extra scene footage as just that and be done with it. All of the cut scenes are still more moments to be suspended in this world.<BR> The &quot;Look&quot; and most of the performances really do help make up for one of its weakest links being the &quot;uneven&quot; quality of that script which &quot;is&quot; David Lynch's doing.<BR> My God I see the great British actor's performances in this and yearned for what this film could've been had it been treated with BBC /Masrepiece Theatre-style writing (.<BR>BTW:  The classic Brit masterpiece mini-series &quot;I,Claudius&quot; comes immediately to mind in which Patrick Stewart plays a fascinating supporting role and in which Reverend Mother actress Sian  Phillips played the fascinating &amp; powerful lead role of  Empress Livia . <BR> Add in Freddie Jones' Mentat and Francesca Annis' Lady Jesisica along with the solid performances of  German actor Jurgen Pruchow , of &quot;Das Boot&quot;  fame , and  always masterful Max Von Sydow  ( &quot;Minority Report&quot; of late )and you really do have enough quality talent on screen to make the sometimes amatuerish script work its way through.<BR>( I'd often fantasized Baron Harkonnen played by classic Brit-film actor Sidney Greenstreet_ You know ,&quot; The Fat gent&quot; in &quot;Casablanca&quot;_ however  I'm as convinced that Rod Stieger would've created a far more powerful and chilling performance as the Baron. I know , dream on )<BR> Now add the masterful costumes ,&quot;especially&quot; the most crucial design of the stillsuits , the Jules Verne look of the technology of an empire , and the masterful craftsmanship of the worms by one Carlo Rimbaldi who made H.R.Giger's &quot;Alien&quot; head work and come to life and you really do have enough of the ingredients of what makes a classic work of SciFi worth owning.<BR> The soundtrack is appropriately engaging enough , but if only Toto could've resisted that one temptation to include those oh so cheezy  lead guitar licks during Paul's first ride of the great worm. Cheapens the whole effect Lynch was trying for. <BR> Well there's plenty of Lynch's infamous &quot;quirky&quot; touches in this to be amusing for its own sake , but the &quot;original&quot; is still<BR>the best. Again ,too bad &quot;all&quot; of the original footage is not included on this DVD ,but there's enough there to make the point.

0156027321|5.0|Pi is a story of great imagination.  By this I refer not only to the writer Martel, but also Pi.  Pi has survived insurmountable tragedy, flipped from the frying pan into the fire.  Instance after instance he must think of ways to live, and reasons to live.  Using clever devices Martel shows us there is indeed a happy ending, but watching Pi's journey you are made to ask how is it possible?  How does he overcome so much sadness, loneliness, and loss?  How is it that life bestows us gifts that we cannot recognize until much later?  <br />I found The Life of Pi to be magical.  It starts out lighthearted, with Pi exploring the various meanings of life in a humorous sequence that questions why we have to commit to any one religion. Pi wants to taste them all!  He has reverence for life!  And as it turns out, this youthful curiosity is never abandoned -- it has saved him.  As the story progresses, and Pi is challenged on so many levels, the story turns naturally darker.  We wonder if by the very nature of his youth and his experiences at the zoo that he is able to survive. Perhaps that is another test.  <br />Ultimately Pi is saved by his imagination. Or is he? The boy with the pastoral life that is suddenly swallowed by horror and loneliness must learn to cope. But after all, Pi has a old black and white picture, and in the background, in a cage, is Richard Parker.

B000002J0B|5.0|1973's _Houses of The Holy_ marked the beginning of Zeppelin's second stage in their career. While the first four albums had more or less hints of darkness, and a certain aura of ambiguity (sonically speaking), this one seemed to find the guys in a more confident, cheerful and self-assured mood.<br />The album is highly diverse, and also shows Zeppelin branching out into other areas that were not explored beforehand, such as funk and reggae. \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" gets things started as an elaborate, energetic rocker. Features impressive chord changes, textures and other such theatrics from Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant uses what seems like an intended feminine falsetto, while \\"The Rain Song\\" is a slow, melancholic ballad with elegant and authentic orchestration. \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" really doesn't need much comment, since it's been heard on the radio for decades now, and \\"The Crunge\\" is Zeppelin's take on funk. This track gets bashed quite a bit, although I've always loved it. Check out Bonham's funky, addictive 9/8 rhythm on the drum kit.<br />\\"Dancing Days\\" has the aura of someone (or people in general) enjoying a drive on a pleasant summer day full of ongoing festivities. While it's a steady rocker, some of the guitar parts remind me of country music. I could easily see this song arranged in country music-style. \\"D'yer Maker\\" (which I believe was originally called Jamaica) is a reggae-rock number, and shows Zeppelin at their artistic best (you just have to love Robert Plant's intuitive vocal improvisations on this one.) \\"No Quarter\\" is probably my personal favorite on here, as it's a long, atmospheric number featuring loads of John Paul Jones' keyboard textures. It reminds one of staring at the orange-brown nocturnal sky when experiencing some kind of snowstorm. Comparisons to Pink Floyd are mentioned in other reviews, and those would be valid, even if only on a superficial level. The keyboard textures and atmospherics certainly recall Floyd. Other than all of this, the track is fairly dark, haunting, otherworldly, oceanic and mysterious. Even Robert Plant's vocals sound a bit murky and smothered, which adds to the mysterious flavor of the track. \\"The Ocean\\" is dedicated to Led Zeppelin's fans. And the lyric \\"now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart/she is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start\\" was Robert Plant's creative way of saying that the birth of his daughter changed his life -- no pedophilia whatsoever here. The \\"oceanic\\" romp-like ending is my favorite part of the song.<br />Things would never be the same for Zeppelin after the release of this album, as a series of unfortunate events would follow, and hinder the band's future. This was arguably the last album in which Zeppelin were at their most inspired, consistent and self-assured. Absolutely essential.than all of this, the track is fairly dark, haunting, otherworldly, oceanic and mysterious.

B00006GO99|5.0|This was the first Thelonious Monk album I heard, and instantly I was a fan. Although Monk's Columbia recordings sometimes get a bad rap (did he sellout? was he merely repeating himself after being one of jazz's greatest innvovators?) &quot;Monk's Dream&quot; is probably the best introduction to the world of Monk's music imaginable. The music swings incredibly, and Monk's unique piano stylings stand out like borealis.<br />One of the most interesting things about Monk's piano playing is his ability to use dissonance to brighten things up. Typically dissonance is associated with dreary or melancholy music. Monk somehow turns dissonance against itself and brightens the music with tone clusters and notes almost impossible to decipher. This is true both in the solos as well as the themes of the songs. The dissonance goes by almost without being noticed, however, and you'll never think he's playing a wrong note. Monk opened up not only jazz but music in general to new sounds and concepts. If you think he can't play piano then you haven't tried playing any of his solos. In the world of music Monk is considered difficult not only physically but conceptually. This CD conatins rich music that will reward repeated listenings for years.
B00005I44H|5.0|I first bought the Decca set by Ashkenazy for 2 reasons. One, I am a fan of Ashkenazy and I think he plays superbly. Two, I heard that Decca gave Ashkenazy a superb recorded sound. So that was my first set of Mozart Piano Concertos. In the meantime, I kept hearing praise about Perahia's set - how wonderful it is and that it is listed on Gramophone's list of 100 greatest classical recordings of all time. I think very highly of that list simply because many of my favorite recordings are there - and they are my favorites precisely because they are simply fantastic - Klemperer's Fidelio, Klieber's Beethoven 5 &amp; 7, Solti's Ring, Gilel's Brahms Piano Concerto, Klemperer's German Requiem, Solti's Salome, Furtwangler's Beethoven 9, Giulini's Don Giovanni. So I thought to myself, let's put Perahia to the test. I fell madly in love with Perahia's reading immediately. My goodness - if I thought Ashkenazy is outstanding, Perahia is simply divine!! I rarely come across such beautiful and mesmerizing playing. Perahia's Mozart Piano Concerto is simply in the 'legend' league, standing proudly beside all the greatest recorded classical works in the world. His playing is simply gorgeous - beautiful poetic insights and astounding technique. I was mesmerized from start to finish, completely absorbed in his playing. Ashkenazy is superb but somehow, Perahia gives every concerto that extra indefinable special touch.<br />This is one of those classical sets that I would put in the 'must-own' class for any classical music lover. You will be enchanted from first to last by the special talents of Perahia. To put it in other words, Perahia is to Mozart Piano Concerto what Kirsten Flagstad and Birgit Nilsson are to Wagner, what Joan Sutherland is to Bel Canto singing, what Rostropovich is to the cello repertoir, what Artur Rubinstein is to Chopin.
B00004SA86|5.0|I was delighted to discover this import title on HMV prior to their partnership with Amazon.  Rafael Kubelik's Mahler Cycle has to be considered among the best ever recorded.  While I'm still partial to Bernstein's famous first cycle on Columbia (now Sony), Kubelik's accounts are mesmerizing and he outshines Bernstein on many of the Symphonies (in particular 1, 3, 4 & 8).  It amazes me that with such a great set, DG has chosen to only make Kubelik's recording of the Mahler 1st available as an individual disc (Sym 4 was available in the \\"Musikfest\\" series but is now OOP), and even more incredibly, that they chose to issue Sinopoli's Mahler Cycle domestically instead of Kubelik's!

Who cares about specific plot points when you've got Brian DePalma directing with his usual stylistic flourishes. True, he's a bit more tied down than with his usual fair (see Blow Out) but even DePalma on autopilot is pretty impressive.<br />This film works much better than its sequel because it doesn't try to pad out the film with a useless romantic subplot. Ethan Hunt isn't a character that needs to be fleshed out and that's what makes the no-nonsense tone of MI1 so superior to MI2. Stylistically, Woo beats DePalma hands down but that's about it.<br />The presence of actors like Jon Voight and Henry Czerny give the first MI an almost Tom Clancy-like feel -- especially in the vein of Hunt For Red October with all the espionage and technospeak.<br />Also, the setting of Eastern Europe contributes a lot to the overall atmosphere of the film -- especially the opening sequence where Hunt's team is betrayed and killed off, one by one.<br />There are some really solid set-pieces in the movie: the aforementioned mission gone wrong at the beginning, the now-famous nearly silent break-in at CIA Headquarters, and the infamous train/helicopter chase at the film's climax. Yeah, that last one was mucho implausible but it's still a lot of fun to watch.<br />Most importantly, Mission: Impossible is an entertaining time waster with a lean script full of all sorts of twists and turns, a solid performance by Cruise and a great supporting cast that also includes the always reliable Ving Rhames and Jean Reno.<br />Alas, this DVD is very bare bones with no extras to speak of. Thankfully, Paramount learned their lesson with the MI2 DVD but it would be nice if they revisited this first one and got DePalma to do an audio commentary, throw in some deleted scenes and a retrospective featurette or two. It's about time.
B000002KNI|5.0|This tape should only be played through a stereo system...only then will it knock your socks off.  And it will!
B00003CWTH|1.0|The beautiful packaging of this movie and the ensemble of actors looked promising, but something gets lost in the translation. Perhaps it's the director's insistence to make this 3 hours long when 2 hours would suffice, perhaps it's the in-your-face moral messages, or perhaps it's the constant use of the f-word and other phrases meant to shock, such as the one the is repeated about respecting certain things that are really more functional than they are worthy of respect, but somehow this film fails to deliver. The raining of amphibians must have been added at the end when the director realized he had to give the audience some sort of an ending. Three hours of watching messed up people deal with the consequences they can no longer avoid is not much of a movie and this isn't art -- it's just nonsense and weirdness masking as art. <br />However, if you wanted to illustrate overacting, this film would be a great reference tool.
B00009L1TA|3.0|On paper Basic is pretty much what it's title implies: a more or less basic military mystery thriller with plenty of plot twists (both conventional and unconventional), but despite a top notch cast and the film being in the hands of veteran action director John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator), Basic falls short of it's potential thanks to some shallow performances, and one too many unconvincing plot twists.  John Travolta is solid as an ex-Army ranger called in to interrogate surviving rangers of an ill-fated training exercise and find out what happened to the legendary Sgt. West (Samuel L. Jackson; excellent as always).  Travolta is joined by Connie Nielsen to help with the interrogation, but as the film gets underway and the plot thickens, the viewer is left in they're seat wondering just what is going on.  All that aside, Basic is a fine film on it's own right, but it had so much potential that has been laid to waste.  The rest of the cast includes Brian Van Holt, Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Harry Connick, Jr.
B00008J4P5|5.0|White Stripes are not exactly of what I consider to be my favorite format of music, but after seeing all the good reviews about them, I decided to buy Elephant, which received a rarely-awarded 5 stars from Rolling Stone. <br />It is a most interesting listen, to say the least. The focus of this release seems to be that of album rock era stars from the 1960s and 1970s, where there is a concentrated attempt to produce an overall masterpiece to the whole collection as opposed to recording what would be two or three top radio songs and the rest of the ten or twelve tracks be mere fillers. <br />Elephant, if recorded by any other artist, could very easily have been a mere garage band type creation. However, Jack and Meg White mix things up with creative humor and gothic pensiveness. Lyrically, Elephant is fascinating. Quite noteworthy is Little Acorns, which starts off with what sounds like a middle-aged orator reading an account of how many years ago a woman who was down on her luck overcame depression by noticing the behavior of a squirrel who, despite being a very small creature, could survive a harsh winter. Though that particular brief segment seemed simple in presentation, its ability to get the underlying meaning across would have been hampered if taken from a more academic approach. And in similar fashion, the recordings were not musically complex, but adding much else to Jack White's versatile vocals would have undermined the level of achievement already accomplished. In other words, addition, in one sense, can be subtraction in another.<br />Hypnotise is, by far, the weakest track. Fortunately, it is the only weak track and is also one of the shortest on the list. It's True That We Love One Another is a most fascinating closer. The banter among the bandmates is very reminiscent of You and Me (Babe), the last track of Ringo Starr's Ringo, where Mr. Starr finishes up by humorously thanking all the major  players involved.<br />Elephant is a jolly good show, indeed, and White Stripes do have a reason to celebrate.
B00000AFDW|2.0|The attempt to make another Destroyer fell very short.  The title track is easily the best song on this album.  It was obvious right away that Peter Criss wasn't playing on it....he does't have that kind of talent so why go in and make this album at all? Before it even came out you knew that Peter would be singing a ballad. &quot;I Finally Found My Way&quot; is no &quot;Beth&quot; or &quot;Hard Luck Woman.&quot;  The rest of it is just too soft. There is no heavy drum sound. It almost like a weak Lick It Up minus the better songs. Get back with Eric and Bruce!  Don't worry about makinganother Destroyer.  I'll be satisfied with another Revenge.
B00009TB5G|3.0|Acting: great. Direction: great. Scenery/costume design/music: great. Screenplay: lousy. Yes, yes, yes, we all know it's nearly impossible to translate such an honored work of literature to the the big screen. Peter Jackson did an amazing job with \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" part one of this epic story. He dropped the ball big time with this adaptation of part two.<br />Completely unnecessary scenes steal precious screen time from scenes that are actually important, thus watering down this pivotal story. Aragorn going over the cliff? What a waste of ten minutes. Aside from the fact that the scene is not in the book (an entirely different subject for discussion!), it's horribly cheesy and not even remotely interesting or very well done. (Oh, Aragorn is swept away by the river! Will he survive? Gee, I wonder....)<br />Faramir's character (for those who know the books) is not only off, but the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of how he's supposed to be. Instead of something of an \\"Aragorn Lite\\" - a brave, wise warrior who resists temptation, he's played as \\"Boromir Lite\\" - a boorish, headstrong, weak fool who, in another example of ten wasted minutes of film time, unnecessarily brings Frodo and Sam along with him instead of letting them continue their quest, which Faramir knows is vital. This sets up a completely unbelievable scene (even for a fantasy movie) involving a Nazgul mere feet from the One Ring. Puh-lease.<br />These two useless scenes alone could've allowed Jackson to actually finish the movie, instead of simply stopping it as though he were running out of time. And honestly, how could you ask for a better cliffhanger ending than that in the book? One of the storylines comes to something of a resolution, while the other leaves off in the mother of all cliffhangers. As it is, the movie hardly feels complete when the end credits begin to roll. I left the theater in a baaaad mood after this one.<br />It's not all bad! As mentioned at the beginning of this review the actorsare excellent, the scenery is beautiful, and the direction is quite good. The battle scenes are nothing short of breathtaking (though the \\"Olympic torch\\" guy stretched even MY ability to suspend disbelief). A more comprehensible story and an actual ending sure would've been nice, though. If you're just up for a cool-looking, well-acted movie, and if you don't know the books, \\"The Two Towers\\" may be for you. If you love the novels, however, and are looking for an adaptation as good as the first part of this movie trilogy, you'll be disappointed.
B000001ESF|5.0|I don't know what I could say about this album that hasn't already been said, but I believe that this is Rush's first really great album, they hit a stride after this album came out, the next 5 albums release we're equally as good.<br />1. '2112': (10/10) Just a perfect song, it's 20 minutes long and it is just utterly amazing and possibly one of their best songs.<BR>2. A Passage To Bangkok   (9/10) <BR>3. The Twilight Zone     (7/10)<BR>4. Lessons     (9/10)<BR>5. Tears        (8/10)<BR>6. Something For Nothing  (10/10) Just a great finish to this album.
0517123207|5.0|While neo-Darwinism is still struggling and many prominent biochemists, physicists, and biologists themselves are predicting its demise in its current form, Darwinism, as presented in the Origin of Species is still undisputed.  Instead of reading claptrap that evolutionary theory has inadvertently produced, I recommend reading the book that started it all. Yes, much of it is refutable, but this books stands as a testament to one of the best theories science ever put forward.  And unlike neo-Darwinism, it is not just one giant contradiction.  Recommended.
0743216458|5.0|I don't find a need to summarize this book. However, I will say the book is excellent! One of the best books I've read about the common soldier in Europe. Ambrose's writing is superb - he makes all of the characters come alive as we follow their induction into the Army and their arrival at Fort Toccoa and their training with Capt. Sobel. We follow the guys to England as they get ready to depart for Normandy. The book continues with their jumps into Holland and later, Bastogne. Since we've followed the troops and have come to know them well, there is a sense of sadness at the war's end that these band of brothers are disbanding. The &quot;where are they now&quot; at the end of the book is quite poignant. The book is not heavy on facts and is somewhat light reading but it's one that is hard to put down.
0738206679|1.0|Prologue:<br />How come there is no 0 or negative choice<br />for the rating? I did NOT want to choose 1 star,<br />but -5 stars.<br />Review:<br />Writing a popular science book is not as trivial as one<br />might think. Here is a (minimal) set of rules:<br />* FIRST and foremost, the author must know the field well<br />and must have contributed to it substantially.<br />* SECOND, the author must know how to address to the general<br />public in an honest, scientific way.<br />* THIRD (and most evidently), the book must be written in a<br />language that can be understood by the layman, but, not necessarily,<br />completely effortlessly.<br />* FOURTH, it is important that the author's primary target<br />be not that he/she try to make the reader &quot;feel good&quot; only<br />(if people can be made to believe that they understand<br />something totally outside their field of expertise,<br />then they feel good about themselves, but, feeling good<br />without learning anything is a waste of time;<br />why not go hiking instead?)<br />* FIFTH, the author should remain humble about his/her<br />achievements, for there is no purpose in boasting about<br />them to the general public.<br />Unfortunately, the author, A.-L. Barabasi, miserably<br />fails in all of them:<br />* FIRST, it appears that his contributions (as far as one<br />can tell by reading his papers) are minimal.<br />* SECOND, the exposition of the subject is not honest,<br />because he hides the complexity, substituting it instead<br />by a tremendous amount of repetition.<br />* THIRD, while it is true that the book can be understood<br />by everyone, the fact that it can be done while taking<br />a nap (i.e., effortlessly) should be an indication of<br />its emptiness.<br />* FOURTH, alas, the only outcome of reading this book<br />is that the reader feels good. (See multi-star reviews below.)<br />* FIFTH, the author never fails to seize the opportunity<br />to tell the reader of his accomplishments.<br />Incidentally, a book that marvelously complies to the<br />above rules is &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot; by<br />Richard Feynman, as well as--at a more technical level--his<br />Lectures on Physics.<br />Let me conclude the review by giving another network for<br />which the degree of a node is a super-duper heavy-tailed<br />variable: Consider as nodes the people on this planet,<br />living or dead, and link two of them if they have the same<br />first name (ignoring variants due to language transformations,<br />e.g., John, Johann, Johannes, Ivan, Ioannis, etc. are<br />considered the same). This is a truly small world.<br />So small, that, for example, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi<br />is at distance one from Albert Einstein.<br />I wonder how come the author failed to notice this example<br />and create yet another chapter (or &quot;link&quot;).<br />He has my permission to use this idea<br />in the next edition of his book.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Once again... Radiohead has done it, they're simply amazing... <BR>Everyone should expand their horizons and listen to radiohead ;)
0808514121|5.0|After a long long time I got to read something so fulfilling. Something that one can identify with instantly and it does not take much effort as well. The theme of Brother Vs. Brother is universal and appealing to all. Maybe because as children of Cain, we are all the same - A blend of Good and Bad. Wow!!<BR>East of Eden was heavy for me!!<br />Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed.<br />The Theme: Brother vs. Brother <br />The Plot:  Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out on<BR>him. <br />He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come. <br />The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say \\"History\\".<br />The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money.<br />I guess the Biblical influence is immense in the book - but obvious it had to be!!<br />Overall, a great great awesome read!!
0679411585|5.0|The authors did an outstanding job writing this book. I had a hard time putting this book down, and will probably read it again before long. Everthing they went through is written in perfect detail. I would recommend this book to anyone who would want to learn more about the vietnam erra.
6304508611|5.0|Sissy Spacek is Carrie White, a teenager who is about to graduate<BR>but is constantly teased by her class mates. The precense of a religious finatic of a mother (Piper Laurie) doesn't help her high school trama either. After strange things begin happening at school after she gets angry or upset, Carrie eventually notices she has telekinetic powers and begins using them on her enemies. <BR>Spacek is so good as Carrie and Piper Laurie is amazing as the mother. Nancy Allen and John Travolta bring out the hate we should have for them very nicely in their debut roles. The second-last scene with Carrie's mother trying to commit murder to her daughter is so eerie and the music helps put the atmosphere into it. The famous prom sequence is very cool.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This concert is out of this world, it is the best concert I have ever seen. Slipknot has been my favorite band for a long time now, and they finally made a live concert dvd it is great.<br />So go buy this video
6305095566|4.0|Easily one of the best horror movies of all time. Sam Raimi's first film is a masterpiece of gore, style and technique, featuring some masterful special effects and unique camera movements. Bruce Campbell's performance is genuine, and the supporting cast adds to the creepy feeling that something so horrible can happen to the most innocent of all of us. Also adding to the overall atmosphere is the music, which is so traditional but original at the same time, one has to love it as it suits the film perfectly.
1573228737|3.0|I have now read all three of Waters novels, and I would say this is the best.  It was hard to get into it and I almost didn't bother to continue, but I slogged through and by the second half I looked forward to nightly reading.  The ending was a great surprise, and I was left with my heart pounding and unable to sleep.  The style of narrative is annoying in the beginning, but the rhythm soon makes itself clear.  Worth the effort for a Victorian style novel.  A similar theme of betrayal runs throughout the three books, but with enough variation to make it worth reading.
B000055WIQ|5.0|Ellen Burstyn stars as Chris MacNeil, a famous actress whose daughter obviously means much more than her career (as it should be). But when her daughter finds a witchboard in the basement and uses it to contact the spirit of a so-called 'Captain Howdy',<BR>she ends up being possessed by the demon that lies in the witchboard. Now, two priests along with the hope and passion of a devoted mother, the support of a kind nanny, and the curiosity <BR>of a detective, will try to battle evil and triumph and retrieve the sweet spirit of a little girl named Regan who was lost when she made the mistake of using that board. <BR>Possibly the best horror film ever made, this film with its religious undertones, travels deep into our minds and stings the brain with excitement and suspense. All the performances are incredible, as is the cinematography and the music score. Linda Blair (although not always the actress who plays Regan - a stunt person was involved) does an incredible job of portraying Regan MacNeil and we really do feel sorry for her. Great film all around.
0425152251|5.0|I just started rereading `Sophie's World' for the third time. Originally I was intriqued by its subtitle so picked it up and started reading it hungrily devouring it in a week. It is a novel so different, so extraordinary as to only be justified in the description magical. What makes it so great is that it has the ability to appeal to people with PHDs in Philosophy, or those totally ignorant or who Socrates was. As one read's Sophie's story I imagine even slightly jaded readers' can't resist vacariously sharing her sense of wonder as she learns about and explores the world she lives in. It is indeed a crash course on the History of Philosophy, even more accessible than Durant's books. As an added bonus as one reads further into the novel the author forebodes a twist. Overall an immensely enjoyable read that makes one think and ask pertinanet questions we are othwerwise likely too busy to explore.
B00000DRXW|5.0|I heard this CD by a friend somewhere in the mountains of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and I completely lost the time for 40 minutes ... this CD is amazing! In this session you can really hear the talent these guys have, it's outstanding, that's the only word I can use for the techniques they use. My ears had a splendid time listening those 5 songs. Although it's recorded live you have no problem listening to it because of the people screaming, only on the beginning and the end of each number. When I sat there listening to this amazing art of guitarplaying my friends (both experienced guitarplayers) were quiet for the full 40 minutes this CD lasts. Normally they start to whine when there's one wrong chord in it, but this time they listened just as good as I did. This CD is unique and I recommend you buy it, for such little money you got the best guitarists of the '80 on one CD ... now that's impressive!
B000002MUQ|5.0|This truly is one of thee best in Van Halen's history.<BR>It obviously shows that the bands songwriting,music and<BR>beautiful ballads have really matured into a melodic hard and<BR>smooth album over the years.Too bad Amazon can't get any LIVE 95<BR>BALANCE TOUR CDs...if you want this album....hear it LIVE first,<BR>the studio record will come in 2nd.<BR>AWESOME RECORD..it blew me away.
B00006LLNU|3.0|I bought this cd based on the recommendation by this website.  Before I start my thoughts, let me say im not a fan of conventional music, i like more the radiohead and flaming lips kind of music, and I also put very little value on the words of songs.  This cd isnt for those who care about lyrics, because you cant understand and there is no lyrics in the album booklet.  But lyrics dont concern.  The music is extremely simplistic, and I dont mean just the fact that only a few instruments play at a time, it doesnt matter.  The chord progressions though are that of most the songs you hear on the radio.  I guess people take it as being something special since there's synthesizers replacing electric guitars.  I think theres alot better music out there than this, if you want something good get Yoshimi battles the pink robots by the flaming lips.  Theres a great cd, this cd is only ok at best.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is without doubt the best music CD I have listenned to in a long time.  So you understand what that entails, I'm not a goth, but I am 37 years old.<br />I've been waiting a long time for music that is this technically excellent.  I fall short of calling it perfect, but only because I don't believe in perfection.  The musical riffs are complex and delicious.  The harmonics, the composition, and Amy Lee's soaring vocals ... everything is just about as flawless as humanly possible.  There's not one bad track on the entire CD, and that's real rare to find these days.<br />Some have compared Evanescence to Linkin Park, but there is no real comparison.  They are of similar genres, but Linkin Park doesn't hold a candle to Evanescence, not in terms of technical merits, definitely not vocal quality ... really, not in any way.  I'm not saying you shouldn't buy Linkin Park (after all, I have), but don't be fooled into thinking Evanescence is a Linkin Park clone, because they're most decidedly not.<br />My only concern for the group is in their second CD.  I reached the final track wanting more.  That can be a problem for a band's sophmore CD's.  If their first release is so excellent, which this one is, they can become complacent, or nervous.  Either condition could mire them, keep them from pushing the edge and taking risks.  I sure hope Evanescence doesn't fall into the \\"formula\\" trap, where they just release a rehash of former glories.  Still, that's a concern for the future.  In the now, this CD kicks ...
B000002UJQ|5.0|Haha at the person who says duran duran is more interesting than radiohead.  But seriously, ill get to the point.  This cd is probably one of the best cds every made.  You cant tell me you dont like this cd unless your just trying to go against everybody else for the sake of being a rebel.  This is an incredible work of art, none of these songs are boring or simplistic in anyway.  I dont really understand the lyrics, but it doesnt matter.  Thats not the point, if you want some good music, buy this cd, then buy the bends, then buy kid a.  Kid A is a little more far out, but still one of my favorite cds.  I cant say im as happy with hail to the thief as i wish i was, but this band is still the best in the world right now and i dont see that changing just because of this cd and kid a and even the bends.
0385504209|5.0|I was &quot;assigned&quot; the Da Vinci Code for my book club, and did not know what to expect.  What i got was a fantasic story, well written, with so many references to real life and history that I was constantly on the internet doing research!  The book is a well-written mystery which ties famous pieces of art to the bible and general history.  Many of the speculations I have heard before, and it was excellent to hear a new twist.  I loved the characters, and could not put the book down.  I highly recommend to any mystery/history/general fiction lover!
B000068PQ0|4.0|I dont want to give this 5 stars, because as people have said before there are alot better things out there.  But heres the difference between this and some of my other 4 star albums.  This one id say a little over half the songs i really like, worthy of a five star label.  But a few of the songs are entirely disposal, and im especially mad about the last song.  Thats no way to end an album.  But since we all have cd players with a skip button, you should buy this album, and then listen to it once and youll know which ones to skip.
6302878527|5.0|This delightful vehicle for the most beautiful Audrey Hepburn and the terribly charming Albert Finney never fails to make me smile &amp; sigh.  While following the pair through France, and through the first decade of love and marriage, director Donen gives us old-fashioned romance combined with a very realistic view of how love once so cherished becomes neglected and abused.<br />Memorable movie lines:<br />Finney to Hepburn who is sporting a tiara:  &quot;If you want to be a Dutchess, be a Dutchess; but if you want to make love it's hats off&quot;.  <br />Hepburn to Finney:  &quot;You don't know what love is&quot;.

0385508417|2.0|I normally enjoy John Grisham's books, but I really didn't like this one at all.  I'm actually surprised to see so many people liked it.  The book seemed more like a sad attempt at a screenplay for the next beloved Christmas film (along the lines of National Lampoon's Christmas), but everything was so cliched and easy-to-see-coming that it would make a terrible movie.  Plus, everyone cared way too much that the &quot;Kranks&quot; (please!) were skipping Christmas, to the point of not even being fun-fiction-believable.  I would recommend skipping this book.

B00000AFWZ|4.0|....but maybe if it was like this all the time, we wouldn't appreciate it as much. Garage spirit stands in stark contrast to lazy established groups like U2 & REM, in that they are spontaneous, passionate, and make little sense, as long as they got a good beat. I noticed a couple hooks that showed up in major 60s groups like the Doors, they didn't just steal from the Kinks!<br />    This was mentioned in another review, but it's disappointing that \\"96 Tears\\" isn't included, along with \\"Black is Black\\" and \\"I Aint Talkin\\". Otherwise, this is a very invigorating set.<br />    I can only hope they come out with Nuggets III because garage rock is still out there. I remember listening to a college radio station and they played songs like \\"Go Go Boots\\" by a group called Risky Shift. I looked all over and couldn't find them anywhere. This song came out in the early 90s. Hopefully the disc hunters at Rhino can dig these lost gems out. My ears will be waiting.
B00004RFFI|2.0|Like \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" another Hollywood blockbuster about extremely bad weather,  \\"Twister\\" gives us a script that it wouldn't have taken an F5 tornado to demolish. Add a nonstop series of lapses in credibility (e.g., some poor trucker in an 18-wheeler gets sucked into the monster funnel cloud, but Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton sidle right up alongside killer tornadoes repeatedly, and get nothing worse than a bruise) and some of the clunkiest dialog ever to boom out of multichannel sound systems, and the result is a movie that makes you grateful for the fast-forward and skip-chapter buttons on a DVD player. To be fair, the storm scenes are pretty entertaining, if not nearly as scary or realistic-looking as they could've been. (It's not that the CGI effects aren't convincing; it's that the neatly composed and precisely staged tornado sequences don't compare to the shaky, grainy, sometimes chaotic real-life TV news footage that the Weather Channel recycles for \\"Storm Stories\\" and such.) And the DVD is a terrific workout for a home-theatre setup, especially the subwoofer.  Unfortunately, the storm scenes take up maybe a half-hour of a two-hour movie, so the remaining 90 minutes is a workout of your patience for bad dialog and bad line readings (Philip Seymour Hoffman excepted). If extreme weather is your thing, you might do better to buy (or rent) a documentary DVD about it.
B00000ILGL|5.0|I first heard the title track as a young teenager growing up in new york,ever since then i was hooked.Now i have bought the cd so that i can listen to it on my long drives through the country.This is definitely classic electronic music at it's best.
B00005JMCR|4.0|I thought the first American Pie movie was hilarious, one of the funniest movies I've seen.  I was anxious to see the sequel, but while it had its moments, didn't win me over like the first movie. American Wedding is the third installment, and is it one funny movie.  It has been a while since I remember laughing so much at a film.<br />The basic premise is that Jim is getting married.  The rest is just a setup for rude gags that just keep getting better.
0345440900|1.0|We did not like her book.  If you want to treat your new baby like a bothersome inconvenience to be conditioned and scheduled into your life, this IMO could be the book for you.  If you'd rather consider your child as the special and uniquely needful individual he or she is (no two human beings are the same), and avoid &quot;one size fits all&quot; cookie-cutter approaches that make nice acronyms, then would suggest looking elsewhere.<br />There were some interesting aspects of the book, but on the whole her advice did not make our baby happy or healthy.  Found the tone of the book to be needlessly condescending as well, as if nobody knows better than Tracy Hogg Enterprises.  No thanks.
B00005JLYU|3.0|All I can say about this one is that if you enjoyed the original like I did, you'll enjoy this one, too.  The stunts are way over the top.  So much so, that you'll probably groan in a few spots, but still a fun movie.<br />The list of people who've had their identities changed in the witness protection program get out to a bad person who wishes to sell it to the bad guy's of the world.  The Angels use their super-human detective and athletic abilities to save the day.
B00009V7RF|5.0|First of all, I'm in a straight up West Coast mentality, so \\"awareness groups\\" like B.E.P. rarely catch my attention.  When I heard the first single from this album, My first reaction was \\"Who?\\"  Since the single was sold out, but there were plenty of albums left in the store I decided to buy the whole thing (I really liked the single).  After listening to the whole thing, I realized it was a production masterpiece!  Producer Will.I.Am  explored every aspect of music on this album and arranged it all to near perfection.  Some people may say that the lyrics lack substinence, but what substinence is really in hip hop today?  The lyrics are easy to listen to especially when your head won't stop bobbing to the ingenious arrangement-No one in this album dies either.  It's nice to see artists like B.E.P. take pride in their music.  You can tell they had a lot of fun making this album-It's not just thrown together blindly.  The female vocalist in the group has a melodic voice that just gives you chills all over.  I respect this album and am happy to finally have something that I can listen to without skipping past every three tracks.  I'm a new fan and give up my FOUR - better yet, compared to what's out there right now this is a FIVE!
6305313687|5.0|I have NEVER been so impacted by a movie ever in my life. I seriously felt physically sick after seeing this...its just so real, so intense, so deep, so powerful, so haunting, I cant even explain the feeling it gives you. I was speechless once it was over; I mean the ending just throws your heart over the edge. The way the movie was captured is just so unique and creative...I think this is one of the best films ever made. I also think it is very under rated, and I really cant stand the people who hate it. If you are one of those people, you obviously missed what the movie is trying teach us about life and the human race. You also may have read too much into the movie- its ridiculous to over analyze and criticize things that have clear honest meanings. Anyways...the acting is incredible, of course Norton gave the performance of a live time, but I think Edward Furlong did JUST as well. I actually think in ways Furlong's performance was more haunting; he just has a very real, vulnerable quality to him. I think together they made the movie utterly astounding and mind-blowing.

B00004XPP0|5.0|These three movies are so much better than the new three.  They should make these on DVD.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|First, the actors are excellent.  But what happened to Sylvia Nassar's truly excellent book?  In that book we learn about the world of Mathematician's and grad school at Princeton (having spent time there as a grad. student, I can tell you that the pen ritual is a bizarre and telling bit of Hollywood schmalz).  By contrast, the movie never even gives the viewer a taste of flavor of Nash's Nobel winning idea, the Nash Equilibrium.  The bar scene with its bizarre &quot;game&quot; is truly insulting (did Ron Howard believe the audience would be too stupid to understand this powerful, yet simple concept?).  There is not a single PhD economist of the many I've talked to about this movie who liked it.  But technical quibbling aside, why the bizarre concoctions of the move, the imagined roomate, etc.  The reality, at least as presented by Ms. Nassar is grimmer and much less flashy, but makes for no less compelling a story.<BR>My suggestion is buy the book and the &quot;A Brilliant Madness&quot; DVD.  Then if you must , buy this Not-So-Beautiful Mind.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have owned this cd for a couple years now, and it has never ever gotten old. This cd kicks so much [tail], it is definitely, in my opinion, one of the best cds EVER. I could not listen to it for the longest time, pop it in and still know every word to every song. Aenima is a 77 minute ride through the darkest places in your mind, and after it's all over you'll be begging for more. If you're new to Tool, buy this cd first, it's their best yet.

B000092ZYX|5.0|After reading many of the reviews, I agree with most of them that this is not \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"The Bends.\\" So what? Radiohead is unique because they experiment with their sound, unlike so many of the other \\"artists\\" out there today. It blows my mind how so much [material] is played on the radio. Radiohead is a very nice change. I liked the comments that you have to be intelligent to appreciate this band and that if you listen to the radio then you won't appreciate Radiohead, that is for sure. Although I have only been a fan of these guys for about 5 years, I appreciate the changes they have made with each album and own everyone one of them plus some live recordings. I never get tired of them. Adding to the comments that were posted in other reviews, I practically laughed out loud when one reviewer said that Justin Timberlake's \\"Justified\\" was SO much better and he would be more popular/remembered in the future. I found this comment completely ridiculous. Timberlake can not even be compared to Radiohead.
B00005JLTN|2.0|The only thing that this movie has going for it is the Special Effects!  Otherwise, it would just be a piece of SH*T!

B00003CXAT|4.0|Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster based on Michael Crichton's technothriler about cloned dinosaurs running amok on a Costa Rican island, is still an exciting journey of the imagination, even though it's been 10 years since its theatrical release. Although its computer-generated effects have been surpassed over the past decade, Jurassic Park's tale of a misguided science experiment fueled by one man's ambition to create the ultimate theme park still packs a Jaws-like mixture of chills and thrills.<br /><br />As in Crichton's novel, the story revolves around eccentric billionaire John Hammond's (Sir Richard Attenborough) plan to convert Isla Nublar into a tourist attraction that would put all the Disney theme parks to shame. With all the resources of his InGen Corporation, a major genetics research company, Hammond has built a huge entertainment complex/luxury resort/wildlife preserve. But unlike similar resorts in Africa where tourists go on ecologically-friendly safaris to see lions and elephants, Hammond's scientific team has done the seemingly impossible...and cloned dinosaurs.<br /><br />After an incident in which a worker falls prey to a velociraptor (in a sequence that pays homage to Jaws, Spielberg's first megahit), InGen's board of directors gets antsy and demands that the Isla Nublar complex, Jurassic Park, be inspected by a team of experts to ensure the park's viability and safety. Otherwise, says InGen attorney Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) \\"if I'm not convinced, they're not convinced,\\" and Jurassic Park will be shut down.<br /><br />Hammond, determined to open his ambitious dream park, recruits paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to assess Jurassic Park's safety and viability. Grant and Sattler are swayed to go by Hammond's offer to fund their Montana dig for another year, but Malcolm is openly skeptical. Hammond's dream, he thinks, is a natural time bomb ticking inexorably away, waiting to explode.<br /><br />Worse yet, Hammond has invited his grandchildren Tim and Lex (Joseph Mazziello and Ariana Richards) to visit, ostensibly to help them cope with their parents' divorce, but mainly to prove  his confidence in the park's security features.<br /><br />Little does Hammond know, however, that his dream park is doomed from various threats. Out to sea, a hurricane approaches Isla Nublar from the east. Inside the park itself, greedy computer technician Dennis Nedry (Seinfeld's Wayne \\"Newman\\" Knight) plans to shut down the security systems to be able to steal dinosaur embryos at the behest of a rival genetics company. Worse, one of the techniques to enable the cloning of the dinosaurs -- a scientific short cut -- is backfiring badly, even though InGen's top geneticist Dr. Wu (B.D. Wong) is unaware of it.<br /><br />When all these elements converge, things go dreadfully wrong on Isla Nublar, and when humans and dinosaurs interact, disaster follows, ending Hammond's ambitious and arrogant science experiment to the sounds of roaring T-rexes and hissing velociraptors.<br /><br />While not Spielberg's finest achievement ever (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and the Indiana Jones movies are better), this is still a fun movie to watch, especially on a lazy, hot summer evening. It is exciting and suspenseful, and like its close cousin Jaws, is better than the novel that inspired it, thanks to a crisp screenplay by Crichton and David Koepp. Adding to the magic are, as expected, composer John Williams and the techno-wizards at Industrial Light and Magic, Stan Winston's live action dinosaur crew, and all the rest who labored on this film. Even more amazing, Spielberg also gave us Schindler's List later that same year, proving his talents in organization and creativity...and diversity as a director.<br /><br />The Universal DVD Collector's Edition includes the 1993 blockbuster which was the biggest box office hit until Titanic was released in 1997, various making-of featurettes, exclusive DVD-ROM features, and the usual extra features (theatrical trailers, cast and crew credits, and production notes).ive DVD-ROM features, and the usual extra features (theatrical trailers, cast and crew credits, and production notes).
B000068UXF|4.0|Great performances. But this transfer to dvd is very poorly. Unlike what the cover may suggest it's not enhanced for 16:9 widescreen televisions. But what's even more sad is that the video is full of digital artefacts. Especially in the beginning of act three the dcor seems to have a life of it's own. It spoils a lot of your viewing pleasure. <BR>The sound is great.
B000069AUI|4.0|I was initially drawn to this album by the single &quot;clocks&quot;.  I was hopeful that the entire CD would include the sound and quality of the Coldplay singles I'd heard on the radio and was not disspointed.  A Rush Of Blood To The Head is laid back masterpiece well worth inclusion in your CD collection.

B00004Z459|5.0|In the late eighties / early nineties, FAITH NO MORE had come up with this fresh new sound: blending the heaviest form of rock ever, with funk / rap, and as far as I know, FAITH NO MORE was one of the first `heavy metal' bands to have a full-time keyboardist! This unique keyboard-laden, rap-filled high-energy hard-rock sound was new, seminal, and spawned a new generation of funk-rock acts shamelessly using the keyboards occasionally, the likes of which include KORN, LIMP BIZKIT, INCUBUS, to name a few and popular ones. However, none of these could match the energy of FAITH NO MORE; and with the splitting up of FAITH NO MORE, it seemed as if there was no one else to carry on this unique blend of music, once made so popular by this great band.<BR> <BR>Just when everything seemed lost, or \\"everything's (seemed) ruined\\" as the boys of FAITH NO MORE would put it, LINKIN PARK came along and saved the day! Amongst the myriads of funk-rock acts today, LINKIN PARK is the one act, which stands out, clearly and handsomely, as probably the only act, to come as close to the energy of FAITH NO MORE. <BR>     <BR>\\"HYBRID THEORY\\" is a power-packed dynamite, which, in its mere 37:53 minutes of playing time, blasts itself off with full fervor, releasing its complete potential grandiloquently, and with great style and panache. One track after another, each of the twelve songs is as fraught with the same amount of energy and punch as the previous one, and before you know, the album ends abruptly, not without leaving an obsessive effect of especially the hard-hitting rapping of MIKE SHINODA, and leaving the listener wanting more than just a thirty odd minutes of this addictive rock album.<br />The lyrics are not so great, and like every other rock outfit, these are about despair, and nothing else but despair - no one in rock can write despair and be reassuring at the same time, better than the spite-ridden wrath-filled king of hopelessness, Mr. TRENT REZNOR. However, there are a coupleof things about the lyrics, which really surprise me. First of all, there are absolutely no swear- words, especially no four-lettered `F' words, which generally litter every rock album; not that it makes a rock album any less worth listening to. Moreover, LINKIN PARK shares this quality with FAITH NO MORE, whom they so strongly resemble. Secondly, though the lyrics are no special, the delivery and the timing of the delivery of the words, by both the vocalists, is simply awesome and really commendable. <br />LINKIN PARK does not only have a unique combination of having two specialist vocalists and a full time DJ: a combination, never tried before in rock, but it also makes a very good use of this unique combination. `HYBRID THEORY' has everything that one could want in a rock album, and is perfect in every way.
0385509456|5.0|I had heard about this book on the Today show and it first peaked my interest, since I am the father of an autistic 5 year old.  During the first few pages, of course, I found many similarities with my son, and enjoyed seeing him through Christopher's perspective.  <br />I always think it is healthy to see persons with disabilities from their own view.  We all have quirks and \\"issues\\" and this book reminded me that we all see ourselves as \\"normal\\" from our vantage point.<br />After the first introduction to Christopher and the neighborhood I thought I was going to be disappointed that this was a bland recreation of Christopher's world with tried and true characters surrounding him.  But then, the story shifted and like the mysteries that Christopher enjoys so much, the story exploded with reality and intrigue.  Imperfections are found in all the characters which is a welcome relief from most \\"disability\\" tales, which made the journey through the story most enjoyable.<br />Besides my obvious interest in the subject matter -- don't feel like you have to have an interest in Autism to pick this one up -- it has enough going for it on its own.  But if you do know someone who is autistic then this is highly recommended!
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather Collection is the best ever, if you don't own it you should get it, 'cuz you know, it's good.
B000006TRV|5.0|No, The Wall is not some put-a-smile-on-your-face;make-you-feel-all-warm-and-fuzzy-inside kind of an album.  If you solely listen to music to feel good, or if you are of the opinion that all things artistic must have a happy ending then this work of Pink Floyd is not for you.  <br />However, if you have a real appreciation for reality - life is not fair, the good guys don't always win, and happiness is only one of the many emotions that humans experience - then you will appreciate Roger Water's exploration and expression of the more somber human emotions.  <br />Artistically, The Wall ranks solidly with other Pink Floyd works such as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  The operatic style of the album is fitting for both the lyrical content and the many musical layers and transitions.  While The Wall is often referred to as a \\"Rock Opera\\", it is very different from other so-called rock operas such as The Who's \\"Tommy\\".  It is probably more precise to refer to The Wall as a \\"Rock Requiem\\" rather than simply as a rock opera.<br />If you like the music of Pink Floyd and don't feel as if you have to listen to the likes of Tony Robbins 24x7 in order to keep from going off the deep end, then you will love the artistic genius that is The Wall.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Director Roman Polanski had much personal history to draw on, when he directed \\"The Pianist.\\" He spent his own childhood in Poland, and escaped from the Krakow Ghetto, although his mother, and other family members, perished in the Holocaust. Polanski makes this his most personal and powerful film to date, and deservingly won the Academy Award Oscar for Best Director.<br />\\"The Pianist\\" is the agonizing story of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's survival of the Nazi's destruction of Polish Jewry. The film begins in 1939, with Szpilman playing Chopin on the piano for Radio Warsaw, as the Germans bomb the city, and finally force him to stop playing. History has documented well what happened in Warsaw over the following two years - the Jewish ghetto was constructed and settled, racial laws were written and enforced, people died of starvation, illness, or Nazi murder. Then the \\"resettlement\\" roundups began. Szpilman was waiting at the Umshagplatz to be deported to Treblinka, with his family, when fate seemingly intervened, and he was spared. His survival story is a different kind of hell than others that I have seen or read about. Szpilman watches the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, and subsequent destruction, from the outside, looking in. Usually, accounts of the Jewish uprising are from former fighters, or survivors, who were inside the ghetto at the time. I can only wonder if Szpilman longed to join his fellow Jews and fight the Nazis, rather than remain in his solitary apartment overlooking the ghetto, with his own end unknown.<br />The story is told from a uniquely unsentimental point of view. I felt at times that Szpilman, brilliantly portrayed by Adrien Brody, had distanced himself from all emotion, except for the periods when he played the piano in his imagination, and listened to music in his head. Perhaps this detachment was the mechanism that allowed him to survive emotionally.<br />The well-written screenplay, by Ronald Harwood, was adapted from Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoirs published in 1946. During some of the movie's most emotional parts, there are amazing camera shots of snow falling, or leaves blowing across an empty street, or the snow covered ghetto ruins that look like the end of the world, with the only sound - Chopin's piano music. These film takes add emotion to the film, compensate for, and contrast well with Szpilman's emotional isolation.<br />There is a haunting scene, near the film's end, with Szpilman and a German officer, that still moves me to tears when I think about it.<br />The film is a remarkable in its sensitivity, and portrayal of one man's struggle to survive.

B00005JKZ3|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as much as the first one, mostly because of the way that the characters were making fun of themselves and society.  No, it's not a classic that's going to be around forever, but it is an amusing film that fulfills its greatest purpose--entertainment.  If you're looking for more than a couple of hours of escapism, you won't find it here.  It's not a &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; quality movie, but it's still fun.  Smith is good, Jones is good, and the dog's great.  The villains are somewhat weak and contrived, but they aren't the point here.  It's a lot of fun constantly being reminded that things as we see them are possibly not what we think they are, and wondering what we'd do if we found out that they aren't.  This movie is more about enjoying a movie experience, and if you come into it with your own expectations of what this movie should be, of course you'll be disappointed.  Just sit down and have fun with this one.
B00005JLTN|5.0|The Matrix series is unique in that it has something for everyone. Some enjoy the amazing car chases and enormous explosions, and others love it for the intellectual angle so precious few other movies even try and deliever these days. <br />This sequal does EXACTLY what it should. It links the first film to the third in an entertaining and efficient manner. Think about it: What trilogy has a 2nd piece that is the best, or even the second best of the three films? Star Wars, probably the biggest franchise of any, failed (in my opintion) miserably with \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". The Wachowski brothers have kept audiences guessing, and beyond some necessarily evil scenes (when Neo and Trinity get... intimate... and that stupid cave rave thing) to expound on some cliched imagery (specifically, when Neo gets off the elevator in Zion only to be greeted by hundreds of people).

B000002H4Q|3.0|&quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me&quot; contains some of the catchiest tunes The Cure ever recorded, as well as some of the most obscure.  It never quite seems to come together musically or lyrically, but I've ended up thinking that the lack of unity is all part of the game.  I'm still listening after all these years, and that means the band must've done something right.  <br />Unfortunately, the record company has done us no favors here--as the Music Fan from Daytona Beach pointed out in an earlier review.  A short, uptempo track called &quot;Hey You!&quot; was cut from the CD back in the days when CDs only held 74 minutes of music, and has never been reinstated.  (Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Tusk&quot; has suffered a similar fate on CD.)  Don't believe the editorial review on this page which states that this was one of the first albums intended for CD.  If it was, Robert Smith would not have made it too lengthy to fit onto one disc.  The truth is exactly the opposite:  This is one of the last major double albums of the vinyl era.  If you still have a turntable and you still have access to used vinyl, I suggest buying a copy so you can hear the whole thing.  <br />As for the music:  &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; is one of the most joyous, perfect pop songs ever recorded, and in fact, all of Side Three of the original vinyl is first-rate, with each of the five songs creating a completely different mood.  &quot;All I Want&quot; is based on a nasty guitar riff, &quot;Hot! Hot! Hot!&quot; is a frenetic slice of funk, &quot;One More Time&quot; is almost childlike in its dreamy simplicity, and &quot;Like Cockatoos&quot; is like a soundtrack to some sort of weird pagan ritual.  <br />Although the rest of the album is inconsistent, its length is necessary for the overall effect.  It creates a feeling of being inside a surreal world, where there is no up or down.  It's a mixture of fear and elation.  <br />I think &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me&quot; is a more developed, and more successful, version of what The Cure was trying to do with &quot;The Top&quot; three years earlier.  For beginners, I would still suggest starting with &quot;The Head on the Door,&quot; &quot;Disintegration,&quot; or &quot;Seventeen Seconds,&quot; but &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me&quot; will always have a place in any Cure fan's collection.  Not only is it an intriguing collection of songs, it is also a memento of the year 1987, when U2 and R.E.M. went from college radio to the mainstream, with The Cure putting themselves in a position to follow them two years later with the release of &quot;Disintegration.&quot;

B00004XOWM|1.0|I love rock music. When done properly it can be invigourating, challenging, energising, funky, emotive and thought-provoking. Fred Durst and co. clearly don't know how to do well.<br />With a ludicrous amount of swearing, lyrics whaich amount to little more than \\"I'm great so listen to me\\" or \\"the world is terrible\\", and music which often amounts to little mroe than thrashed guitar lines and out-of-place turntable work, it's rather hideous at times. <br />The hip hop overtones are also offputting, especially the second version of Rollin' and Boiler. Used properly turntables can add to rock music, but the rapping her eis unitellgent and negative.<br />The fact that this CD only averages 3 stars on here says it all - I'd deft you to find anythign else which has such consistantly poor reviws. Besides, a lot of the faovurable onces seem to be written by people half Durst's age (astonishingly he's not far short of 40, although his IQ is) and amount to little more than screaming fanboy views from typical teeange stoners.<br />Please, people, try to expand your minds beyond this. At the least, bands like Tool, System Of A Down and Weezer have some imagination, variety and musical structure to them, wheras the clasiscs such as Hendrix, Led Zep, Metallica, AC/DC and Iron Maiden will show you how to play a guitar properly.
B00005JLXE|4.0|although this review will never be read let me say my peace. I liked this film. I liked the dark and gothic view of Daredevil rather than the chipper happy Marvel induced Daredevil. I liked how they added the tale of the BULLSEYE vs. ELECTRA bit in this film from issue #181 of Daredevil comics. And to go off track for a sec...... Spiderman stinked to me. It wasn't dark, had hardly any action, the movie mistakes were easily spottiable and it was too happy. And Daredevil had no movie mistakes, more action and a rather decent plot. The only complaint is that the action needed to be a bit more stylish (hence MATRIX or BLADE).<BR>Some (or alot) of people seem to dislike this film cuz they either hate BEN AFFLECK or the Daredevil movie was not like the comics at all. Well WAKE UP! This is the 21 CENTURY! Me and alot of others want anti-heroes and darker and cooler movies. Not happy crap! If you want happy movies, watch BLACK & WHITE FILMS. So this is a good film. I hate BEN AFFLECK but he was not bad at all in this film!
B000084T18|2.0|Dr. Dre ahs done a lot for hip hop over the eyrs, with his classic albums both solo and in NWA,a dn the success of his proteges Snoop and Eminem. This, however, was a very bad call. This guy's rapping ability is almost non-existant, he just mumbles incoherently. <br />The songs aren't his own work, so I guess it's not his fault they're bland motonous and lyricaly immature, merely working off the new image of 'hip-pop' - where the social change, street-level rebellion and push for self-improvement are replaced by the worst of pimpz, gangstaz and gunz cliches.<br />Most of this guy's audience don't realise how cheap and lame it all is. 50 Cent merely gives rap a bad name while being a simple money-makng machine. I almost thing the guy should go back to the dealing, at least he was good at that.

The video is an insight into the bands live shows, how good they are and what a complete maniac Nick has grown to be (witch is not surprising from a man that is dubbed Rex Everything). The song however picks up on the harmony between Josh and Nick, aqnd proves them to be, not such an odd couple. Track four still gives the feeling that the band are pushing themselves to show there musicianship.<br />The albulm carrys on being more of the same until the 2nd single \\"Go with the flow\\". This stands out from the other tracks and melodically \\"flows\\" along with the rest of the albulm surprisingly well. <br />The albulm is the perfect scratch on QOTSAs' belt, and yes this is very homlely to people not assosiated with them, but it lacks the head filling riffs like \\"ode to clarrisa\\" and \\"tension head\\" as well as the wrenching \\"feel good hit of the summer\\" and the Legendary \\"Lost art of keeping a secret\\". This albulm is a lot cleaner but, somtimes grease is good...
B00006CXXU|5.0|I always said I wouldn't buy Christina's album because I didn't think I'd like it.  However, after seeing her in concert (I went to see Justin Timberlake, but to my surprise I ended up really enjoying Christina's show) I decided to buy the album.  I was surprised by how much I thoroughly enjoyed it!  There are several great songs.  Among the best in my opinion are Fighter, Dirrty, Can't Hold Us Down, Get Mine Get Yours, and Infatuation which are all uptempo songs that make you want to dance and sing along; Make Over, which reminds me of a 60's psychodelic song; and Walk Away which is a haunting, jazzy ballad.  I also love the Stripped Pt. 1 and Stripped Pt. 2 Interludes.  You can tell that each song is very personal to Christina and there is a wide variety of musical styles on the album.  I highly recommend this album - she has come a long way since her first album and it definitely shows.
B000002VC3|5.0|Eye in the Sky may be the most popular APP album.  It certainly has the Project's most played track that many have heard over and over without even knowing who the artist is.  I can always picture Michael Jordan trotting out on the court to the sound of \\"Sirius.\\"  Then there is the title track that tacks onto the opening instrumental which is just beautiful.  In fact, the entire first half of the album has a spiritually uplifting celestial feel.  One is just swept away by the vocals to these songs, especially Eric Woolfson's contributions.  My only complaint is how the wonderful simplicity of \\"Silence and I\\" is interrupted by a big orchestra sound in the middle.  It really disturbs the mood of the album.<br />The second half is not as strong.  There are two rather mundane tracks \\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned\\" and \\"Step By Step.\\" \\"Psychobabble\\" is also not one of the better tracks, but it has a powerful, catchy verse.  The album, however, ends with one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard: the dirge \\"Old and Wise.\\" The lyrics sound like those of one who is dying yet it sports the line \\"I'll miss you when I go.\\"  One usually doesn't think of the dead missing the living (it's usually thought of as the other way around).  It is a very powerful track.  The Best of the APP Volume 1 has a slightly extended closing saxophone to this track which makes the song even better.  Eye in the Sky is not perfect (check out APP's Ammonia Avenue for perfection), but I could never give this gem less than 5 stars.  It's one of those \\"essential\\" rock albums.
B00005RYL9|4.0|There is enough written about the film, so I am just going to state my views of the technicalities of this version of the DVD since I couldn't find a review about the Immortal Edition. <BR>I must say that the picture is much improved from the director's cut edition. However do not expect it to be state of the art. You can still see at times the grains but it is much more superior that the director's cut. <BR>In terms of sound, the DVD boasts the DTS-ES system. Now that is state of the art. However, since this is an old film the sound cannot be compared to the Gladiator and Seven discs. <BR>This is the best version of Highlander that is available. I should know I have the director's cut version. A bit pricey though. I think for that price they should at least include a \\"making\\" documentary. All in all, I would truly recommend it to my friends if the price within the region of USD 20. I think we can do away with the Queen CD!
B000002VCU|5.0|The Turn of a Friendly Card is one of the APP's most solid &quot;concept&quot; albums (about gambling, if you will).  &quot;Time&quot; doesn't fit quite as well with this concept as the other tracks unless it's about one's time (or life) being stolen from loved one's by the gambling disease.  The song is so beautiful and celestial, however, it is hard to think of it in such mundane terms.  Besides the two instrumental tracks (&quot;The Gold Bug&quot; and &quot;The Ace of Swords&quot;)being not as memorable as the instrumentals on Eye in the Sky, there is nothing weak on this album.  &quot;Games People Play&quot; is one of my all-time favorite APP tracks.  It is a fun rocker you can't help but sing along to.  The title track is simple and beautiful with some of Woolfson/Parsons' best lyrics (&quot;There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains and a wheel of perpetual motion...&quot;).<br />The tracks on the second half of the album seem to be meant to tie in together as the track listing above suggests, however I think the title track and &quot;Nothing Left To Lose&quot; would have sounded better just standing on their own.  &quot;Nothing Left To Lose,&quot; like &quot;Time,&quot; is another beautiful Eric Woolfson-sung track.  My only qualm is the hard rocking ending to it (with the music from &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;), which I find rather distracting. Still, it is behind Ammonia Avenue as my second favorite APP album (just above Eye in the Sky and Gaudi).  &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Games People Play&quot; alone make this album worth its weight in &quot;gold bugs&quot; (or casino chips).
B0000687VH|5.0|Este CD es antologico, pues captura la esencia del sonido de ese muro tridimensional de musica que era GFR con sus tres originales integrantes. Notese los solos del batero Brewer que para esa epoca - y aun ahora - son vitales y muy originales. Los riffs de guitarra son contundentes propios del \\"dedos de piedra\\" Farner y reposan sobre un bajo de Schacher envolvente que aniquila cualquier vacio en ritmos y sonido. Este show del 71 es un buen complemento al \\"Caught in the Act\\" para felicidad de los fans.<BR>Warning: En Hispanoamerica estamos esperando un DVD de este SUPERGRUPO....ON TIME!
B00005JM09|5.0|It seems that the script writers for T3 listened to the old Elvis Presley song. T3 is a non-stop,  overwhelming, amazing actiong movie. From the beginning to the last scene, the viewer stands in the audience with an open jaw. Thankfully, the producers chose not to \\"complement\\" the good action sequences with a \\"makes-you-think\\" plot. There wouldn't be room for this.<br />But I'm not saying T3 is a stupid movie. It's not. I enjoyed all 109 minutes of it. T3 concentrates on the character of John Connor, after his mother has died. John Connor is now played by Nick Stahl, and he is MUCH better than Edwar Furlong. For the first time we can see John Connor as the true leader of the humans, not an annoying kid who likes to rob money-machines (But if you want to watch scenes from the future and the war against the machines you'll be disappointed). Claire Daines is another touch of talent in the movie.<br />But let's now concentrate on the two robots of T3. Amazingly, Arnold Schwarzenegger was able to deliver his best performance ever. Forget his recent [stuff], like 6th day, End of days, etc. Schwarzie's T-101 gets better every each time a new Terminator is released. And some funny momonets, too. \\"Talk to my hand\\"... fantastic. And blonde bombshell Kristanna Loken. Where did girl come from? The perfect \\"robotess\\". Cold as ice and hard as steel.<br />Sure, some of the scenes are too convenient (Claire Daines knows how to fly that specific airplane, for an example), some of them plainly wrong (Schwarzie's robot displaying emotions, no matter how much \\"psychology\\" he has in him) and director Jonathan Mostow, although competent in the action scenes, does not try to innovate in his job. His style reminded me  of  Tony Scott. But  T3's proposal clearly was to be a good action movie, and a bridge to a probable T4. Under these assumptions, T3 is excellent.<br />Grade 8.8/10
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Good is Firefly.  As other reviews have mentioned, it is possibly the best written show that was ever on TV.  A Space Opera Western that simple cannot be compared to another show, including Joss Whendon's Buffy and Angel.  That is unless you compare it's outstanding quality and originality.  <br />The Bad is that we may never know what happened.  Both the characters and the storylines are so intriguing that you just have to know more.  How did Zoe and Wash fall in love?  What are River's powers?  The guys with the blue hands? What's the Rev's story?<br />The Stupid would be Fox.  [People].  What more can be said except surely such short-sightedness will eventually bite them in the...  My goodness, the pre-order of the series sold out in days.  The show is still making fans thanks to downloads and tape sharing.  Yep, [people].<br />So buy, watch, laugh, cry, enjoy, and keep hoping for more.
B000002TQV|4.0|Ok, you can just ignore cranky reviewer's supposed review and buddy you don't deserve a best friend. lets just stick to the facts here, this is not stale punk rock, this is some real music. radiohead are real music, they create real, heartfelt albums. you can't diss on these guys, they are a true band. ignorance is not needed.
0385486804|5.0|This book kept me turning the pages.  It is amasing how the author was able to track this ypung mans activities.
B000002VEP|5.0|Inspired by the life and work of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi, who conceived the Sagrada Familia Cathedral in Barcelona, 'Gaudi' is an amazing album.  In fact tracks like the 8:44 &quot;La Sagrada Familia,&quot; &quot;Closer to Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; (the latter two sung by one of the greatest vocalists ever, Eric Woolfson) are almost too perfect.  I find myself thinking, &quot;this music is way above my music listening sophistication...now where's my copy of Turn of a Friendly Card...&quot; Then there is the addicting beat of &quot;Too Late,&quot; the more mainstream &quot;Standing on Higher Ground,&quot; and the fun rocker &quot;Money Talks.&quot; There are only 7 tracks on this album, but they are all quality.  Even the instrumental at the end ties up the album very well.  Aside from Freudiana, Gaudi is Eric Woolfson's last album with Parsons and the &quot;Project&quot; has never been the same since. One can only imagine what could have been had this brilliant duo continued. No APP collection should be without this rather overlooked masterpiece.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a dream, something wonderful and hazy, beyond reality.<br />The story seems so haphazard, yet fully realized. The maturing and progression of Chihiro is tangible and real as she learns that action speaks louder than words. Struggling to free her parents, Chihiro stands out like a beacon amongst characters more concerned with their own wellbeing. <br />Spirited Away is a truly special because it makes the impossible seem impossibly real. Experiencing childlike wonder as an adult is a rare experience, seemingly limited to this movie and little else. <br />Animation, storytelling and Miyazaki at their very finest.
0679735909|1.0|Once I start a book, I always finish it.  Always.  Once I am more than 10 pages into a novel, I feel guilty if I don't follow through.  It's a huge pet peeve of mine. <br />I didn't finish this book.  <br />I tried!  Trust me, I tried!  I had heard such amazing things about it.  I was convinced that it was going to be one of my all time favorite books.  Everything about it seemed something that I would love!  The time period, the history, the romance... everything. <br />Unfortunately, that was not the case. I wanted to finish it, I did, but reading it was like a chore!  I have never felt like that about a book, ever.  Yet I felt obligated to keep reading.  I kept thinking about all the awards it had won and how many people raved about it, and how I didn't really appreciate good literature unless I read and fell in love with this book.  I kept telling myself eventually I was going to just love it, so I kept going.  I kept going until I was well over page 200.  <br />I never loved it. <br />I don't really know how to rate this novel because I didn't actually finish it, and even writing that, admitting that fact to the world, I feel bad.  I feel as though I am not quite as literary as I had presumed.  Maybe I just don't know good writing, but I felt as though I was reading a history textbook.  A BORING history textbook.  <br />Can someone please explain to me what is so fantastic about this novel? I really thought I would love it.  I wanted to love it. I tried to love it.  <br />Instead I was bored out of my mind.
0060930187|4.0|For anyone who has lived with/through clinical depression or any for of mental illness, The Bell Jar is a must read.  Few authors have been successful at capturing this horrifying illness so poignantly, yet realistically.  The reader is invited to experience the throngs of depression as it takes hold and tortures the individual so intensely, that for many the only way to end the emotional pain is self-destruction.  Although suicide is not the answer, it exists as the one sure way to end the misery of everday existence.<BR>'How tragic that Esther is freed from her demons and Sylvia, herself, was not.  This work is a masterful at exposing depression as an ugly and debilitating illness.
B000002UJQ|5.0|ok first off let's clear up a few things. unlike someone who can't get his facts straight (cranky reviewer) radiohead do. and they use those facts and make some of the best music today. these guys kill duran duran, duran duran is just an obsolete 80's band pretty much. they got absolutely NOTHING on radiohead. I can't believe how some people can be so ignorant and say that radiohead is terrible, hey if have good taste in music you will like radiohead. and this cd is one of their finest, and that's the definite truth.
B00005JM09|1.0|I was lucky enough to get a decent copy of this movie before it came out in the cinema.I have to say i was a bit of a letdown,the story was weak but the action was good,i also have to say the movie wasn't long enough,T2 was over 2 hours long this movie wasonly 1 hour and 40 minutes.If james cameron had directed it it would have been a smash like T2.
0316666343|2.0|I completely agree that this is not a &quot;feel good&quot; book, and I disagree that this represents a typical teenager. My best friend died when I was thirteen and I did not relate to any of the situations that took place in the book. This book seems as a complete misrepresentation of youth and death. The supernatural part of the book was original, yet completely dark and depressing. I would not recommend this book.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I have seen this movie twice now.The second time was more for the score than anything. I was so impressed with Klaus badelt  score for pirates. The music fit the movie great. Very fun and hard driven at times.I love the major motif that klaus uses throughout the score. I had to go right out and buy this cd.When it is comes on dvd/vhs I am positively adding this movie to my library. Lovers of film scores will have to add this cd to their collectoin. It ranks up there with likes of lord of the rings and harry potter. The score still gives me chills. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown digs deeper into the origins of Jesus and religion in &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot;  Borrowing heavily from &quot;Holy Blood Holy Grail,&quot; Brown semi-fictionalizes information regarding the true source of the Holy Grail in this latest thriller.  With enough plot twists to start his own pretzel factory, Brown shocks and awes with deft precision in this wonderful mystery.  While I wasn't personally impressed with his previous work, &quot;Angels and Demons,&quot; after reading &quot;...Da Vinci...&quot;, I may very well return and reread his other work.  But this one is strongly recommended!
B00004XONN|5.0|abbot's not like cranky, he does use his brain. but unfortunately for him, he is all wrong. This is a masterpiece of Radiohead's, they outdid themselves once again with this cd. The lyrics (if you actually LISTEN/READ them, unlike some) are the usual perfection, I just don't know how Thom does it. Kid A is just awesome, and it just proves even further that beyond a shadow of a doubt, Radiohead have become legendary.
0312305060|2.0|One of the worst books I have read all year.  This novel never picked up and was extremely contrived and moved at the speed of sludge.  You would be much better off purchasing Mrs. Dalloway.
B00000DGUY|5.0|This album is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Dire Straits. The tone and quality of the songs is wonderful. Once again, Dire Straits proves once again that they are the Sultans of Swing.
B00005JLU1|5.0|I had seen this movie in the movie theatre as a teenager and it Rocked!!  That started my enjoyment of Johnny Depp films.  I never watched 21 Jump Street until this movie.  The cast is so funny.  The TV version I seen added parts that I had not seen in the theatre but cut out parts that were extremely funny.  Now I have a copy of the TV version plus the video version which was what I seen in at the movies.  It would be really great to get on DVD with both versions together (played together or both on one disc).  To this day I can sing every song (I had the soundtrack before the videos) and say most of the words with everyone.  It is a funny movie that just won't get old watching over and over!!  In fact I watched it today.  I just can't say enough about how hilarious this movie.  It is the \\"bad boy\\" falling in love with the \\"good girl\\" just like \\"Grease\\" and other great movies like that. I think they did a great job at making it look like the 50s in the movie.  It has been my favorite movie since I seen it.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I absolutely love the Pirates Of The Caribbean soundtrack!  It was wonderfully done!  When I hear the music I know exactly what scene it is in the movie! I have seen the movie six times already! If you loved the movie, you'll love the soundtrack!!  Buy it!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000092ZYX|5.0|this album was definitely worth the time waiting, Radiohead have come back with a vengance, and this time it's getting political. I guess people from west michigan just don't know good music when they hear it. but im here to state a clear and honest fact, every song on here, as you probably would have guessed already, is not skippable. well, i mean it is, cd-player wise anyways. but how can you skip through one and go to the next is what I mean. With this album, you just can't. Radiohead definitely contributes much to actual unglamorized music, and that's something we can all be thankful for.
0316666343|4.0|One of the few books that is deserving of its popularity, Lovely Bones has an opaque quality about it that is truly haunting.  It is an absorbing book worth the time spent to turn the pages.<br />A girl is the victim of a violent and tragic death and she watches from heaven the earth she left behind.
B00005JMCR|5.0|I went in thinking this was \\"A rental\\" But I was very happily suprised. This is the best one yet. It was funny, with that wonderfull boy-teen humour we have come to love from the cast. The cast was smaller but there was no shortage of suprises and down right laughs. The clips did not take away from the movie at all. Go see this.
B00005OM4N|2.0|I am not a Britney hater, but i was a bit let down by Britney's 3rd album. Undeniably, there has been a style change to appease the critics, but it does still include the bubblegum pop that was once typical of Britney.<br />There are three categories present on this album:<br />1     THE NEW BRITNEY STYLE<BR>The woman Britney is seducing us both lyrically and musically with the songs I'm A Slave 4 U *****, Boys ** and What It's Like To Be Me **. Nice try Britney, but I don't want you. I Love Rock 'N' Roll *** is kind of different, but we haven't heard anything like that from her.<br />2     CLASSICS<BR>The upbeat Baby One More Time type songs are represented by Overprotected ***** (in my opinion the best song on the album), Anticipating ***, Cinderella **** and Bombastic Love ****. And I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman **** (a.k.a. I Like Sweet Candy, But Not Yet Vegetables) Enough stuff to suit all children's souls.<br />3    ... AND THE LET-DOWNS<BR>The terrible songs Lonely *, Let me Be ** and That's Were You Take Me *, are not worth the name filler. On non-us versions the 'track' I Found You * is included, a song you will listen at most 1 time, I hope.<br />Conslusion: Only buy this if you like the singles, but don't expect to find anything more than those.
0375422307|5.0|The subject matter is brave while the illustrations are unconventional and smart. In PERSEPOLIS, Marjane recounts her childhood of growing up in Tehran during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. There is no doubt that Marjane has experienced more during her nine years than many have during their entire life in this country. Being raised by two forward-thinking parents, Marjane is provided a progressive glimpse into the political and cultural events occurring around her in Iran. But she is different than most Iranian children. She rebels against wearing the veil, is a fan of Western pop culture, and speaks out against fundamental doctrines during religion class. It is amazing that she (or her parents) weren't seriously reprimanded for their actions and beliefs. Marjane even attends a demonstration with her parents against the wave of religious fundamentalism engulfing Iran.<br />I truly loved PERSPOLIS because it provided a rare glimpse of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. I learned much about this very different culture while empathizing with her unique family. I feel as if I know them personally. Marjane's illustrations tell a thousand words. They are simple yet innovative and clever. I can't wait to read the next installment in this series and hope it is published soon. Enjoy!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Being a guy I think that this is a good actoin movie.  Tobey Maguire's body was so hot after being bitten by the spider. Just look at his abs, and muscles.  As for his face, it is kind of dorky still, I guess he is sort of a nerdy hunk.  It's just too bad that I heard that he just did it for the movie. Well I guess I will have to see this movie over and over again.
B0000399WI|5.0|I believe that,like good friends, we can count the truly great movies on the fingers of our hands. This picture is in my top 5 of all time. The performances alone, of all the cast, not just Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, are superb. For me,it is the voice over of Mr Freeman that elevates the different moods and tones over the course of the story. Far from turning this into another jail break fiasco, we are left to wonder at the endurance of the human spirit and grieve at its frailty. There is no glorification of the physical violence, no homage to the &quot;tough guy&quot; routine, offered - rather a slow subtle appreciation for the ability to survive and to adapt to a hostile environment. Morgan Freeman's closing soliloquy of &quot;I hope........&quot; is not the atypical Hollywood triumphant ending but, a considered dose of reality. Please G-d, there wont be a sequel!
B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles' &quot;Revolver&quot; is without a doubt the best album put out by The Beatles or anybody. I love all 14 songs on this album, but the highlights on this album are &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;I'm only Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Love you to&quot;, &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, &quot;For No One&quot;, and the best track on the album &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, which has definitley had some influence on today's music.<br />Paul, John , George and Ringo were just four young men from Liverpool who became musical geniuses. This is a great album from a great band and no one will ever make quite the impact that they made. If you are just getting into The Beatles, this album is a good place to start. Then pick up these other Beatles albums:<br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<BR>Magical Mystery Tour<BR>The White Album<BR>Abbey Road<BR>Let it Be <BR>The Beatles: 1962-1966<BR>The Beatles: 1967-1970<BR>The Beatles Antholgy 1<BR>The Beatles Antholgy 2<BR>The Beatles Antholgy 3<BR>NOTE: I have heard these albums but unfortunately I do not own my own copies.
6305508550|4.0|Throughout the past several years many co-workers have recommended this movie as a funny glance into the absurdity of working in an office. Unfortunately until recently I've had little luck in finding it available to rent (a clear indication of its popularity). Now that I have finally watched OFFICE SPACE I appreciate and condone all the positive reviews this movie has generated. There is no doubt that anyone who has worked in an office environment will relate to OFFICE SPACE. This movie highlights loud and obnoxious cubicle neighbors, office equipment that fails to work properly, and arrogant bosses. I couldn't help relating to the entire movie. I think the funniest part includes the entire skit regarding Milton and the red stapler. OFFICE SPACE is pure comedy. An intelligent low-budget film that will be a classic for years to come. Don't miss this one!
B00009L1TA|4.0|Basic's plot twists were crazy at the least.  Despite that fact the movie is still very watchable.  I thought that it was very entertaining and still keeps me thinking.  John Travolta is convincing as &quot;Hardy&quot;, while the others try a bit too hard to get into their characters.
068484267X|5.0|After having read this Frank McCourt's incredible story, I honestly feel like I know little Frankie, like he has confided in me. The careful, thorough (but not overdone) detailing in this memoir is superb. <br />The situation traces young Francis McCourt and his brothers living in poverish Ireland during the 1940's. Frank chronicles his entire childhood..the hunger, the loss of the his innocence, school, and the camraderie between the McCourt brothers. The brotherhood is incredibly amusing and the highlight of the book. <br />This book is great. The vividness that Frank uses to describe his own history is amazingly entertaining. If you appreciate character depth and human emotions, this a great book for you. <br />The most astounding aspect is how Mr. McCourt is able to describe himself prior to his loss of innocence and convey the innocence within the diatribe.
B000062Y98|5.0|Having got into Iced Earth in recent years I decided that I ought to a buy a Blind Guardian CD (given the affiliation) and picked this CD on sale.  I stuck this into my CD player and after one listen thought that it was lucky that I did not pay full price!  It was initially just \\"too much\\", hit too many senses and was not very digestible.  <br />A couple of days later I thought I'd try again.  Maybe my mind was clear but the absolute awesome drumming hit me.  Boy can Thomas Stauch play.  The first four songs just came together Precious Jerusalem, Battlefield, the wonderful Under the Ice and Sadly Sings Destiny are just four awesome metal songs that burnt a hole in my CD player for weeks with some truly kick... drumming (OK I got embarrassed a few times being caught playing \\"air drums\\").  <br />The next track the Maiden and the Mistrel Knight for me is the only flat spot of the real album (The bonus track Mies del Dolor was another track that I could give a miss to) otherwise I consider the rest of the CD to be brillant.  But if you want my opinion (I suppose you do if you are bothering to read this) the best track is in the rest of the CD, the song - Age of Innocence. Kursch's vocals and feel in this song is amazing.  <br />Hansi, Andre, Marcus and Thomas I salute you for doing a truly progressive metal album that dared copy the title of Queen's masterpiece and a very funny Marx Bros movie!  I also thank you for making it one of the few sale CDs that I have bought that I did not decide to convert as a frisbee to play with my three year old child!
B00005K3OT|3.0|The movie starts off in the winter of 1959, at the quiet and tranquil French village, where the inhabitants live there lives as quietly as possible. Until one day, driven by fate and a strange wind, Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her duaghter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) arrive in town. The villagers are rightly very curious about the strangers but when Vianne opens a chocolatier, the town's mayor (Alfred Molina) warns off the people against the 'evil'. But even when giving out warnings and instilling a fear for such temptations, the mayor cannot stop the villagers' attraction to not only the chocolatier but the outwardly friendly and irresistable Vianne. Vianne little by little shows the villagers what it means to not only enjoy life, but live it. <br />&quot;Chocolate&quot; has gotten a total of 5 Oscar nominations: Best Picture (David Brown, Kit Golden, Leslie Holleran), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Juliette Binoche), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Judi Dench), Best Music Original Score (Rachel Portman), and Best Writing (Robert Nelson Jacobs). <BR> <BR>First off I must say that the acting done by such an all-star cast is superbly done. Notably Juliette Binoche, with her beauty and charming accnet, is vibrant in her role as the woman Vianne who can't help but be different from everyone else. Alfred Molina also handles his character with what seems like the greatest of ease. Sort of the bad guy in the movie, but can't help loving him by the end of the movie. There's Judi Dench as a elderly woman made an outcast by her own daughter (played by Carrie-Ann Moss you won't believe as the same Trinity we know and love!). There's also Lena Olin who acts out her character of a battered wife to perfection, Leslie Caron in a role you can hardly recognize, and the young priest played by Hugh O'Conor (there's one scene where he sings and dances to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; which is very cute!). And of course I mustn't forget Johnny Depp as Roux, the Irish gypsy who falls for Vianne. Unfortunately he had a very small role in the film but was an adorable match for Juliette Binoche. Of course he could have worked on his accent a bit since it comes and goes often.<br />As for the movie itself, the plot is nothing too complicated or too original. In fact, some like me might find many similarities to the Disney movie &quot;Pollyana&quot;. There's an outcast who ultimately though reaches to each and everyone in the town. There's a kind of 'bad guy' who chooses what kind of sermons will be preached. <br />The reason for my 3 stars is because I thought that besides the marvelous acting, the movie itself felt a bit slow and nothing remarkable. And most of all, whoever decided to categorize this movie as a romantic/comedy must have not really read the script. The romance is more like a subplot and &quot;Chocolat&quot; is more like a drama than a comedy. Sure, there are a few moments where you can chuckle or even laugh a bit. But no a laugh-out loud movie at all.<br />So in conclustion, &quot;Chocolat&quot; is a sweet movie which flows along at an even pace. A film to watch when you have a few hours to spare where you don't have to concentrate that much. Oh, and a bit of trivia. Johnny Depp plays guitar in this movie in three scenes, and also does on one song on the soundtrack.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Tobey Maguire's body is so hot after being bitten by the spider.  It's just too bad that I heard that he just did it for the movie.  Well I guess I will have to see this movie over and over again.
0940322897|4.0|I didn't look forward to trying this book---memoirs of childhood seldom do much for me---but there being so little Stendhal out there in translation, I couldn't overlook it.  Well, long book tho it is, H.B. is very readable and a lot of fun for those who love Stendhal's style and persona.  Chatty, honest, quirky (all those little maps!), skipping around madly, with the strange mix of irony and idealism that makes Stendhal so &quot;modern,&quot; this is an enjoyable book for &quot;the happy few.&quot;  I doubt there are many books like it---Rousseau's confessions feel much more polished, &amp; hence less &quot;real,&quot; than Stendhal's book does.  (Of course I'm agnostic on how honest S. really is---but it's a good book, true or not!)
0767836286|2.0|All the friends' opinions were positive. The leading cast added a sense of insurance. The name of the director was without any doubt promising. Despite the demanding label of &quot;political thriller&quot;, having taken into consideration all the ingredients above, I was convinced that Arlington Road would offer me an enjoyable time.<br />I admit that I finished viewing the movie with a feeling of disappointment and disbelief. To be fair, there is not doubt that Arlington Road provides a great dosage of suspense throughout its duration. But if you make the mistake and try to think of what you just saw, after the end titles, everything seems to fall apart.<br />The basic character of our story is Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges). He is working as a professor of political history, with terrorism being its main focus. This, combined with the loss of his wife caused by a wrong judgment by FBI, renders him particularly sensitive to relevant stimuli. We can sense from the beginning that his fragile psyche will play an important role as the story evolves. After a strong opening sequence we see Faraday developing friendly relations with his new neighbors. Until the day an unexpected event puts doubts in his clouded mind. The question is clear: Are his neighbors involved in a terrorist group? That was it. Arlington Road now resorts to a series of easy clichés. Its obvious purpose is to surprise the viewer with the known plot twist of the neighbor who is not as innocent as we thought at the beginning - or could he be innocent, after all?<br />Tim Robbins gives a satisfactory performance in the role of the mysterious neighbor. On the other hand, Jeff Bridges, whose role as the &quot;Dude&quot; in Big Lebowski was absolutely amazing, here constantly gave me an impression of being over the top: his performance featured numerous hysteric reactions and grimaces. Some viewers may explain them based on Faraday's unstable mental condition; nevertheless they failed to convince me.<br />Director Mark Pellington does a more than adequate job with the script he has in his hands. Still, he is capable for a lot more things as revealed by his next and undoubtedly better creation, Mothman Prophecies.<br />I will conclude with a short comment regarding the highly praised film's closing sequence. Without revealing anything, here is what crossed my mind when watching it: Each of the terrorists should have had at least 3 Ph.D. degrees in Psychology. Only such collected knowledge would enable them to predict with the shown accuracy the reactions of so many people on so many occasions. If that was not the case, then I hope that they purchased a few lottery tickets the same day, since their success would have been certain!
0375422307|5.0|It's a great story and I won't spend as much time praising the book since every other review does that. The few things that got under my skin were.<BR>1.  She implies that Iran was somehow responsible for Iraqi invasion that's simply not true.<BR>2.  She accuses Iran of using chemical weapons, during the entire war Iraq used chemical weapons using US intel (Thanks Rummie) Iran never had/used any chemical weapons.<BR>3.  She totally ignores the fact that the socialists/MKO fought on the side of Saddam.<BR>4.  She ignores Khomeni, and I guess that's a smart thing, she probably would have had a price on her head if she had mentioned him directly.<br />I lived in one of those border towns she talks about and lived through the early Iraqi bombings and later the Scud missile attacks.  I've walked through the insanly large cemetaries that were created as the result of the war.  Her description of life during the war is spot on.  I look forward to reading her next book.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Cruel Intentions changed the drama category a lot.  For the way times have changed for the 21st century.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is as cruel as they get, while Reese Witherspoon is short and sweet.  As for Ryan Phillippe, well he showed his behind as usual.  The movie is a great erotic thriller, as you would expect.  But don't be surprised to see a twist here or there, as they are known to happen.
B00005OM5L|5.0|A masterpiece of a concert video/DVD. Eric plays his heart out on a rainy day during an outdoor concert. The camera work is excellent, especially for those who appreciate seeing Eric's fretwork and picking techniques. The sound quality is also excellent, especially if you will play this DVD through home theatre. This is the best &quot;Slowhand&quot; live video. The outstanding camerawork puts you in the front row. In addition,  anyone learning guitar will appreciate and understand Eric's legandary status when they see this video.
B0000013G9|4.0|Ahh, yes.... one more bomb from the past, which is to say 'da bomb.'  TLC surprised a lot of critics who disregarded their debut (but still quite successful) &quot;Oohh... On The TLC Tip&quot;.  With singles such as &quot;What About Your Friends&quot;, and &quot;Baby Baby Baby&quot;, airplay was guarenteed.<br />The sophomore album was even better; disregarding the pointless Prince remake, all of the singles &quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;Red Light Special&quot;, &quot;Waterfalls&quot; slammed home on the low-rent bass tip, and the delivery and production were second-to-none.<br />Much better than the follow-up &quot;Fanmail&quot;, and a cornerstone of 90s soul.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Excellant sound score!  Listening to it is almost as exciting as the movie.  The music creeps up your spine, well worth the price to add to your collection! A+++
B000002UJQ|5.0|I only recently got into Radiohead and so I bought this album as it was on the recommended list at my local store and I was not disappointed. I've been a Pink Floyd fan for a long time and the grandious sweeps and the humanist message in this cd truly tips its hat to the Floyd. Pink Floyd were the greatest band to do orchestral epics and Radiohead are truly heirs to their throne. This cd is in my opinion the greatest of its kind since Dark Side of the Moon.
0671027344|4.0|Like many of the readers below, I read this book in a few hours after borrowing it last night for no other reason than the qwerkiness of it's title.  I'm not going to talk about the story because there's plenty of that already here, but I will say that I was quickly drawn into this character, \\"Charlie,\\" and couldn't help but continue reading until I was finished.  <br />I can readily identify with some of what the character is going through, (which is probably what drew me to the title), but there's a great deal more here than I expected and the surprise ending adds a whole new level to a book that otherwise deals with various serious topics from what almost seems a casual, matter of fact, speculative and completely objective point of view. <br />I do know someone with similar life experiences to \\"Charlie,\\"  and was left at the end of the book feeling as if I understood them a little better and wondering if the point of Mr. Chbosky's story was not so much whether or not there are \\"perks\\" associated with \\"being a wallflower\\" as there are potential skeletons in everyone's closet that would best be dealt with directly rather than hidden from our own inner-view.<br />This book is very well written and I came to Amazon hoping to find more by it's author.  Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be anything else, so for those of you similarly looking, I'd like to recommend anything by Nick Hornby, (High Fidelity, Being Good & About a Boy), the first author to get me reading non-stop again since I first read Stephen King's \\"Christine\\" back in 1984.
078322933X|4.0|There's not a whole lot I can do to expand on the reviews posted already, except that this film surprised a lot of people in the film industry by it's relative success at the box office.<br />You have to give props to Mark Wahlberg who's inspired psychopathic performance belies his acting experience--which wasn't much at the time of this film's release.  You're convinced by the end that you've been taken for a capable thrill-ride, however skimpy the budget.<br />James Foley does a good job assembling the cast, which includes current box office sweetheart Reese Witherspoon, Amy Brenneman, and particularly Alyssa Milano, who completely overshadows any sex appeal emitted by the lead.
B00009RDG8|5.0|I am a pretty big Tommy Lee Jones fan. I think his sarcastic, quick-talking acting persona is brilliant and has worked in just about every movie he's made, Especially in The Fugitive, The Men in Black movies, and surprisingly this movie, where he is hunting down Benicio del toro's character to put a stop to his murderous battle-field driven insanity. The fight scenes where their two characters were going at each others throats like savages trained to kill were wicked. I want to learn to fight like that.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I've ever seen a sci-fi film more intersting, moving and exciting than this. Christian Bale's performance is extraordinary and that alone worth to whatch it.<BR>You can't miss it! AMAZING!!
B000001FS3|4.0|U2 finally found what they've been looking for. Grammys for their THE JOSHUA TREE album. The album sold seven million copies in 1987,the year it was released. A worldwide tour followed the release of this album inspiring RATTLE AND HUM,both the movie and the follow-up album. Live versions of I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR(with a gospel choir) and BULLET THE BLUE SKY appeared on RATTLE AND HUM. The band dedicated THE JOSHUA TREE to their friend Greg Carroll,who died in 1986 at only age 25 or 26. The album notes give his birth year as 1960.
B00005IC2H|5.0|When I saw Vanilla Sky for the first time, &quot;Svefn G Englar&quot; actually didn't stand out to much....probably because the movie was so surreal and dreamy, much like the music of Sigur Ros.<br />One day at school, i decided to download some music off the vanilla sky soundtrack, and this was the only one I ended up getting. I couldn't stop listening to it. Every little nuance in the music just blends together 100%. It feels like your in a dream, a fantasy almost...everything just seems so wonderful and beautiful, but you cant help feeling down because it seems to good to be true, to good to be real. To the reviewer below me...yes, they are from Iceland, but I believe they actually created their own language for their songs. Words you've never heard before and probablly will never hear again.<br />Its probably some of the most beautiful music my ears have ever heard, and I am a musician serious about knowing my art as much as humanly possible. No need to do write-ups for each track here...they are all wonderful. My favorite is still &quot;Svefn..&quot;, though.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy one of the best albums of the new millenium.
B000002IST|4.0|WE CAN'T DANCE was Genesis' third biggest-selling album,the other two being 1983's self-titled GENESIS and 1986's INVISIBLE TOUCH. Take notice that there is no title track on this album. The similarly titled song is called I CAN'T DANCE. That was a big hit next to NEVER A TIME,HOLD ON MY HEART and NO SON OF MINE. HOLD ON MY HEART is played on many jazz radio stations nationwide. This album was drummer-lead vocalist Phil Collins' most recent. He has quit Genesis,which was originally a quintet,since this album was released. Collins recorded and released four solo albums since this one. The tour promoting this album inspired two follow-up live albums,THE WAY WE WALK,VOLUME 1,THE SHORTS, released in November 1992 and VOLUME 2,THE LONGS,released in February 1993.
0062513346|3.0|Unfortunately, I don't think this book is as great as The Alchemist or Veronica Decides to Die. In general, I am a great admirer of Paolo Coelho's work. I enjoy the simplicity of his style a lot and the topics he chooses for his novels. But while this book is interesting and challenging, it is too mystical for my taste.<br /><br />The book is even more fantasy oriented than the Alchemist, introducing us into an unbelievable world of angels and saints. Here, the author sets himself on a journey to see and talk to his guardian angel. He is accompanied by his wife, who balances Paolo's faith, as she is skeptical about her husband's practices and faiths.<br /><br />We are introduced into an occult world, a context full of mystical rituals, some of them quite frightening. In the Mojave Desert, Paolo meets the Valkyries, a band of bold women dressed in leather riding on motorbikes, who spread the word of angels.<br /><br />Despite the many unbelievable experiences which give you the feeling that the book is only for the &quot;initiated ones&quot;. I still believe it is enchanting; a lot of this charm comes from the fact that is it very personal.<br />I recommend this book only to the very mystical personalities.
B000001FS6|4.0|The success of U2's THE JOSHUA TREE album prompted the band to record RATTLE AND HUM with filming a documentary movie. We take notice of a photo of Elvis Presley behind the band in one of the album photos. The first track HELTER SKELTER,a Lennon-McCartney composition originally recorded by the Beatles,was &quot;stolen by Charles Manson&quot;,according to Paul &quot;Bono&quot; Hewson,who mentioned that at the beginning of the track. At the end of VAN DIEMEN'S LAND,a man who interviewed the band asked,&quot;What has happened between the writing and recording of THE JOSHUA TREE album,the tour,and the new(RATTLE AND HUM) songs?&quot; We hear mostly chuckling. DESIRE,an original track,was the album's first single,released in October 1988,like the album. Bob Dylan's compostion ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER is on the album. Dylan sings background vocals on LOVE RESCUE ME.R &amp; B great B.B. King joins the band on WHEN LOVE COMES TO TOWN. PRIDE,an UNFORGETTABLE FIRE track is heard,which is an ode to the late Martin Luther King. ALL I WANT IS YOU is another hit,so is ANGEL OF HARLEM. And,of course,two live versions of JOSHUA TREE tracks,I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR and BULLET THE BLUE SKY are on this album. This album was a best-seller like THE JOSHUA TREE. But the band wouldn't put out their next album until 1991.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I bought this album last summer,I haven't stopped listening to it yet.I had heard some hype about this album from my brother who is also a Fiona fan.The first time I listened to it,I was hooked.&quot;On the Bound&quot; is a great opening song.In the beginning of the song she seems so certain about what she wants-&quot;You're all I need&quot; is what she repeatedly exclaims.But toward the middle of the song she seems more unclear-&quot;I don't know what I'm doing,Don't know should I change my mind,I can't decide there's too man variations to consider&quot; is what she declares.The next song,&quot;To Your Love&quot; is practically an anthem for any haunted soul apologizing for their confusing and distraught ways.&quot;A Mistake&quot; is an anthem for any independent person looking to minorly rebel against logic.I skip ahead to my favorite song,the last track on the album-&quot;I Know&quot;.A gorgeous piece.I guess I was drawn to it because of her false naiveness of her lover's &quot;sins&quot;.She is still willing to forgive whatever malicious or otherwise actions he made and is ready to go through that again.This is evident at the end of the track when she states &quot;Ad if it gets too late,for me to wait For you to find you love me,and tell me so It's OK,don't need to say it.&quot; Needless to say,this is easily one of my favorite albums.I can listen to it through and through without ever getting tired of hearing her disturbed lyrics and her riveting voice.This is a much more mature album than Tidal.She has stopped trying to use such uncommon words in her lyrics to impress people and started using everyday words.The production is also outstanding.That ws the first thng that hit me,all that was going on in all the songs was impressive;how so many intricate pieces could fit together to form ten excellent songs.I wasn't sure if this album could top Tidal.I listened to that album constantly when my brother first got it.I still fall asleep at night listening to Tidal,but this is a far more triumphant album in terms of maturity and production value.I recommend this album to any music fan with any taste.
B00005JL2O|2.0|I loved the first two, but this one is just not very funny. I'm sorry, but Goldmember disgusted me, and his antics were not at all amusing. You never hear anyone on the street saying \\"Haha look at me I eat my own skin and have balls made of gold!\\" Plus his accent was non-descript. It's not like fat bastard where people actually liked him. <br />Beyonce is a horrible actress. I rather like her music, but she simply has no talent when it comes to acting like something she's not (a 70's swingin roller girl or whatever she was supposed to be). <br />most of the jokes were reused from the first two movies, and simply not as funny or shocking as they were before.<br />i'd love to see an austin powers 4, but mr meyers please find some new jokes, and vixens that [aren't bad] at acting.
0385504209|4.0|This summer's hot bestseller is fast-paced, well-written and fun--just take it all with a grain of salt! Create a rather tweedy American professor, a gorgeous red-headed Italian detective and a bizarre murder, and you have the stuff of hundreds of mysteries--but toss in the current fad for art-related novels (&quot;Girl with the Pearl Earring&quot;) and interest in the seamier side of Catholicism, and you have a winner! The &quot;DaVinci Code&quot; presents a timeless theme, the search for the Holy Grail, as a search to uncover the truth about the sacred feminine in Catholicism, which the male dominated establishment Church has supressed for centuries. Brown's introductory footnote regarding the truth of much of the material in the novel overstates his case--even the most cursory search on the internet suggests that the facts are highly disputed, Brown's interpretations of Leonardo's work hardly mainstream, and even the existence of a group like the Priory of Sion is a lot murkier than the novel suggests. Much has been written about factual inaccuracies in the book--&quot;The Last Supper&quot; is not a fresco for example, and the &quot;Madonna of the Rocks&quot; is painted on wood, not canvas.<br />But never mind--it's a great read. The book will send you to the library to look at some of Leonardo's works again, and I'm sure there's already a big increase in tourists at Rosslyn Chapel in England and St. Sulpice in Paris, not to mention the Lourve. The action incredibly takes place all in 24 hours, and at the end all the villians but one get let off the hook in a rather simplistic conclusion, but don't let that spoil the fun. Brown has hit on a winning formula---one we're sure to see at the movies soon!
B000099T2L|5.0|Finally, here's the longer-awaited solo debut of the Destiny's Child lead singer, as people were waiting for, with most best producers of the R&B scene:<br />01. Crazy in love (featuring Jay-Z)-Produced by Rich Harrison & Beyoncé-Beyoncé was so right when she chose this song for present the album. The beat's so crazy and good, from beginning to end. That instrumental arranging in the chorus reminds like an orchestral sound but hotter & adapted to bang. I like the vocals, the rap & the music. Guys, you bang it. (10/10)<br />02. Naughty girl -Produced by Scott Storch & Beyoncé-That club bangin' track keeps it slower after Crazy in love and it's bringing down the speed that the album began with. I like the Arabic-flavored music and I think it's so much good. The part of the song I like most is the beginning of the prechorus. But I think she could give the track a bit more of heat. (8/10)<br />03. Baby boy (featuring Sean Paul)-Produced by Scott Storch & Beyoncé-Naming the singers, is enough to say the track is the bang. Sean gives to the track the heat that it needs. And that Arabic, reggae flavor gives the song that wit. The part of the song that I like most is from \\"Picture us dancin real close\\" to \\"Feels like true paradise to me\\". I love it. Beyoncé bangs the vocals and the writing and with the help of dancehall hitmaker SeanPaul. (10/10)<br />04. Hip-Hop star (featuring Big Boi & Sleepy Brown)-Produced by Beyoncé, Bryce Wilson & Big Boi-This track moves between hip hop, funk & rock, and I love it. I think it could be better. I like the Big Boi raps and Sleepy vocals, and of course Beyoncé, she gives them high-pitched and softer sound than ever. (9/10)<br />05. Be with you -Produced by Rich Harrison & Beyoncé-A soft track that gives the listener the relax that he lost while listening the previous tracks. It doesn't seems a production of Harrison and it's a track that sees Beyoncé talking bout what she'd rather and of course, that's being with her baby. (8/10)<br />06. Me, myself and I -Produced by Scott Storch & Beyoncé-This track sounds like Be with you, with a soul-funk sound and I think, slower, and soft too. Talks bout her ladies, bout how she feel and bout all that things close to her heart. I like it. (8/10)<br />07. Yes -Produced by Focus... & Beyoncé-I like so much this classical Destiny's Child track like, but with a beat good and new. The beat mixes music box, with percussion, with cell phone interferences. I love it. And that's another mid-tempo track that stays with the style of the both previous. It's a good track to precede the next. (9/10)<br />08. Signs (featuring Missy Elliott)-Produced by Missy Elliott, Nisan Stewart & Craig Brockman-This, in my opinion, the best song of the entire album. Missy brings so much good and soft beats that when I hear it, it gives me such comfort. I really feel this track. Beyoncé hits again with her vocals that, sometimes, sound like Tweet. The theme of the song's so original and I love the track entire, from the beginning to Missy's rap. (11/10)<br />09. Speechless -Produced by Beyoncé, Fanatic & Sherrod Barnes-I really don't feel this song. It's too much hard and slow for my likes. Well, I like some parts of it, but I don't like it very much. That hard beat with the guitar and it's too much slow, I say again. (6/10)<br />10. That's how you like it (featuring Jay-Z)-Produced by D-Roy, Mr. B & Beyoncé-I feel this song. The soft beat and lyrics are good for this song. And it's a really climbing from the slow feeling of Speechless. Jay-Z takes something more than a feature, rapping chorus and verses. I really like it. (9/10)<br />11. The closer I get to you (duet with Luther Vandross)-Produced by Nat Adderley Jr.-If you like ballads, this is the best song of the album. They sing, but of course!, bout their love. I feel this song. I think it could be a little better. However, I like it. (8/10)<br />12. Dangerously in love 2 -Produced by Beyoncé & Errol \\"Poppi\\" McCallaJr.-What can I say bout this? It's the deepest song of the album, with lyrics that hurts your heart, and this is the second version of the song that DC did in Survivor. The 2 versions are almost the same, this one has got more instruments and the vocals change a little. It didn't suppose 2 me another song. But I like it. (9/10)<br />13. Beyoncé Interlude -Produced by Beyoncé-An interlude, it talks bout the harmony with their love feigning it with the beauty of colors. I can't score it.<br />14. Gift from Virgo -Produced by Beyoncé-I didn't feel this song when I heard it, but when I felt it, I liked it. I like that jazzy beat. The worst's that the track go on for only 2.40 minutes. (8/10)<br />15. Work it out -Produced by The Neptunes-I was really missing a Neptunes track, and the one that they produced is already released. I didn't like that. What can I say bout this? It's one year old and it mixes Neptunes beat with a 70's flavor that gives the song the dance. Good track. (9/10)<br />16. '03 Bonnie & Clyde (featuring Jay-Z)-Produced by Kanye West-Who doesn't knows this song? Did by 2pac and then versioned by Jay-Z, with the collaboration of her B, who we are talking about. The song hasn't the fun that I thought it was gonna have. Anyway I like it. (8/10)<br />17. Daddy -Produced by Beyoncé & Mark Batson-Well, I like this but what I like most from this, is the Beyoncé vocals. They are very harmonious. I like the way she sings here. (8/10)<br />I like very much the album, but I'm still missing that tracks she announced for the record. Tracks like Neptunes-produced \\"I think I'm ready\\", the Timbaland & Missy-produced \\"Wrapped around me\\", the R. Kelly-produced \\"Gangsta\\", the Lil' Kim-featured \\"Ice cream truck\\"; \\"Summertime\\", \\"My first time\\", the Bad Boys soundtrack \\"Keep givin' your love to me\\", and forward to 45 songs she recorded for the album. That's the mistake.
6305718954|1.0|Borrow liberally from &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; employ cheap music video-style editing, and round up a handful of third-tier actors, and you've got &quot;Stigmata,&quot; an unscary and woefully stupid religious thriller.  The editorial review advises us not to dismiss this film as an &quot;Exorcist&quot; rip-off.  How can you not?  It mirrors that 1973 movie very closely, but unlike &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; &quot;Stigmata&quot; shows no concern for originality, vision, or a plausible script.  Patricia Arquette is a twentysomething atheist who gets mysterious wounds that are similar to those of Christ.  A priest gets called in to investigate the matter, and the two begin a journey that's far less interesting than what the movie promises to be.  Like most bad horror flicks, &quot;Stigmata&quot; labors to get scares from the audience through lots of blood, hyperactive editing, and other tired techniques.  But even if this film weren't such an &quot;Exorcist&quot; wannabe, you'd still be left with amateurish acting, a script riddled with holes, and the sight of Nia Long in purple extensions.  My advice?  Skip this dud altogether.  You're better off renting &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; or &quot;The Omen&quot; for the umpteenth time than spending a minute watching this lame and uninspired bore.
0553208845|5.0|This has been called Hesse's greatest novel and it is easy to see why it has that reputation. Siddhartha is simply a masterpiece. It is the story of Siddhartha's lifelong journey towards enlightenment.<br />Part of the beauty of this book is in its ornate simplicity - if you can have such a thing. The story is easy to access and the images Hesse uses are colorful and crisp. What is startling about this book is how much detail is given through so few words. Yet you are able to see the characters, smell the fragrances, and feel the emotions of the characters in the book. The insights and Hesse's voice are certainly there, but they are like the flowing commentary of the river in Siddhartha - fleeting, gentle, understated, and wise.<br />Hesse decides to tell of an enlightenment journey through the use of a novel format. This is not some religious text, this is not some philosophical text. This is a story. A remarkably beautiful, precise story that is easy to access by almost any reader. Granted, eastern religious thought tends to be either villified by the West as a sort of pantheistic outmoded religion; or it tends to be overly mystical and hard to access through translation. However, Siddhartha manages to bring the true messages of wisdom and enlightenment and put them in an easily readable format.<br />This work does double-duty. Not only is it a wonderful spiritual story, but it is also an amazingly well-crafted piece of literature.
0871137380|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie, and I must say that the book is far better.  While the movie gives you an idea of what people went through, the book takes you much deeper into the soldier's lives in Somalia.  Incredible read...did it in one sitting.
0385503954|2.0|I had waited for this book and thought based on reviews that it would be worth it. Our book club read it and we were overwhelmingly disappointed. It was over written in the beginning and although the ending was thought provoking, it was not worth the time it took to dredge through the first half of the book to get to it.
B00005JKZV|4.0|The Two Towers was a great movie, which I've seen at least seven times. It has excellent casting, acting, directing, editing, etc. The only thing I have a problem with would be what many Tolkien readers have said about the books: It's too short. I feel that it would be wrong to judge the movie against the book at this time, because quite a bit of the book has yet to take place until the third movie. However, as far as writing goes, I can understand Faramir, and Eomer acting like jerks, because frankly, that's what the writers have been doing the whole time. Elrond, Galadriel, Theoden, everyone's usual politeness has been filed down to cause so conflict between the heroes and the helpers. Even Gollum's schizo-scene, comic at first, has found a soft spot in my heart (Has no one else pitied him? \\"I hate you. I hate you\\"). Furthermore, we have assurances that Faramir, Eomer, Treebeard, and even Theodred will have a bigger part in the Extended Edition, which I will wait for, and I recommend for anyone who feels that they need more explanation of characters should wait for that as well.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I'm afraid that the New Robin Hood with Kevin Costner, although somewhat of a pleasant distraction, pales in comparison to the original with Errol Flynn. Flynn was well known for his flamboyance and cocky attitude. It did not endear him to all but most loved his style especially in movies like \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\", \\"Captain Blood\\", \\"The Seahawk\\", and a few others. In later years his acting in \\"Objective Burma\\" showed that he was quite adept at more serious roles as well. In this movie even the supporting cast brings a wide array of feelings of sorrow and amusement to this wonderful film. For a two disk set of DVDs with many extras and being a special edition I can't wait to get my copy. For the period it was made the color, music, and sets were incredible. It remains a timeless classic that may be copied, but never beaten.
B00008WG3U|5.0|yeah although this cd isn't as good as their older stuff i still believe its great and they're are one of the few bands not selling out on how they sound and trying to be what everybody else wants to hear
B000002GYI|5.0|When i first popped this thing in my CD player, it literally struck me dumb with delight...i had heard of Kraftwerk through one of my friends and i picked this CD up and was completely taken aback by the precise mixture of synthetic vocals, trance like music and the theme of a computer dependent age where humanity and technology blend(its like they were talking about 2003 22 years ago). I absolutely love the 1st track &quot;Computer World&quot;. Its dark vocals and synth driven melody just seem to flow though your thoughts and feelings. &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot; is just as good with a little less drama and a lot more bounce. I also love how &quot;Numbers&quot; fades in to create the next track, &quot;Computer World...2&quot;. All the rest of the songs are excellent also, based on the same theme. It is not often you find an album like this based on one great idea that delivers so much and makes you yearn for more after it is over. Take my advice, there is no other CD that is like it. Believe me, once you start to listen to Kraftwerk, there is no turning back.....
B000084T18|3.0|Your probably wondering why I am giving \\"the best rapper\\" only 3 stars. Well for all you people that never heard of 50 before In da Club, and Wanksta, he was strictly for the streets. How can people say this guy is the best rapper? Hello! 1999 - Power of the Dollar - it went no where. Without Em and Dre on his side he wouldn't have nothing... he has a great flow. I am not dissin 50, but this album could have been much more than this \\"in da club\\" ... . Yeah, for a teenage girl this is the perfect album, but what happened to the fans that helped build 50. From when Power of the Dollar was out (I got a bootlegged version). And the G-Unit mixtapes. This album could have been much more. 50, stick to the streets, not the teenage girl's walls. I'm looking foward to Lock and Unload from G-Unit in the fall , just don't give us no club ... . 50 just got rich and bought some jewelery. And tell all the radio stations to stop playing every song on your album. Best Track - Many Men (wishdeath) Worst Track - In da Club
B00009M6VJ|4.0|The issue of capital punishment and the death penalty is a very hotly debated topic, like abortion. Who gives people the right to take life and play God and so on and what if the executed were innocent is some anti-death penalty remarks. The movie ends with a quite shocking ending but a rather cheapened one. <br />Kevin Spacey plays David Gale, a respected college professor and active member of DeathWatch, an anti-government group. One night while drunk, he has sex with a willing college student. However, she turns the tables and pulls rape charges. Afterwards, his life goes to hell: he gets a divorce, fired from the school and everyone avoids him. He is then charged and put on death row for the murder of his friend, Constance(played very well by Laura Linney). All this is told years later to a reporter, Bitsey Bloom. He's being executed in 4 days and it's up to her to find out the truth. <br />Very good acting and a touchy subject. The only problem I had was with the ending. It was shocking to see but it cheapened David's cause, but the film's worth watching
B000075BFK|4.0|2pac... dead or alive, we will forever enjoy his music. This is a great cd. The only problem is their is too many Outlaw appearences. The Outlawz are hot, but this is a 2pac cd. And to prove he is alive go to hidden track 14 on the 2nd disk. Or just look in the cd booklet at track 1. (an intro that has a newsreporter asking where these new 2pac songs are coming from)If you look who it was written by it says T. Shakur. Anyways this is a great cd. The best tracks are Thugz Mansion (both versions), Better Dayz, When we ride on our enemys, and They Don't give a f*ck about us. The cd has excellent beats although they would not be the kind 2pac would write a song to. This is no all eyes on me, but this cd is worth your money. 2pac is coming out with  2003 album, a clothing line and more, so what do you think... dead or alive??
B00005OM4Q|4.0|The film \\"Almost Famous\\" is a Cameron Crowe and Dream Works Home Entertainment movie.  Cameron Crowe has won an Oscar for best screenplay for this movie and he has been nominated for an Oscar for \\"Jerry Maguire\\".  This movie was released in 2001 and is approximately one hour and eighty-five minutes in length.  <BR> This is a drama about a 15-year-old boy named William Miller (Patrick Fugit) who wants to be a journalist for Rolling Stone Magazine.  Miller meets with a \\"Band-aid\\" named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) who introduces him to the band Stillwater.  While writing an article about the band, Miller befriends the guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup).  Both Russell and Miller fall in love with Penny Lane and it hurts their friendship.  Now Miller has to write an article for Rolling Stone without letting his feelings get in the way.  <BR> I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates Rock `n Roll.  I thought that Kate Hudson did a great acting job as Penny Lane.  She was both believable and fun to watch.  The story line was good as well.  It showed a back stage glimpse at the lives of rock stars in the early to mid 70's.  The soundtrack to this movie is important as well because it compliments certain scenes such as in the bus when they are listening to Elton John after they were all in a big fight.  I would give this film 4 and a half stars
B000002NJS|5.0|this is a great album and i highly reccomend you buy it
B00005O5JV|5.0|This is a very interesting movie and Reese Witherspoon sure does have her moments. She is a very talented actress and probably could play almost any role you could think of. About the movie, the main character, Elle Woods (Reese's character), starts out dating a guy who joins law school and tells Elle he couldn't be with her unless she worked for the law. Devastated, Elle goes to Harvard, cracks a case, and finds herself a new man! This movie is full of laughs and I can't wait to see Legally Blonde 2. Keep going, Reese! LOL.
B00006L8G8|5.0|This is a great album.  It's as good or better than Supernatural.  I've seen many opinions & reviews that Santana is trying too hard & has too many featured guests, but I don't agree at all.  I think they all do an excellent job.  Some standout songs are \\"Game of Love\\", \\"You Are My Kind\\", \\"Amore\\",  \\"Foo Foo\\", \\"America\\", \\"Why Don't You & I\\", & \\"Let Me Love You Tonight.\\"<br />Note:  I noticed in reviews on the domestic version of this album that apparently it lists \\"Why Don't You & I\\" with Chad Kroeger, but instead has the singer from The Calling.  This international version DOES have the version with Chad Kroeger singing.<br />Also, \\"Let Me Love You Tonight\\" on this album version is an excellent song; one of the best on this CD.<br />The only song I like a little bit less is the final one of \\"Novus\\" with Placido Domingo.  On that one the vocals sound too operatic (obviously).  He does have a wonderful voice, but I just don't like that style of singing.  Aside from the vocals on it I do like the music.  I just thought he should have had someone else singing.<br />Overall, an excellent album.  If you like Supernatural, you'll like Shaman as well.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This, for my money, is the finest movie soundtrack of the year! For one thing, THANK YOU, Hans Zimmer (producer) and Klaus Badelt (composer) for not trying to shove some horrible pop song in over the closing credits. (Don't you just hate when they do that? Totally ruins the mood -- especially in a period movie!) This soundtrack is all orchestral (with some effective choir moments) and all great. Yes, Badelt's music does recall the best of Zimmer and has similarities to Howard Shore's brilliant \\"Lord of the Rings\\" music -- but this is all good. The tracks are rousing, exhilarating, and absolutely fit the mood of the movie (a lighthearted, heroic romp). Favorite musical moments -- the entrance theme of Capt. Jack Sparrow (just fits that hilarious moment perfectly!), and the music accompanying the first sword fight (in the smithy). Amazingly, I have read that this soundtrack only came about at the last moment -- when the movie's producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, decided that he did not like the music that had originally been written (by another composer) -- he didn't think it sounded \\"piratical\\" enough. So he called in Badelt and had Zimmer produce -- and with only six weeks to go before the movie's release, they came up with this fantastic score. Say what you will about Bruckheimer -- he has his finger on the pulse! A big hats off to ye, Jerry, and Hans and Klaus. And -- the list of musicians and recording crew inside the liner notes HAS to be read: almost everyone is listed with their \\"pirate name\\"! (Hans \\"Long John\\" Zimmer...ok, I don't even want to know...)
B00006879E|5.0|I first bought Maroon 5's CD when they opened for Matchbox 20 and Sugar Ray. They were great in concert but I didn't know their music, I listened to the CD for weeks after that, and was surprised when they opened for Counting Crows and John Mayer. I reccommend this CD to everyone!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I  believe that this movie is the best western, if not the best movie ever made. It has all the classic themes, good versus evil, worker versus bosses, the love of money, the disdain for money, a gallant quest, honor,glory,heroism, self sacrifice. I saw this Movie the week it opened, twice a night for 7 nights, I am so happy to see it available on DVD.<BR>I would urge all the fans of this film to spread the word, see this film, it has as much meaning today, as it did in 1969,<BR>IOL.
B00006879E|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Maroon 5 open for Counting Crows and John Mayer.  I went to the concert to see Counting Crows more than anything, but when I noticed the opening act on their webiste a few weeks beforehand, I decided that this time I was going to know a little more about the opening band, because usually CC's opening acts are pretty cool and I always want the CD afterwards.  I was not disapointed again.<br />I will admit it took me more than one listen, and a sweet/sad song called &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; but these guys are good.<br />Very bluesy rock with a hard driving force.  They obivously were having a lot of fun playing live and I always like to see people who love their work.<br />If you are fan of Counting Crows, John Mayer, and or Ryan Adams there is no reason you will not like these cats as well. They probably won't cross over commercially with this effort, but that's half the point in my opinion.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I loved Hybrid Theory. LOVED IT. But Meteora, though it was said to be just as good, well ... doesn't come close. The first single, &quot;Somewhere I Belong,&quot; is pretty good, but it still took me a few listens to like it. I think there are no other songs worth mentioning on this album except the incredible second single, &quot;Faint.&quot; I didn't think much of that either, though, the first couple of times I heard it, but now I love it. Buy &quot;Faint&quot; as a single, for sure ... but not this album.
B00005JMC6|5.0|Niki Caro's \\"Whale Rider\\" (based on the novel by Witi Ihimaera) is an uplifting tale of tradition and inner strength. Twelve-year-old Pai (talented newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives with her grandparents in a rural New Zealand town. Pai's mother and twin brother died in childbirth, and her artist father took off for Europe, where he now has a new (pregnant) girlfriend. Pai's brother was supposed to be the next chief of her tribe, and with his death Pai's grandfather Koro searches for a new (male) leader, failing to see that it is Pai that possesses the courage and talents of a chieftain.<br />The movie is filled with a haunting soundtrack by Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard, including samples of traditional Maori music by Hirini Melbourne. The cinematography beautifully captures the many moods of light and shadow on mountains and sea, as well as stock footage of majestic whales. \\"Whale Rider\\" is an uplifting tale of love, loss, and courage, about tradition in the face of change, and believing in yourself.
B000006TRV|5.0|Listen, this was NOT an album of \\"our times\\" or \\"the 80's\\"  This is an album of the human condition.  Let's see if you can follow me on this-<BR>As we age, life teaches us, many times harshly, that to wear your heart on your sleeve is not condusive to continued mental or emotional health.  So as we grow we build many walls around ourselves in order to protect our psyches from damage.  We ALL do it.  We surround ourselves with consumer ... having bought into the madison ave bull that it will us happy.  But with all the walls up we cant get to that which we most need - real human connection.  How many of you are living beyond your means?  For what?  Look at all the posturing out there all the posing.  It's all about attitude, no substance, which is why people look at this album and say \\"What a downer, man!!\\"  It's sooooo depressing!! Like why bring us all down??  Lighten up!!\\"<BR>It's ok, stay in your own little world and live for yourself.  If you have a mind, you might see that the truth within this album applies to everyone.  While your at it look up the word allegory.  It may help you to understand...
B00005JLPK|5.0|&quot;Frida&quot; possesses that mythical essence which the Spanish call duende: magic spirit or inspiration. The entire film--performances, music, visuals, explodes with passion and colour. We see Frida from her beginnings as an impetuous schoolgirl and her first introduction to future husband Diego Rivera, to her death at age forty-seven. In between we are priviledged to Frida's unique perspectives of life, love and art, everything drenched in vivid colours, ripe with possibility, a tango of pain and passion.<br />The cast includes many high-profile names, such as Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina, Geoffry Rush, Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, and Edward Norton. I am amazed at how well Julie Taymor (the Lion King Broadway musical) has captured the feel of Mexico during the early-to-mid 20th century:  the revolutionary atmosphere, inequalities, the textures and smells of everyday life.<br />The most impressive part of the film for me was the music and visuals. The soundtrack includes a liberal dose of traditional Mexican tunes and singers, including Chavela Vargas, a legendary folk singer and one of Frida's real-life lovers. It was incredibly powerful to see the weathered face of Vargas as she serenades Salma's Frida; one can only imagine what memories she was recalling of her time with the real Frida. Mexican folk singer Lila Downs also contributes, as does Caetano Veloso and Hayek herself on &quot;La Bruja.&quot;<br />Taymor uses Frida's actual paintings as inspiration for the visuals, at times combining live action with Frida's paintings, photo montages, and puppets to bring to life Frida's creative genius, trying to go behind the paintings into the events that inspired them.<br />The two-disc DVD comes with several short extras on visual effects, interviews with Chavela Vargas and Lila Downs, Salma's recording session,  Although overly ambitious and sidetracked at times, &quot;Frida&quot; manages to paint an unforgettable portrait of a fiery spirit: communist, painter, wife, lover, infused with the soul and passion of Mexico., wife, lover, infused with the soul and passion of Mexico.

B000006045|5.0|MEZZANINE is one of those albums that seems to get glowing praise from everyone who hears it.  You could spend days listening to people gush over it, but you probably would give up after about an hour, because everyone would essentially be repeating the same idea: \\"this is one of the greatest albums ever.\\"  One almost begins to suspect that these are nothing more than rabid Massive Attack fans, for whom Robert Del Naja and company can do no wrong.  You would be correct, but that doesn't change the fact that these fans are not overstating the virtues of MEZZANINE at all; if anything, they're understating them.<br />This is the best kind of music: the kind that appeals to everyone.  If you absolutely MUST pigeonhole this album, you can call it trip-hop, but MEZZANINE is much more than electronica mixed with hip-hop.  The songs build slowly, starting with a simple beat before moving to heights of every kind of emotion you can think of, from utter sadness (\\"Teardrop\\") to paranoia (\\"Man Next Door\\") to the pleasures of the flesh (\\"Inertia Creeps,\\" hands down the most erotic song in history).  Along the way, they take cues from R&B, post-punk, hard rock, and even pop, making it extremely difficult to dislike this album.  But when music is this good, who'd want to try?
0446608955|5.0|Nicholas Sparks' &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is the most riveting story of innocent first love that I've ever read.  The opening line in the first and last chapters brought tears to my eyes.  &quot;When I was seventeen my life changed forever.&quot;  Read everything in between and you'll share my reaction.  The plot is easy to follow, perhaps even unoriginal but the story is nonetheless irresistible and at its best is a breath-taking story of the joy, pain, and confusion that life can throw at us when we are least prepared. I only hope that every person who deserves to find their one true love will one day meet their own Jamie Sullivan.  I only wish I had known such a girl when I was seventeen as I am sure every man who has (or will) read this short but life-changing story.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I bought this CD in advance of seeing the film. After my first time of listening to it, I knew I had to see it! The soundtrack is just incredible, but after seeing the movie you do have a better idea of what you are listening to and how the song was worked into the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones does the best job, in my opinion, but Richard and Renae are almost as fabulous! I have a CD for the house and one for the car. Cannot be without those fabulous tunes!
B000069AUI|5.0|Few records in my lifetime have been this amazing. Thank god for Coldplay! In a current music state clouded with unoriginal, heavily marketed artists, Coldplay shine through all of that. Don't let anything get in the way of their music. Forget the popularity, forget selling out Madison Square Garden, forget the whole Gywneth thing. This band deserves all the attention they get for one reason, they are incredible. The songs range from beautiful to powerful. Chris Martin has so much passion in his voice and in his words. You cannot help but feel exaclty what he is feeling. Its almost as if he is speaking directly to you, telling you a story. Coldplay having released only two records so far gives me tremendous hope that all music is not processed, marketed [material]. Do yourself a favor and buy this album. When you are older your children will be listening to Coldplay like you listened to Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin.
B00009ATIX|3.0|Three stars for the follow:<br />Star 1-George Clooney &amp; Viola Davis do some impressive work.<br />Star 2-The cinematography is some of the best of the year.<br />Star 3-The Score for the film is one of the best of the genre, heavily recalling the polish avant-garde at the most minimal &amp; dense (think Ligeti or Lutoslowski &lt;SP&gt;).<br />Otherwise, this is a forgettable film which hasn't a soul. It's telling that Tarkovsky's version is 3hrs long and this new one 90min but that the new one FEELS longer than the Tarkovsky version. When all is said and done, a film must be ABOUT something, albeit thematically, emotionally, etc. .  Tarkovsky's 'SOLARIS' was about many things, all handled with the skill of a master who believed in the mental fortitude of his audience.  Soderbergh, however, wants to tease his audience into entering into a labyrinth but then he's not skilled enough to actually say anything once inside.  His approach, as it happens, it quite simple-minded: he positions the failed relationship between Kelvin and Rheya as the the singular issue of existence.  There's some philosophy 101 tossed in for good measure, but mostly, you don't have to think watching this new 'SOLARIS'.  Science-Fiction is a genre of ideas, of complexity, something Soderbergh failed to see.  Sure, points go for trying something serious but really, the scope and density of the subject is just beyond him.  The film tries to attone in it's climax, a climax where the station plunges into the beautiful ocean of Solaris but even here, the filmmaker doesn't trust the intelligence of the viewer and he insults them by having Kelvin reconcile with Rheya after his faux suicide (his reunion after death is Christian romanticism which would've surely offended Lem and which even Tarkovsky at his most sentimental would've never attempted)... It just doesn't work.  Buy the original or read the novel; buy the score to this new 'SOLARIS', otherwise, spend your time elsewhere.
B0000942LT|5.0|Wow!  This cd is definitely the best Staind album out yet.  I waited a while to get this album because I wasn't sure I would like it very much.  A lot of people complained that it was too soft and boring.  I took my chances anyway because I liked their other two albums(Dysfunction, Break the Cycle) a lot.  Every song on this cd is simply remarkable and I just can't get enough of it.  The band really does a good job of showing how they feel and that is a good way to get to know a band.  Some of my favorite songs on this cd are &quot;Price To Play&quot;, &quot;So Far Away&quot;, and &quot;Fray&quot;.  I can't believe that they could put such a good album together.  It will always be one of my favorite rock cd's I'll ever own.  Go buy it.
B00009W0U4|4.0|'IRREVERSIBLE' starts as an attack on what film \\"should\\" be with credits running in reverse, sliding around, and at the end of the film.  The effect here is less for the cool factor (as it is in the film 'SEVEN') and more to disrupt audience levels of acceptability.  In fact, the whole film pushes the audience to question what is \\"acceptable\\" and what is not.  This is not exploitation, however, but aggressive art, art which is meant to challange, provoke, and stay with you long after the film is over.<br />The plot has been discussed elsewhere so I won't harp on that.  Needless to say, the film starts in a circle in Dante's Hell, moves upward through a Purgatorio, and almost, but not quite, gets to Heaven.  But the film is told in reverse.  \\"Time destroys all\\" is the motto, and indeed, because \\"Heaven\\" is at the beginning and \\"Hell\\" at the end, the film isn't a romantic parable on coincidence but rather an essay on/for/in search of Nihilism; Nihilism is tragic, Hence, this film is a tragedy. It's best if the film is viewed as a Horror/Love/Pro-Feminist story.<br />The acting in the film is as perfect as the deft camerawork/cinematography.  Monica Bellucci should especially be praised for taking on what is surely one of the most difficult scenes any actress has been asked to perform on film.  The infamous rape is done with such artistry and integrity that it is never sensational & exploitative; The violence is always real and vivid, never forgettable, and is (the violence) far above and beyond the frivolous \\"human bodies as toys/trash\\" shown in films like 'GLADIATOR' and 'TERMINATOR 3'.  Here, violence is never romantic nor chic and for this Noe deserves any and all credit he gets.<br />This film is along the same in-your-face, intellectual horror films as 'SALO: 120 DAYS OF SODOM', 'VIDEODROME' and 'HELLRAISER', films where the killer is not some masked voyeur but rather the \\"Killer\\" is time, destiny, circumstance, and the human disposition towards violence as it fulfills personal/political/psychological desires & a need to transgress.<br />For a better understanding/appreciation of 'IRREVERSIBLE'check out the above mentioned but also give a read to Georges Bataille's \\"EROTISME\\" and \\"THE TORTURE GARDEN\\" by Octave Mirabeau (also some Maurice Blanchot wouldn't be bad).<br />I give the film 4.75 but not 5 because Noe hasn't quite made his masterpiece...but he's very, very close.  While not a film for everyone, if you can mentally & physically handle 'IRREVERSIBLE' you'll experience what art can & \\"should\\" be.  This film will be studied and discussed for many years to come.lfills personal/political/psychological desires & a need to transgress.<br />For a better understanding/appreciation of 'IRREVERSIBLE'check out the above mentioned but also give a read to Georges Bataille's \\"EROTISME\\" and \\"THE TORTURE GARDEN\\" by Octave Mirabeau (also some Maurice Blanchot wouldn't be bad).<br />I give the film 4.75 but not 5 because Noe hasn't quite made his masterpiece...but he's very, very close.

B00005JKN9|1.0|Scorsese was apparently so dazzled by the history of Ol' New York and the pomp of his own vision that he failed to see that his story has no center.  Daniel Day Lewis is the only one involved in this production to provide any clarity, any raison d'etre.  His character is big, loud, self-loathing, grotesque, murderous, earnest, cunning, skilled, over-the-top, and tragic: he is the center of gravity in the film, a great symbol for a PART of what America is, and when he's not on screen the film becomes a dull slideshow of old photos presented by an old professor who's ceased connection.  There are two films here: one, where Lewis' Bill the Butcher tells the real story of how America was created by Exploitation and Tenacity of Immigrants (Irish, Italian, African, Chinese, German).  The other film (No.2) is the one where Scorsese has lost sight of what the story is really about (it's about old new york, sure, but does it really lavish enough time and attention on the details of anything to educate?).  Diaz serves no purpose here...imagine her out of the film and you'll see it makes no difference that she's in. As with other Scorsese films, the latent homophobia is in effect here.  The cinematography is good but a bit subpar for what you'd expect from a Scorsese film (all of his other films have rich visual pallettes to speak of).  The score is a collection of tunes which don't quite go together at the end of the day (whoever did the whistling tune at the beginning of the film should've scored the whole movie).  Forget what you've been told, this film is NOT a masterpiece, is NOT a good film, is NOT worth seeing in almost every way save for the way the studio system is a relic from a time since passed, a system which offers spectacle but nothing more (and even the spectacle isn't that original).
B00009ATIX|3.0|I think this move had great potential. excellent cinematography, stellar ( no pun intended) performances form the cast. It had a very Kubrick feel to it.<br />Parts of it had me transfixed, practically hypnotized, while others parts had me hopelessly frustrated.<br />I agree that this movie is subtle. Sublety can be a great instrument to tell a tale such as this, but this one was a bit too subtle.<br />My main problem with this film was that considering the scenario: people being visited by dead loved ones on a spaceship in orbit around an anomylous planet. Sounds scary to me.<br />Unfortunately the movie built almost no suspense around this. I never felt that Chris was the least bit surprised except during thr initial contact with his dead wife. I don't know about you all but I would have been totally freaked. No ownder the rest of the crew went crazy - unfortunately this was never fully explored. lets delve into the mystery a little and build some suspense. Chris seemed to accept his dead wifes reanimation way too easily. I never felt the fear or the uncertainty radiate from Chris.<br />I don't know, maybe I'm thick, but as hard as I tried I could not connect with the characters. Yes, the acting was all first rate, it is just the script left way too much to the imagination.<br />I thought this could have been another 2001- A Space Odyssey if only... if only what? I'm not sure, maybe a sense of forboding, of fear of who this &quot;ghost&quot; was and what was her purpose.<br />I have a feeling that the parts that could have made this a better film were left on the cutting room floor.
B000083E79|5.0|I'm only dissapointed in One Track,\\"One By One.\\" Its my FAVORITE Cher song of all time,but on the CD,its the re-mixed club hit.The rest of the album is fantastic.It has all of Cher's hits we have loved over the years.I got to see Cher in Vegas in 2001,and it was one of the greatest shows I've seen by any peformer,and most of the music on this CD was from that great concert.
B00009V7T2|5.0|incredible. that's the only word that springs to mind. nothing short of the most amazing album this year so far. possibly this decade.<br />just to clear up an error made by someone earlier, televators is about the person in question commiting suicide.<br />i was speachless when this album reached it's conclusion.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|\\"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\\" this has perhaps become the most famous question ever asked in a fairy tale. And in 1937, this was the question with which started this exalted masterpiece; a magical motion picture that bewitched millions of spectators worldwide and started a new trend of entertainment.<BR> <BR>When Walt first began his ambitious project with a loan of 1.5 million dollars from the Bank of America, critics termed it as 'professional suicide'. Disney studios were well renowned for giving to the world the first cartoon in full color and also the first cartoon with sound (Steamboat Willy). Most critics predicted that Snow White would be a box-office failure. They argued that cartoons were only meant to last ten minutes, filling the gaps in the programme rather than becoming the main attraction. They branded Disney's ambition ludicrous and foolish. But their predictions were proved wrong. At its premiere on 21st December 1937 at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, the celebrity-packed audience applauded all the finest sequences. Snow White instantly became a worldwide hit of magnetic proportions, starting a saga of magic which soon grasped the whole world; launching a series of Snow White dolls, figurines, books and vinyl records. <BR> <BR> Walt's achievement was recognized by Hollywood in 1939, when Shirley Temple presented him with a special Oscar. It was unique, consisting of eight figures - one large Oscar and seven miniature ones. Since then, Snow White has become a cherished classic loved by people of all ages.<BR> <BR> The animation, though traditional, is matchless in its grandeur. And considering that in those ages, every single cel had to be hand-painted; one can say that Snow White is nothing short of visually spectacular. Entailing the tiring labor of some 750 artists who painted over a million cels; (only 2,50,000 were used in the finished film) this classic came to life. The music composed by Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline and Paul Smith is richly melodious and vibrant; the score and the songs really beautiful. From the dwarfs' 'Heigh-Ho' to Snow White's 'Whistle While You Work' and 'With A Smile And A Song' to the prince's 'One Song'; each tune has its own splendor. 'Someday My Prince Will Come' is soothingly melodious, and has indeed become a timeless classic (though I don't quite like the Barbra Streisand rendition of it).<BR> <BR> The characters are astoundingly brought to life by brilliant vocal performances. Walt had himself chosen Adriana Caselotti as the voice of Snow White, and her classical numbers are exceptional. Lucille Laverne is the perfect choice for the voice of the queen and witch. Broadway star Harry Stockwell provides a wonderful voice for Prince Charming; and Pinto Colvig and Roy Atwell portray Grumpy and Doc very well. <BR> <BR> An eternal masterpiece, Snow white has something for everyone. It transports us to a realm of innocence and wonder; and we lose ourselves in this enchanted world. It is a conglomeration of fun, beauty, warmth and romance that really touches the very bottom of your heart. <BR> <BR>The 2-Disc platinum edition DVD is one of a kind, offering a breath-taking anamorphic full-screen transfer of this magical fairy tale, accompanied by an equally awesome Dolby 5.1 surround sound (the DVD also provides Dolby 5.1 French and Spanish language tracks). The bonus features are numerous (Disc Two having a total running time of 190 minutes); offering and in-depth look at the movie itself and how it was made. There are vast virtual galleries, early presentation reels, vintage audio publicity, a very nice set-top game and guided tours by Roy Disney and Angela Lansbury. The abandoned concepts and deleted scenes are a special joy to watch and the celebrity-hosted feature 'Snow White Through The Decades' is very informative and entertaining. I had to import the DVD from US and must say that it was worth every bit of my money. However, Disney studios have discontinued the title from the 31st of January, 2003, and the ones on Amazon.com have also gone out-of-stock. So if you don't yet have a copy of this classic, go get it now. I love this timeless masterpiece and will prize it always.

B000001FFJ|5.0|10 Stars. Probably the best and most important disc I own. Absolutely essential for anyone that appreciates music. It's pointless to try and describe this album in words -- you simply have pick it up and listen to it at least 25 times. The first few times you may not &quot;get&quot; it -- and then it clicks -- and then you'll have to own everything Mr. Waits as ever recorded. Tom's musical integrity, creativity, and innovation make the Beatles look pedestrian. I'd rank his contributions to music up with Ellington and Armstrong.

B000002UAF|5.0|The soundtrack from the Beatles' best ever movie was also the best album of their early period.   A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was also the only LP they ever released (prior to the post breakup compilations) of all Lennon-McCartney material:  no cover versions, and no George Harrison compositions.  John Lennon was especially dominant, penning nearly all of the songs on this terrific album.   The title song he wrote in a single day, after being told by the producers that the movie would be called &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; based on something Ringo had said (and a phrase John had already borrowed from the drummer for his book &quot;In His Own Write&quot;).  The whole band rises to the occasion on this track -- especially George Harrison.  In the space of a 3 hour recording session, after hearing the song for the first time, Harrison worked out the distinctive guitar sound on his new Rickenbacker 12-string which ensured a terrific Beatles song would become a classic.  His strident opening chord -- which kicks off both the album AND the movie -- grabs the audience's attention immediately -- and the band never lets go.  Harrison's 12-string is dominant throughout this CD, though George has to share the instrumental spotlight with John on &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; -- a terrific bluesy number that gives Lennon his first opportunity to play the instrumental bridge on a Beatles' song.  Note the emotion in that solo, something that would characterize John's playing thoughout his life, just as the jealousy and romantic insecurity expressed in this song would pervade Lennon's lyrics.  You can hear other examples of those insecurities on this collection -- in his gentle duet with Paul McCartney on &quot;If I Fell&quot;, the country-sounding &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; and the Del Shannon-influenced &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;.   These Lennon gems -- plus &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; and &quot;Anytime At All&quot; -- reveal Lennon as the driving creative force on this album. Yet it must be said McCartney's three songs are extremely memorable, especially his beautiful ballad, &quot;And I Love Her&quot;.  I like this song so much better than his later &quot;Yesterday&quot;;  Paul's voice is full of romantic yearning, and it is perfectly matched by the band's gentle accoustic backing -- especially George's lustrous solo.  &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; was Paul's first big hit, while &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; also is first-rate.  As mentioned, George Harrison didn't have a self-composition on this album, so he sang John's &quot;I'm Happy Just To Dance With You&quot;.  &quot;Good job on that, George&quot;, says John in the movie -- and he's right!  Ringo didn't even get a song to sing on this album, though the American album originally released back in 1964 included an instrumental version of &quot;This Boy&quot; called &quot;Ringo's Theme&quot;, and the drummer had some of the best scenes in the movie.  Overall, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was one of the strongest albums the Beatles ever produced, and a must-have -- for fans and non-fans of the band alike.   My only complaint -- this CD was issued in mono.  Stereo versions of the songs were available, although the stereo version of &quot;If I Fell&quot; (which you may find on old vinyl LP's) shows McCartney's voice faltering under the strain toward the end.
B000003S2O|5.0|This monumental tour de force indubitably represents the culmination of what Eno was trying to achieve with the Ambient genre. The sheer brilliance, with which he was able to translate the places he envisaged into their aural equivalents, is nothing short of staggering; he is unquestionably in his element here. With this landmark recording, Eno has created a masterpiece that is illimitably greater than the sum of its parts, and stands amongst the greatest artistic works of the 20th century.<br />(There are a few guest appearances here and there, but they're mostly notable for how Eno incorporates their contributions into the blend - Bill Laswell's ominous rumblings on \\"Lizard Point\\", Jon Hassell furnishing \\"Shadow\\" with his trademark 'vocal trumpet' shadings to great effect, Michael Brook's poignant guitar work on the timeless \\"Dunwich Beach, Autumn, 1960\\".)

B00003CXAR|4.0|Maybe I'm being overcritical.  The film is as great as it ever was; particularly with the clarity of DVD, but I was expecting more &quot;bang&quot; from the DTS version.  I realize that only so much can be done with a 25 year old film and is is not a recently made action film in which you have to have a massive floor-ratteling explosion every 5 minutes or so. My main comment is that DTS did not do much more for this film than the Dolby 5.1 surround sound.
B00005JKO3|5.0|Although El Cid has not been released in DVD to date, I have viewed the film on several occasions in other formats. Based on an epic poem, this film has a complex story-line set in feudal Spain.  The film has richly colored landscapes supporting a story of knights in combat, loyality, threachery, a love affair, the power of friendship earned through virtue, and the importance of duty and honor. The musical score is moving and typical of the period of time in which the film was created, and the costumes are vibrant and help to create the feeling of feudal Spain.  This is an excellent example of a particular film genre. The film is one of Charlton Heston's best performances. His acting is boldly appropriate and the film was an excellent vehicle for a highly competent supporting cast. It is one of the cast of thousands films that should be in every film affectionado's collection.  It is worth viewing for the score, the landscapes and the fight sequences alone. I anxiously await a widescreen DVD release of this important film in digitally restored color, and sound.  This is a film that can be viewed several times without boredom.
B00004RFFI|3.0|I didn't much care for this film when I first saw it on broadcast TV, but the DTS version blew me away (along with the twisters).  The special effects in DTS more than made up for the mediocre acting and rather inane plot.  I didn't much care if the actors survived the tornadoes or not.  Maybe when I watch it again, I will not be quite as taken away by the effects and return to disliking the film.
0312263120|1.0|I have no idea if Dan Brown's other books are as bad as this one.<br />Certainly the Da Vinci Code has gotten good reviews.  In fact,<br />it was on the basis of these reviews that I picked up this book<br />in paperback.  Unfortunately, even by the standards of Tom<br />Clancy, this book is a howler.<br />In a work of fiction we expect that the author invents a plot,<br />characters and setting.  Unless the fictional work is based<br />entirely in a fictional world, I expect that the author will<br />have done at least some basic research, building the plot<br />from easily known fact.  This is certainly not Dan Brown's<br />style.<br />In the opening of the book we find that the NSA is willing<br />to double the industry salary offers of the best and the<br />brightest to assure that they have access to the best talent.<br />This does not resembly any government job I've ever heard of.<br />NSA jobs, like other government jobs, follow government pay<br />scale and are certainly not known for their largess.  The<br />mistakes continue in an opening scene in a government security<br />facility protected by a dome able to withstand a \\"2 megaton\\"<br />nuclear blast.  Then we have near magical computing technology<br />which, darn, is put in danger by a single software developer.<br />There are also egregious slams against the Electronic Frountiers<br />Foundation (EFF) and anyone else who wants to put barriers in the<br />ways of the NSA.<br />In the acknowledgements Brown claims to have corresponded with<br />two cryptographers at the NSA via anonymous remailers.  If this<br />is true, what ever wisdom they attempted to impart seems to have<br />been lost on Brown.  He does not seem to have read basic books<br />like The Puzzle Palace or Applied Cryptography.<br />On top of this shaky plot foundation are predictable characters<br />who are little more than cardboard cutouts.  Even Tom Clancy's<br />worst is better than this.  So my recommendation is leave this<br />insult to dead threes ...
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel's vibrant novel, narrated in vernacular is the story of sixteen year old Indian boy, Piscine Molitar Patel, who is cast away in the Pacific Ocean as the Canada bound ship transporting his family along with their Pondicherry Zoo sinks. Far from being another cliched survivalist story, Pi is accompanied on the lifeboat by a hyena, an orang-utan, a zebra and a tiger named Richard Parker. Pi watches in amazement as the hyena first devours the zebra and then the orang-utan, only to be defeated by the more feral predator, the tiger.<br />Pi's struggle for survival is compounded by the terror of the tiger - a battle of intellect against instinct. Using every available resource, Pi must act intellegently and quickly to keep the ferocious animal at bay while withstanding marine inclemency. Deceptively simple, the tale bespeaks existential realities with unpretentious panache. Martel chooses to prove the existence of God in an era when postmodernists, evolutionary biologists, astronomers and fiction writers are convinced of the opposite - the abrogation of Ultimate Reality by cold Reason. Yet, Reason says Martel is nothing but 'fool's gold'. Belief in 'dry, yeastless factuality' robs us of the faculty to perceive the 'better story'. If the world is a story-like construct diffusing the line between the real and fictive, reason is a poor substitute to God as our mainstay. Martel's God is 'as secular as ice cream' indicated by the diverse religious predilections of the protagonist. The query as to which religion is true becomes redundant.<br />With a boying sense of humor, Martel is revulsively even horrifically entertaining. Martel's breathtaking realism constitutes meticulous detail about animal behavior and interaction. castaway survivalism and overarching human intellect removed from base imperatives that reduce human to animal. The antithetical marriage of the factual and imaginative, the practical and spiritual is crystallized in the form of zoology-religion intermix. Memorable scenes  involve the hyena preying upon the injured zebra; the tiger inquisitively fencing a shark, Pi's urge to drink his own urine and later taste the tiger's feces. Towards the end, Martel sways to Beckett-like dialogue in a coincidental encounter with a blind Frenchman whose cannabalistic designs on Pi are dashed by Richard Parker's silent attack. Absurdism is preceded by a near magic realist experience on an island of floating carnivorous algae which has a Biblical connotation of the loss of innocence in the Book of Genesis.<br />Earlier Martel comments that animals provide a mirror to humans. As Pi consequently becomes more ferocious than Richard Parker, it is the preservation of human sanity that finally guarantees his triumph over adversity. Understanding and manipulating the ways of nature make Pi reign sovereign. The novel shines with original and refreshing similes. The event significance dictating chapter length adds cadence to narrative, which is punctuated by the author tracing back Pi in modern day Toronto as he rearranges his memories on sea.<br />Many novelists painstakingly research their novels, yet few have the capability of fitting information from mismatching domains into perfect jigsaw. Martel transcends with this skill by endowing it with a finale that emphasizes that detail without meaning is purposeless. Indeed, Martel's fundamental idea is not wholly innovative but burrowed from Moacyr Sclair's Max and the Cats (1990). Sclair's book devouts a few pages describing a young German man trapped in a lifeboat with a jaguar, with the purpose to satirize Nazism. This resulted in fervent objections from Brazilians against Pi's Canadian author. Nevertheless, Martel's recycling and rewriting of Sclair's theme escapes any indictment of plagiarism and was given the much deserved Man Booker Prize in 2002, which quelled the controversy. Excellent reading!
0385509456|4.0|Without going into all of the details of the mystery of autism, let me say that this is a truly wonderful, personal narration of a guy named Christopher, with many clever and witty diversions, and yet still a story of heart-rending compassion. Some small bits are a tad tedious, but that's a small price to pay for Mr. Haddon's personal experience and humorously wise tale of a child in pain, striving (almost valiantly) to become one of us... although maybe that's not the smartest of desires.  Give yourself a treat and read this as soon as you can.
B0000033PB|5.0|After taking a long hiatus after recording their previous album (&quot;Love Beach&quot;), ELP made a strong comeback with &quot;Black Moon&quot;.  This CD is packed with top-notch ELP songs that contain Keith Emerson's strong keyboards, Greg Lake's great bass and vocals, and, my favorite, Carl Palmer's unparalleled drums.  Typical of previous ELP albums, this one has several insturmental tracks (&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Changing States&quot;, and &quot;Close to Home&quot;).  Each band member shows their individual talents on these songs.  Also, there are two excellent Greg Lake ballads, &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot; and &quot;Farewell to Arms&quot;.  These songs showcase Greg's outstanding vocal talents and his extreme vocal range.<br />I've been an ELP fan for years, and I'd rate this CD as one of their best.  Pick it up and enjoy some great prog-rock at its best.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|In my opinion, this CD is one of the best that I have ever heard. I love the beats that this group creates and I love the way that they make their voices sound while singing.

B000002UJQ|5.0|After I'd listened to &quot;The Bends&quot; and gotten to know each song on it, I decided to listen to &quot;OK Computer&quot; for the first time. I knew that this one had the most hype surrounding it, but I didn't think I would like it more than its predecessor. I was wrong.<br />A lot of people have said that it takes a few listens to really understand it and appreciate it, or in some cases, just to like it. But I loved it from the first time I heard it. One of the greatest things about &quot;OK Computer&quot; is its ability to be diverse and stay consistently excellent. Look at the reviews on here -- nearly every song is mentioned as someone's favorite. There are no weak points in this album. Whether you like &quot;Airbag&quot; the best, or &quot;Let Down,&quot; &quot;Karma Police,&quot; or &quot;Exit Music (For a Film&quot; (which is personally my favorite), or if you like all of them equally, there will almost undoubtedly be something for you here.<br />I say &quot;almost&quot; because as with any great work of art, there are of course people who don't like it. Some of these people are the ones who go out of their way to disagree with the popular opinion, but it also may not be your style. I can't understand personally how anyone wouldn't like it, but that's my bias. If you have ever liked anything else by this band, you will probably love the album. I recommend it as highly as possible.

0312983867|4.0|Although some of the characters feel like &quot;repeats&quot; from other novels and some incidents that have occurred in prior novels occur in this book, Evanovich still gives her reader a fast-paced, funny read.  Plum is the quintessential bungler and all the more hilarious for it.  Wish there was more developmen t re; a relationship between Stephanie and either Ranger or Morelli.  Things seem to be in limbo with this book.  But if you're looking for a book that's highly entertaining and is a quick read, you can't miss with &quot;Hard Eight&quot;.
B000003TAB|5.0|I mean it when I say this, Incesticide has no bad tracks. From Start to finish, it is a solid album. I thought I wouldnt like the version of 'Polly', cause the origanal kicks butt on Nevermind, but this version is great as well. The only thing I dont like about this record is that its not hard or as heavy as any of the other Nirvana records. But other then that this is great, my favorite song on Incesticide is 'Sliver' its really cool and flows well. 'Aero-Zeppelin' is a fusion of Sweet Emotion by Aerosmiths rythm and Led Zeppelins Rock and Roll, I think! This is not a place for new fans to start but if your gonna get into Nirvana youmust own this I mean its way to good to pass up! This is just as good as Bleach and In Utero, not quite as good as Nevermind though, but it comes very, very close.
B000002GK1|5.0|This was on of my favorite SG albums, even though anything they released is the best. To tell you the truth i never listened to Nirvana, I was always a SG fan. Even w/ their very last release I was still in love w/ the band. This band has proved that they are the masters of grunge. SG takes the cake and eats it w/ this album.
B00009ATIX|3.0|Generally speaking, I usually enjoy films with open endings that leaves the viewer to come to their own conclusions and interpretations of how the story ended. But, in Solaris, (not comparing it to its previous source materials) the ending just left too many unanswered questions making this movie ultimately a letdown. Many movies that have open endings leave you puzzled but still satisfied with the feature. The way Solaris ended, I kind of felt teased and ripped-off in a way. Besides the way the film ended, I did like Clooney's performance as well as the co-stars' preformance in the movie. The story is pretty dramatic, emotional and intriguing. So overall, the film isn't bad, but just kind of feels like a teaser with the way it ends.
B00009UW0N|5.0|JUST READ DOWN TO BARRY(top 500 reviewer) HE GOT IT DOWN PERFECTLY!!!!!
0064471837|5.0|There are many strengths in this novel that make it such a good read; foremost of these is Garth Nix's creativity.  The division between Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom is a fresh treatment of the modern world-fantasy world schism, often hackneyed and overused in many other novels.  Nix also uses many other elements of high fantasy in a new way, such as necromancy and arising from the dead.  I'm fairly sure that Nix invented the description of the seven bells, and this is one of the best usages of magical items I've seen in fantasy literature.  The description of the gates and regions of death is also quite original and clear to understand.<br />There are only two flaws in the book, both not serious enough to prompt a downgrading to four stars.  (If there was a possible 4.5 stars, I would probably opt for that option).  Firstly, the characterization of Sabriel, while complete, did not evoke a complete sympathy in me.  This made it difficult, at times, to understand why she was so pressured or why her own quest was so important.  Secondly, while the description of the necromancer's bells was clear, I found myself having to keep referring back to the descriptions (incidentally, I've memorized that the description of the bells start on page 80 of my version).<br />However, all in all, Nix has written an excellent first novel.  While it does have dark undertones and revolves mostly around necromancy, the dead, and a bit of resurrection, I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to read a bit of original and different high fantasy.

We know about the \\"Real World\\". We can't discover them again.<br />This film is EXACTLY what it needed to be, and was outstanding in every way. I can't wait to get the DVD, so I can start pulling more and more out of it, like I did the first one.
0316666343|2.0|I've heard this book mentioned a lot in press and conversation and everything I'd heard about it was good. The concept of a murdered girl watching her family on earth deal with her death intrigued me. When I finally got to reading it, it was an incredible disappointment. The writer handles death by skipping lightly from subject to subject, going off on tangents in the form of flashbacks as events in the grieving family's life reminds the dead narration character of something from her childhood.<BR><BR>Susie Salmon, the narrator, is murdered by a neighborhood serial killer, and that's where her story begins. The book starts off well enough, with realistic reactions of friends and family. The characters are depicted in varying degrees of detail. Those characters outside the immediate family are largely variations on stock characters, such as the grizzled veteran cop, the playgirl grandma, even the reclusive serial killer. In life, misfit Ruth barely knew the girl, but becomes Susie's best friend after death, which I found a bit odd. The fact that Susie's mother is developed as a character only by minor hints and glances is probably the most artful thing the writer attempted to do in this short novel, and a good effort, but in the end, we still don't know her as well as we ought to. Susie's father is the most graphic representation of grief as he holds on to Susie's memory long after everyone else has moved on. The characters in what Susie calls \\"my Heaven\\" are barely described at all. But details that seem meaningful are handed out, such as Holly, her roommate, taking her name from \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" - we're never told why or what her real name was.<BR><BR>The flow of time is difficult to follow in this novel, because while Susie is observing life on earth after her death, she frequently gets sidetracked in flashbacks of her early childhood. While this could be a constructive method of telling her life story in a series of flashbacks, they are instead deliveredin no particular order and with no unifying theme. The only thing they all have in common is the saccharine-sweet heart-yank that comes from a kid story. Perhaps this is how the author wished to show sentimentality, but all it left me with was a brief description of a family photo album. These scenes went by too fast and randomly for the reader to get attached to any of them. In non-flashback flow, the author lingers too long in the immediate aftermath of Susie's murder. It seems we're shown every day until a certain point, and then we're rushed about 10 years down the road.<BR><BR>The Deus Ex Machina ending for the killer was a bit of a laugh. The plotline was given all along of the tightrope he walked between discovery and concealment. After all the near misses and the evidence being grabbed by Lindsey, all of it came to nothing as the other characters kept just missing him, and none of it was ever resolved. I realize that a major theme of the book was that evil isn't always punished, but in such a case, why let the reader know who did it? Why construe events so that everyone but the cops know who did it? The recurrence of the killer as a character allowed some building of suspense, but with no payoff, the suspense is wasted.<BR><BR>Oh, and the bit about the elbow. Her chopped her up and put her in a bag. But a neighborhood dog found Susie's elbow. I'm wondering how he chopped her so that there was an ELBOW just ready to drop off the bag. Was it a flap of skin from her elbow? The lower part of the humerus with the upper parts of the ulna and radius attached? Why would he make that a separate part? And say it out loud. Elbow. There's something intrinsically silly about it. How are we supposed to feel any of the gravity of the situation when the dog finds an ELBOW? Another thing that rang false was that after so many times Susie tried to contact the world of the living, she is through some unexplained means able to take over the body of her friend-after-death Ruth.And rather than call the police, and tell them where her body is, tell them the story of the murder, she just uses this opportunity to have sex, and nothing more.<BR><BR>Though this isn't truly awful, I can't understand what makes it a bestseller. The writing is mediocre, the story is sappy and too sugar-sweet to be belived at times. In the end, I felt that the book could have been good, and parts of it were fairly decent. But what could have been an interesting study in grief and resolution ended up being a cursory flight down memory lane.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I've read the Lord of the Rings and am pleased to say I thought the Two Towers was excellent!<br />Sure they did cut some scenes and put in new ones BUT after seeing Harry Potter 1 and 2 that this was one of the best from book to movie movies ever! Everyone in the theater was constanly on the edge of our seats.<br />I'm saddend that so many people hate it...what did they expect? Us to sit in the theater for three days?
0375758992|5.0|I was drawn to this book because I am a White person who lived in Africa under Black Rule.<br />Alexandra Fuller got to experience White Rule, the transition to Black Rule, and Black Rule.  But she was a child.  And she remembers how those changes looked to her, how they affected her and her family, and how they molded her.  But always thru the eyes of a child.  A remarkable book.
0688145078|5.0|This book explains it just right! It was a wonderful idea to make a sister version and a brother version of the same book so that each sex can identify better with the gender specific text and illustrations. I found it helpful to introduce this book about 2 months before the new baby arrives. I like how the text plays up the fact that the baby can't do many things that the big brother can do. Therefore, it sets a positive tone for the child to better accept the fact that the new little person is going to need quite a bit of attention (help) from everyone. I am a preschool teacher and when one of my students is about to become the big brother, I always recommend 2 books--\\"I'm a Big Brother\\" to read with the child and \\"The Pocket Parent\\" with hundreds of sanity saving suggestions for Mommy and Daddy. There are a variety of issues and concerns that arise when a new baby comes into the family of a preschooler. Both of these books in their own way help relieve anxiety of parents and children. The books do a great job acknowledging and addressing feelings due to the changes in behavior and routine that are bound to happen with the birth of a new sibling. Keep them handy to be consulted and reread at a moment's notice.
B000063DHL|4.0|These comments are all objective obviously but this album is one of the best Maiden albums made.  Compared to their earlier offerings, it is very strong and shows maturity.  This album was made after the powerslave tour of 1984 - 1985.<br />What I liked about this record are tracks 1 through 5 and 8.  # 6 and 7 I found lacking musical quality.  It's ok, it's difficult to make an all out perfect album.  To me that would be Seventh son of a Seventh son.<br />This album, along w/ others released in that 86 - 87 timeframe influenced many musicians to come.  Imagine, it is 2003, and I can make an assesment of this record, 14 years after I first heard it.  This band delivered strong albums/ kept their fans content, because I never thought that I'd be checking it out all this time after it came out (considering I quit listening to Maiden for about 10 years).<br />Good things bring nostalgia.  And this album is one of those.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Professional movie critics hate this movie.  In other words, regular folk would probably enjoy it.  I certainly did.  Yes, the plot isn't exactly Pulitzer candidate, but it's good enough glue together the excellent action sequences.  Imagine the action sequences of The Matrix done better.  Highly recommended.

B00005JLTN|5.0|I've read a lot on the writhing sex Zion scene where everyone is dancing and NEO and Trinity get it on. Why is it so long? Why all the dancing? Man do they have to hit you over the head...look at what Trinity and Neo are doing. Look at the people who are dancing. I think the scene has more to offer than meets the eye. They are releasing these movies so close to one another for a reason. Just wait for Revolutions.
B00008977N|5.0|Well, first, I am a huge Peter Gabriel fan.  I have been watching the Secret World on VHS for about 9 years and think it is the most amazing rock concert one could hope to see.  Saw Gabriel live last November and I like this video better.  Now, I have been blessed with the DVD.  Second, I am not a videophile or audiophile.  Still, I enjoy a good picture and good sound.  I played this on the DTS audio track on my Yamaha home amp and JVC flat screen TV.  I thought the picture was great and the audio track was awesome.  I often heard very strong bass coming from Tony Levin and do not have a subwoofer.  I commented at the outset that the sync was very good and noticed how often the lips and vocals seemed together.  Now, maybe there are a few places where this is not the case.  But, third, I don't watch a video to see how many mistakes I can find.  Sitback, relax....watch and listen.  This is amazing music from a man who has been and is one of the most creative musical minds around.  When I have a lot of time on my hands, I might do a side by side comparison with the VHS, but not for now.  If you like Peter Gabriel more than a little bit, then get this.
630460288X|4.0|Demolition Man is a fun experience. It's idea of the future is inventive and original and also extremely funny. Stallone stars as John Spotten a cop who is framed by a deadly criminal Simon Phoenix. They both get a frozen inprisonment.  Phoenix escapes while having a hearing years and years later into the future and Spotten gets thored out to stop him. The future cops need Spotten because they aren't used to dealing with violent criminals because there's zero violence in the future.<br /><br />  It's very funny when Stallone finds out there's no toilet paper in the future and these things called the 3 sea shells in place of them. It's also funny when he gets invited to a high class dinner....at Taco Bell. Stallone surprisingly enough handles the comedy very well. Sandra Bullock is extremely cute as Spotten's partner who unlike the other cops of the future is dieing for some action. Wesley Snipes is a lot of fun as well as the crazy Phoenix, it's one of his more memorable roles.<br />  Sure the film doesn't know whether it's an Sci-fi action thriller or a comedy but it still works as one hell of an entertaining movie. The whole cast is in top form so that helped the movie even more.
0451169514|5.0|all that i can say right now is wow. i mean seriously, this story is so multilayered, and so facinating that it's near impossible to put down, and it's something that will never be forgotten. it's not the horror of the story that makes it so memorable, it's how king describes these childrens, and adults lives. it's soo good, i mean you feel like you're part of their club. the movie is horribly cast, the people look nothing like they're described in the book. this book does contain many sex scenes, and a lot of foul language, but who cares, i mean if it's part of the story, then it's part of the story. altough at points the story does drag a little (like in descriptions of the town, and some of the interludes, like 2+3, but not 4+5) it still makes for an amazing story. king packs it with action. i would rate this as not only kings best work, but my favorite book of all time. read it, but put some time aside cause it took me half a summer.
1577311760|2.0|I enjoyed the book, for a time anyways, The Power of Now (it has since degenerated into The Power of Then). But as soon as I heard Tolle's voice, the knowledge and enjoyment I previously had gleaned just kinda' deflated and balloon-farted out the window. His heavily accented German is hard to understand and makes it an effort in heavy concentration to listen to and just peacefully enjoy. My wife was similarly let down upon hearing his somewhat high-pitched and most assuredly not-ready-for-prime-time reciting voice.

B0000039PW|5.0|Simply the most incredible rap album ever. Biggy is unbelievable in every song, and you can't help listening to it over and over. The only song I don't like is friend of mine, and i don't like the $#@! me interlude, but it's still incredible. Best ever, period.
B00005OAIE|1.0|For every person who wants to make love to sweet Johnny, and who says anyone who has anything bad to say about him hasn't given him a chance, I am hear to say, chances he's been given by me, and it's only gotten worse.  <BR>The first song I heard was &quot;No Such Thing,&quot; and all my friends said, &quot;oh that's not a great song, you need to listen to the CD.&quot;  So I did.  When I didn't like the CD, all my friends said, &quot;oh you need to hear his earlier stuff before he got popular.&quot;(Kind of funny how everyone claims they've been listening to this for 2 years, riiiight) So, I did.  WHen I didn't like that, they said &quot;just see him live, you'll be blown away.&quot;  So I did(Somehow twice).  And let me say, my opinion of Mayer has only gotten worse.  Not only did his selfish, cocky, arrogant nature lead him to headine a tour with a far more establish Counting Crows, his live shows are just as trite as the CD's.  Just because you play a 10 minute guitar solo, doesn't mean it's improvisation if it's just stretching the same solo that was on the CD as though it were on repeat(Dave Matthews, are you listening?)  I don't mean to bash him, because, well nevermind I do.  I think this CD is drivel, I think he is quite possibly suffering severly from turrets syndrome(not that there's anything wrong with that, but the fact that millions of girls think it's somehow cute when he's on stage, is)and the fact that I had to sit around with my friends listen to him play, twice, while hearing a shortened set of my favorite band give me no other option.  Wow, I'm angry today.

1590710037|5.0|Are you creative, yet are facing writer's block? Read this book and it'll shake your block loose and help set you free!<br /><br />In this slim volume Stephen Pressfield discusses the inner naysayer we all have within us, also referred to as an inner critic by most writers.This book helps you identify and defeat the negative self talk any creative person must deal with. It does so in a serious tone, sprinkled with lots of humor. For example, the heading of one of his essays is &quot;How To Be Miserable&quot; - it was an essay that had me chuckling. It also had me nodding my head as I recognized myself in what he wrote.<br /><br />Written using a variety of short essays, this book is easy to pick up and read at any point. I read it from the first page to the last, in order. You don't necessarily need to do that to benefit from Stephen Pressfield's wisdom about the inner struggle creative people face from day to day. Read from beginning to end does have it's advantages though -- the author takes aim at resistance, procrastination, rationalization, and finally at the end winning the war. When we win the war of art we are free to create, free to be truly happy.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read on the subject. It helped me identify my own foibles then smash the blocks holding me back. I saw myself in each page and triumphed along with the author. This is an excellent book for any creative person. I highly recommend it.
6305263248|4.0|For some reason this seems to be an easily forgotten movie by many. I'll mention it in conversation, and most people look at me as if to say &quot;Ronin? a movie? with De Niro?&quot; I don't know how this can be though, as it stands out in my mind. De Niro, as usual, is excellent, but the supporting roles by Jean Reno and Sean Bean definitely stand out. Oh, did I mention it has a car chase or two?<br />As car chases go, I always considered the best to be The French Connection and Bullitt, but I think Ronin takes the crown. Part of it is the European setting, where everything is smaller, tighter, and just magnified. The other component is the camera-work, which puts you right in the action. You feel like you're part of the chase, not just a bystander about to be run over.<br />I think this film is one of those easily overlooked gems that you should go out and watch immediately!<br />And for all the silly people that keep wanting to know what was in the case, your homework is to watch Pulp Fiction and look up the word &quot;Macguffin&quot;. I'll expect a report on my desk monday morning! =)
B00005JM1Y|4.0|This is Rowan Atkinson's best leading role, not that this is saying very much.  However, Rowan Atkinson's character is a good-natured buffoon that tries his best, which is a separation from the more selfish character of Mr. Bean.  However, it's impossible to have a complete separation, and we see a lot of skits that Atkinson has already done multiple times in other venues.  <br />Another weakness to this movie is that it is just another spy spoof, akin to the numerous Leslie Nielson movies we have all seen.  It is almost a believable plotline though, which would've made the movie a stronger satire, had not John Malkovich's role had not been so entirely unbelievable.  Needless to say, Malkovich took a weak character and made him worse, and his performance was enough to keep me from wanting to see this movie again. <br />But there are some very funny scenes that make this movie very fun.  There's a hilarious chase scene, along with a series of funny scenes at the headquarters of the secret organization involving Atkinson that left me out of breath.  Atkinson's brilliance along with strong support from the rest of the cast (minus Malkovich) make this movie a worthwhile trip, as long as you keep your expectations low.
0140185232|5.0|This novel analyzes different attitudes toward life.  I found it deeply interesting and at the same time entertaining.  Following Elliot, Larry, and Isabella's life kept my attention, and yet it was the philosophical discussions that I enjoyed the most.  He clearly showed the hollowness of a life lived only in a pursuit of material pleasure.  Money, Social Status, and things did not create happiness.  The novel also shows the bitterness of spurned love.<br />What happens.  Elliot is wealthy and a gentleman with much class.  His social status matters more to him than anything else, and the patheticness of his life is shown at his death.  Isabella and Larry are originally engaged, but separate.  Larry seeks personal peace, while Isabella seeks materialistic satisfaction.  Larry travels the world searching for inner peace and finds it.  Isabella settles for something less, and lives an incomplete life.  The novel is great, its revelations about life are tremendous.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Reactions to this movie can go a lot of ways, because there are a plethora of positives and negatives to be found.  <br />The Good:<br />The action is decent and has the added creativity of using computer enhanced shots for Daredevil's sound wave enhanced sight during the fight scenes.  I liked that the characters had the ability to receive visible, even brutal injuries because it forces them to remain grounded in reality.  The villians are another strong point.  Colin Farrel steals every scene with over the top charisma and hilarious facial expressions, while Michael Clark Duncan just has the perfect head bad guy &quot;look&quot; about him.  Another cool part is a rather innovative first kiss between Daredevil and Electra that comes together as a genuine and unique moment in an otherwise mundane script.<br />The Bad:<BR>     The film seems choppy at times, and all of the interesting characters are wasted as the movie doesn't seem to have much time for development.  The script is little more than &quot;servicable,&quot; which means that conversations are frequently bland.  The main problem here is that of the title character, Ben Affleck.  He has been on and off in other movies, but here it seems like facial expressions and any kind of emotive acting has been thrown out in favor of a performance without substance and feeling.  When I think of Daredevil, I think of of three major characteristics that Affleck doesnt appear to have.  One is athletic ability.  Tobey Maguire became toned and muscular for Spiderman.  Here, Affleck looks to be surrounded by droopy putty with no muscular definition at all.  Secondly, the Daredevil character is supposed to have an intense drive.  Affleck exudes a passive, take things as they come vibe, and his expressions are usually vacant.  A third thing I would expect is some form of fire or passion that makes Daredevil do the things he does, but here, I can only sense that he's tired.<br />Other than that, the movie moves at a reasonablygood pace and is entertaining enough to be enjoyable.  I would have to recommend seeing it on the basis of the excellent villians, some good action, and the innovative kiss.

B000002LRX|5.0|Unlike most people, I bought Angel Dust before The Real Thing. Before I bought it, I saw the 100+ rave reviews for this album on Amazon. This is the only album I have ever bought without hearing a single note of music from. But when I heard it I was very impressed. Angel Dust has grown on me ever since my first listen. I then bought The Real Thing by Faith No More and California by Mike Patton's other band, Mr. Bungle. <BR> <BR> The first thing I noticed after listening to the entire album was how Mike Patton has so many voice styles. Near the end of the first song, \\"Land of Sunshine,\\" he sounds like an opera singer. On songs like \\"Caffeine\\" and \\"Smaller and Smaller\\" he belts out some pretty demonic screams. Then on tracks like \\"Kindergarten\\" and \\"Be Aggressive\\" he shows off his rapping ability. And on heavier tracks like \\"Malpractice\\" and \\"Jizzlobber\\" his voice reaches near death metal roar. On \\"RV\\", he sounds like Tom Waits. And on \\"MidLife Crisis\\" he exhibits a sort of growl/rap. The musicians in Faith No More are also good. The guitarist Jim Martin is not bad although his riffs are a bit simple. The bassist, Billy Gould is very good and plays a little bass solo in the song \\"Kindergarten\\". The keyboardist, Roddy Bottums uses his keyboard to create an environment and a mood for the music. And the drummer, Mike Bordin plays unique tribal rhythms which are also quite complex. <br />Every song is good. Here is a rundown of the album tracks:<br />Land of Sunshine: This is a strange yet very enjoyable song that incorporates a thumping bassline and some lyrics that were taken from a Scientology questionnaire and fortune cookies. There are also occasional outbursts of mad laughter from Mike Patton. A<br />Caffeine: This is one of the heavier songs. It is opened up by monkeys. It contains the only real swear on the album. This song was conceived during a sleep deprivation experiment. Though it is harsher than most of the album's songs it is still good. A<br />MidLife Crisis: I loved this song on first listen and I still love it. It has a strange style of rap in the verses and a soaring melodic chorus. Great song. A+<br />RV: This is a song about white trailer trash. It is backed by a piano and has amusing or disgusting(depending on how you look at things) lyrics. Quite catchy. A<br />Everything's Ruined: This song starts out with a piano and moves into a great song that is about a boy who is \\"counterfeit\\". The story is told from the view point of the boy's parents. One of the best on the album. A+<br />Malpractice: This is the worst song on the album. It's still quite good but is not up to par with the rest of the album. I like the mellow part of the song a lot though. It also has plenty of time signature changes and has lyrics about someone who likes having a surgeon's hands inside his or her body. B+<br />Kindergarten: This is a rap/rock song. It has a bass solo and a cool keyboard melody. Patton's shows he is also a very good rapper. Great song and probably the best of the album. A+<br />Be Aggressive: This song is about oral sex and was written by Roddy Bottoms not Mike Patton. The cheerleader chorus is very catchy and the rapping is good. Another great track off the album despite its sexually explicit lyrics. A+<br />A Small Victory: This is a song with oriental keyboard melody. It is also very enjoyable. I believe this was one of the singles off Angel Dust. I can tell why FNM chose it. One of the best on the album. A+<br />Crack Hitler: This is a disco type song about a crack dealer who thinks he is Hitler or something like that. The guitar effects are quite impressive. There is something that sounds like a Nazi march in this. The song sounds like it's from a spy movie. A<br />Jizzlobber: This is probably the most intense on the album. It sounds quite dark. Sounds almost like Korn (who were influened by FNM) at times but it is a hell of a lot better. It is the longest on the album and clocks in at around 6:34. It is also one of the best. A+<br />Midnight Cowboy: This is a peaceful, serene cover of a movie's theme music. Contrasts greatly from the chaotic \\"Jizzlobber\\". Good album closer. A<br />This album is a musical journey that can change your mood with each song. I really have no idea why it was such a \\"failure\\". It is the best Faith No More album and is the best Mike Patton album I have heard so far. If you don't own this you should go buy it. Listen to it with an open mind.
B0000931QR|5.0|If you are looking for an upbeat, positive CD this summer full of innocent dreams in a fast-paced world, don't miss &quot;Lo Que Te Conte Mientras Te Hacias La Dormida.&quot; Amaia and the gang return triumphantly with an album that maintains their style, yet charms us with a uniqueness that leaves us hooked again.  With new sounds found in samples like &quot;Geografia&quot; with rings of the Spanish-language world beyond Spain to the LODVG traditional romantic sound in &quot;Tu y Yo&quot;, the gang continues to deliver.  You'll be happy to encounter an album that speaks of the daily trivia of life, without the needless obscenities and extreme effort that a lot of artists seem to need these days.
B000002540|5.0|After a magnificent debut album, Blue Oyster Cult's two succeeding studio albums suffered from excellent material sounding as though it been cut in a huge hurry between concert gigs, minus the stage ambience that enhanced and amplified the band's hyperkinetic, craftsmanlike playing style (the knitting of their guitars and keyboards had always set them apart from the usual pound-sound heavy metal) and strikingly arrayed songs. This was one heavy metal band that concentrated as much on music structure as they did on blast and flash and weren't afraid to let a little lyricism or melodism run around loose. What a surprise, then, that the most full-sounding Blue Oyster Cult album in their pre-&quot;Agents of Fortune&quot; period would be a live album. With a few slight re-arrangements - the added intro/bridge of &quot;Subhuman,&quot; the cheeky finale bridge for &quot;Seven Screaming Dizbusters&quot; (with singer Eric Bloom's smartass parody of Mickey and Sylvia's &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; repartee), the thundercrack, soaring four-guitar-and-bass midsection of &quot;ME 262,&quot; the eerie synthesiser support for an extended guitar solo (and a pretty one) on Donald (Buck Dharma) Roeser's early master ballad, &quot;Then Came The Last Days of May&quot; - and a couple of clever covers (especially the oddly atmospheric &quot;I Ain't Got You&quot;), the Cult delivered a setful of the exuberant, insouciant slash that made them such an in-person favourite even when their recordings weren't selling accordingly. <br />Interestingly, the band divided the selections almost evenly from their first three albums: three from &quot;Blue Oyster Cult&quot; (including a speedball-accelerated &quot;Before The Kiss, A Redcap&quot; and &quot;Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll&quot;), three from &quot;Tyranny and Mutation,&quot; and three from &quot;Secret Treaties,&quot; the aforesaid pair of covers, and the concert favourite &quot;Buck's Boogie.&quot; For the latter, Roeser and keyboardsman Allen Lanier trade off on some whip-it solos before Lanier eases back to play support-and-push for the guitarist's galloping flights. It could have been a washout of self-indulgence but wasn't; Roeser was always too sensible and tasteful a player for that (he was nothing if not the most underrated guitarist of his breed), and it didn't hurt that the band could and did keep up with him and keep him anchored as well as they did.<br />As a kind of wrap-up to their early era (they were already at work on the music that would become &quot;Agents of Fortune,&quot; determined to take the kind of care with it that they took with their first album, avoiding the rush job of the second two), &quot;On Your Feet or On Your Knees&quot; was as good as it got and then some. For a band whose strength was as much their concert style as their recordings, Blue Oyster Cult would never again put forth a live album (there were two yet to come, the disappointing &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; and the inconsistent &quot;Extraterrestrial Live&quot;) equal to this one's elemental sophistication of power and sensibility.
B00005JLET|5.0|Yes, I too was blown away by &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. However, I'm beginning to get a little annoyed by all these people who say you really can't appreciate it unless you've watched the Japanese version. This movie is too beautiful to watch to waste my time reading sub-titles. And then there are all the people who say the over-dubbing was horrible. I thought it was pretty good myself. You can get away with alot more in an animated film than one that is live-action. And personally, I don't ever want to hear another actress do Chihiro besides Daveigh Chase. For me, Daveigh's voice was one of the things that endeared me to Chihiro. (I was a little taken aback to learn that she played the creepy Samara in &quot;The Ring&quot;.) I thought all of the voices were great. For those of you who don't like sub-titles, don't worry about the dubbing. The English language version is great.
0316776963|5.0|'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is my first exposure to the work of David Sedaris, and it will surely not be my last. It's a book which is consistently humorous throughout, and at times devastatingly accurate in it's assassination of character flaws, delusions of grandeur, and idiocy in general - quite often of which is the authors own.<br />The magic of Sedaris' writing, is, that while he can make light of normally heart-breaking subjects like drug addiction or the death of his mother, it's only when he describes his ordeal of trying to flush a 'big-boy' - (not his own), that you begin to feel sympathetic. He treats everything with the same level of amusement without going over the top. Some writers of humour are extremely witty and insightful but they don't really make you laugh. Sedaris is one of few that has the gift of inciting genuine laughter without seemingly trying too hard - and for that he has my full endorsement. Keep 'em coming David.
B000003S09|5.0|This is the original prog rock album. It has 43 minutes of music.<br />\\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" - prog-rock blueprint: monstrous riff, searing electric guitar, intricate rhythms, wailing saxophone, cool lyrics<br />\\"I Talk To The Wind\\" - ballad with low-key vocals, plus flute<br />\\"Epitaph\\" - moody song, reminds me of Moody Blues and early-ELP<br />\\"Moonchild\\" - begins with a hazy medieval lyric backed by flute and drum, segues into free-form quiet mellotron/electric guitar/vibes/drum, etc. which continues for rest of 12-minute song (listen to on headphones), then segues into....<br />\\"The Court Of The Crimson King\\" - a dramatic, heavy finale!!!!! similar to the very best ELP songs.

B000002J1L|5.0|Nursery Cryme is a classic prog album with 40-minutes of solid music. Peter Gabriel is the lead vocalist.

B000092ZYX|5.0|it made me ill to read some of the other reviews... you may have read them...you know...one star, thom is too whiny, all he talks about is the president and post 9/11...and all he does is whine about it.  and then someone said there was NO EMOTION.  was I the only one who listened to the song \\"I Will\\"?  he sounded as though he were about to cry.  <br />anyway, the album is great.  songs like \\"2+2=5\\" and \\"Go to Sleep\\" are great rock songs, while \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\", \\"Backdrifts\\", and \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" are quite unique songs.  lyrically, i don't see that even MOST of this album is political.  only a few songs, and PARDON the man for having an opinion.  and to think, he actually shared it with us!  what a monster!  <br />anyway (again), pick this up if you don't own it.  it blows sorry discs like ok computer out of the water (if you wish to know more, read my ok computer review).
B00005JM1F|1.0|I must say that I had an enormous expectation for this movie. It was sold out everywhere and I heard that it was fantastic. So I finally got it and went straight home to see it and in the beginnig I was excited and the minutes started to pass and nothing funny was happening. So after one hour I started to skip the scenes to see something good but actually never happened.<BR>This movie doesn't have a strong argument, it's supposed to be unrated but I never saw a scene with something &quot;unrated&quot;, it's terrible it has some good ideas but the directores and producers didn't know how to develop them.<BR>I strongly DON'T recommend this &quot;movie&quot;.
B0000057C5|5.0|this is an album of industrial bliss.  much better, yet easier to chew on than their first disc, it is a must have for industrial and metal fans alike.  hard, yet quite melodic at times, it will keep you interested from start to finish.  favorite tracks:  1, 6, 7.
0385504209|5.0|Yes, some of the facts are inaccurate, the romantic points of the story are a waste of time (don't worry there aren't too many of them), and the ending is disappointing.<br />  However, I found this book to be very engaging from the start and built up enough momentum a long the way that the ending and other &quot;flaws&quot; seemed to be of little consequence.<br />  Dan Brown provides enough solid facts to compensate for those that seem to be skewed in the name of plot development. Had the author taken the time to explain every side of every arguement the characters make in regards to history the book would have not moved nearly as fluidly.  Remember, this book is meant to be read for enjoyment, not to base your college thesis off of. In the end the reader is left with a heightened interest in the works of art and groups mentioned in this book and has been entertained in the process.<br />  If you are looking for a fun book to read this is a great choice.  It moves you along quickly and keeps your interest.  It may cause you to want to review some history and I think that it is wonderful when a book helps to develop new interests.

B000063UR2|5.0|... because without them we probably wouldn't have the Director's Cut of such an amazing, and vastly underrated film. If you've watched the US release, you cannot understand the true Otherworldly essence this movie contains, not only due to the music score, but also the different scene cuts. However, it was very interesting to watch both versions, as the US and the Director's Cut are both on this \\"Ultimate Edition\\" DVD set.<br />Tangerine Dream's score is interesting - electronica, ELO style (if you've seen \\"Xanadu\\", you will probably know what I mean), but lacking real depth. Jerry Goldsmith's score truly captures every magical moment throughout the film, and really brings to life not only the scenery, but also the emotions of the characters (and viewers).<br />The US cut also destroys much of the basic premise of the story - the idea that pure innocence can destroy pure evil. The US cut implies Jack and Lili (made only a Lady in this version, not the Princess of the European release) are already having a sexual relationship at the begining of the film. How can she be considered 'pure' (in traditional fairytale style) if she is having sex (implied or not)? This is but one of the many jarring edits made to this film, which have been rectified in the Director's Cut.<br />I deifinitely urge anyone to watch this edition - there are not enough true fairytales captured on the big screen for children anymore, and the depth of ideas also makes it enjoyable for adults. Besides, it has Tim Curry as Darkness, the devil - how can you say no to that?<br />Watch it. Adore it. Feel the magic, and believe.

B00003XACV|5.0|After listening to this music, Thomas Newman soon became my all-time favorite composer. He uses a different style and so many different sounds and rhythms than other composers. When you listen, you do not feel like you're watching a movie in your head or missing part of some message. This music stands alone. It is powerful and moving. It's emotional and fun. <br />Your music collection is incomplete without this score.

0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin is an award winning author, for many books (just read about his awards on the back). He's even worked at Hollywood. This author knows how to captivate and audience and leave them begging for more. <br />Unlike other fantasy books, Martin uses subtle sorcery that seems more mysterious (whereas in other books charaters use &quot;magic&quot; like its some machine gun they can fire openly). His plot and the characters are brilliantly set up. Each one is unique- you have lords, ladies, children and even a dwarf. It has everything a book needs- compulsion, tragedy, perspective, mystery and dialogue that will keep you thinking and imagining. <br />This is the start of one of the greatest series in epic fantasy. I say drop everything and get this book now. Lord of the Rings is a classic and in a league of its own. Song of Ice and Fire will probably be the &quot;new classic.&quot; When this series is over, there will be only two in the genre- &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire.&quot; Everything else is just a book.

B00008S2VG|3.0|Not only sounds Madonna like a robot, the new Che Guevara-war style with accompanying ideas and lyrics gives the whole packet an un-human atmosphere.<br />#1 AMERICAN LIFE **: Definitely not the best track on the album. Madonna seems to have sunk to deep depths, at least lyrically. The music is just mediocre.<br />#2 HOLLYWOOD *****: In my opinion the best track on the album. Instantly catchy, this could-have-been hit wants to be heard many times.<br />#3 I'M SO STUPID ***: This song will be remembered as the IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII song. The beginning of this song is indeed very cool. The rest of it is just so-so.<br />#4 LOVE PROFUSION ***: A decent track, but not very spectacular. Up-tempo I Deserve It (Music 2000).<br />#5 NOBODY KNOWS ME *: Not worth listening. It just seems to go nowhere, and there is no feeling in this song.<br />#6 NOTHING FAILS *****: 2nd best track, offers everything that you'd expect from a Madonna-song. But forget the lyrics. She offends many of her christian fans here.<br />#7 INTERVENTION ***: LOVE PROFUSION PART II... not very remarkable but worth a couple of listens. It's just very normal.<br />#8 X-STATIC PROCESS ****: One of the better songs, because it really pops-out in in its tranquillity, although it becomes worse after each listen.<br />#9 MOTHER AND FATHER ****: 3rd best track, and, exceptionally, pleasant lyrics (Madonna about her dead mother and neglecting father). Very up-beat, reminds me a bit of Hollywood.<br />#10 DIE ANOTHER DAY ***: A good track, but without those brilliant beats it wouldn't be nearly as half so good. Lyrics don't make sense.<br />#11 EASY RIDE **: Not really interesting. Madonna wants to have a more balanced album, after all the madness, it seems. Don't listen this for the so-called spiritual lyrics, instead, listen to the beats.<br />Conclusion: Most songs will be forgotten soon, but the songs Hollywood, Nothing Fails and Mother And Father are worth buying the album. Last note: don't buy ifyou just liked Ray Of Light 1998, and the slower tracks on Music (I Deserve It and Gone).
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I saw Gavin Degraw live before his CD was released.  I really wanted to get the CD, but I worried that it would pale in comparison to his live performance.  However, this CD really lived up to my expectations.  Degraw has a very gritty voice--somewhat of an acquired taste--but once you get used to it, you really fall in love with the songs.  There has been a tendency to lump him together with artists like John Mayer, but he has a very unique sound and voice.  My personal favorite songs on this album are Overrated, Nice to Meet you Anyway, Follow Through, and More Than Anyone.  Of course, no CD is without its low points.  Personally, I always skip Chemical Party when it comes on.  The song just doesn't do it for me.  Other than that, Chariot is a great album and I expect bright things in Gavin Degraw's future.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride is the reigning CMA female vocalist and with good reason!! Martina has the most powerful voice of any singer in any genre. Her songs are beautiful and they have meaning. Martina is all about empowering women and bringing up issues that are real such as domestic violence, addiction, and child abuse. There is such comfort in her voice. A friend recommended this cd to me and I was hooked ever since. This cd is a great introduction to Martina and has some of her biggest hits. If you are looking for another M cd I would recommend &quot;Evolution&quot;.

B00007E8V4|5.0|Okay, besides this cd being my favorite at the moment (along with Toxicity and System of a Down), the reason the song 36 has its name is because if you line up every track from Suite-pea to Streamline (going through all 3 cds including the hidden track, Arto, on Toxicity) 36 is the 36th song they have done. Also, Serj is turning 36 this year. The lyrics make sense. Oh, don't steal this album...BUY IT!!!
0060926317|1.0|At first read, this is the fictional story of an American woman who is adopted by a group of aboriginals in the Australian desert, and journeys with them across the country, learning and assimilating the culture of these Real People on the way.  Yet beneath the surface this novel is much more than that.  That much is evident alone from the immense controversy it has generated, and the strongly contrasting passions of praise or criticism it has aroused.  Why all the fuss?<br />Its because of the thinly veiled message that the author conveys with her story.  The story itself is not even that well written, but more important than the story is the message.  Marlo Morgan is convinced that there is something wrong with the people of the modern world, which she describes as mutants, in contrast to the aboriginal Real People who are Gods first people, the only true human beings left on the planet.  But Morgan goes a step further when she presents the lifestyle of the Real People as the answer to the problems of mankind.  By following the principles of the Real People, Morgan proclaims that paradise is possible. Mans own saviour is himself.  Mankind can save themselves from evil, and create paradise on earth.<br />Essentially this is new age philosophy rather thinly disguised, plain and simple, the new age gibberish of modern times.  Not surprising, theres also mention of typical new age techniques like palm reading, mental telepathy, and healing.  Conveniently, the Real People are mouthpieces for Morgans own new age philosophy, and cleverly lend an authority and credibility to her ideas that would not be present if she were to just proclaim it herself.<br />As a result, this book is much more than an interesting story.  Morgan makes no secret that she wants the world to adopt the practices of the Real People.  They made me their spokesperson and she is the mutant messenger preaching the Real Peoples gospel.  By the conclusion of the book, the proclamation of the new age gospel becomes increasingly explicit. We do not judge the Mutants.   We pray they will look closely at their actions, at their values, and learn before it is too late that all life is one.  We pray they will stop the destruction of the earth and of each other.  We pray there are enough Mutants on the brink of becoming real to change things.  We pray the Mutant world will hear and accept our messenger.  Its evident that Marlo Morgan wants us all to become converted new agers, seek salvation from within ourself, and so bring about paradise on earth.  Essentially her story is the good news to mankind, a new age Bible, disguised as a novel.<br />Its a clever idea, because what Marlo Morgan has essentially done is wrap the central tenets of new age philosophy in a package, and cloaked them with the apparent authority of an ancient aboriginal tribe hidden in the desert.  The authority cannot be challenged because the tribe is in hiding and about to vanish forever.  Its all very wonderful - if its true.  But what if the story isnt true and the Real People dont even exist?  The authenticity of the events she describes critically important: is the emperor really wearing any clothes or not?<br />It doesnt take much to see that the emperor doesnt have any clothes, and to realize that the story is a fabrication.  Morgan  an American - gives herself away by attributing several characteristics to the Real People that are distinctly North American rather than Australian, such as the use of spider-webs as dreamcatchers and headresses with feathers (concepts familiar to North American Indians, but completely foreign to Australian aboriginals). As an Australian myself, its easy to see that many claims she makes about aboriginals and Australia are simply untrue.  There is a complete lack of substantial corroborative evidence for the events Morgan describes. Not surprisingly, the book has sparked loud cries of outrage from Australian aboriginals, who calling it an insulting hoax, and claim that there is no evidence that Marlos journey ever took place.  A group of aboriginal leaders even received support from the Australian government to travel to North America to prevent the book from becoming a movie.  In response to the outcry from Aboriginals at their culture being exploited and misrepresented in order to endorse new age ideas to gullible Americans, Marlo Morgan has reportedly apologized and acknowledged that her apparent experiences were fiction and a fraudulent fabrication.<br />Ultimately the ideas of the Real People about consciousness and positive thinking are just too conveniently identical those proclaimed by contemporary new age gurus.  Todays new age prophets  not the Real People  are the real inspiration behind this book, and those with a passion for new age ideas and an ignorance about Australia are its victims.  Cloaking modern new age ideas with the apparent authority of an ancient people is a mean and nasty trick, but the prudent will see through the deceit and realize the naked truth that the emperor isnt wearing any clothes and he isnt very pretty.  The gospel of the mutant messenger is a false gospel, its prophet a false prophet. There really is no need to go on a vicarious journey with Marlo Morgan and be enlightened, because her apparent enlightenment is only another form of spiritual darkness.  Certainly there are problems with our modern world, and Morgan has highlighted some of them, but the answer to this darkness is not a false gospel, but the true gospel which alone gives the lasting solution to sin.  Its prophets do not proclaim the emperors new clothes, but about the kings clothes, clothes of righteousness which offer lasting salvation for all who believe. -GODLY GADFLYng it an insulting hoax, and claim that there is no evidence that Marlos journey ever took place.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Based on Sylvia Nasar's biography of the mathematical genius John Forbes Nash (born 1928), winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics for his revolutionary game theory, `A Beautiful Mind' recounts Nash's struggle with genius and with schizophrenia.  Frequently and incorrectly confused with multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia involves seeing delusions.  In real life the nature of Nash's delusions during his time of illness have been largely forgotten by him, and in this regard the screen-writer has taken the liberty to fictionally recreate delusions revolving around three imagined characters: a representative of the US Defence who convinces Nash to act as a code-breaker by examining popular magazines for hidden Russian codes giving clues about an imminent nuclear attack, an imagined college room mate and his young orphaned niece.<br /><br />But the real power of this movie is that it enables viewers to get inside the mind of a schizophreniac by making these delusions real and presenting them as an alternate reality.  Nash's inner landscapes are presented as real to the audience, just as they are real to those with schizophrenia, and we are drawn convincingly into his world.  Suddenly, the plot takes an abrupt turn as both movie viewers and Nash are robbed of these delusions by having the rug pulled from under them and confronted with reality.  For Nash the experience is even more terrifying - he ends up in a psychiatric hospital.  To say more would spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but it's enough to say that the experience of the movie is like the experience of the disease.  It's a brilliant concept that successfully enables us to empathize with Nash.  \\"Imagine that you would suddenly have learned the peoples and places and moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been.\\"  The movie's success is enhanced by the brilliant acting of Russell Crowe as John Nash, in a performance of pathos in the same category of the memorable acting of Rainman and Forrest Gump; and a delightful soundtrack by James Horner with haunting vocals by Charlotte Church.<br /><br />But this movie is just as much the story of Nash's wife Alicia (in an award winning performance by Jennifer Connelly) as it is about Nash.  Despite his mental problems, she sticks by him and her love and commitment to him says a great deal about what marriage is really all about. Nash's words in the acceptance speech of his Nobel Prize point to her love as the real source of his endurance in the struggle, and it is her love that this movie is about just as much as it is about Nash's genius and illness.  This positive portrayal of marriage and of the undying love of a wife is a welcome change from the typical infidelity offered by Hollywood.  Her love is just as beautiful as Nash's mind.<br /><br />Parents should be aware that there are some incidents of blasphemy and sexual talk.  But the themes of this movie in dealing with the complexity of schizophrenia are clearly adult anyway.  Not only does it result in greater appreciation for John Nash, but also greater understanding and compassion for schizophrenia - even if the portrayal of Nash's life is not entirely accurate.  There are moral and historical flaws, but there's still tremendous beauty.  `A Beautiful Mind' is a beautiful film that was deservedly rewarded for its beauty with several Oscars (including Best Picture), and if you're a fan of serious movies your life will be enhanced by viewing it.  If only more films had this kind of beauty. -GODLY GADFLYhe memorable acting of Rainman and Forrest Gump; and a delightful soundtrack by James Horner with haunting vocals by Charlotte Church.<br /><br />But this movie is just as much the story of Nash's wife Alicia (in an award winning performance by Jennifer Connelly) as it is about Nash.

B00005JKZV|5.0|Now I am not a Tolkien Purist by any means, not even close.  I know they had to change the story around somehow or another to fit it in a movie.  The director realized that peoples attention span for movies is not that long, so 3 hours is a stretch.  The bottom line is that changes had to be made, thus the reason they willl have the extended versions, all 2 or 3 of them.  For the average movie person this movie works, it has drama, fighting, great special efffects and a plot that moves along and can be followed.   The book is essentially telling 3 stories at once and when you try to tansfer it to screen that presents a huge challlenge.  The Director did the right thing by changing some stuff or leaving scenes out for the extended versions, otherwise they would never had made a profit from the whole thing.<BR>   If you liked the first one or like the mythology/fantasy style you can not go wrong with this movie, it is a masterpiece even in the theatrical form.  Great story line, awesome special effects, some humor, some drama and huge fight scenes that make your jaw drop.  I will be getting the extended edition for sure, but for those who do not want a 4 hour edition pick this up and enjoy.
B00005PJ8O|4.0|Don't be mistaken: this classic war movie is not so much about war as it is about a man: General George S. Patton, arguably America's greatest Second World War combat general.  Based on two books about Patton (\\"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph\\" by Ladislas Farago and \\"A Soldier's Story\\" by General Omar Bradley), the movie explores the war within his soul, and the temperament that was his undoing and yet brought him unprecedented success. Limited to his military career between early 1943 and late 1945, it's more of a character study than a biography.  But with a running time close to three hours, it's a character study with tremendous depth.<br />Several aspects of his character are highlighted.<br />1. Patton was fiercely competitive.  His race to beat British Field Marshall Montgomery to Messina and then to Berlin becomes a prime motivator for success, even if he needs to sacrifice men to achieve his personal ambitions.<br />2. Patton loved war and thrived on the heat of battle.  While his compatriot General Omar Bradley did his job because he was trained to do it, Patton did it because he loved it. \\"I love it, God help me, I do love it more than my life.\\" Patton had no political ambitions, and his only fear was that the war would have no role for him: \\"All I want to do is command an army in combat.\\" As his German opposites observed, \\"The absence of war will kill him.\\"<br />3. Patton was a passionate military historian.  His love for military battles of the past constantly becomes evident: \\"Patton is a 16th century man, a romantic warrior lost in contemporary times.\\"<br />4. Patton was intensely religious.  He believed in both God and reincarnation, and was convinced that the lines of history were in place for him to achieve great things, and that God would enable him to fulfil his destiny - \\"The last great opportunity of a lifetime and I'm left out of it? God will not allow it to happen.\\"  Yet his fierce religious fervour towards God was juxtaposed by his profanity towards men.  He frequently blasphemed, one incident in particular bringing out these conflicting qualities, when in reply to a question about the regularity of his Bible reading, Patton remarks \\"Every God-damned day.\\"  It's been said that the raw language typical of Patton is even toned down in the movie (he supposedly once said \\"You can't train a platoon without using profanity\\").  Yet his inclination toward profanity is not excused, but is presented as part of a larger problem he had in controlling his tongue.<br />5. Patton was inspirational.  He knew it was natural for soldiers to fear battle, and combated this with a fierce military discipline that made the soldiers fear him instead.  \\"They'll lose their fear of the Germans ... I hope to God they never lose their fear of me.\\"  \\"I won't have cowards in my army.\\"  The inspiring and bloodthirsty monologue that opens the movie with Patton dwarfed by the American flag is unforgettable: \\"No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.\\"<br />6. Patton himself lacked the discipline he expected of his soldiers.  His moments of lax self-control led him to say and do things that got him into serious trouble with both his superiors and allies.<br />These last aspects are especially important.  The movie almost has the aura of a convincing documentary, because it paints Patton with his virtues and vices. This is one of the movie's strengths: it portrays Patton as he was, with both strengths and weaknesses, without openly glorifying or condemning them.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner stated in 1970 \\"We are not defending General Patton, and we are not attacking General Patton.  We are really telling the true story of one of the most fabulous and interesting characters that I have ever observed in action.\\"  More than anything else, it's a serious study of his complex character.  This war within the man overshadows the war outside the man.  Patton was his ownworst enemy, his big mouth frequently getting him into trouble, and resulting in him being relieved from his command on more than one occasion. Great as he was, he was not without weaknesses, but his failings are shown without excusing them.  In fact, Patton's weaknesses were the reason Eisenhower opted to advance General Omar Bradley ahead of Patton, although Patton was always his first choice when a brash military leader on the field was needed for a particularly bold mission. Despite his weaknesses, Patton was truly inspirational to those who served beneath him and the importance of his contribution to the Allied success is undeniable.<br />At times the story goes beyond the man, with a broader focus on the war effort.  First Patton and Montgomery vie for success against Rommel in Sicily, and then again in Europe.  But the war scenes are always on a large scale, with wide angle shots of explosions, tanks and masses of infantry, rather than individual experiences of horror.  In the end, it is not the world war that is center stage, but the complex character of the man Patton, and the war between his passions.  George C. Scott's performance as Patton is brilliant and one of the memorable performances in cinema.  It's not surprising that the movie went on to win seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  It has that epic \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" feel, and it serves of a lasting testament to the confusing personality of a strange yet important military leader: Patton himself. -GODLY GADFLYworst enemy, his big mouth frequently getting him into trouble, and resulting in him being relieved from his command on more than one occasion.

B00009NHC5|3.0|&quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; has Audrey Hepburn playing Suzie, a blind woman who is victimized by a trio of men after a doll stuffed with heroin turns up in her apartment. Richard Crenna plays the most deceitful of the &quot;baddies&quot;.<BR>TRANSFER: Warner has done a rather average job of mastering the film for DVD.  Colors are dated, at times faded.  Fine detail tends to get lost during the night scenes in a sea of undistinguished black levels, while certain darker scenes also suffer from excessive film grain.  Flesh tones are not accurate and reds appear more orange than red.  Overall, a boring video presentation, though edge enhancement and pixelization are kept to a bare minimum.  The audio is mono and strident.<BR>Extras: A featurette with producer Mel Ferrer sharing his favorite memories and the original theatrical trailer.  <BR>BOTTOM LINE: This is a worth while thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  But the transfer may have you falling asleep.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The plot of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels has already proven itself over time - in this trilogy of movies by director Peter Jackson it just needed to be brought successfully to the screen.  The second installment of the series, `The Two Towers', at least equals and perhaps even surpasses `The Fellowship of the Ring.'  The two highlights in my view were firstly the incredible portrayal of Gollum, both his internal turmoil as well as his wretched creature-like body (with the brilliant help of CGI technology); and secondly the epic battle of Helm's Deep that concluded the movie with a cast of thousands.  Unlike the first movie, overall the tone is darker and there is significantly more violence and action, but not with a focus on gory instead of glory.  Thankfully it does not degenerate to the distasteful gore and gratuitous bloody violence that marks much contemporary action movies.  Other memorable aspects were the majestic New Zealand scenery, and the portrayal of an overwhelming sense of evil in connection with the forces of Sauron and Saruman.<br /><br />It is only to be expected that some changes need to be made to the plot in order to condense an epic story into just three hours.  However I was disappointed that unlike the first movie, Jackson appears to have made some adjustments to Tolkien's original that were simply unnecessary and unjustifiable, particularly the antagonism of Faramir, the portrayal of the Ents, as well as the incorporation of some extra drama involving Aragorn at the end of a battle, and the infusion of too much romance not present in the original.  You don't need to be a Tolkien purist to find these kind of unnecessary changes somewhat annoying.<br /><br />But once one gets over the initial shock of the adjustments to Tolkien, this is still a brilliant movie.  The setting of Middle Earth, along with its characters and epic war really comes alive.  This may be fantasy, but the choices and struggles are very human and very real.  Perhaps this is most obvious with Sam's wise words at the end: \\"There's some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for.\\"  This is as true for real life as it is for Tolkien's world.  It's also true of the movie itself: in a world of cinematic garbage, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings show that there is still some good left in this world, and these are movies worth fighting for. -GODLY GADFLYthis is most obvious with Sam's wise words at the end: \\"There's some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for.\\"  This is as true for real life as it is for Tolkien's world.

0451191153|1.0|I have just finished reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead\\" back to back, and man, am I glad I'm finally finished. I had to check them out to see what all the hype was about, and it's clear that many of the comments here about Rand being a bit mentally afflicted were definitely true. You actually feel dirty reading some of this stuff. It's that sick.<br />What disturbs me most about Rand's novels is her twisted idea of romantic love. The heroines are frigid, emotionless robots who only enjoy sexual encounters if they're being treated like garbage the whole time. They're slapped, shoved and snatched around, their arms are being twisted, and they love it. They wouldn't have it any other way. It's disgusting. Dominique Francon seems to only enjoy it if she's lying completely still and unresponsive the whole time. The heros are also cold and robotic, except they enjoy knocking the women around. It's completely joyless. If Rand was trying to create erotic love scenes, she sure missed the mark. When the couples are just spending time together outside of the bedroom, they talk about how the woman enjoys being treated as the man's property because the man is just so perfect and godlike. Otherwise each one seems to just intuitively know what the other is thinking. There is no playfulness, no laughter, no anger or tenderness or any other genuine feeling involved, as you'd have in an actual relationship. They feel no actual need for each other, because that would be weak, so they drift in and out of each other's lives over periods of several years. This is Rand's idea of being in love? Obviously she never experienced the feeling. Because of this, you can't bring yourself to care whether the two \\"soulmates\\" get together in the end or not. <br />The characters in this book are completely unlikeable, except for Gayle Wynand, and of course anyone who's read this knows how he ends up. I thought there was much more depth to his character then anyone else in the book. You got an idea of what made him the hard-nosed guy that he was, and you saw that he had genuine feeling for Dominique, even though the part where he builds a house in the country to keep her away from other people was a little much. I didn't understand the appeal of Roark at all. By the description given, he didn't seem all that physically attractive (not that that matters, but he IS supposed to be the perfect man, right?), and his so-called individualism didn't inspire me at all. It seemed like most of the time he was just doing completely illogical things in order to be difficult. He didn't strike me as very bright or charismatic, and I certainly don't understand why anyone would worship him. Dominique basically has no personality that I can tell, except that she also does silly and illogical things, like dumping a basically decent husband because he wouldn't let his business be run into the ground to save her hero Roark. As for Keating, one minute you loathe him, the next you feel sorry for him. But you never actually like him. Toohey is just ridiculous with his \\"I'm going to take over this newspaper...and RULE THE WORLD!!\\" speeches. He's not exactly a villain who strikes fear into the heart. I wasn't even sure he WAS the villain until halfway through the book. Not that I need to have it spelled out for me right away, but I do like to have some sense of who I'm supposed to be rooting for or booing, especially when I'm 400 pages in. The characters were just so flat for the most part that I really couldn't be sure. Oh, and Roark's big speech with the \\"not guilty\\" verdict at the end? Total cheese. Some of the dialogue throughout the entire novel is so cheesy that you can't help laughing (Like Roark saying the guy who discovered fire was put to death? How did he know that?). <br />I feel sorry for Ayn Rand, because it seems she was just a massively insecure person, with no ability to connect with other people. So, to make herself feel better, she decided to throw togethera so-called philosophy justifying her complete lack of love or empathy for anyone at all. Unfortunately, she attracted a lot of other miserable people who have decided to worship her as some sort of all-knowing sage. I also feel sorry for them. I'm no student of philosophy, as you can probably tell since I have focused on the novel aspect instead of the idealistic one. But it seems as if most people would be level-headed enough to see that the very principles that Rand constantly condemns, are in fact the principles that make life in a hard world bearable.  They're an undeniable part of mankind's being. If you take away man's love for his fellow man, you take away the part of him that makes him man, and he becomes an animal. If every man (and woman) lived only for himself, it would not be a pretty world. If you don't realize that, you need to grow up. Or get some therapy and medication, quickly.
0743424425|5.0|Great book.  I still haven't read a king novel that i did not enjoy.  His brilliant developement of characters is what makes his stories so great and believable.  This book is downright spooky!  A must-read for any King fan.  I'd also recomend reading Bag of Bones and The Stand.
B000092ZYX|4.0|with a modern-sounding mixture of ok computer and kid a giving a soundtrack to fear of the present world, radiohead have proven themselves yet again.  <br />i can only give it 4 stars though, cuz 4 of these songs don't seem to sit well with me (backdrifts, the gloaming, i will, punch up at a wedding).  maybe they're great, but they don't stick in my head.  the other songs are great though.
B00006879E|4.0|MAROON 5!  One would see this as a bad thing however this funk driven debut from those crazy kids my head bouncing in my car all day long.  Its catchy ,shamelessly melodic and leaves you with a a smile and a stiff neck. The 4 stars is a result of its lack of impact. I dont know jane... Im sure shes a great girl, however it to me they really didnt have much to say.  So, i based most of my review on the music and its ability to move the listener, not the cliche lyrics about a girl that we've alllllllll heard before.
0790731002|5.0|I think I saw this one in theatres first, actually I think I saw the VHS first, im not exactly quite sure. All I know is, I liked it. Wait yea im pretty sure it was theatres. Anyways the movie is great.<br />Val Kilmer does a terrific job of batman. If batman had to be anybody besides that Michael Keaton guy,(im pretty sure thats the original batman) Val Kilmer would probably be my first choice. Robin was a great choice too, as well as two face and the Riddler as Jim Carrey.<br />The story is basically a tale of revenge, as always. However this time batman and robin get to team up against 2 baddies like Batman 4. This one is ALOT better then batman 4 by far, George Clooney is terrible compared to Val Kilmer in almost every way. However, the story fits fine. It isn't that dark, but hey, it's still good.<br />The action does a nice job of working itself it. We get to see quite a bit of Robin, some new cars, and finally their new flying machines. The love story is pretty good. It isn't too sappy, yet it is there and doesn't take way too long. The sound is pretty good too, along with a musical score that isn't dark like the other 2 batmans, but is just right. I could tell you to not buy this movie, sure, but it is batman and it is the best we are going to get for the SECOND sequel. Number 4 just [is bad], everyone pretty much agrees. Go buy this film/movie.
0385474547|4.0|This is a story about colonization.  True, the colonization of the Ibo takes place only in the last third of the book, but that is what makes this book so interesting.  Colonization did not occur in a vaccuum; it was imposed upon already existing and sophisticated cultures.  I think it is Achebe's purpose to show us a portrait of such a culture in order for us to better understand exactly what effect colonization had. <br />Achebe raises several interesting questions.  One of these is the question of an idea of universal rights and wrongs.  In traditional Ibo culture, twins were left to die at birth as they were harbingers of evil spirits.  The colonizers come and vanquish this custom in order to save innocent children.  In doing so, they upset Ibo culture.  In this case, who is right? Achebe also raises questions about the culpability of the colonizers.  In Western education today, colonization is blamed for a great deal of the present-day woes in Africa and Southeast Asia. Achebe's portrait of pre-colonial Africa is neither peaceful nor utopian.  Local tribes war against each other without the artificial divisions later imposed by the colonizers.  In this context, the modern-day conflicts in Nigeria between the Ibo, Hausa-Fulani, and the Yoruba come into clearer focus. <br />Achebe's writing style is simple and aggresive. You will be hard pressed to find a passive sentence, which makes for some choppy and dynamic literature.  I felt like it read more like a translation than a book that was originally written in English. It is a quick read, 3 days at the most should do it.  However, unless one has at least a passing interest in Africa and its cultures and histories, this book may be a bit dull.  <br /> Also recommended:  V.S. Naipaul.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I hate her new look and i think she is a bad example of what girls should be. But this is one of th best albums that I have. She is one of very little in the music industry that can actually sing. Her vocal range is oustanding, and I can compare her to what Whitney Houston used to be. Even though her dress and style (stinks), her talent is amazing. I think everyone should have this album in there collection.
B000006TRV|4.0|THE WALL. It's a classic album and but I don't believe it's Pink Floyd at their best. If any other band in the world released an album like this it would be really great. But Pink Floyd can do so much better. Sure, there are great songs like &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Another Brick In The Wall PT.2&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot;, etc. and my vote for the best song of all-time &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, but that being said, there are too many stupid filler songs, it's the only Pink Floyd album that I can't listen to from start to finish. It's not that it's depressing, I listen to Sentenced, try listening to Sentenced and tell me if this album is depressing. No I like slow, sad music, it's just that the album has alot of parts that are very unneccasary. Well, that's enough of my ranting, don't take it from me, listen to it for yourself. All I'm saying is I believe albums like &quot;Wish You We're Here&quot; and &quot;Animals&quot; are better Floyd pieces than this one.
B00005T30L|2.0|I purchased this DVD after reading the advice of other reviewers, I shouldn't have.  While I agree Ghost World is smart and intelligent, the slow pace and often below-average performances (except for Buscemi) take away from what could have been a good movie.  I kept waiting for some sort of climax or even something to laugh at, but the movie abruptly ended before that could happen.  The only thing that kept my attention was Steve Buscemi's wonderful performance as Seymour, the object of Enid's (Thora Birch) obsessive attention.  Don't waste the money on buying this DVD, rent it first.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden, the way it should be. Their classic lineup is reunited, with a newer face (Janick Gehrs) making a 3rd guitarist spot. This album is a return to what Maiden does best, and proof that these guys who are well into the 40's or 50's can still rock. Even though anything would have been great after VIRTUAL XI, this is almost as good as classics like SOMEWHERE IN TIME, POWERSLAVE, PIECE OF MIND OR NUMBER OF THE BEAST. Just listen for yourself, you be the judge. Not me.<br />1. Wicker Man    (10/10) Their single, just to show us that they can still open an album with a swift kick.<BR>2. Ghost of the Navigator  (10/10) Great written song, it's interesting.<BR>3. Brave New World   (10/10)<BR>4. Blood Brothers   (10/10) Arguably the best song on the album, great when they play it live. Just listen to Nicko.<BR>5. Mercenary   (10/10)<BR>6. Dream of Mirrors   (10/10) Maybe as good as &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; I don't know, it's nice. Nicko has some crazy time signatures on those drums.     <BR>7. Fallen Angel    (7/10) Like usual Maiden albums get kinda choppy towards the end.<BR>8. Nomad        (6/10)<BR>9. Out of the Silent Planet    (9/10) But then they get better.<BR>10. Thin Line Between Love and Hate  (10/10) Can you believe these beautiful lyrics?
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I enjoyed the CD, it's fun and very different this summer.  You should buy it and judge for yourself, you'll find that you're listening to it a lot.
B000063DI9|4.0|Great concept power metal album. Arguably their last great album. This is when they we're in their prime. There is alot of synth work on the album, which might be hard for some to swallow, but not if you're like me, there could never be enough synths. <br />1. Moonchild   (9/10)     <BR>2. Infinite Dreams    (8/10)    <BR>3. Can I Play With Madness   (10/10)     <BR>4. Evil That Men Do     (10/10) One of their best, Still played live.   <BR>5. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son    (10/10)<BR>6. Prophecy        (7/10)<BR>7. Clairvoyant     (10/10) One of my favorites, it's a tie between this one and &quot;Evil That Men Do&quot; for best track on the album.   <BR>8. Only the Good Die Young  (9/10)
B000002UDB|5.0|Side one of this album contains the tracks that ended up on the `Magical Mystery Tour' TV film; side two are all of 1967's single releases. There are some people who consider this album just a pale imitation of `Sgt.Pepper'. I vehemently disagree. Some of the tracks presented here surpass many of `Sgt.Pepper's ' weak spots. Even if one cannot find much to enjoy about the films itself, the same cannot be said for the soundtrack album. Methinks it's time for all Beatle Freaks to let the Magical Mystery Tour `take us away, take us today.'<br />Magical Mystery Tour - A brassy invitation to go on a trip to an unknown destination, courtesy of Paul McCartney and Co. John Lennon lends a hand in the final chorus. The sound effect of a bus roaring by is the cherry on top of this cake.<br />Fool On The Hill - Beautiful Paul ballad spouting a creed found in many philosophies . . .that the fool is more intelligent than the learned people who mock him. The use of woodwind instruments on the track is a masterstroke. Every time I hear this track, I `m reminded of the accompanying film clip and I'm engulfed in hysterics; remembering an obliviously stoned Paul gallivanting around the French landscape without his passport! Naughty, naughty Macca!<br />Flying - The first Beatles instrumental ever to see the light of day (the chirpy ` la la la'ing doesn't exclude it from the honour). DJ's at the time loved to play this track near the top of the hour so they could fade it out into a newsbreak without leaving ion a lyric. Slight, but fun.<br />Blue Jay Way  - The mystical Beatle strikes again with this mantra- like tour of his Los Angles abode. Many of George Harrison's friends used to get lost in the fog on their way to his estate; this is George explaining of what to do `in case of emergences'. <br />Your Mother Should Know - A another chance for McCartney to visit the music of Britain's past. This song, driven by piano is ` for all the grannies to dig' . . .and for us too.<br />I Am The Walrus (No You're Not, Said Little Nicola) - The greatest example of Lennon biting wordplay games; some of the images presented as farcical, others erotic and some just gruesome to the extreme. I don't know how much luck was involved they tuned into the Shakespearian radio play just in time to add it to the mix; it's a stroke of genius anyway, with the two meshing perfectly (\\"I am the Egg man . . . Are you, Sir?\\" \\"I am the Egg man . . . A man may take you for what you are.\\"). John's voice sounds suitably distorted and alien; like the vocals on `Tomorrow Never Knows'.<br />Hello Goodbye - A great song of opposites with some stellar ringing lead work by George. The impromptu luau at tracks end foreshadows the fadeout on the next year's single, `Hey Jude'. <br />Strawberry Fields Forever - This is the ultimate Beatles song for me. There are so many facets to this tune, that to go into it at length would take a huge document to complete and I don't have the time to go that far; so let me just say that you can listen to this track a million times and find something new in each listen.<br />Penny Lane - Paul's tribute to his home of Liverpool. While Lennon gives us surreal portrait of his youth in `Strawberry Fields' McCartney takes the factual approach, with the reporter's eye for detail. Incredibly, some of the establishments named in this song still exist. The horns add a nice touch to Macca's reminiscing.<br /> Baby You're a Rich Man - Another example of Lennon and McCartney combining two songs together to form the whole. A musical set of questions and answers directed at an extremely wealthy individual (probably Brian Epstein). <br />All you Need Is Love - What it all boils down to in the end. George's stabbing guitar solo is one of the best he has ever done. It sounds like all the Beatles (including Ringo Starr) had fun recording this track. Note John's sly self-parody at the end blending weirdly with `Green sleeves'.
B000063DIH|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Iron Maiden, and I bought this album early on when I first started getting into them and it turned me off for a while. It's lacking something, but I can't quite pin it (cough!- Bruce's voice- cough Adrian Smith- Cough! Cough!- Good songwriting- Cough!). <br />1.

0743455967|2.0|Stephen King,the reclusive master novelist,was the rare subject of the banner headlines in the summer of 1999 when he was nearly killed after being hit by a truck in his hometown of Maine.The backleaf to this book would have you believe that this book was entirely the result of his post traumatic event.But in actual fact you find this to be a bit of a dupe when you learn he actually started writing this in 1997,he merely completed it after the accident.This minor quibble aside,however,the book is still rather naucious.Bestowed with the title of the greatest writer of horror fiction ever,it would appear Mr King has let the commonly held accolade go to his head a little.He's served us a book that is well intentioned,fairly interesting and even fairly touching in certain parts (certain events in his life,as well,of course,as the recent accident).But all the same,it's also an ultimately rather self righteous and somewhat sanctimonious literary fest,that seems to make unfair demands on it's budding writer audience.I mean,in one segment,he asks us to give up on TV.Huh?Not likely.This coming from a guy who made a guest appearance on The Simpsons recently?!?Are we not something of a hypocrite,Mr King?I'm sure you wouldn't have wanted us to miss your big TV appearance and all.<br />This one particularly stands out,but there are a fair few other outrageous demands that could be mentioned.This book,by rights,should have an insurance slip attached to it.Does Mr King not owe some kind of recompense to his writing disciples should his apparently surefire recipe to success in being a writer prove unreliable?One would have suggested Mr King have invested his energies in something like an auto biography,which would have been just as interesting and most likely half less overly demanding of it's reader.

Featured on the video game GTA: Vice City. (10/10)<BR>3. Losfer Words (Big 'Orra): Thier 4th and 2nd best intrumental. Second only to &quot;Genghis Kahn&quot;. (10/10)<BR>4. Flash Of The Blade: (10/10)<BR>5. The Duelists: (7/10)<BR>6. Back In The Village: (7/10)<BR>7. Powerslave: Great riff, great chorus, great song. (10/10)<BR>8. Rime Of The Ancient Mariner: The infamous final epic track of the album, it's just so amazingly good. The guitar is phenomenal, just listen to it for yourself it's too good for words. (10/10)
B000005HN6|5.0|Orchid<BR>1995<br />Candlelight /Century Media<br />7 songs 65:32<br />Music: Opening up with the 14:06 In Mist She Was Standing, the song swiftly establishes everything that Opeth was about. Long compositions that will have little coherence to those used to three to four minute concise songs. Musical ideas that are repeated for minutes at a time, then suddenly end as a new passage comes along. Heavy distortion (but not downtuned- the guitars are Maideny) and double bass swapping with clean guitar, slow and gentle bits. It really is a style that requires patience to understand, and a love for obtuse compositional styles. But I will clear up a misconception people have about Opeth. While extreme vocally from the start, at this time Opeth was not at all extreme musically. Except for some bursts of speed and soloing, Orchid is quite a mellow album. Even pacing and more than enough acoustic passages will stone cold dead any attempts to throw this on as ¡¥excitement music¡¦ and if you put this album on with the ¡¥impress me¡¦ attitude, it won¡¦t. Because it¡¦s not that kind of music. It¡¦s music music if that makes sense, created as if nobody was ever really meant to listen to it on a large scale. If you¡¦re wanting the more deathy and song oriented Opeth, skip down to My Arms Your Hearse and go from there. If you¡¦re looking for a unique journey of music built alternately around dual guitar harmonies knocking into sequences when the two guitars and the bass are all playing different parts, stop-start transitions at times and smooth here-to-theres at others, here you go. This is a band that was certainly unique then, and this album still holds up as out of the ordinary today.<br />Lyrics and Vocals: Perhaps the most easily recognizable voice in all of extreme metal, Mikael Akerfeldt really does make some noise in his debut. I can¡¦t think of very many vocalists in 1994 (when the album was recorded) who used both clean and growled vocals freely. I¡¦mdefinitely not going to go so far as to say he was the first (Dan Swano did beat him on that at least!) but all those years ago, Akerfeldt did set the standard for what the extreme progressive music vocalist should sound like. The clean vocals are not very developed at this point, and really are little more than ¡¥whisper-singing¡¦ bits here and there. But the roar¡K Ah yes, the roar. A breathy, high scream with enough reverb to fill it out is the primary form of expression here and it is probably the most expressive, throatburning vocal of its type. If you¡¦ve heard Edge of Sanity¡¦s Crimson, you¡¦ve heard it. Katatonia¡¦s Brave Murder Day and Bloodbath¡¦s Breeding Death also featured the tortured throat of one Mikael Akerfeldt. On this album, which is not at all harsh or extreme musically, the vocals alone made the buzz about this band say ¡¥black metal¡¦, ¡¥extreme¡¦, ¡¥brutal.¡¦ An interesting relationship here between vocals and music I¡¦d say. Nothing as great as what it would be once the clean voice was developed on later albums, but again hindsight is 20/20 and who knows how this was taken in 1995? Lyrically I hate to say there isn¡¦t much special going on as far as overall quality, with lines here and there standing out. Passages such as ¡¥Riding the fires of the northern gold/I¡¦ve searched the eye/I laugh under the weeping moon¡¦ sound cool, but what do they mean? There could be hidden meaning, or it could just be that sounds cool factor. Typical prog obscurity here, ha ha! <br />Production: The album was produced by Opeth themselves, and engineered by one Dan Swano. The sound of the CD is completely unique, as I have not heard these astral guitar tones before or since. I get a sense that things were a bit rushed because even though the sounds are clear, there is a raw feeling to the guitars and the polish isn¡¦t there yet. Little things like unsteady drum beats and little vocal bits that should perhaps have been done again slip through once or twice, but to be fair the only reason I catch that is because I¡¦ve listened to the thing five billion times and there¡¦d be something wrong with me if I hadn¡¦t caught it, you know? I just wish that bass drum had a less clicky sound¡K<BR>Packaging: The edition I have is the 1997 US release by Century Media, which includes the famous blue CD that was fussed about when the album first came out. The cover is quite simple: Two orchids. Not even a logo for the European edition. The booklet itself is a standard 10 page affair, with each song having its own page for lyrics, and then a credits/thanks page. The backgrounds for the booklet are badly pixilated, and the back cover is merely the old Opeth logo in white over a white background (yes, that is correct) so this isn¡¦t the greatest piece of art to look at, but hey, it does its job. The back cover of the CD is the silhouette sunset shot that developed the Opeth mystique that lasted a few albums where their entire image was not at all having an image because nobody knew what they looked like! Another fun thing to do is look at the bands that are thanked here. Katatonia, Emperor, At the Gates, Asphyx, Edge of Sanity, Dissection, Therion, Ethnocide (who?).<BR>Summary/Notes: Orchid¡¦s historical significance can not be understated. In addition to the actual material on offer, just the meeting of Mikael Akerfeldt and Dan Swano during the recording of this album should cause some appreciation. I¡¦m curious to how this album was received in 1995 as I didn¡¦t start hearing about Opeth until right around the time Century Media put the first two albums out in the US. The fact is this album is a groundbreaking milestone in heavy metal for the progressive elements that are thrown into the more metallic music and the extreme vocals. Trapped in between trends on its release, Opeth was weighed down by the black metal tag for years after this, simply because of what the hot trend was at the time.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Hammerfall, Stratovarius, Gamma Ray, Angel Dust, etc they all owe their entire careers to this album. This is one of the first and one of the best Power Metal albums. I'm not a fan of the genre but this album is good, it's lighter than anything they did before and lighter than their next album POWERSLAVE.<br />1. Where Eagles Dare: Maiden sure knows how to kick off their albums don't they? (10/10)<br />2. Revelations: Different, but good (10/10)<BR>3. Flight Of Icarus: (10/10)<BR>4. Die With Your Boots On: How could you not like this song? Lot's of Maiden fans I know don't. (10/10)<BR>5. The Trooper: One of their biggest and best, I first heard it from Sentenced, they covered it from Maiden on an early EP. (10/10)<BR>6.Still Life: Slow but good (10/10)<BR>7.Quest For Fire: (9/10) Like usual the second side tends to get weaker.<br />8.Sun And Steel: (7/10)<br />9.To Tame A Land: (8/10)
B000050IE6|5.0|1999 <br />Peaceville Records<br />7 songs 62:31<br />Music: Two minutes of an ambient guitar drone, another minute and a half of a clean guitar melody, and then Still Life smacks us upside the head with one of those ¡¥only Opeth¡¦ guitar riffs and we¡¦re off and running with The Moor. Fabulous and such a quality, engaging open guarantees that this album is going to be no letdown from the last one. One important concept that Opeth introduces into their music is that of repeating passages, so when a particular riff gives way to another sequence, it may come back. That was never the case before, and with The Moor they let you know right away with a chorus. I might as well say it, The Moor is one of the two completely awesome songs on this album that eclipses the rest, with closer White Cluster being the other, with its guitar freakout centerpiece. Benighted establishes the tradition of song #3 to be the ¡¥calm one¡¦ for two albums in a row (although Face of Melinda on this album is also acoustically based without all the heaviness). Overall the album strays away from the more forceful death metal qualities of My Arms Your Hearse but for sure it hasn¡¦t disappeared, as Serenity Painted Death hasn¡¦t a soft bone in its musical body, especially damaging to the senses following up the mellow Face of Melinda. Moonlapse Vertigo is somewhere in the middle, more lush perhaps, using some combined heavy/acoustic riffing. All cool stuff. The soft parts once again are more wandering, taking their time and settling in on this album where last time they always seemed like they were going somewhere in particular. Right there might explain MAYH¡¦s favor in some fans¡¦ eyes but Opeth is best when in no hurry and just taking in the scenery for sure.<BR>Lyrics and Vocals: There isn¡¦t much left to be said about Mikael¡¦s growled vocals, which almost exclusively roam around the lower registers here, as they are powerful, real, and stand out as unique. He¡¦s one ofthe guys that justifies growled vocals as a true means of artistic expression and as a legitimate, skilled part of metal. As for the clean vocals, holy hell, the improvement from album to album continues as his singing is more confident and powerful, the melodies are bolder, and the clean vocals carry more of the album than ever, with parts in every song that become the focal points, which is the absolute highpoint of Godhead¡¦s Lament, for instance. Mikael¡¦s voice now doesn¡¦t need to be hidden and he¡¦s as good as anyone in his midrange. Lyrically, it¡¦s another concept album, this time darker than My Arms (and the music¡¦s not as dark, go figure). The background of the story is this one guy¡¦s a heretic and is cast out of his home. Years later, he returns (The Moor) to reclaim his lost love and take her with him. Well, luckily she¡¦s completely agreeable to the idea but they linger too long and are discovered and let¡¦s just say things come to quite the terrible end. The story is effective, especially within Face of Melinda to express why this woman is worth risking life and limb for, and also why they become, ahem, delayed. Impressive that the one song that the concept depends on for credibility is one of the two that¡¦s all-cleanly sung (Benighted being the other). <BR>Production: Much brighter, less dank than My Arms, Still Life is definitely a vibrant listening experience (save for a dropout of one guitar momentarily when listening on headphones, ay!) where everything shines through quite nicely. What¡¦s cool is that Opeth produced and engineered it themselves (with some assistance from Fredrik Nordstrom) if the booklet is to be believed, and given the fullness of the sound (beyond that few seconds mentioned already), this might be a second career down the line. <BR>Packaging: Travis Smith¡¦s artwork is at once catching and effective, with this being the first time there¡¦s actual art on the cover. Red and black may be overused asmetal colors, but this works so to hell with what¡¦s been done before. This is also the first CD to include photos of the band, breaking the ¡¥unknown mystique¡¦ quality and bringing the artists to the forefront of their creations. Where they found two guys with Hispanic last names, both named Martin, in Sweden I¡¦ll never know. <BR>Summary/Notes: My Arms Your Hearse was certainly a transitional album, and Still Life is definitely a shift in a more considered direction overall. I thought it was the ultimate, until another Opeth album came along¡K
B000063DHL|5.0|This album shows definate improvement from the already great POWERSLAVE album. This is a very mature album, both sonically and lyrically. It took me a while to get into it becuase I was so used to the filth and the fury of early Maiden, but definately this is Maiden in their prime.<br />1. Caught Somewhere In Time - You have to love the synth. (10/10)<BR>2.Wasted Years - Great Maiden song, often forgotten, but it has one of the most melodic choruses in the history of the band. (10/10)<BR>3. Sea Of Madness - 9/10<br />4. Heaven Can Wait - (9/10)<BR>5. The Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner - Not their best written song. (7/10)<BR>6. Deja Vu -  10/10<br />7. Stranger In A Strange Land - SOLO!!! 10/10<br />8. Alexander The Great - Corey Taylor of Slipknot fame said he learned more about Alexander The Great from listening to Iron Maiden than he did in all of high school, and I thought, yeah that's about right. 10/10
B00009MGQL|5.0|Finishing up the techno trilogy, \\"Jeff\\" is one of Mr. Beck's finest releases. I know others will not like it, and some will think it is just OK... but that's how Jeff Beck's albums work! To compare this album to classics such as Blow by Blow, Wired, and Guitar Shop would be stupid because all of Jeff's releases are so different that you can't compare them. I can say, however, that this album has guitar playing on the level that surpasses all of Jeff's previous albums because he is always learning and he gets better all the time.<br />Personally this is my favorite of Jeff's techno-rock albums. Who Else had great songs, and You Had It Coming had great guitar playing, but JEFF has both of those as well as real musicians, such as Dean Garcia (bass) and Steve Barney (drums). They add another level to the music and the production is also excellent on this release. The tunes are also more varied than on YHIC, as JEFF includes hypnotic grooves with sweet ballads and Bulgarian traditional music.<br />Let's move on to the songs! \\"So What\\" is a great, hard edged opener with interesting chordal changes and a great groove. \\"Plan B\\" really kicks off the album with varied changes in tones, grooves, and chords, and Jeff's second wah-wah solo is jaw-dropping. The dynamics of the real musicians shows here. \\"Pork-U-Pine\\" once again has Beck exploring world music, specifically Arabic music. Hypnotic grooves on this one. \\"If the voice don't say it, the guitar will play it\\" is exclaimed in the beginning of the song, and the guitar does indeed play it. Interesting dynamics on this song as well. Jeff's phrasing with the whammy bar really allows him to expand and he nails the sounds that go best with this type of music. \\"Seasons\\" is a highlight of JEFF. It starts with great riffs and grooves. Then, after a little bit of that, it moves into slow, orchestral backgrounds along with emotional and inspiring guitar playing that I've never heard Mr. Beck do before. It then moves back into the riffs and grooves, and then combines the two with the orchestra, and more playing from Jeff that is smothered with feeling and emotion. Steve Barney's drums add to this song as well. Great Beck-like harmonics here as well toward the end. Then there's \\"Trouble Man,\\" which is almost the opposite of \\"Seasons.\\" It's mean and hard-edged, while still containing excellent playing. Great dynamics, phrasing, and tone from Jeff as usual. Next, another highlight, \\"Grease Monkey,\\" with the vocal phrasing of Nancy Sorrell. Jeff's playing mimics that of a hot rod, and there's always at least one tune like this on his recent albums. However, this is much better than \\"Roy's Toy\\" of YHIC or \\"THX 138\\" from Who Else! It has an infectious groove, great playing, and interesting chordal styles and changes. \\"Hey Grease Monkey, show me what you got!\\" And Jeff shows us all right, with an excellent solo. Next is another hot rod related track, \\"Hot Rod Honeymoon.\\" Not quite as tough as \\"Grease Monkey,\\" but it has more of a \\"feel-good\\" type feeling. Jeff's excellent slide playing is shown here, and it is indeed incomparable. \\"Don't tell me you never rode a hot rod!\\" \\"Line Dancing with Monkeys\\" follows it up, and Jeff's way of manipulating sounds while still having them sound musical is showcased here.<br />\\"JB's Blues\\" is another standout on JEFF. Beck's playing is full of soul and feeling and the chord changes beneath it are very effective. Jeff's tone is also noteworthy here and is icing on the cake of his masterful playing. \\"JB's Blues,\\" along with \\"Seasons,\\" is my personal favorite and is among the best playing Jeff has done (on record, at least). \\"Pay Me No Mind\\" is an interesting track, and the only one with full vocals. There is obviously hip-hop influence here. Probably my least favorite on JEFF but is still not a bad track by any means. \\"My Thing\\" is next and it kicks things into high gear. The intro is killer! It continues with that riff a bit into the song before it goes into another gear with a funky Sly Stone type feel. Then, back into the main groove with a great solo. \\"Bulgaria\\" takes the feel down to low gear again and is unlike anything Jeff has done before. It is a traditional Bulgarian folk piece with an orchestra and beautiful playing and tone by Jeff. His volume manipulation is excellent. Jeff's playing is once again smothered with emotion on this song. It is the shortest track, coming in at 2 minutes exactly, but the brevity only adds to it. It melds into \\"Why Lord Oh Why?\\" with haunting melodies and phrasing. Written by Tony Hymas, it is a great closer to the album and Jeff's playing is mysterious and very effective. Heavy guitar comes in and haunts the listener even more. A perfect way to end a wonderful album. <br />Overall this is one of Jeff's best albums and could very well be my personal favorite. I'm inspired, moved, and amazed by what Jeff Beck and his colleagues continue to accomplish. Mr. Beck just keeps getting better and better. Some will chose not to like this album, some may even say it's their least favorite... their loss.

B0000A1RJI|2.0|A conniseur of film scores like myself would die to hear what Alan Silvestri would have done with this score, because Klaus Badelt and the rest of Hans Zimmer's men couldn't put the score back together again.<br />There are moments in this score that just scream adventure, whilst others simply scream at you.  I can't complain much about whether the thematic material sounds like The Rock or other Bruckheimer flicks.  It does have that flavor, just as one can tell a John Williams score from a John Barry score.  The main theme, most prominent in the beginning, is piratey enough for me, but after hearing it fifteen times over the course of the album it tends to wear on the old ears.<br />Much of the action queues tend to break down like The Rock, what with the orchestra romping along with what sounds like a drum kit providing the percussion.  Overall it's not TOO synthy, but if you've listened to Zimmer/Badelt/Media Ventures scores long enough, you KNOW they're there, and inevitably you hear them.<br />At 43:30 worth of running time, one can tell the score was a slap-together and sell, rush-job sort of production.  There are a few shining moments, particularly the moment in the film when we first see Captain Jack Sparrow, and the lilting cello piece towards the end when Will Turner frees Jack from the gallows, and the love theme when Jack and Elizabeth profess their love for one another before the Commodore.  <br />Most important about these moments, is they provide a chance to sigh after the bombast that is typical of a Media Ventures venture.  Filmtracks has it right, do not buy it if &quot;you despise the use of volume rather than style in Media Ventures scores.&quot;  The volume does swell to the point that you can't really tell what is being heard.<br />Fair thematic and piratey music, and worth a download from KaZaA, but I wouldn't buy it.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Many people got disappointed by the movie because they had the \\"Lou Ferigno\\" Hulk in mind... But the true - original comic book - Hulk, is far more powerful, and the movie shows it well... Of course there are some deviations from the  comic, but they are ok, I liked the fact that they made him grow as a visual equivalent of \\"the madder he gets, the stronger he gets\\".<BR>I've already seen it 3 times, and i cant wait for the DVD, and for a Hulk 2, i d love to see the Grey Hulk, or classic enemies like the Leader or the Abomination.<BR>This movie - between the action movie and the psychological drama - desserves a 5/ from an old Hulk fan.
B000003B6J|4.0|The original gangsta rap album, NWA's Straight Outta Compton introduced guns, dope-slanging and gang behaviour to hip-hop, as well as introducing to the rap scene Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy E and DJ Yella. \\"**** Tha Police\\" was so controversial that it even attracted attention from the FBI, while tracks like \\"I Ain't Tha One\\" prompted accusation of casual misogyny despite Ice Cube's definite and eloquent explanation on exactly why this is not so, and Dopeman actually warns against drug use: \\"If you smoke 'caine, you a stupid mother****er.\\" Overall, the album is hilarious yet still true to life and educational on a street level; the album opens with, \\"You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.\\" And anyone with half a brain should be able to understand it.
B000096FUD|4.0|LOST IN LA MANCHA (New Video Group) is the sad, frustrating and highly quixotic dissolution of Terry Gilliam's ten-year obsession of bringing Don Quixote to the big screen. This fabulous documentary covers about a month of preproduction and less than a week of actual shooting when everything that could go wrong does. Screaming jets from a nearby military testing range disrupt shot after shot, the actor playing Quixote develops serious medical problems and can no longer ride a horse, the multi-national crew has a communication breakdown and then an act of God, in the form of a flash flood, wipes out the elaborate location set and one of a kind props. Of course, through it all Gilliam is the metaphor for Quixote and we get a glimpse of what might have been and what still could be. Live your dreams.  Recommended.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I don't know why people think that linkin park is geared only towards pre-teens and adolescents who don't know any better and are interested in loud noise to head bang to. I'm actually a 25 year old in grad school and am enjoying every minute of meteora. I don't even care that it's under 40 minutes because it really is quality over quantity. I don't know how many times I've bought cds only to discover that the only good songs on the thing are the two that the band has already released. The lyrics aren't brilliant. Mike and chester won't win any literary prize for their work. But they are poignant. I don't know of anyone who has not felt the emotions expressed in linkin park songs at least once in their life, even beyond their teen angst years. That alone says a lot for the band. Try to find lyrics like that from other rap/rock groups. It just doesn't exist. So, go out and buy the album. Get 40 minutes of great songs and get your money's worth instead of the 6 minutes of glory you would have gotten with the other bands' 60 minute CDs!!!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|One of the best films of 2003, X2 beats out the commonly and easily applied stereotype to most movies during the summer. THat being the less the pleasing stories from sequels and blockbuster budget films. However, X2 was a sequel and a blockbuster, and audiences loved the film, propelling it to heights much greater than the original. Set just 3 months after the events of the first movie, X2 finds all mutants being hunted down, similar to the foreboding prophecies given by Magneto in the first film. The X-Men, beaten, and seperated from each other, have no choice but to turn to their one-time foe, Magneto, if they are to defeat the villains and save the day. A truly remarkable film, X2 is definitely an improvement upon the first.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Although I really enjoyed the performances of Suge Knight as Kingpin and Rob Halford as Bullseye, this movie really stunk it up.  Terrible script, hokey acting, hackneyed plot, the worst martial arts I've ever seen, insulting to the audience, fake-looking special effects, cliche supporting characters you don't care in the least about, storyline slapped together like a house a cards, this entire film is a mess.  Stick with \\"Spider-Man\\" or \\"X-Men\\" instead.  Heck, I'd even take \\"Batman And Robin\\" over this disaster of a film.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros has created one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard, stripping practically everything away but the music itself.<br />As many people have stated before, there are no liner notes, not really an album name, no song names, just the music itself, a couple of pictures, and the name Sigur Ros.<br />I cannot describe the beauty, and it would take the smartest people YEARS to decipher the words, since they are gibberish (Hopelandic).<br />It is something that must be experienced to believe.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Well, I had been waiting for a new Fleetwood Mac album for years, so maybe I had very high expectations. &quot;Say you will&quot; is a good cd, and I must say that it has some of FM's greatest songs (Peacekeeper, for example), but now I've found out that without Christine McVie, Fleetwood Mac is really missing something.<br />I've always thought that Stevie Nicks is one of the greatest composers and singers in the world, and she certainly is, but now listening to this record, without Christine, I know that the old saying is completely true: &quot;You don't know what you got until it's gone...&quot;<br />Five stars? No... One star for each member, one less star for Christine.

I was expecting more of a how to book -  I hadn't expected it to be so entertaining and engaging. I'd read a number of his books in the past. This book really humanized Stephen King for me.

0812548094|4.0|The book was great right up to the ending.  A good portion of the ending must of ended up on the cutting room floor.  Goodkind is usually quite detailed in his writing but not in the ending.  Maybe he got tired of the book.  It was like we got the readers digest version of the ending instead of the real ending. <br />Richard managed to do some quite amazing things is about 100 pages.  It is too bad because I sure would have enjoyed learning why his &quot;wife&quot; was needed to get through the towers.  In the first book he was quite unsure of himself and this theme carried on into this book until he met the Spirit of Darken Raul.  Amazingly he did what was necessary and he was off like it was a walk through the candy store.<br />Very disappointing.  If the editors did this they should be ashamed!

B000002INR|5.0|OMG!  Skid Row are so much better than Bob Dylan.  Bob Dylan never wrote a song as beautiful and timeless as \\"I Remember You\\", and he certainly never rocked as hard as anything else on this album.  Also, Sebastian Bach is so much better at singing than Bob Dylan.  If there were a sing-off, Bob Dylan would be left a bruised and bloody mess.  JUST BY SEBASTIAN BACH'S VOICE!  THAT'S HOW GOOD A SINGER HE IS!  Sebastian is such a good singer, I have to wear a helmet and shin guards when I listen to this.  The rocknroll is so good, once I forgot to strap myself to a chair before hitting play, so the rocknroll sent me through the window.  I fell six stories AND DIED!

B00009ATIX|3.0|For sci-fi lovers, this will not make your top 10.  What you get with the DVD is the theatrical version, a couple of standard self-promoting featurettes, an early version of the script and a commetary by Soderbergh and Cameron.  As the commentary states, this is not a remake of the Tarkovsky version, but a new interpretation.<br />What is clear from the movie and the commentary, is that this film evolved into the &quot;love story&quot; theme from the more philosophical basis of Lem's book.  I cannot guess what the reasons for this were, but it shows in the inconsistency of the scenes.  An example is a flashback scene where Kelvin and his friends are discussing God and Kelvin declares that God need not exist. Yet because the nature of Solaris is not discussed in this movie, the content of the scene is irrelevant and is left in presumably as it depicts Rheya in one of her &quot;moods&quot;.<br />Continuity problems are evident in the editing.  The scene where Rheya breaks through a door, as in the Tarkovsky version, is removed, but the destroyed door is not edited out of a dream sequence.  The commentary makes light of this, but this hides deeper problems with Soderbergh's script.  We know that Rheya is constructed from Kelvin's thoughts, yet she &quot;remembers&quot; her suicide, an event Kelvin did not see.<br />As another reviewer has said, this film is more style than content.  And style there is, and it is a treat.  The Solaris station/ship is beautifully constructed and the cinematography is excellent.  Clooney does a credible job as the wounded Kelvin, although another actor, such as Douglas might have been more believable.  Jeremy Davies as Snow is wonderfully expressive.<br />But for me, the movie disappoints.  In 90 minutes, we get a jumble of scenes wrapped into a love story, and a &quot;happy ending&quot;, yet the real mystery of Solaris is not broached, despite the main characters being scientists.  Imagine the Tarkovsky version with every major philosophical dialogue removed and every scene shortened.  Because of this, Solaris is not science fiction, but rather a redemption movie in sci-fi trappings. Soderbergh and Cameron have proved, like so many others in Hollywood, that making a science fiction movie without a good script, focussing on sets and CG effects to try to please a mass audience, just doesn't really work.<br />Perhaps Soderbergh could release the &quot;philosophical&quot; version he started to make, then perhaps we could see if he had a better vision for the film he claims to have wanted to make.phical dialogue removed and every scene shortened.  Because of this, Solaris is not science fiction, but rather a redemption movie in sci-fi trappings.

038533348X|3.0|Cat's Cradle started off well enough and flowed easily, then it took a turn for the silly and outlandish. I must admit that K.V.Jr is a very intelligent man, and behind his somewhat unremarkable dialogue there is a very large message here. This book has the typical anti-establishment theme Vonnegut is known for. I'm sad to say I wasn't a good audience for his words. The concept of the \\"ice-nine theory was great, but I didn't care for the story three forths of the way through. It ended silly and not what I expected. I didn't cheer for any of the characters, in fact I had no respect for any of them. I will not say it is a bad novel, but it is a bad novel for me at this point in my life. It is a hard novel to grasp, but easy to read.
0195073401|1.0|When there are Varian's book and Nicholson's book, why would Mas-Collel write another one? Especially when the author can't beat either of them. This has been my question for almost 2 years. The authors present almost every idea in the most complicated way they could find. They use many notations that are not very well adopted by 'the usual calculus' which most economics students have taken. Instead, they use many notations borrowed from Real Analysis, Set Theory, and so forth... these are Math PhD level or even higher courses. To explain the ideas, those are not necessary. Before I entered economics, I always thought economics is not rocket science but economists like to make it look like rocket science by intentionally talking in a difficult way. Mas-Collel's book proved my thought. This book is so wordy. The author can't even explain the simplest idea without wasting pages. I sometimes even doubt whether the authors really understand the 'things' (sure they do, they are from Harvard and Mas-Collel became hot in Spain). I just wish they could explain things instead of showing how difficult it is and how high the level is. I once struggled 3 days on this book trying to understand something, in the end I still had no clear idea. I switched to Nicholson's book and I understand the idea immediately and I will never forget it in my life. <br />I wish our professor could choose Varian's book for our first year PhD course. Mas-Collel's book wasted me so much time and I learned very little from it. It tries to touch everything and can't explain anything in the way a student would like. The comparative statics part was badly written. If someone wants to set this as a standard, then the professors should require the students take real analysis (math PhD level) before micro. Because Mas-Collel uses their symbol and language a lot. I believe a true master is someone who can explain complicated things in easy ways because they are competent and have confidence in what they aredoing. I bought Mas-Colle's book brandnew. Next time I move, it goes to the dumpster. I will only keep Varian and Nicholson's book.
0441172717|5.0|The best way I can describe Dune is that it takes the political and strategical elements of the latest books in the Ender series (Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets) and takes them even further in depth, all the while being supported by an incredible plot.  The emphasis put on the importance of every little action affecting the overall outcome helps to paint a beautiful and intricate picture for the reader.  The depth of this world is amazing, Herbert creates an entire alien culture better than any I have ever found.  He has even made an entire ecosystem with everything having a purpose and explanation.  This novel does not disappoint in the least and I recommend it to any sci-fi book reader.
0689859368|5.0|I've heard about this new series despite the huge buzz about \\"Harry Potter\\" this summer, and I was curious to check them out. My son is 5, my daughter 8, and I have to tell you, they enjoyed these books much more than they did the latest Harry.<br />I've seen some of the reviews here, and I think what many people are missing (which is clearly stated on the back of the book) is that these books are intended for readers 6-10.<br />They are sophisticated, snappy, and not overly written. We were able to read a chapter or two together, and the story was just the right length for my youngest's attention span.<br />As an parent, I too was just as excited to find out what happened next as much as my kids were. But the best thing is that the richness of these books is intended for little imaginations. Truly a fairy tale for tthe 21st century!
B000092ZYX|1.0|pulled over our collective heads.  I'm tired of reading reviews about how \\"important,\\" \\"deep,\\" and \\"meaningful\\" the last three Radiohead albums have been.  The bottom line is that they are meandering, unstructured, self-indulgent assemblies of drivel.  Each album sounds more and more like they've run out of good ideas for melodies and hooks.  Or they are playing a massive prank on the critics to see how long people will continue to laud this [garbage].  Time to move on and find another \\"greatest rock & roll band ever.\\"
B000001EC1|4.0|This is a great compilation, since it rounds most of Bon Jovi's best cuts on one album, to make for a very cool, catchy pop-metal package. Great Buy for anyone who likes 80s Rock, concidering Bon Jovi was one of the leading acts of the genre. While it has its share of mediocre material, the really good tracks here are excellent, which include:<br />Livin on a Prayer, Someday I'll Be A Saturday Night, Wanted Dead or Alive [Kickarse], Lay Your Hands on Me, YOu Give Love a Bad Name, Blaze of Glory, and Bad Medicine.
B00008EY5W|5.0|Most people absolutely loathe the Superbit concept and think of it as nothing more than a marketing ploy.  I, however, enjoy the titles quite a bit and appreciate the benefit of the increased bitrate that leads to some great video transfers and excellent audio.  If you want the extras, pick up the two-disc.  If you're looking for presentation, then go with this one.<br />If you didn't know, the movie is about an intergalactic war in the future where hideous arachnids are terrorizing the planet and the military is out there for some squishy, gooey fun.  First off, let's start with the action scenes, and believe me: there are tons of them.  And most of them are so unrelenting, you'll be begging for mercy by the time they're over.  With some absolutely stunning visual effects (that still hold up after six years), Paul Verhoven shows that he not only knows how to make Elizabeth Berkley poll-dance, but he can get Gary Busey's son (Jake Busey, in a hilarious supporting roll) to kick some serious [rear-end].  The action never lets up right from the get-go.<br />The film itself is a quite humorous political satire that plays up war-time politics and the propaganda films of Wold War II.  Of course, with satire, we must have so much shmaltz and bad dialogue that you'll cringe.  But it all oddly enough works.  Each line is so horrible that you'll be laughing at it.  So right when one of the imperative characters bites the big one and spews out there repulsive last words, you'll be rolling your eyes.  But again, it all works.  It was meant to be silly.  It was meant to be poorly acted.  But it also has a brain to it and that's what counts the most.<br />As for this new Superbit of the film, this is the third version that has been presented on DVD and it is by far the best-looking version of the film available at the moment.  Detail is improved greatly from the previous releases and every monsterously disgusting sequence is in perfect detail.  No compression artifacts here and I'm happy to report that edge enhancement is next to nothing.  A flawless transfer that can safely be called the co-champion of the Superbit video quality right along with The Fifth Element.<br />As for the audio, you get your usual choice of Dolby and DTS and both are excellent.  What's interesting here is that each track has some really strong points and others have some really... not-so-strong point.  First, the DTS track.  What you get here is pounding bass, ear-shattering screaches, stuff flying by your head every two seconds.  It may be a cliche, but it sounds like the bugs are right in the room with you.  This track is a sock-in-the-gut that will have your neighbors calling you to turn your TV down.  Secondly, the Dolby Digital track here is also excellent.  What's interesting here is that it is not quite as powerful as the DTS, but in some cases, it actually sounds clearer.  Split-surround effects are more convincing and the film's score is more believable.  While it may not be as intense as the DTS, it still has its improvements as does the DTS.  This will be a matter of personal choice here because both tracks are equally good, but mixed differently: the DTS was more visceral, but the Dolby was more convincing.  Which will you go for?<br />In the end, Starship Troopers is a highly entertaining flick that's intelligent and fun to watch.  While there may be some corny teen romance scenes, they are all made up for with bug-splattering fun.<br />Rated R.  Contains extremely graphic violence and gore (people are dismembered, beheaded, shot, stabbed, all with extremely gory results, not to mention plenty of bug gore), nudity (a co-ed shower with male and female nudity), and some language (a few \\"s\\" words, one \\"f\\" word, and that's about it).  Not for the kiddies, that's for sure.
B000000993|5.0|Tool expanded their &quot;Grungy&quot; sound from their debut into full-fledged metal with multiple artsy touches on this record, which would indicate the far more complex efforts that would follow. On its own, Undertow is pretty straight-forward HEAVY Metal with many underground influences and a sludgy/doom feel to it, coupled with light signs of progressive. The songs depict bleak, dark, evil images [the videos help too] of dispair, drug-induced anger, abuse, intolerance, etc. The album also losely follows a Water theme [Bottom, Swamp Song, Undertow, Flood]. The ending is an extremely odd &quot;song&quot; [or statment, or sotry, or something] which ends this dark album on a strange note.
B00009TB5G|2.0|After seeing the masterpiece that was \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" the 2nd film in the Lord of the Rings series is a major disappointment.  The film is a mess of disconnected events, overly violent, aimless in it's story, repetitive, and often painfully cheesy.  Edited like an episode of a T.V. show, in which the adventures of the many characters seem unconnected & irrelevant to each other, the film has very little dramatic momentum.<br />The 3 hour film builds (slowly and tediously) to a long and dull battle for which the outcome is irrelevant to the great story that began in \\"Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  What does the comeback of the old King of Rohan, his beautiful niece, and the Battle of Helm's Deep have to do with the One Ring, The Dark Lord, & the quest to save Middle Earth?  These plots & characters were BACKGROUND in Tolkien's gripping novel, but here they are shoved into the foreground, with little success.<br />The adventures of Frodo, Sam, & Gollum are the strongest parts of the film, but this story builds to a phony climax that makes little dramatic sense & does nothing to advance their story.  It also contains a shockingly corny speech by Sam, that signifies, I think, the filmmaker's last ditch attempt to somehow tie the many disconnected plots together.   It should come as no surprise that this climax & this speech were invented by the filmmakers, apparently unable to find enough drama in the original text.<br />No doubt \\"The Return of the King\\" will be stronger, but it is too bad the 2nd film in the trilogy had to be so aimless and limp.
6305728437|3.0|This is a tale of a young chinese girl who steals her father's \\"call to arms\\", cuts her hair and disguises herself as a boy so that she can join the war instead of her father.  She has a little dragon with her, Mushu (voiced by Eddie Murphy), sent by her ancestors to protect her from danger.  Mushu is the highlight of the movie!  Though the lines are not quite as funny as what you'd expect them to be for Eddie Murphy, he is the best part of the show.<br />Good movie.  The animation is wonderful. It's just not one of those movies that my family requests to watch very often at all.  It is at the back of the pile of Disney movies now - waiting to be requested again.  It is worth seeing once - from there you'll have to form your own judgement as to whether it becomes a family favorite - or just a once in awhile movie.<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B000002UDB|4.0|This is my favorite of the Beatles Studio CD not counting any of their compliations or anthologies.  A solid outing that finds them in between stages.  Not too psychidelic but not as stale as say a Hard Day's Night.  <br />Bottom Line:  A Classic of course.
6304711905|2.0|Let's see, I think in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; that was referred to as authentic western gibberish, but if it's authentic, it's about the only thing that is in this farce.<br />The problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.  It starts off as a western stage piece, basically a comedy, not quite in the ham-it-up vein as say &quot;Maverick&quot;, but not meant to be taken seriously.  I mean, there's no way you can look at 100 watt teeth and the most imaculatey starched clothing this side of a stuffy French restaurant and think you're supposed to be watching a historic telling of the real gritty west.<br />But then it tries to transform itself into an action picture, and you're left holding the bag.  There's no way any of these characters could afford to get blood on those collars.  I remembering seeing the (apparently un-killable) Ike Clanton toss his sash on the ground at the end, and thinking; hey!  Somebody just ironed that, you ungrateful retch!<br />Ah well, the underrated Val Kilmer has some nice lines, but otherwise this thing is a mess that's only worth seeing for the corny language, and to figure out how Russell could really ride a horse in those tight pants.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Obtaining this soundtrack immediately after exiting the theater registered as the next logical course of action for me.  I was, however, greatly disappointed to find that the CD is filled with only half its potential.  Why?!  Was there not enough varied music in the film to include on the soundtrack?  I find that unlikely, considering how many times the &quot;main action theme&quot; is on here, which by all means is a wonderful cue.  Nevertheless, I find main themes that sparsely populate a soundtrack are far more effective:  Lord of the Rings, with the exception of the Nazgul chant; Star Wars 'token themes' (Duel of the Fates, Across the Stars); Gladiator.<br />The song that played in the credits is noticeably absent.  A ten minute long 'Caribbean Suite' or some such at the end would have been a great decision to make.  Alas.<br />Concern over the movie's success being a deciding factor in how much time is spent on the soundtrack is foolish; look at the Time Machine:  waste of a good score if you ask me.<br />I never understand why music from a film is left out of the soundtrack when there is plenty of room to spare for it.  Pack in 80 minutes!  Make the CD worth it!
B00001ODGR|5.0|This is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen.  If you like Styx at all, you will love this.  The boys look and sound great!!  Man they have aged well and sure remember how to rock.  The opening track will have you hooked.  Order now!!
B00000K19E|5.0|... or at least one of the best movies in a LONG time. I've seen it at least ten times and still can't get enough of it. What makes this science-fiction flick diffrent from the rest of the movies out there  is that it's got vision. Larry and Andy Waichowski (ever seen bound? If not, go and get it!) have come up with something entirely new in essence, even though they have borrowed and/or been inspired by countless different sources, ranging from philosophers to cyber-punk authors and even mathematics, to some extent. Fair enough, as they never really made a secret out of it. Don't get me wrong, there's some serious thinking going on there. <BR>The visual effect is stunning the (in-) famous bullit time being just one of the oscar-winning special effects specially developed for this movie. The soundtrack, the casting and the equipment (who can't remember the black glasses, long coats and thight, shiny suits?) make what would have been a good movie exeptional. <BR>Keanu Reeves, who's not exactly known for his acting skills, just seems to be made for his role of Neo, a confused ex-computer-nerd-turned-superhero who doesn't talk to much, and truly kicks but. Laurence Fishburn does a great performance as Morpheus, his voice nearly hipnotizes you into believing what he's telling you about \\"the world not really being what it seems\\". Scary. One of the best performances is delievered by Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity, she really gets the right mix of vunerability, beaty, and toughness, and delivers some of the best lines in the movie. <BR>Whatever you say about the \\"good guys\\", the \\"bad guys\\" really bring it to life. Hugo Weaving is very convincing as Agent Smith, a machine slowly developing weard human feelings, what doesn't make him more likeable, thank god.<BR>And look out for Joe Pantoliano as Cyprus (I love his acting) and, oh yeah, the Oracle!
B000002H6C|5.0|This is without a doubt (in my opinion) not only the best Metallica album in existence, but It is the best metal album in existence.<br />BLACKENED- Like previous first Metallica tracks, it slowly builds into absolute mayhem as James screams anti-war lyrics. Lars stays busy, and really shines on this song. This is my favorite Metallica song of all time.<br />AND JUSTICE FOR ALL- This is by far one of the most sophisticated, intricate, and complex metal songs ever. Clocking in at over nine minutes, this song takes you on the ride of your life, and when its finally over, you are left, shocked at what you just heard. You cannot count the changes in pace/tone on one hand in this song. This is definately a song that Kirk shines on.<br />EYE OF THE BEHOLDER- Another awesome song with some great lyrics. &quot;You can do it your own way, as long as its done just how i say.&quot; <br />ONE- The first Metallica song with a video made for it. Also one of their best songs of all time. Goes from semi-ballad like to all out headbanging thrash metal. In the last few minutes you cannot help but headbang.<br />SHORTEST STRAW- Great overall song with some awesome riffs and drum kicks. The chorus fits perfectly into the tone/atmosphere that the song creates.<br />HARVESTER OF SORROW- Slower, more violent song about how people who are abused as children sometimes bring that abuse to the generation following theres. One of my favorite songs on the album.<br />FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY- Great headbanging song, you will headbang, just because the rhythm of the song begs you to. Great all around song with awesome riffs and great vocals.<br />TO LIVE IS TO DIE- This song is an ode to Metallica's late bassist Cliff Burton. Though its an instrumental, its incredibly heavy and works into a heavy ballad style song.<br />DYERS EVE- This song and BLACKENED are the fastest songs on the album. Lars shows what he's made of in this song, and you can't help but give him props for being able to play drumsas fast as he does on this song. The song is about parents to dictate to their children, and do not offer encouragement.<br />IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS ALBUM, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of my favorite albums. If you even listen to this album twice, you will fall in love. Layered and dense, great lyrics and vocals. The music is very interesting to listen to. You will fall in love all over again on every listen of this masterpiece... awesome.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fabulous CD! I've had it forever and just came across it again! A Must for Fans Old and New!!! BUY IT NOW!
0380977788|4.0|Neil Gaiman's first book for young adults is a grippingly creepy  tale.  Coraline and her rather distracted parents have recently moved to a new home in the country.  When Coraline ventures into the mysterious closed up door in the parlor, she enters into a nightmarish world of the \\"others\\"...another mother and another father.  These creatures mirror her parents, but seem more attentive to Coraline than her real parents in a weird yet compellingly attractive way.  Gaiman's description of the odd duo with their paper-white skin and black button eyes adds to the building horror of this strange other world.  Young Coraline finds her real parents' lives jeopardized by these creatures.  It is up to her to be brave enough to save them and she is scrappy enough to do so.  Aided by a peculiar cat, she enters into a bizarre bargain with the \\"other mother\\".  This is the stuff of nightmares and will send chills up the spine of readers looking for a spooky story.  Although recommended for 8 and up, I think this is more suited for middle school ages and up.
B000060MWU|4.0|Well, this was probably my favorite movie until Lynch's Mulholland Drive came out.<br />It's the sort of title where, if you're thinking about buying it, you've probably already seen it. You either love it in the way you love your favorite dream, or wish you hadn't wasted two hours of your life. For that reason, I don't see much use in discussing this exceptional film.<br />As for the DVD itself: Don't expect extras.<br />No problem there--a psychological masterpiece such as this deserves to stand on its own. Extras always sound nice, but they usually consist of some director with an overly-inflated ego trying to make his work sound like something more than a diversion while munching popcorn. Usually, the popcorn is better.<br />Lynch allows his movie stand on its own. It not only stands, it walks, runs, and grabs you by the collar. Great stuff.<br />Some reviewers noted a lack of sound quality. Probably, they have better sound systems than I do, and mine isn't all that bad. In a nutshell, the Lost Highway DVD is *far* better than the video release in terms of sound. I didn't get to see Lost Highway at the theater, so my first spin of the DVD was like hearing the movie for the first time. Wow. The soundtrack brings a new dimension to the movie.<br />The only reason I knocked a star off the rating was for the image. The overall image quality is pretty good, better than my VHS copy, but the decision not to present it in wide-screen was a bad one. No...it was an ignorant one. The film was clearly shot with a wide-screen ratio in mind. I don't know what the heck people were thinking. As my dad would say, &quot;They weren't.&quot;<br />To me, sound and vision are the fundamentals of a film, with &quot;plot&quot; a distant third. (If plot is your main concern, grab a book--print media won't hurt you!) Without widescreen, you miss a couple of things, but more importantly, certain shots just don't look the way they should.<br />Maybe in ten years, someone will release a nice box set of all of David Lynch's films as they were meant to be seen and heard, similar to the fantastic Werner Herzog/Klaus Kinski collection. In the meantime, this is a good DVD.
B000001IPL|4.0|There are some mind-blowingly good songs on Smash. Ignition is my favourite album of theirs, but Smash is right on par with it. Self-Esteem is the best song in my opinion. It's very dark, but not in a maniacal way like Beheaded, which is just pure palp. &quot;Cme Out &amp; Play&quot;, the other huge hit from this album isn't as good as Self-Esteem because it seems so hokey.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie! Rich in colours and an excellent storyline. But its a bit rushed. The DVD comes (like the first one) loaded with excellent features! I strongly suggest you read the Harry potter Books before you watch the Harry potter Movies, though!
B00006AUIG|4.0|Session 9 is an atmospheric thriller that takes place in a creepy mental institution. It's unsettling to say the least.  A work crew has been assigned to remove the asbestos from the old abandoned facility. The more time they spend there, the more the place gets under their skin and things start to go awry. I wish they would release this in an uncut version, because the deleted scenes would have added a lot to the movie. The scenes were cut because in previews, some audience members were confused about the identity of a female character. Check out the deleted scenes on the DVD and you'll see what I mean. Overall though, a good flick to watch late at night with the lights off.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I recently moved to the USA (for a temporary time) and was overwhelmed by the difference in American and European music. My favorite remains Europop but i 'm takin a liking to American music.<br />The t.A.T.u. album rocks and they do too!!!! Usually when I buy an album from other artists I end up regretting it because 3/4 of the album is unlike the music that is launched as a single. But this album is electrifying all the way! the lesbian image is faux (everyone knows by now) but people nowadays think so much about an artist's background they forget the music:<br />1. Not Gonna Get Us: An Electrifying track. The music is excellent, and the vocals r really good too. 5/5<br />2. All the Things She Said: The song that swept the world! This song is addictive! You can see they really worked on it. 5/5<br />3. Show Me Love: Nice Song. the song that really makes u wanna dance! t.A.T.u.'s Japan Tour which happened December 2003 was titled Show Me Love, the lyrics are not THAT good. Still its a very good song (the Extended version is better). 5/5<br />4. 30 Minutes: This is a soothing song, with some nice lyrics. A totally different song compared to the first three songs on the CD. 4/5<br />5. How Soon is Now?: Remember the Smiths? Well this is one of their good ones. and personally I like t.A.T.u.'s version more. Its rockier and at first I didnt like it, but after 2 days or so I took a liking to it. 5/5<br />6. Clowns (can you see me now?): This is a nice song, but I personally prefer the Russian version Klouny which you can buy on Amazon.com the album is called Dvesti Po Vstrechnoi but is titled T.A.T.U. on amazon.com. 5/5<br />7. Malchik Gay: This is a piece for acoustic lovers, its very different from the Russian one which is more Europop (again I prefer the Russian one). 4/5<br />8. Stars: This song has beautiful music, it even his a small twist of Arabic music. The girls' voices are so harmonious! And Yulia's rap is cool. 5/5<br />9. Ya Soshla S Uma: Russian version of\\"All the Things she Said\\". Ya Soshla S Uma actually means I've Lost my Mind, so they repeat Ya Soshla S Uma as opposed to All the Things She Said. I like this track its the same but the lyrics fit the music more than the english version. 5/5<br />10. Nas Ne Dagoniat: Russian Version of Not Gonna Get Us. It's the same thing but the vocals are a tiny bit different. 5/5<br />11. Show Me Love [Extended Version]: Its not different but its, like the name suggests, extended and better for parties.<br />12. Behind the scenes with Julia and Lena: Not crucial but you see them in the supermarket and in a studio in LA plus a small interview. 5/5<br />All the Things She Said Video: Well, you should have your own opinion! I think it was unnecessary to do the kissing cuz the song is excellent. 4/5
B00003CXCK|5.0|I've always been interested in the Holocaust. I don't know what it is, but it's a drive to know about it, to understand it. I just recently saw this movie for the first time. I expected it to be like most World War II movies, mostly action and political, but this movie amazed me. It was the most moving movie I've ever seen on the Holocaust and the cruelity of man-kind. Once you see this movie you'll always carry it around in the back of your mind. It was the best three hours and seventeen minutes of my life. (Thanks Steven!)
B00005JM09|5.0|Well, what can I say? As many others, I thought \\"this movie will fail\\", \\"there's no Linda Hamilton and James Cameron\\", \\"it's a waste\\", and some blah, blah, blah like that. Then I went to the movies and watched! And I instantly changed my conception... IT'S AMAZING!! I don't watch an action movie like that for a long time, and just like Matrix and Lord of The Rings, I can't wait to see the fourth part of the serie! Oh, if you're asking what happened with Sarah, or how did Skynet got another chip to bring another T-800 back, it will explain, don't worry! Now I'm with great expectations about it! Go and get it, you won't regret! It's bombastic!! It's awesome!! It's Arnold!! IT'S TERMINATOR AGAIN!! THE WAIT IS OVER!! HASTA LA VISTA, BABY!!
630522577X|5.0|Why the film studios allowed a musical work of art such as this to waste away in the vaults I'm not sure, and hope they learned a lesson.  The restoration team did a wonderful job to ensure the quality of the original film flourished.  The colors and music shine like a diamond, and the voices of Harrison, Hepburn/Nixon, are clear and crisp in the Dolby 5.1 and match up to the video beautifully.  The enchanting story is back, and this time it will stay.  The part of Higgins played by the great Rex Harrison is brought to life by intricate acting.  Harrison played the part on broadway, and since he didn't &quot;sing&quot; well, he talked the lyrics of the songs to pitches.  He brought this same style to the big screen.  Hepburn wasnt the first choice of the producers (it was Julie Andrews, who could sing her own part, but was already in Mary Poppins), but Hepburn became Eliza Doolitle, and it was one of her most renouned performances.  She was nominated for oscar in this performance, but wasnt given the honor since her singing was dubbed (a travesty, and mistake by the academy).  The musical soundtrack is wonderfully accurate and the noise is substatially low.  Everything in this film (and DVD) is seamless.  Enjoy this film over and over, especially the gorgious cinematography and colors that starts from the overture and doesn't end until the finale.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The Harry Potter saga started as a group of runaway best selling books, and then they turned the books into movies.<br />Sometimes this can be a disaster, other times, the movies deviate from the books.<br />HOWEVER, in this case, the Harry Potter movies are every bit as entertaing as the books. They also stay TRUE to the storyline which is very important to a majority of people.<br />I am in my 30's and I was able to sit through this entire movie without once being distracted or feeling bored, theaction and pace were wonderful.<br />This one is very worthwhile in your library of DVD's, an if you have kids, I hope to one day, they will love it !<br />Best Regards to All, MC - TheStickRules.Com
B000089RVX|3.0|i would suggest borrowing this CD from a friend or downloading a few tracks before you buy it. i dont think its worth paying more then 12 bucks for either, so get it used or from one of the cheap sites if you can. the reason i say this is that although there are some excellent songs on this cd, the album as a whole gets a little reptive and boaring. there really isnt a whole lot of varitey on this CD to keep things interesting. it doesnt have a whole lot of replay value either. youd be better off buying this cheap and then using the songs you like as part of a mix for an MP3 player or CD-R. i dont mean to knock this band, i think they def have some talent. but i was certianly dissapointed with this album as a whole so i figured id put my 2 cents in and give potentail buyers a little warning. this is def an album you want to preview before buying, dont go by the one radio hit. make sure this is worth the investment for you before you go spending money on it.
B000005PW0|5.0|I first got into Police Academy when I was 10. We rented this 80's stunner from the video shop as my Mum wanted to keep me amused for a few hours so she could do the ironing. Well all I can say is the rest is history and from that moment on I was hooked on the whole Police Academy trilogy and Guttenbergs style and brilliant comic timing. <BR>So why is it such a good picture?Well from the comical brass music at the start of the picture to Guttenbergs stunning comical performance which I put up there with the greats like Chaplin in \\"Modern Times\\" the film just provides a gag a minute. Guttenberg of course went on to do a great body of work like \\"Short Circuit\\" and the oscar wining \\"Coocoon\\" not to mention \\"Three men and a little baby. If ever you needed to select a symbol for 80's comedy it would surley have to be Guttenberg. So get some popcorn and grab a coke and sit back with your partner to the perfect comedy night in. Awesome

B00008DDXC|3.0|Not as awe inspiring as the first film, the introduction to the Potter mythos, this film returns to that world decently.  However, a distraction was the fact that the primary kid actors have aged quite a bit beyond their original roles.  It's quite startling watching the second film then checking out the `Hogwarts First Year' section and seeing them much younger.  Too bad they couldn't do a Lord of the Rings and do as many films as possible quickly, heh. Still, the effects were a lot better.  The basilisk was better CGI than the firsts three headed dog and ogre thing.  Decent matinee fair, but nothing to seek out like the Two Towers and likely a disc I won't buy for my collection.

B00000HYXB|5.0|I own four CDs by Blind Guardian and, as I stated in the title, this is the best.

I recommend it.

B000001DTM|5.0|This album ushered in a decade that turned sour with boy bands and gangsta rap. While I dont't really have a problem with rap(Which I think is hysterical!), there really wasn't anybody doing anything to keep this momentum going. Including U2 themselves. This album is a timeless masterpeice on par(though not equal because of the sheer influence of it)Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. People may not agree with this because they either don't understand or were never there.

B00008HCCF|5.0|That Norah Jones has one of the most soothing voices and easy-to-listen-to song repertoires is far and away the major selling point of her music. \\"Live in New Orleans\\" delivers a nice compilation of smooth tunes in an intimate setting (House of Blues) that is likely to impress anyone who checks out this recording.<br />I'm not sure how to classify Norah's music, but her voice is the most enchanting to come along since Sade landed in the early 1980's. Naturally, the focus of this DVD, both musically and visually, is on Norah herself, but in no way does the rest of her Very Handsome Band get left in the shadows (literally or figuratively). The camera images tend to fade in and out from close-ups of Norah's face, to a couple measures of a bass/guitar/drum lick, to Norah's hands on the keyboards, and back again. It's very simple, but not necessarily monotonous. I applaud producer/director Jim Gabour's efforts in leaving out any glitzy or contrived visual aspects: the performance is as easy to watch as it is to listen to.<br />Save for four songs plus the encore, the musical selection (15 songs total) is entirely from the \\"Come Away With Me\\" album. I liked every track of this DVD; thus I'd rate this a very strong performance overall. As with all great live concerts, parts of many songs contained different twists or improvisations, and I loved the way Norah eased into \\"Don't Know Why\\" without everyone noticing right away. Oddly enough, I don't think we're seeing the entire show (run time is 67 minutes). You can tell this by some of the edits, but the big giveaway is after \\"Lonestar,\\" when Norah remarks to the band's tour manager and backing vocalist, Daru Oda, that she'll be back on stage later in the show. Unfortunately, that's the last we see of Daru.<br />Concerning the band, the guys stay pretty tight, even without the preponderance of interaction that is so common in jazz performances. My only criticism (a minor one) of the sound quality is that the percussion crashed a little too loudly on a couple numbers. Perhaps this had to do with the way Andrew Borger's drum kit was miked, but I'll make an allowance for the character of the venue. Still, you might have to turn down your sub-woofer a tad to avoid an occasionally boomin' bass drum.<br />CD \\"extras\\": 1) one encore song, which could have been placed in-line with the other tunes in order to avoid having to access it by flipping through menus; 2) video of \\"Come Away With Me,\\" which is well done.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I loved this episode! and i love that i can have the songs on a cd to listen to anytime i want. my fav songs are \\"under your spell\\", \\"walk through the fire\\",\\"something to sing about\\", and where do we go from here.\\" I love Dawn's lament, but i wish they had dawn's scream at the end it would have added a nice touch.if you loved the episode this is a must have as well as the script book for this episode. in fact this is a must have for ANY buffy fan. it's a nice touch to your collection. ALso, AMber Benson proves that she has an awesome voice in this episode. i expected her to have a very quiet voice and was shocked when she belted out this song. BUt most quiet people always have the best voices. James Marsters has such a sexy voice and anthony stewart head has a decent one. I'm sorry(no offense to anyone) but alyson hannigon and nicholas brendon cannot sing that well. And i'm sorry but neither can sarah michelle gellar. but she pulled it all off nicely by making up with her personality. all in all great cd.
6303477259|5.0|Simply put, this is the best there is in large-venue concert production.  (If you prefer smaller venues, you may also want to pick up the David Gilmour in Concert DVD.)  Even though the promised DVD of PULSE hasn't yet arrived, it's very apparent what a work of art the well-coordinated light show was, and Mr. Thorgerson's beautiful videos are also outstanding, and surreal.<br />It's clear from this that Pink Floyd is not at all a destroyed band, but one very much alive.  The video allows for a close-up glimpse of the band in addition to the light display, that might be lost to the audience at the actual concert.  For that it may even surpass the concertgoing experience for those who prefer a more intimate musical experience.  At times it may seem that the younger touring musicians are more &quot;into it&quot; than the band, but then Pink Floyd has always been more reserved than some.  The Floyd members show their passion in subtler ways.  If anybody in the band has a tendency to be visibly animated, surprisingly enough (or is it?) it's the softspoken keyboardist Richard Wright, who reacts very clearly to the music.<br />&quot;But if I have the audio CD, should I buy this too?&quot;<br />Absolutely!  Even though most of the tracks are similar in style, on some the combination of light and sound heightens the experience.  Also, the video-only tracks are well worth hearing.  But perhaps the most stunning difference is in &quot;Sorrow&quot;.  While the CD version takes a more mournful, softer approach, the video version is a hard-rocking tune that draws the most passionate playing out of all three members.  If David Gilmour and Nick Mason are on fire, then Richard Wright is positively explosive on this song.  Letting loose with a screaming, uncharacteristically aggressive Hammond assault, one almost wonders if the keys will survive such a performance (especially given the fire in his eyes!).<br />The only thing at all lacking on the video is the picture quality, which although good, is not up to modern standards of clarity.  Hopefully the upcoming DVD will rectify this.  Even considering this limitation, I can't possibly lower a hard-earned 5 star rating!

B00007B8PF|4.0|Worth searching out for any real AC/DC fan, Austrialia's 'High Voltage', released in February 1975 is much different from the later UK/US release. The brothers Young barely had their band together when new vocalist Ronald Belford Scott came aboard. In fact both the drums and bass were played by session musicans (Phil Rudd and Mark Evans would join later in the year). Like any typical debut record, they had yet to perfect their sound or stage show, however the origins of a great band are in evidence. The band's first real classic \\"She's Got Balls\\" is easily one of the highlights along with \\"Stick Around\\" (not on the later version), \\"Soul Stripper\\" and \\"Show Business\\". Most shocking of all is the appearance of a honest to God ballad, \\"Love Song\\" (go figure), a very touching song supposedly written by Bon lamenting the breakup of his marriage. I've never cared for \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\" (though the video is hilarious). Definitely a must for the AC/DC completist but it would take another record before AC/DC could claim legend status. Ahhh...show business, that's the way it goes...
B000062YAZ|3.0|Slayer's 'Reign In Blood' got all the right elements in it - crunchy guitars, great drum fills (Lombardo is one of the best metal drummers around), a few innovative solos and melodies...but it gets repetitive in places, and the lyrics are really sophomoric (words about satan worship can only go so far before they seem plain dumb).<br />Highlights - The slow middle riff in Angel of Death, the main verse riff in Postmortem, and the song Raining Blood. Some of the solos are good too, but overall they just seem like random whammy bar, evil-scale noodling compared to other bands. The verse riff in Altar of Sacrifice is kinda cool as well.<br />Lows - Umm, where's the bass in all the songs? Can I hear some bass please? Also, where's the variety? Example - The song Jesus Saves starts off nicely (almost Black Sabbathesque), but then its the same old fast punk ride cymbal, alternating snare and bass drum rhythm that gets played in like 4 other songs on the album. Don't tell me it's how thrash is supposed to be, cos I've heard *aplenty*. Oh yeah, Tom Araya can't sing. At all. AAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!<br />To sum it up folks: This is an overrated album that was cool 17 years ago, but falls somewhere in the mediocre category today. Better guitar playing? Megadeth's got it. Better song structure? Early Metallica wins hands down. Innovative soloing? Try Pantera. Brutality? How about a million other death metal bands - two of the good ones - Nile, Cryptopsy. Lyrics? Uhh, a 7th grader could pass this test. Next in line please...
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Don't get me wrong- this music is great.  The only problem is that it isn't exactly original.  Tracks 5 and 10 are taken directly from track 12 of the Blasck Hawk Down score, and the main theme is just another version of Gladiator.  This music is great, and I love the CD, but be prepared to hear familiar music.
B00008O31H|5.0|Whoever said that the Black Keys are like the White Stripes is going on the fact that both have only two members.<br />The Black Keys are on the Fat Possum record label, one that deals with legendary bluesmen like R.L. Burnside, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Junior Kimbrough, and Solomon Burke. It shows too. The Black Keys play dirty, nitty gritty blues, drawing from all of the aformentioned at Fat Possum. Thickfreakness was recorded in the same manner as any R.L. Burnside; it is very raw and rough around the edges. The Black Keys were going for this sound in their blues because it adds character and a certain element of, \\"wow, this is bad-...\\". Basically, it fits the label. <br />Thickfreakness isn't completely original, some of the songs are covers (including one of Mississippi Fred McDowell's). That doesn't mean it is not a good album--look at the North Mississippi Allstars's record \\"Shake Hands With Shorty\\". It won them a Grammy and yet almost every single song was a cover from a bluesman on the Fat Possum label. They took the standard blues and made it their own, something that I believe the Black Keys have done well. The singer/ guitarist has the voice of Warren Haynes and a true mastery of the guitar that the White Stripes simply don't have. The drummer is excellent too.<br />But now you're saying, \\"Wait, the White Stripes have blues too\\". They do. You will hear some of the same Zeppelin-esque sound in both of the bands. The Stripes are built on Zeppelin and punk, but the Keys are built on Fat Possum and Zeppelin. If you like the blues, Thickfreakness is just for you. If you're expecting something a little more punk like the White Stripes, you may be dissapointed. I think that most anyone who has enjoyed listening to the delta blues, Zeppelin, or the Stones should enjoy this album tremendously.
0385504209|2.0|I was recently reading a message board setup specifically for readers to discuss Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. I was shocked by the prevailing ignorance of most of the posters - Christian and non-Christian. I just can't believe that people would take a piece of fiction so literal. Then I remembered why - because of the pompous statement by the author at the beginning of his book stating that \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\" Since when does a conspiracy THEORY become fact - I'll tell you when - when you're trying to sell to an unassuming public.<br />This book is to be read with a grain of salt. Mr. Brown mixes fact with fiction and uses his characters to tout it as absolute truth. I will admit, this is a page turner - a definate thriller at the core. But this is far from any reputable history book. There is no second-guessing why this is in the FICTION category on Amazon.com. A few examples:<br />1.) Something called the Order de Sion existed in the Middle Ages up until, at the latest, the 17th century; something called the Prieure du Sion existed from at least 1956 to 1984; whether these two groups have any actual relationship to each other, we will never know. The duties and responsibilities of the Order de Sion is still unknown to this day. The idea that their purpose was to protect the secret of the Holy Grail is FICTION - THEORY.<br />2.) The Knights Templar were arrested on charges of heresy by the church because they were going to reveal the true meaning of The Holy Grail. Another piece of FICTION - THEORY. The Knights Templar WERE involved in heresy. King Philip the Fair was also after the wealth they had amassed by becoming bankers, diplomats, masons, etc. He used the heresy charge as an excuse to obtain that wealth.<br />3.) The Nag Hammadi Library which includes The Gnostic Gospel of Philip is taughted as one of many lost manuscripts predating the New Testament and early Orthodox Christianity. Supposedly, these documents reveal the true nature of Christ and His relationship to Mary Magdalene. According to Mr. Brown, Constantine canonized The Bible, burning documents like those of The Nag Hammadi Library only because Christianity was on the rise and paganism was out the door. This is FICTION - THEORY. Constantine converted to Christianity and was disgusted by gnostic pagan ritual. This wasn't a strategic business move as Dan Brown asserts. As far as the Nag Hammadi Library being a prelature to Christianity - this is a gross misrepresentation. Christianity predates Gnosticism, no matter how old the Nag Hammadi Library. Read the New Testament. You will quickly understand that Gnosticism is a sect, broken off from the early Christian church. Their beliefs were skewed and they mixed pagan ritual with Christian thought.<br />Those are just 3 simple examples. This book is an interesting and fun read, but far from fact. If you read it, take the time to do the research for yourself and figure out where Dan Brown's fact becomes FICTION.tianity.

B00000F2JL|5.0|This is a lovely video for young and old alike.  I generally don't mind some of the Sesame Street or Disney videos, but this is a step above.  Despite the fact that it's a bit more sophisticated than your average childrens' video, I think kids will fall in love with it right away.  My 3-year-old daughter has loved it ever since she was small.  The sweet story about a snowman who comes to life, based on Raymond Briggs' book, is accompanied only by original music.  The animation is old-fashioned and beautiful; the music is beautiful; and the story about a magical friendship is truly touching.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I received an advance copy of the \\"Chicago\\" DVD several days ago. The quality of the transfer is superior.  Audio options include DTS and an informative commentary track by director Rob Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon.<br />Unfortunately, there isn't much else.  Miramax includes the 30 minute infomercial for the film that aired constantly in NYC and LA during Oscar campaign season, plus the deleted \\"Class\\" musical number (not enhanced for Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS) and that's it.  Not even a trailer.<br />The lack of extras is surprising for highly successful major studio release (the most successful in Miramax's history---over $300m earned worldwide), not to mention an Oscar winning best picture.  And there's a lot of history behind \\"Chicago\\" and its various permutations over the decades---and the many years it took to bring the musical to the screen---that is touched upon in the enjoyable but superficial infomercial but could have been explored in much more detail.  A missed opportunity.
0679746048|4.0|Girl Interrupted tells the cautionary story of a troubled teenager surviving in a 60's mental institution to which she was warehoused like many other affluent disaffected kids of her generation.  Trapped by parental expectations, she descended into depression, attempted suicide, and was coerced to \\"voluntarily\\" commit herself after being thrown onto a taxi by an uncaring psychiatrist after a 30 minute interview.  <br />What follows is a poignant account of the struggle to maintain sanity amid the cold, uncaring insanity-provoking world of the institution.  Crisp, brief chapters are vignette windows into a screened, locked, regimented life.  Characters are drawn with skill to help convey the many colored canvas of mental illness.  A crazy trip to an ice cream parlor provides a note of humor, whereas the story of the effort to save a fellow patient from a trip back to her disfunctional family illustrates the horror of patient powerlessness.  One cannot help but be reminded of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, as life imitates art in this true account.<br />Other chapters deal with the vague concepts of sanity and insanity.  I was particularly struck by the author's description of the road to craziness as a battle between competing ideas of reality, where the real world is always still visible even from the depths of the imaginary one.  Also interesting was the author's partial refutation of her diagnosis.  I say partial, because self-mutilation is not a hobby of the sane, regardless of any lengths one might take to explain it.  <br />Two criticisms of the book come to mind.  First, a personal journal was mentioned in the movie.  If it really existed, excerpts from it would have provided a fascinating glimpse of the author's life and thought processes while institutionalized.  Second, several things should have been wrapped up at the end.  What were the fates of the other girls like Cynthia and Polly?  Did the author resume her relationship with her parents, or are theyestranged?  What became of the staff of the institution, especially the ones who controlled so much of the author's life?  Maybe an epilogue chapter would have helped to tie up all these loose ends.
B00005JMCR|5.0|Unlike some I watched the American Pie movies only maybe twice.  The first movie was better than the second in my opinion.  However, American wedding was hilarious.  I laughed so hard at Stifler in this movie.  I am actually happy with the cast that remained in this installment of the series.  With this movie it makes me feel like they should have simply used these remaining cast members for the entire series.  I have seen this movie 3 times and I laugh each time I watch it.<br />It is a great summer movie just for a good fun experience at the movies.
B000000WZ4|5.0|I love, love, love this CD and I have been meaning to write review about it for awhile. As stated by another reviewer, this album ranks right up there with Black Celebration and Violator. I don't think it has left my 3-disc CD player for more than a week without me missing it and sticking it right back in!<br />This is a very solid album, there isn't a single song I dislike or want to skip through (well, okay, I don't really LOVE Jazz Thieves, it has no lyrics which I dislike, but still I do listen to it and it's fairly short). Also, the songs flow very nicely into one another so there aren't any abrupt transitions between songs. Another reason I love this album is because the lyrics are solid and fairly poetic. I am a big lyric person and good lyrics are very important to me.<br />I am not going to write a mini review of each song, because that has been done quite nicely by another reviewer, but I will say that Sister of Night (reminds me of Waiting For the Night to Fall), Freestate (I have a whole music video in my head for this song), The Bottom Line (romantic and sweet in a very DM kind of way), &amp; Insight (I love the way the guys use their voices on this one) are truly great songs and some of DMs best work.
0679777547|4.0|I first picked up this book after seeing the movie The Ninth Gate, directed by Roman Polanski, and he was the one who reccomended reading the book. I was a bit dissapointed with the referrences to older books and the confusion around them, since I've never read them nor do I speak Latin, which is also included in the book in phrases. But those things are just perks to those who have experience with both. The detail in character descriptions is what pulled me into the book immedialtely. I found to be continuing character events in my head even after I finished the book. I was also inspired to check out some of the older titles mentioned. Definitley interesting and satisfying.

B0000942HV|3.0|It's the 4th version of 'Bells' in last 11 years, seems to me that Mike is in the deep idea crisis right now. His manner of playing guitar saves the thing though, it sounds nice.<BR>Ah, almost forgot! Hiring John Cleese, Monty Python guy, as a conzertmeister is the most great idea I could even imagine Mike would implement!
B00008S2VG|2.0|This is easily Madonna's worst album. The music is simplistic. The lyrics are self-absorbed. The arrangements come in only two flavors and are equally awful: the pseudo-acoustic sound that sounded so fresh on &quot;Music&quot; has worn out it's welcome and makes you wish she had never picked up a guitar or they are robotic electronica devoid of melody or passion. &quot;I'm so stupid&quot; is unlistenable. The rest of the tracks are just OK and suffer from a numbing sameness. The exceptions are &quot;nothing fails&quot; which is brilliant, moving and awe-inspiring and &quot;hollywood&quot;, which, while weak compared to her other material is at least catchy and has a great hook. Last, but, not least: The artwork and packaging is horrid.
B000088E6D|5.0|Had never heard of Michael Buble, but while ordering Peter Cincotti, he was suggested by Amazon. Thanks Amazon! Ordered both CDs and immediately fell in love with his voice and style.  He's smooth and gives an updated sound to the standards. Definitely recommend his CD, Enhanced, and am looking forward to his new CD coming out in September.
B00005JM1F|4.0|Old School is a very funny movie that is a throwback to Animal House starring John Belushi.  The movie is about three friends in their thirties all struggling to realize that they're getting older so they start a fraternity on a college campus.  Seeing that they cause so much trouble and that many members don't even go to the school, the evil dean steps in and tries to revoke the charter.  Some scenes will have you rolling around on the ground in tears they are so funny.  The iniation with the cinder blocks, picking up the pledges, and the school spirit routine with Will Ferrell in the mascot suit are all hysterical.  <br />  The cast for Old School is surprisingly good.  Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughan are very good together throughout.  Wilson plays the straight man although he has several funny scenes.  Ferrell is great through the whole movie as Frank the Tank.  His streaking scene and his inspirational speech, a la John Belushi, are two of the funniest scenes in the movie.  Vaughan's speech at Frank's wedding is also very good as he tries to convince him not to get married.  Juliet Lewis, Craig Kilborn, Andy Dick, and Sean William Scott all make basically cameos, but are all very good.  William Scott as a white trash animal holder is very good as Ferrell shoots himself in the neck with a heavy duty tranquilizer.  The Unrated DVD Special Edition doesn't offer much that is different from the movie that was shown in theaters.  Included on the DVD are the widescreen presentation, trailers, an outtakes reel, several deleted scenes and a feature length commentary.  This is a very funny movie that is definitely worth the purchase!
B00008WT49|5.0|I have a pretty decent system, I just got a new Pioneer Universal DVD Player that plays everything, SACD & DVD Audio and I have to say I was blown away!  I have Norah's DVD and CD and both exhibit great sound quality. This was my first SACD and it sounds like she's in the room with you, it's that good. Every instrument, every plunk of the piano, and every breath from Norah sounds immaculate and clean.  This is a subtle recording, very warm and very inviting, listening to this SACD really brings you into the music.  Some multi channel recordings sound unnatural, this one doesn't.<BR> Finally universal players are coming down in price and you can afford one(The pioneer I just got was the cost of a good branded player) if you enjoy music, you'll love SACD & DVDA, it just {bites} that you have to pay for music twice to attain this kind of sound quality, but in this case Norah won't let you down.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|An important note:<br />Some of the early copies of this disc were accidentally pressed incorrectly so that the entire film ran too fast. A number of people were angry about this, thinking the frame rate on the film was set too fast, but the soundtrack was equally fast.I noticed this problem in a rental copy, but when I purchased a brand new copy, the problem had been corrected. If you're considering purchasing a used copy, you'll probably want to check with the seller before paying.<br />This is by far one of the most impressive films I've ever had the privelage to sit through.
B00004X01U|5.0|Wonderful and innovative. Most of the tracks are arranged in a pseudo-folky, guitar strumming style and tweaked with electronic touches. The result is clean and fresh sounding and Madonna's excellent vocals are highlighted. The other tracks are high energy electronica that will get your feet moving. Highlights: &quot;impressive instant&quot; recreates the giddy high feeling of the best night out you've ever had. &quot;don't tell me&quot;  is a folk + dance = joy masterpiece. &quot;paradise(not for me)&quot; is a moody downtempo classic. &quot;what if feels like for a girl&quot; is a simple, yearning plea for us to think about the way we're raising our girls, but, is not at all preachy. The only flaws are the short running time and that, while a good song, &quot;amazing&quot; sounds too much like &quot;beautiful stranger&quot;
B00000JXZ7|5.0|...I feel obliged to say something, as I believe this is one of the outstanding must-have cds of recent years.<BR>Kyung Wha Chung cut these legendary recordings in the 70s (Bruch) and early 80s (Mendelssohn), with fantastic analogue sound and outstanding orchestral rapport. She plays the Mendelssohn with a pace which brings out the sheer joy and beauty of the music, free of lingering exaggerated sentimentality. If ever there was a modern masterpiece, this recording is one. The sound is sweet and virile, and in this as in so many of her recordings she plays as if she is capturing a live performance, not the stereotyped studio. There is a spontaneity so often lacking in studio recordings, which doesn't fade with repeated hearings.<BR>The Bruch Concerto is also wonderfully fresh, a real breath of life in a much-recorded work. (Astonishingly, she plays this work even more beguilingly later with Klaus Tennstedt, coupled with the Beethoven, another must-have recording). I first heard this Kempe collaboration of the Bruch Concerto and Scottish Fantasy when it was released on vinyl, long ago played into scratched oblivion as was the way with my favourite LPs. Hearing the CD is just magical. Even the fabulous Heifetz Mendelssohn (Munch) and Bruch (Sargent) recordings don't eclipse Kyung Wha Chung's legendary performances, which are appropriately remastered on the Decca Legends label
B000002UAX|4.0|The &quot;White Album&quot; may not be the greatest Beatle album, but it may be the most interesting.  This was recorded at about the time they started to split apart into different musical styles, and the album shows it.  The album highlights Lennon's emotional, introspective music (&quot;Yer Blues&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;I'm so Tired&quot;), and McCartney's genius for melody (&quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;, &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;).  Harrison also contributes with some great songs.   The sheer variety of material here is well worth the price.
0060555661|2.0|The book is still great, however the revision was the worst.  I bought the book being as it was cheeper than the hardcover, and half the book was filled with this guy's (Jason Zweig's) insights on the reasons for the numerous tech companies bursting with the bubble.  Everyone already knows what happened when the bubble burst.  Its quite odvious that's all the revising author knows about securities, being as half the book was filled with comments about it.  My advise, the extra money for the hardcover is worth not having to read the revisions.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Johnson's words are beautiful and thought-provoking, his music is soothing and warm.  It makes your cares go away... appreciating the small pleasures in life.<br />Johnson's previous album was wonderful, and this one is just as good, if not better.  The acoustic-driven tunes are mellow enough for background music, perfect to sing along to.<br />Johnson is my new favorite artist!
B00007BKVC|5.0|Most people do not know that Brad Pitt is in this movie. He plays \\"JD\\", the guy with the nice abs and body. He shows his rear end in this movie, a rare thing for him.  Being a teen boy, I think that this is more of a chick flick.
0380715430|3.0|I'm having a conflicting situation here. I am fluttering through this book happily, with nary a dull moment. At the same time, my barely-beyond-layman's education in linguistics (three or four college courses) is consistently being offended. As several reviewers pointed out, this book is riddled with erroneous information, obvious enough to gall even the non-expert.<br />His assertion, for example, that English uses fewer articles (definite and indefinite) than essentially every other language, especially gendered languages, ignores obvious contradictions, like Russian (which has feminine, masculine and neuter nouns and no articles at all for the most part). The argument that English's one-size-fits-all approach to the second-person pronoun (&quot;you&quot;, vs. French &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vous&quot;) is something that makes the language somehow superior also grates--I, for one, find it  irritating that we have no plural form, and people in the American South have, adaptively, coined &quot;y'all&quot; to fill the gap. As a final example here (but far, far from the last of the bungles I read) is the implication that the English plural form is somehow an orthographical issue, and that it can be explained as simply &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;-es&quot; after &quot;-sh&quot; words. The true origin of plurals actually involves morphosyntax. I won't waste time explaining that here (it's fairly dry, anyway).<br />All that aside, however, I'm still having fun. I learned some new words (velleity, glabrous, ugsome); I committed to memory a few new anecdotes. So, have fun with this book, but don't take it too seriously. If you're like me, you may be inspired to go seek out more academic books on the subject.
B00009APK1|5.0|This movie rules, it defidently doesn't follow the usual trilogy rule of getting worse as they go. The two towers is every bit as as good as fellowship of the ring.  These movies do an excellant job of telling the best story ever written.  Combine the allstar cast, the breathtaking scenery, and the all time greatest story.  And you have one of the best movies ever.
0893860220|5.0|I have read quite a few books on this topic in last 2-3 years. I rate this as still number one book on this subject. This book is really a must for the seekers from the east or west.

I highly recommend this to all the seekers and readers of Advaita.
B00008RV1L|5.0|American Psycho is indeed psycho.  It has a great cast and plot.  Being a teenage guy I can some what relate to Christian Bale's character, having to do things for your physical appearance is very important.  Most of the movie he is shirtless or in the nude.  That is just fine with me.  He has several sex scenes and I just went crazy over the one when he was looking in the mirror at himself and moaning and showing his arm muscles.  His running around naked with only shoes and a chainsaw was great too.  He wears tight undies when he has them on...LOL.  His crazy character makes this a very enjoyable movie.  Look for Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, and William DeFoe to be Christian's supporting cast.
0689859368|5.0|My 9 year old daughter is crazy about animals and I can't seem to get her to read books other than Pony Pals, Animal Ark, and some other Dolphin series books.  I mean, she does not even like Harry Potter.  I got her this book in hope of adding variety to her readings.  To my surprise, she loved it.  In fact, she kept asking me for the 3rd - 5th books which have not been released yet. What can I say ... 5 star to any non-animal book that captures my daughter's interest.
B00005JKN9|1.0|I didn't like this edition,well, sort of,<br />first, the edition is ok, but WHY did Miramax &quot;divided&quot; the movie and the special features in both discs???<br />Its ilogical!<br />it'd be better if disc one had the entire movie and comentaries and disc two the rest of the special features, that would be LOGICAL but nooo... They did a mess<br />what do you think??????<br />I live in Mexico and region 4 of this DVD is better (and that's strange 'cause I prefer region 1)
B00001OH1S|4.0|I find myself hitting the play button way too frequently.  The album is short, but all the included tracks will bring vivid memories of the wonderful movie.<br />Overall, an excellent soundtrack.
B00006IUL7|5.0|This movie was really good. Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, and Jonathan Jackson were great.  The scenery was good to see too.  Jonathan is hot as usual, but it's too bad that he didn't get much air time.
B00009UW0N|2.0|Pointless '25th anniversary' edition.  Sure the film looks and sounds great but so did the last two DVD incarnations.  Commentary tracks provided by Carpenter, Hill, and Curtis are adequate and somewhat disappointing.  As for the 86 minute 'new' documentary, it's nothing more than a trumped up version of the 30 minute documentary (Halloween Unmasked 2000) with endless, ENDLESS, ENDLESS, ENDLESS, ENDLESS clips  --make that entire sequences--  from the movie.  Curtis's own 2000 interview is again repeated here as are the same stories from Hill, Carpenter, Tommy Lee Wallace, P.J. Soles, and Nick Castle.  I'm not sure what the point was in marketing another version except to cash in on the Halloween title and make money from unassuming customers, like yours truly.  Save your money.

B00005JLXE|3.0|This movie is entertaining and is good enough to pass time with, but I just didn't really care for this one that much. I love Ben and Jennifer G. but the movie just seemed OFF...like it was quickly thrown together. The dialogue was very so-so. The witty comments attempted are just so common that its no longer &quot;witty&quot;. I also think certain characters were a waste of time...such as Ben's lawyer-friend sidekick. He's there for laughs, but I wasn't laughing. Plus, I HATED the way Jen and Ben meet. He's so anxious to find out this woman's name that he chases after her for really no reason and then they engage in a fight slash dance scene that was sooooo cheesy. I was expecting music from &quot;Flashdance&quot; and &quot;Fame&quot; to pop on anytime. The main villain...NOT scary. I had absolutely no feelings for the character whatsoever. They didn't really spend much time exploring that character. I'm not familiar with the comic book. I was more of a DC comics person growing up (though I LOVED the spider-man movie!). You should wait for this movie to come to HBO or something. Its really not worth the hype...unless you're a fan of the character.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This was a very good movie. What made it even better was that Justin Long was in it. He is kind of a dorky hunk, he has great abs and muscles.  I really liked him in Crossroads too.  Justin, for all us guys out here you keep getting the hot chicks, rock on man.
037542217X|5.0|Mma Ramotswe was in her late thirties and blessed.  She had two orphan children, a wonderful fiance, and a house on Zebra Drive.  Mr. Matekoni, the fiance, said that cars speak of people.  Mma Ramotswe was concerned that her assistant Mma Makutsi who had run Mr. Matekoni's car repair business when he was ill would not have enough work to keep busy now that Mr. Matekoni was restored to good health.  Mma Ramotswe asked her assistant if she would like to have a husband.  Mma Ramotswe was an optimist.  She did not like to see her assistant go through life thinking she was just a local girl from the bush.  After all, she was a crack typist.<br />Mr. Maketoni found that the work of his two apprentices was less  greasy than it had been before his illness.  Mma Makutsi advised there was another detective agency in town.  She learned about the principle of competition at secretarial college.  It was located in the original premises of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  The competition was Ex-CID.  Also, New York was mentioned, but Mr. Buthelezi would not say how long he had been in New York.  While typing up the bills for the garage Mma Makutsi thought up the idea of a typing school for men and found a source of old typewriters from her secretarial college.<br />Mma Ramotswe was given a case to find people so that an engineer could make amends.  She traveled to a government office to find out about a pension for the widow of a prison official.  She knew that dull people could not distinguish between meritorious and unmeritorious requests.  The motto of the secretarial college is be accurate. The apprentices restored the old typewriters to serviceability.  Mma Makutsi received a declaration of love from one of the typing students.<br />The head of the rival detective agency claimed to be the first professional detective.  He claimed that the women were just dabbling.  I will not disclose the ending to any of the various strands of the plot.  These books just keep getting better and better.  Bravo Alexander McCall Smith for your wonderful series.better and better.  Bravo Alexander McCall Smith for your wonderful series.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack brings back memorable scenes from the movie. If you liked the movie then you will enjoy the soundtrack. My mother keeps \\"borrowing\\" it and I don't see it for days. I am going to have to buy her her own!
B00005RDRO|5.0|I will never forget the day a college professor of mine bad-mouthed this movie. He hated anything with Neil Simon's name on it. Well, I must say he seriously lost credibilty with me at that very moment... This is the classic spoof on Hollywood's murder mysteries.  &quot;Clue&quot; pales in comparison.  Just look at the casts.<br />The performances are outstanding (indeed these are final performances for several of the cast members).  And yes, I love Neil Simon's over-the-top one-liners and sight gags, and this talented cast can pull them off.  Truly this is a showcase of lively writing and brilliant comedic acting.<br />OK -- now here's my grumpiness (which I did not allow to lower my rating of the overall film) -- what happened to the original cover art?  Is Peter Falk really the star?  It makes it look like a Columbo episode.<br />Second, the gag ending is missing.  Isn't this what DVD is all about?  It should have at least been included as a &quot;deleted scene.&quot;  Ah well, perhaps there will be a special edition later on down the road -- get a commentary out of the remaining actors before they are all gone!
0790729628|5.0|Watching Blade Runner:The Director's Cut is like listening to  smooth Jazz on a rainy day.  One becomes hypnotized by the effortless flow of the dreamy, and nostalgic world and forgets all about time and space.  This unusual world encloses around you, slowly making its way to the gentle core of your soul.  Ridley Scott's direction of this patient science fiction masterpiece starring Harrison Ford, allows the viewer to enter a dreamy and accurate portrayel of mankind's future and the out-of-control technology that man has yet to master.  From Phillip K. Dick's short story \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" comes one of the finest science fiction films ever invisioned.  The dark and profound subjects such as the acceptance of death and the fragility of humans are subtely incorporated into the film's plot line, while the stunning and highly influencial art direction of the futuristic Los Angeles allows  viewers to become entranced in it's beauty and awe.
B00009MGQL|1.0|Just got my copy of &quot;Jeff&quot; this morning. Had a few listens.... first impression.... too samey. Most of the tracks sound too unstructured as if JB has just been cut and pasted into tracks. His guitar tone has been better, most of this sounds like a Line 6 POD (I think some of it is) with some samples and kit thrown in... can't hear much bass. No real stand out tracks. <br />I think YHIC was miles better, also had more musicians on it. I really like electronic music but don't see this as groundbreaking. Too many vocal samples used to try and spice up things.<br />A thing that is starting to show in the compositions is there are not a lot of real arrangements with key changes etc... just grooves in one key.<BR>I know some of you guys are going to rip me to shreds for all this but this is my own opinion. I still think JB is an amazing performer live but needs more clear defined ideas/melodies in the studio.<br />Dissapointing
1400034779|5.0|I know. It's a pretty lame title, but it's true.<br />The writing is simple and compact and yet very descriptive without unnecessary dialogue and description. No predictable plot twists, not even a lot of twists. Just very good storytelling without all the frills. And the story leaves you appreciating the simpler way to live.
B000002L7V|5.0|This is my favorite Dio album. Keyboards were used in previous albums, but here they are more consistant over the whole album. What sounds more mystical- keyboards or guitars?

0790729652|4.0|Batman was released in 1989 and was a huge blockbuster from the first day. When I first saw this film I was a little surprised that Jack Nicholson's [now my favoriet actor] name to be listed before Michael Keaton's, but soon realised that they weren't wrong by doing this. This is clearly Jack's movie, his style of acting makes the movie.<br /> The finest point of this movie is it's cast, which like most other comic-book movies is outstanding. Michael Keaton is clearly the best Batman to date, Jack Nicholson is exceptional as the evil Joker, and Kim Basinger is convincng as Vicky Vale. Other actors of interest are Billy Dee Williams and screen legend Jack Palance. The film takes place in Gotham City where a man called Batman has been taking care of the city's ever growing crime with his fists and inventions. This puts fear in the crimelords and at the same time a botched hit is about take place on the Joker and his men while they're doing there normal crime. The man doing this to Joker is actually his boss, and like Batman always does, busts in to the scene and of course tries to stop them. As he does Jack's character tries shooting at him but as he does, Batman sidesweeps him and he falls into a tub of some kind of strange chemical.<br /> And so begins the Joker's rein of terror. At the same time, Batman's real idnetity is a rich millionaire named Bruce Wayne, who at the time is having a party, and at the party is the lovely reporter Vicky Vale, who Bruce takes an instant liking to, unfortunately so does the Joker. As the movie goes on you'll see flashbacks from Bruce's past, explaining why he became Batman.<br /> The soundtrack by Prince is suitable for the scenes and Nicholson brings humor to the film. The biggest fault of the film is how it drifts off to comic book territory a little bit, but not much. The directing is great by Burton, who has became one of my favoriet modern day directors. If you really want to see a sequel go ahead and see the second one which isn't that bad of sequel but forget the rest of them they aren't worth your time. Don't judge the movie before you see it, solely because of the corny TV show, it's an action movie that won't disappoint you.'t that bad of sequel but forget the rest of them they aren't worth your time.

B00005JLTN|3.0|OK rather than bore everyone with the usual complaints (Zion, Trinity/Neo, etc.), I would first like to say that I was intrigued by the philosophy debate going on among the main characters, well actually the secondary characters (Jon Voight, the Merovigian, the Archiect, etc.). I was a tad disappointed that none of these solioquaies seemed to reach any conclusion. Presumably they will in the third installment, though I think that on some level that is a mistake since most of the audience will have a tough time remembering all that philosophy after six months (perhaps it is a cheap ploy to get everyone to buy the DVD). <BR>One of my biggest (original) complaints is the overly long battle between Neo and Smith. After about three minutes of an essentially repetitive battle, all I could think was, \\"Yes he can replicate himself. Can we please move it along?\\" The freeway battle was superb precisely because it moved and the conditions of the battle changed. The Smith/Neo battle stay the same after the first dozen Smith's popped out.<BR>Also when did the agents become such a bunch of wimps. All these rebel programs and human inflitrators and they act like the keystone kops. (I know there is a likely reasons, but still)
B000002IQ9|4.0|For Phil Collins, he has made a massive impact on what the music industry should sound like, be like, and act like. Still, it is always a better appeal trying to hear him live and assertive. I sometimes miss seeing that triumph Phil had endured on his own, and with Genesis. It is just a shame that he isn't performing as heavily as he used to. Hopefully, that live feel can be reflected in his music again.<br />With Phil's 1990 Serious Hits... Live, he captured a level of star power, that now seems more like it was manufactured by Britney Spears and Ashanti. But it is the music that needs to speak the message, not looks within itself. Phil gives a knouckout performance of several of his biggest songs on his own including, Something Happened On The Way To Heaven, Seperate Lives, Two Hearts and Another Day In Paradise. Still, you can't beat the classics from his legacy. The album also includes live performaces that give a serious appeal, including One More Night, and the song that launched Phil Collins solo status into the star status he is at today, In The Air Tonight.<br />Every Phil Collins fan is really going to want to own this one live piece of music. Still, is was just a shame that he didn't perform anything he did with Genesis on this record. Perhaps it is for the better. After all, there can be too much of a serious thing.

0062502182|2.0|I can sum up what Coelho is trying to say, by quoting a new age bumper sticker : &quot;Find what you love, and love what you find.&quot;  <BR>As I read this story, I fluctuaded between annoyance at the totally obvious metaphors being shoved down my throat, and interest in the possibility that there would be something wonderful to tie it all together.  Ultimately, it fell flat, and never really told me anything useful, or interesting.  Yes, I did draw parallels between the boys life and my own, as was intended.  But the answers and ideas given were things I figured out as a teenager / early 20s.  This would have been okay if the story itself had been intriguing.  It had moments of humor and heart, but never even tried to develop them.  I hardly even cared about the boy and his Personal Legend (a phrase which is always capitalized and repeated way to many times).  This book could be good for young teens who haven't figured out the way yet, or for an adult who needs a lighthearted reminder of the ultimate simplicity of life.  Overall, this book is like alchemy..   A lot of mumbo jumbo, and instead of gold we are left with a lump of lead.

0385504209|5.0|This book was great. There. All of my thoughts put into five words. It was so good that I managed to finished of in two days. Whats more, I was only able to do that with the Harry Potter books. Every one should read it.
B00005JLSC|4.0|The first musical to win the Best Picture Oscar after 34 years, this 2002 Rob Marshall's adaptation of a 1975 Broadway musical lacks the warmth and romance of the 2001 Baz Luhrmann's hit \\"Moulin Rouge\\", but certainly rivals its daring predecessor in glamour. It's sumptuous to look at and thoroughly glorious as far as film-making is concerned. However, an emphatic viewer has a hard time to identify with any of its characters. Yep, probably no woman would like to find herself in a situation Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones found themselves in here -- murderesses. Maybe later on, when Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Zellweger) are helped by a slick lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and insatiable press to become celebrities of their own. Much like a fairy-tale for grownups, this film does not worry about morals or profound lessons on humanity. Rather, it offers a real show, based on the roaring 1920's with all its sex and prohibition. \\"Chicago\\"'s final effect on viewer is enhanced by great acting, singing and dancing performances from the leading three actors (Zeta-Jones won Oscar for her supporting role), sophisticated choreography and perfect editing, often making for an all-out exhilarating impact.
B00005JLTN|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was left wondering about some things that didn't add up. So I saw it a second time and really paid attention so as not to miss anything. After that I understood the entire movie and knew why everything was happening. So I saw it a third time just to enjoy it the ground-breaking visuals and genius of the whole thing. If you gave this less than 4 stars you obviously saw it once, were too thick to understand any of it and then told all your 'pals' how 'dumb' it was and that it 'didn't make sense'. So go watch your mindless Charlie's Angels(matrix wannabe) garbage. Oh, and drop me a line to tell me how brilliant Kangaroo Jack was.
B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head is the second Coldplay CD, and it is definently full of emotion and raw energy as was the first. However, I don't think it's as good as Parachutes was. Not because the songs aren't of as high quality, but because Parachutes seems to have much more of a mellow and dreary vibe to it, while as A Rush of Blood to the Head has more fast-paced songs. Both are great albums and worth every penny. Stand out songs on this album are &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;In My Place&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, and &quot;The Scientist&quot;.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Well, hasn't come out yet on DVD but I loved it when i saw it the theatres this summer. One of the most entertaining movies this year! Make sure you rent it wen it comes out before everybody fogets about it.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay's &quot;Parachutes&quot; is simply beautiful. First, I bought &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, mainly because of their single &quot;Clocks&quot;, but I found the CD to be full of other great, touching songs. I couldn't get enough of Coldplay, so I went out to get &quot;Parachutes&quot;, expecting it to almost be as good as their second effort, but not quite. However, my prediction was wrong. In my opinion, &quot;Parachutes&quot; is even better than Coldplay's second album. More mellow and dark, &quot;Parachutes&quot; gives us songs like &quot;Don't Panic&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, and &quot;Trouble&quot;, songs that can't be found on &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. Get &quot;Parachutes&quot; now, and if you haven't gotten the band's second album, grab it too. They're both worth every penny.
B00005JLTN|5.0|I have to say, all the amateur critics dropping their \\"elaborate\\" reviews on this movie are quite annoying. This is a Sci-Fi Action flick; it shouldn't be judged under the same standards as an Oscar quality movie.<BR>This movie is very fun to watch! Yes, there are a couple long scenes that seem useless, but the directors put them there for a reason. As a whole, Matrix Reloaded is spectacular.<BR>This movie is far better than the first in that it has a lot more action, a much more complex story, and altogether a more exciting movie watching experience.<BR>I bought my first DVD player when the first Matrix came out, and I think Matrix Reloaded should be a good reason to buy a big Home Theater System (I recommend the Sony ones, I have one, and it rocks!).<BR>I can't wait to pop this DVD in, and have a very exciting movie watching experience with full volume.<BR>Can't wait for Matrix Revolutions!<br />Here's a tip to aid in the better understanding of the Matrix Trilogy. Watch Animatrix, this little DVD packs a lot of information, and gives a nice introduction into the fantastic world of Anime. Matrix is inspired in anime, so if you don't get anime, chances are you might not enjoy this type of movie as much.<BR>Oh, and the game Enter the Matrix, also has some nice bits of info that help into better understanding this story, and it's very fun to play. Not the best action game out there, but quite entertaining.
B00005QIPH|5.0|People are always saying how The White Stripes are better than The Strokes. Well that my friend is a lie. I own both \\"Elephant\\" and \\"Is this it?\\". And to tell you the truth, Elephant pretty much .... It has many weak songs like \\"I Want To Be The Boy... \\" and \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\" sure it has one or two good tracks but its never going to be as good as their old stuff.<BR>Unlike \\"Is this it?\\" this CD is like nothing out there right now. It has great beats that make you get up and dance. Each song is good in their own way. \\"Barely Legal\\", \\"Someday\\", \\"Trying Your Luck\\". Are just a few great songs in this album. This album is one of the best I own. Go get it now. You wont be disapointed.
0790729652|5.0|Superman. Spider-man. X-Men. They're all good comic book films, but to me they pale in comparison to this 1989 classic. Micheal Keaton plays Batman/Bruce Wayne and pulls both roles off real well being a millionaire by day and a crimefighter by night. Jack Nicholson also pulls off a great role as the psychotic Joker. The writers did a very good job on the story. My only complaint is the DVD itself. There's not even a theatrical trailer. Maybe Warner Bros. will release a 2-disc special edition next year for the film's 15th anniversary, complete with a theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, and possibly a commentary. They should, considering all the 2-disc special editions they've been releasing lately. Anyway, I highly recommend this to anyone.<br />My favorite line from the movie:<br />Mugger: Don't kill me.<br />Batman: I'm no going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tell all your friends about me.<br />Mugger: What are you?<br />Batman: I'm Batman.
B00008NG5V|4.0|&quot;On &amp; On&quot; is a great follow-up to &quot;Brushfire Fairytales.&quot;  The music and arrangements are similar enough to build solidly on the strengths of the first CD, but offers definite lyrical growth.  &quot;And there will always be stop &amp; go and fast &amp; slow, action, reaction, sticks &amp; stones and broken bones,&quot; he sings on the opener &quot;Times Like These.&quot;  I have three favorites on the CD.  &quot;Taylor&quot; is a perky track with Jack's throbbing rhythm guitar, a lovely melody and a bit darker lyric, &quot;He thinks that singing on Sunday is gonna save his soul now that Saturday is gone.&quot;  &quot;Holes to Heaven&quot; is another uptempo track with Adam Topol's percussion smashing away juxtaposed to Jack's throbbing guitar.  &quot;Bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of soul,&quot; Jack sings on the upbeat &quot;Rodeo Clowns.&quot;  &quot;On &amp; On&quot; is an excellent progression from his first CD, building on the strengths and adding more lyrical depth.  He's created set of certain fun.  Enjoy!
B00006RAKP|5.0|Whether or not you like Elton the individual or not, it's difficult to ignore his raw songwriting and singing talent.  He is one of the most enduring (and let's not forget successful) performers of the past 30+ years.  His personal life aside, Elton knows how to channel his emotions into some of the greatest songs of the modern rock era.  Just look at this particular compilation and judge for yourself.  This is the first time a collection such as this was possible because over the years, Elton has recorded on no less than 3 different record labels.  This inherently creates quite a problem when it comes to combining all of his best hits into one release and the bickering begins from one label to the next over how much money it will make and who will get it (other than Elton &amp; his lyricist, Bernie).  I don't know HOW they did it, but somehow the heavens parted and an agreement was forged, much to the major surprise of us in radio (they hardly agree on ANYTHING other than downloading music over the internet is robbing them of millions).<br />With that miracle done, the job went to including the best of Eltons vast collection of major hits.  NOT an easy task to say the least...but SOMEONE did it.  I must admit, I was VERY impressed with the selection and how well it chronicled his career from his very first hit song to the most recent.  Unlike many artists or bands (Lionel Richie &amp; Fleetwood Mac) who in MY opinion have yet to be able to re-capture the success of old, Elton has managed to continuously maintain great songs with amazingly catchy harmonies over the years.  I admit that when I heard that Elton was doing music for 'The Lion King' I was skeptical thinking that all his best work was behind him.  I was not only wrong, but WAY WRONG.  It seems that when it comes to creative music composing, you either can do it for years, or after just a few you dry up (has Billy Joel released any pop hits lately?).  Elton continues to draw from that well of creativity and he certainly doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon.  For the serious Elton fan, give this a serious look, you will be amazed at how good it sounds coming from your stereo.and he certainly doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon.

B00005JMCR|4.0|I was not really looking forward to this movie given all the horrible reviews I've read in the newspapers, Entertainment Weekly, etc.  While watching the movie, I was shocked at how funny it was.  It was almost as funny as the first one.  I don't know what the \\"professional\\" reviewers were thinking when they panned the movie, other than figuring that my friend who I saw the movie with was right when he said, \\"Movies for young people shouldn't be reviewed by old men.\\"  I have to say I agree.  Not only does this third installment offer the requisite hilariously gross Stiffler scene (kudos to Sean William Scott for doing whatever the directors/writers ask of him every time out), but there are several great scenes in which Stiffler and Finch pretty much trade  personalities.  Sean William Scott gets 90% of the laughs.  I hope they spin off this character into a movie or two of his own.  Thomas Ian Nichols doesn't really do much as Kevin (which is too bad, because he's a good actor in his own right), but Eugene Levy and Fred Willard do their always hilarious performances.  Even Stiffler's mom sneaks in a cameo.  If you like \\"gross\\" movies, you'll love this movie.  If you like high-brow films, you'll hate it.
B00005JLTN|4.0|Not having viewed the first \\"Matrix\\" film, I had to evaluate this film on its own merits ... which is a good thing, because as I had no basis of comparison, I enjoyed the stunning visual effects and futuristic fantasy concepts without preconceived notions. However, *now* having viewed the original \\"Matrix\\", I can see a few flaws in this sequel. Overall, it is the stunning visual effects that are most memorable: fantastic flying scenes, artistic kung fu & ju jitsu fights, acrobatic leaps including walking on walls and ceilings, photographic views of the gears and machines which keep the underground city of Zion functioning. The most important reason for the film's success is the original creative concept of humans entering the computer program called \\"the Matrix\\" ... to beat it at its own game, i.e. to alter or change it. This idea *alone* makes the film a block-buster at the box office. The inclusion of martial arts and spirituality add further to the intrigue and mystery of the story line ...<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sequel lacked the depth  of the original theme: Neo discovering \\"who he is\\", \\"finding his own path\\" and realizing he is \\"the One\\" who will challenge and possibly ovecome the Matrix program. The build-up to his decision to seek information from the Oracle was nicely done but the actual meeting was a let down. Another minus to the film is the deliberatley prolonged fight scene with the Agents named Smith. It detracted from the impressive and artistic merits of the martial arts fighting. The car chase scene with the Evil Twins on the highway was also lengthy and too exaggerated . There were missed opportunities to film stunning views of the mountains and valleys of Switzterland, personally I think Neo & Trinity arrived at the Swiss castle looking for the key-maker way too soon ... a more meandering route could have been built up with a creative climax. Also, they found the dungeon in the castle where he was locked up too easily. One intriguing twist in the plot could have been to develop a romantic interlude between Neo & the French mistress of the \\"god-father\\". The writers of the film could have explored Trinity's ability to deal spiritually with a \\"love triangle\\". The \\"party scene\\" after Morpheus' speech to the humans seemed rather primitive. It appeared to trivialize the seriousness of the impending invasion by the machines.<br /><br />Overall, the sequel was good but left *this* viewer feeling the film was hyped up too much. No doubt the Matrix trilogy will change how films are made in the future but it should never be forgotten that technical merit does not replace important themes in a story. Place equal emphasis on *both* and I will gladly see the third film in this series.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Well I'm surprised Shaun from Jefferson City, MO USA doesn't like this cd. Maybe a distraught fan and a bad return fan letter. <br />Play this CD as the Sun is going down and definitely play &quot;Turn me on&quot; while you and your significant other are alone. TURN IT UP!

B00005JLTN|4.0|I don't know how many of you have ever seen an entire trilogy, but let me clear one thing up for you, the second one is ALWAYS the lamest one of them. It has to do with the way a story is told. Sure, you can counter that with some...Lord of the Rings speech, but nobody's listening to you anyways. Now, the second movie was NOT as good as the first one, and having saw previews of the third movie, I don't think it's as good as the third one is going to be. If you want a good, quality movie, you might want to skip this one. Truth be told, the action scenes(apart from knowing what happened in part two) is the only reason to watch this movie. But if you're a matrix fan, as I am, you will buy this DVD simply to have the second part of what is sure to go down as one of the greatest trilogies ever. Peace.
B00000JMOJ|4.0|The Running Man is a film based on a surprisingly good short story by Stephen King.  King's tale, a sort of beefed-up '1984', has a man on the run not only from the law, but from a repressive society at large.  It's gritty, gruesome, and so different from the film as to be nearly unrecognizable.<br />The film itself is quite good, although it should be noted from the onset that it has a lot of truly agonizing mid-1980s styles and mannerisms.  Some seem almost farcical, such as the earrings and female hairstyles, but if you can look beyond them you'll likely enjoy this film.  In a nutshell, good ol' Arnie plays a cop (really a special police trooper) who refuses to fire on unarmed food rioters and is arrested.  Society has been transformed into a totalitarian nightmare where the masses are controlled through the media and spoon-fed various gameshows such as 'Climbing for Dollars' where people try to avoid attack dogs and earn cash prizes, and of course the most popular, the Running Man.  The Running Man itself is a gameshow in which fugitives are released into 200 square blocks (the \\"game zone\\") of burnt out LA and then chased around by stalkers as a live studio audience watches.  You can probably see where this is going.<br />Long story short, of course Arnie and his buddies end up in The Running Man show and are chased around by some colorful and entertaining stalkers.  The film does a fairly good job of playing around with the underlying social commentaries of facism and media control (Robocop actually does a better job, and there are similar tongue-in-cheek remarks made in Starship Troopers).  Stalkers are picked to chase our heroes by housewives who like them \\"big and cuddly,\\" audience members are chosen a la The Price is Right to win extra prizes including \\"The Running Man Home Version\\" board game, and as Arnie smashes, bludgeons, mauls, and one-liners his way through the various stalkers sent to kill him, he gradually wins over the crowd, and manages to roll back the media control gripping the masses.<br />The film isn't nearly as gritty as the novel, and often seems downright cartoonish, with stalkers effectively interchangeable with modern professional wrestlers (in a few cases literally, such as Jesse \\"Captain Freedom\\" Ventura, who does a hilarious turn as a retired champion tapped to do away with vexatious Ahnold and who refuses to wear pastic robot armor for the home audience).  All in all the film is a guilty pleasure with its endlessly entertaining one-liners and is about on par with Total Recall for its production values.  As Arnold pictures go, I think it loses out to classics such as Conan the Barbarian or Predator, but still deserves a place in your DVD library.ack the media control gripping the masses.<br />The film isn't nearly as gritty as the novel, and often seems downright cartoonish, with stalkers effectively interchangeable with modern professional wrestlers (in a few cases literally, such as Jesse \\"Captain Freedom\\" Ventura, who does a hilarious turn as a retired champion tapped to do away with vexatious Ahnold and who refuses to wear pastic robot armor for the home audience).

B000008806|5.0|I could lecture for hours probably about how electronica has changed between 1998, when this cd was made, and now, 2003, when this review was written.  A lot's happened.  In short, a genre that spent 30 years putting together a foundation and less than five years in becoming an actual mainstream area.  Electronica is a genre obsessed with the divides between mainstream and underground, and in the past of couple of years, the music has taken a turn in many directions, mainly towards experimentation or pop music.  That's the musical history lesson for today.<BR>Moon Safari was released, as I said, before all of this happened. Now, it sounds incredibly mainstream (I hate the terms mainstream and underground, because good music is good music, but its hard to find other way to explain the two), but then it was kind of experimental.  At the time, however, a group like Air could put out a cd like Moon Safari, which is accurately described as having a certain bubble gum quality, and gain respect, not insults, from all people enamored with the genre.<BR>Every track on this cd is incredibly good.  At the end, you hear hints of The Virgin Suicides Score, and 10,000 ghz legend.  At the beginning, you're reminded of Premiers Symptomes, the first Air album.  It fits right in with their artistic history.<BR>Favorite tracks (in the order they appear on cd):<BR>La Femme D'Argent<BR>Kelly Watch the Stars<BR>TALISMAN<BR>Remember<BR>Ce Matin-La<br />If you want to hear some good music, buy this album.  And if you don't like it, either because it's not mainstream enough, or because it's too mainstream, at least you heard it, and if you can't get props from others on it, as in &quot;hey, you own moon safari, you dog you&quot;, you can always sell it to a used cd shop, where it will undoubtedly go quick.
B000002U94|4.0|In this sequel to LIVE BULLET,we hear songs from the studio albums following LIVE BULLET. They are NIGHT MOVES,STRANGER IN TOWN and AGAINST THE WIND. This set,NINE TONIGHT,is appropriately titled. I supposed this album was taken from various concerts that began at 9 PM. NINE TONIGHT is from the movie &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. Bob Seger recalled in an interview that NINE TONIGHT was intended for the AGAINST THE WIND album. But the producer for the &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; soundtrack album had the song ready for inclusion on the album(UC). This album was recorded at Cobo Hall in Detroit in June 1980 and Boston Garden in October 1980. The AGAINST THE WIND album was being promoted when this album was recorded. Seger has a new keyboard player,Craig Frost,succeeding original Silver Bullet keyboardist Robyn Robbins and David Teegarden,a new drummer. Teegarden replaced original Silver Bullet drummer Charlie Allen Martin,who quit the band due to an auto accident that parayzed him. Like LIVE BULLET,LET IT ROCK was the final track on the album. This version is more electrifying. The CD has an edited version because otherwise it would have been believed that would exceed the maximum playing time on a CD. Or,it would have become a 2 CD set. The LP gives LET IT ROCK's playing time as 8 minutes and 45 seconds. The CD version is only a little over 6 minutes.

Okay, that's just my opinion, but there it is.<br />You don't have to enjoy the film -- if you dislike the music, that's going to be a major turnoff for you. But boring? My gosh, if a viewer is impatient, just jump ahead to the scenes of New York City... how could anyone find that boring?<br />This film is an aquired taste. I couldn't watch it through the first time without taking a break. However, I've had the priviledge of seeing a \\"live performance\\" of this film -- that is, the film was projected with the sound turned off, while Phillip Glass and a handful of other musicians performed the soundtrack live, totally in sync with the film. I didn't have any problem watching it through without taking a break!<br />This is one of the most significant pieces of filmmaking ever made. At least check it out.

0060005424|5.0|I, of course, started off reading Mr. Garth Nix's books with Sabriel. Sabriel was extremely imaginative, with Nix creating an entirely new world with dark creatures, extreme magic, and very realistic characters. Lirael was indeed very good, but I just think that it was a mite worse than Sabriel. While in Sabriel Mr. Nix keeps the point of view soly on Sabriel, and where Sabriel was, and what Sabriel was doing, etc, in Lirael, Garth Nix first starts off from Lirael's perspective for perhaps 150 pages, than turns to Prince Sameth (Sabriel/Abhorsen and King Touchstone's son) for a couple of chapters, than back to Lirael, and so on and so forth. While this was necessary to keep the plot going, I sort of disliked that just as I was settling in and really starting to like reading from Lirael's view, he ends a chapter and starts with Prince Sameth. Otherwise, this novel was fantastic, and I am searching for the next book in the series - Abhorsen. A good summer read for young readers such as I.
B00005221L|5.0|An excellent movie. Easily one of the best action movies ever made. I mean what else could you want from a movie- Arnold Schwartzeneger, Apollo Creed, Govenor Ventura, a minigun, lots of explosions, cool one liners(Stick Around!), and a really cool rasta alien. <BR>P.S. The movie is awsome but it is not scary. It isn't trying to be a horror movie. ...

I suggest KJ52 as an excellent rapper.
B00006HBUB|1.0|Truily a masterpiece of modern ciniema. Far surrpasing the Godfather, this movie is an oscar worthy mystery of epic proportions. Contaning performances capable of moving you to tears, you'll have to watch it again and again. The exact opposite of all that is true of this film. It makes Darkness Falls look like Goodfellas. It contains almost two hours of pure torture. While watching this movie you can actually feel your brain slowly being eaten away. If you watched it enough times your brain would rot down to nothing and then maybe you could tolerate this thing. It is not a movie or film. It is a horrible parrasite. A journey into hell. If satan himself decided to put all his evil and love of pain into a movie it would be better than this freakish excecise in stupidity. God help the unfortunate souls un-lucky enough to see this. Eventualy you will recover just as we did.<br />P.S. we give it one star because we have to, it deserves negative 10

I couldn't see any point to this movie, especially with the \\"fast forward\\" trick at the end to bring us up to a present day NYC skyline in which Scorsese delusionally decided to include the World Trade Center towers.<br />Oh, and since when did a performance that barely made it to \\"Captain Hook\\" Cartoonish level warrant any praise at all?<br />The ONLY part of this movie that was interesting/compelling had nothing to do with the prurient sex and violence.  It was, instead, Boss Tweed, and his nonchalant quips about getting bread and soup out the docks the morning after the murderous draft riots because, \\"We're losing a lot of votes here tonight.\\"<br />THAT is all.

0790733226|5.0|This movie is really slow to begin with and you wonder why you've been watching for so long.  The payoff comes fast and furious as a transmission from outer space quickly transforms the quirky character played by Jodie Foster into a world renowned scientist.  I don't know who plays the eccentric billionaire, but he steals the show.  James Woods is a very formidable antagonist and will not give in throughout this movie.  He has national security in mind and does not budge on any of his stances through the movie.  You really begin to hate Tom Skerrit's character until he gets his final desserts.<BR>Carl Sagan is a famous atheist, but this movie, which has been adapted from his book of the same name, is strangely a search for faith and a god we can all relate to.  Ironic, huh?
B00000JLWW|4.0|Its not plausible that the country that made Titanic the highest grossing movie ever would now verbally bash it. I see that many viewers have given this movie 1 or 2 stars. I agree completely that it is probably not the best movie ever made, but it is still well made. DiCaprio and Winslet have good on screen chemistry and the supporting cast is also strong. This film is not deep in its themes and revelations, but it provides good entertainment value.

It's great trying to figure things out before the characters do. I recommend this book to everybody.

She describes what heaven is like for her, how she feels about missing her family, and what everyone is doing below her.<br />Given that this is the premise, you will understand how far-fetched the ending needs to be to be considered far-fetched.  The author simply doesn't play by the rules she's set up for this fictitious situation.  An entire book based on coming to grips with a life cut short is turned on its ear when the heroine manages to return briefly to earth.  The power of the message of loss, healing and carrying on is severely damaged.<br />That being said, the first 3/4 or so of the book is wonderful, if upsetting, and it's worth reading, although perhaps not in hardcover.
B00005JLSE|4.0|It seems to be an \\"either / or\\" situation with these movies. Is it OK that I like both of them? They're actually very, very different from one another. The only common thread is that they are both musicals. As far as \\"great movie-making\\" goes, Moulin Rouge is much better than Chicago, IMHO. Moulin Rouge runs the gamut of emotions, and it really pushes the envelope a lot more than Chicago does. Chicago is pretty much just a big Bob Fosse tribute (which is fine... I love Bob Fosse! But he made such a mark, he's no longer \\"original\\"). Anyway, I think it is possible to like BOTH movies. Chicago is a lot of fun!<br />The extras on the DVD are good -- I learned a lot about the history of the source material on the Making Of Featurette, and I liked seeing the 'Class' number, which was cut from the feature release. I strongly recommend the widescreen version as opposed to the fullscreen. Fullscreen cuts off so much of those beautiful visuals -- I can't believe they would even release it that way, all visually chopped up.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Wow. I saw it on TV and was dumbfounded. This movie is incredibly hilarious. I highly recommend buying this one. Whether you like B-rated movies or not, this one is sure to please.
B0000399WI|5.0|Every once in awhile, a film comes along that defies explanation, that you can't really pinpoint why everyone loves it so much, you just do. And that that film comes out and is praised to death despite having either low box office return, unknown stars or an extended length. Well among all the teen gross out comedies, teen romances and just convuluted messy and totally unneccessary films, Shawshank towers over them all. <br />Tim Robbins plays Andy, an intelligent banker who is convicted of killing his wife and lover, he's sent to Shawshank Prison. Despite having rather brutal guards and gay men who keep assaulting him, Andy becomes very likable due to his intelligence. He does the guards tax returns and financial advice, gets a big library rather than the 2 shelves they used to have and in one scene, actually let's people listen to a song from the speakers for the first time. He also befriends Red, a kind of convenience store man who can get anything. Over the course of 20 years, we see Andy and Red going through Shawshank and how to have resilience even at it's worst. <br />All this leads up to one incredibly satisfying ending which benefits from a seemingly long film and great acting, this is a very good film to buy, yes I said buy, don't rent this. Buy.
0375751513|3.0|This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.<br />Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.<br />Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else.
0393057658|5.0|I admit as I read this book I was a little disturbed.  As a baseball fan, you want to believe that the closer and clutch hitter are of vital importance to the game, but not in the view of Billy Beane.  A seemingly callous view of almost every romantic role in baseball leaves you wondering throughout the book, unable to put it down.  This book sheds some light on one of the most intriguing mysteries of baseball, how do the cash strapped Oakland Athletics keep winning?      This book has something for everyone.  It involves a lot of mathematics and statistics, but not to worry.  I was a C- math student throughout high school, yet Michael Lewis' storytelling and explanations even made me understand.  A must-read for baseball diehards who are ready to hear a view completely opposite from everything they've ever been told about the game.
0385335482|3.0|I read Confessions of a Shopaholic, and I read it several months after reading Bridget Jones' Diary and about a year before reading Bridget Jones' Edge of Reason.  If you have touched the Bridget Jones books and enjoyed them, don't bother with Confessions.<br /><br />Confessions, and the similar novel A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, seem too much like a spin-off with a far less charming leading lady than Bridget Jones.  Our lead character lives an overly spoiled, overly whiney, trite little life while trying to live like the French royal family.  Boo hoo.  She cries and runs up her credit cards and just like any self-respecting grown woman would do (NOT), she runs home to Mommy and Daddy to fix all her problems for her and cannot figure out why she can't find love ~ DESPITE acting like a child.  (Obviously, I have NO compassion for people who won't take accountability for their OWN bad decisions and don't commend protagonists that act that way either.)<br /><br />The writing style itself is actually quite enjoyable, indicating the author may have other books actually worth reading out there, but I really felt that the characters and plot could have used a lot more depth and charm.  Unless you live by the false Paris-Hiltonesque world that this book tries to perpetuate.
068485743X|3.0|Noah Lukeman's book starts out strong with a new slant on much of the writing advice already out there: less is more, and most is even less than that.  The exercises in the adjective and adverbs chapter are so helpful that they completely transformed the first chapter of my manuscript.  Thanks, Mr. Lukeman.<br />However, once beyond his excellent treatments on modifiers, sound, comparison, and style, one becomes acutely aware that like writing, editing is a highly subjective field.  Many of the techniques that he advocates for sentence construction and dialogue directly contradicts the advice of other well-credentialed editors.  This is where a strong sense of the strengths of your own writing, the conventions of your genre, and the preferences of your agent or editor is going to help you, and where &quot;The First Five Pages&quot; will fall short.  <br />Rather than strictly being a &quot;how not to get rejected off the bat&quot; guide as the cover blurb claims, &quot;The First Five Pages&quot; also endeavors to show you how to write the best novel you can.  That's fine.  But if you take Lukeman too seriously, you might come to the conclusion that he would rather you not write at all than have a single word out of place.  It comes as no surprise, them, that towards the end of the book (and prominent on his literary agency's webpage), we find Lukeman's particular bias: &quot;Ovid, the Roman poet, said one should wait nine years after finishing one's work before seeking publication. Here lies the difference between someone writing for money and a writer.&quot;<br />If it's your goal to win a Pulitzer Prize, that's an admirable sentiment.  For the rest of us making our livings as writers, who want to write great stories that make people think or feel, you are well advised to pick and choose from Lukeman's advice.<br />If you can only buy one book on writing, I instead recommend Donald Maass's excellent book &quot;How to Write the Breakout Novel&quot; which not only focuses on good writing, but the themes and techniques which can make a novel a best-seller. Additionally, &quot;Self-Editing for Fiction Writers&quot; by Renni Browne and Dave King gives some excellent tips, though they disagree with Lukeman on some key points.<br />My best advice is to read as many of these books as you can: take to heart those points on which everyone agrees, internalize the rest, and just write.

There's a site called the Not Yet Successful Entrepreneur Zone... that features stories of failed businesses. Reading these stories are useful because you can learn from others' mistakes.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Good music isn't SUPPOSED to be catchy (you friggen' mtv lovers) Good music makes you want to listen to it over and over again.. notice some new, little detail about each song everytime you pop it in your cd player. it's not about how well it is stuck in your head. <BR>Ive barely gotten past the first song on this cd. It's such a good song i can just listen to it over and over again. Although, all the songs are wonderful. Buy this cd.

B00005JKCH|5.0|Let me start off by saying that \\"Spiderman\\" was my favorite superhero when I was a young child.  Perhaps that is why I enjoyed this movie so much.  It brought me back to a time when I just loved being a kid.  Sure, I got picked on by bullies and I was a nerd, but \\"Spiderman\\" always gave me the hope that one day I would become something that no bully could ever touch.  That's the brilliant thing about this movie.  It reminds you that we have all been the geek or the loser at some point in our lives, but in the end, we always get the upper hand and become something great.  It recalls those days when the sky was the limit and reality was only as close as your eighteenth birthday.<br />In essence, this movie is fiction at its best.  It makes you forget your troubles for a little while and leaves you with a good feeling.<br />The storyline stays true to the comic, with the exception of Spidey's web-slinging ability.  Although that minor detail actually makes the character more believable as superheroes are concerned.  The movie isn't as dark as \\"Daredevil\\" or serious as \\"X-Men.\\"  It's a whiz-bang thrill ride that just cuts loose in front of you.  It takes the campiness that the Kilmer-Clooney \\"Batman\\" movies tried horribly to utilize and mixes that up with the youthful idealism of every kid who has grown up in the good ol' U.S. of A. and makes a fun adventure that's not too violent for the little ones and just deep enough to lure in adults who may not have read \\"Spiderman\\" when they were younger.<br />I'm not giving this movie five stars because I'm a Spiderman fan, I'm giving five stars because it makes you feel great after you've watched it.<br />By all means, watch this film.  It's worth it.
B000002TPS|5.0|i'm hardcore megadeth fans and i like all mega album from 1st till the last. this one is the most melodic mega album. all the songs are great. the intro of &quot;reckoning day&quot; is just briliant &quot;a tout le monde&quot; is a great ballad ,&quot;adicted to chaos&quot; has a amazing vocal done by dave on the chorus, &quot;i thought i knew it all&quot; is my fav tune the drum beat and the lead after the second chorus ROCKS!   i have no complain about the album , maybe ..all the songs has the same tempo, but that's not complain at all since the music is still top quality<br />i dont want to call this album sell out or comparing this album to any other band. the album is WORTH BUYING
B00005JLXE|4.0|\\"Daredevil\\" has always been one of my favorite Marvel characters.  It truly was a surprise to me when I first learned that a film was actually going to be made about him.  He teamed up with Lou Ferrigno's \\"Hulk\\" when that TV series was used to crank out a few TV movies, but that particular flick was wretched.  It did no justice to the \\"Daredevil\\" character.<br />This \\"Daredevil,\\" however, stays fairly true to the comic book, although I felt the story dragged somewhat.  The worst part of the movie was when Murdock and Elektra first meet.  The scenes with the two of them \\"play-fighting\\" came across as too rehearsed and just downright sugary.  Too sugary for a complex hero like \\"Daredevil.\\"  Other than that, the movie is very good.  Comic faithfuls and general movie-goers alike will not be let down by this film.  It contains enough action and humor for anyone, and seems to flow in the same vein as Michael Keaton's portrayal of \\"Batman\\" in the first of that series of movies.<br />The film is very dark, and very violent, which stays true to form when compared with the comic book, especially during the Frank Miller era.<br />Whenever I watch \\"Spiderman,\\" I get this happy feeling from when I was a child still growing up.  It takes me back to a time when superheroes were clean cut, patriotic, and all-around good guys.  When I view \\"Daredevil,\\"  it takes me to my teen years when I thought the world was against me and no one was ever going to help me through.  At that time, superheroes were no longer the good guys, they had become as complex as normal human beings and fought with themselves more than against an enemy.  This type of hero is closer to the real deal, he has problems, both physical and emotional, and there are no defined enemies anywhere.<br />One other small note, if you have young children, I don't suggest letting them watch this film.  \\"Daredevil\\" was geared more toward adults in the comics and so is this film.
B0000024K1|5.0|I remember buying this record back in 88 and travelling home on the train reading the lyric sheet that went with it, trying to get my brain around rhymes which seemed so deep, powerful, explosive. The music that accompained it delivered in a way I'd never heard before, with both fusing to make a record of such ground-breaking importance that after even ten listens, you could not yet comprehend it on a full scale.<BR>   15 years on, it's still the best album I've ever bought or heard, with Chuck's voice still blowing everything else out the water. Eminem may be top dog today, but just like Mike Tyson in his prime, when PE were at their best, no one could touch them.<BR>   Stand out tracks on this LP could well be all of them, with Rebel Without A Pause, Don't Believe The Hype and She Watch Channel Zero being my particular favourites. Produced by the Bomb Squad and everything on this record so tight, it was little wonder that the rap game and music in genre would never be the same again.

B00005JM09|2.0|When science fiction movies like those based in the future or have something to do with it, generally receive huge amounts of appreciation and become increasingly popular, one does not quite resent the idea of watching one of the genre.<BR>I have not watched the first two of the Terminator series, so my views are free from that kind of comparison. <BR>What did I expect from the movie? Thrilling sound-effects and breath-taking visual sequences.<BR>The sound-effects were good and certain scenes showing blasts and the use of their weapons by the Terminator and the Anti-terminator were almost impressive. The attempt at comic relief has proved successful. The computer's view on various subjects was interesting.<BR>However, the movie is basically an endless chase with plenty of 'booms' and 'bangs'. The story is hardly thought-provoking; it does not have that 'unique' and 'unbelievable' and 'interestingly logical' feel to it.<BR>For all those who enjoy raw action, watch the movie, enjoy, HAVE A BLAST!
B00004R9A4|5.0|Because I dimly remembered loving this movie as a child, I recently got it to entertain my two boys, ages 5 1/2 and 8 1/2, on a 2000-mile road trip.  They both loved it, so much so that they chose to watch all or pieces of it over and over again rather than watching other movies we had on hand.  It manages beautifully to entertain both the older one, a Harry Potter fan who finds many cartoons too &quot;babyish,&quot; and the younger one, who is frequently scared of live-action movies and finds even Mary Poppins, for example, too dark.  (The bird lady disturbs him, and I can't convince him Mary's leaving at the end isn't a tragedy.  I wouldn't even attempt to show him Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!)  This one is a delightful mix of fantasy and reality, with just enough suspense and a triumphant ending--not to mention the wonderful performance by Angela Lansbury.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Once upon a time Jon (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) have a chance encounter in a department store.  There is some instant chemistry between the two, but each is involved in a relationship and so they are decidedly indecisive.  However, she keeps talking about Fate as if Lachesis herself was dropping constant hints into her ear.  They part, but are brought together again by Fate (or Serendipity if you will; what is important is that you capitalize the word), and he takes this as a good sign but she insists that a higher standard must be met.  He will write his name and number of a $5 that she spends without looking at; She writes her name and number in a book that she will sell to a used bookstore.  However, not even that is enough to finish tormenting this poor guy because to prove that &quot;now&quot; is not the time they should be together they walk into separate elevators in a hotel to see if they push the same button.  Apparently, Fate not only has a sense of humor, it is a sick sense of humor.<br />Are Jon and Sara supposed to be together?  With this set up you cannot think otherwise, although getting her to tell him her name almost proves impossible (As soon as she said her name my immediate question was &quot;How do you spell it?&quot; and that turns out not to be an idle question because both of these soul mates have dropped the &quot;h&quot; from their names).  Now, we know that Jon and Sara are going to end up together because in the final analysis this is a romantic comedy and not an exercise in existential horror.  But we also know that until he finds the book and she comes across the $5 bill that the cosmic wheel of chance is not even close to having finished spinning.  &quot;Serendipity&quot; is a movie that pours on the close calls and near misses with gay abandon.  The problem is that the stars do not start aligning for this fated couple until both are about to get married.  In other words, while toying with Jon and Sara before allowing them to live happily ever after each gets to ruin the live of another human being.  Maybe the cosmic balance must be maintained and the ultimate joy of our happy couple has to be equaled by the pain inflicted on their fianc&eacute;es.<br />I think if there were not human wreckage behind the happy ending I would have enjoyed &quot;Serendipity&quot; more.

However, &quot;Serendipity&quot; has a cruel streak: notice the circumstances under which Jon discovers the book.

038572179X|3.0|This novel started VERY slowly, and unappealinly. I did not like the character Briony even before her actions came into play.  I just found her irritating, and the author seems to dwell with fondness on her &quot;writer-ly&quot; ways and in general on the craft of writing, which becomes very boring unless you are interested in the writing process rather than in the finished writing and the stories themselves.  Twice, I almost decided not to finish reading this book.  Finally, I got interested enough to want to find out what would happen.  It is well written and ultimately has an interesting story to tell, and we finally do see why the craft of writing is a subject, but it's still an irritating element of the novel, and Briony is irritating.  Anyway, I would say it's very good writing, an OK story, but nothing I'd recommend to friends.
B00009L1TA|4.0|I almost always watch a film twice, even if I have to wait for it to come out on video or DVD for the second viewing.  I can distinctly remembering being aware that I enjoyed watching &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; more the second time around with all the ways that Frank Capra set up the nightmare sequence at the end.  Since then I have enjoyed watching films a second time to appreciate how stories and surprises are set up.  After watching &quot;Basic&quot; I was really looking forward to a second viewing to appreciate how this one set off the dramatic payoffs at the end.  Having listened to John McTiernan and James Vanderbilt talking about the directing and writing of &quot;Basic&quot; I wanted to really pay attention to how they set me up, because I never saw the end of this one coming.  But once I finished watching the film a second time I realized something rather depressing: I never had a chance.  On the one hand I like the fact I did not see the ending of this one coming; but while there are hints that point to the resolution there is only the empty feeling of being tricked, not the joy of having been played.<br />&quot;Basic&quot; is a military murder mystery involving a number of deaths in a Rangers training exercise in the rain soaked jungles of Panama.  Samuel L. Jackson plays the drill sergeant from hell and John Travolta is the former army officer called in to investigate by an old buddy.  The film has been compared to both &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Rashomon,&quot; and both comparisons are faulty.  &quot;Memento&quot; was brilliantly constructed and the audience understood exactly how it was being played.  In &quot;Basic&quot; you are fooled, not because you have been tricked, but rather because you have been lied to.  &quot;Rashomon&quot; had different characters telling their own decidedly different version of the same event, which is certainly a key part of &quot;Basic,&quot; and in both films you do get the truth at the end.  But when you watch &quot;Rashomon&quot; a second time you understand why each character tells the story that they tell; the &quot;lies&quot; or &quot;self-deceptions&quot; make sense in that they present the teller in the best light.  But in &quot;Basic&quot; the lies are intended primarily to confuse the audience.  Which they do.  All we can assume is that each telling of the tale is closer to the truth, but even that knowledge does us no practical good.<br />This is disappointing because we are talking a movie directed by McTiernan and starring Travolta and Jackson and we would expect something better.  However, after listening to the various interviews on the DVD I can see what happened.  McTiernan and Travolta were impressed with Vanderbilt's script, but the director objected to the fate of Jackson's character and Travolta was not happy with what happened to his own character.  Consequently, the second half of the script was rewritten to make everybody happy.  However, when you are talking about a carefully constructed murder mystery, these sorts of revisions clearly turned what might have been a delicate mechanism into a cinematic bulldozer.<br />Maybe you will not be offended by the way it all works out.  &quot;Basic&quot; is certainly compelling, not only in the way Travolta's character of Tom Hardy interrogates various witnesses to what happened out in the jungles of Panama, but also the way he banters with Captain Osborne (Connie Nielsen), the young officer who has the misfortune of being the closest thing the base has to an investigative officer.  The cast is excellent, with Giovanni Ribisi, Taye Diggs, Brian Van Holt, Tim Daly, and Harry Connick, Jr. running around tangling with Travolta and Jackson.  To be fair, I did not really understand how badly I had been had until I watched the film a second time, but &quot;Basic&quot; should have been the real thing and it is not.tch &quot;Rashomon&quot; a second time you understand why each character tells the story that they tell; the &quot;lies&quot; or &quot;self-deceptions&quot; make sense in that they present the teller in the best light.

B00005JKN9|3.0|My opening salvo about this DVD concerns formats. Not too many people have shelled out the big money for a widescreen tv. Therefore I am totally against WS editions in the 2:35 aspect ratio. While viewing on a conventional tv this ratio cuts off heads! It also removes emotional expression because of the distance from the actors face. The 1:85 is the way to go. It is the best at capturing 70mm for the average viewer. The best of both worlds at satisfying director/viewer I saw this movie in the theater and never thought about the time, thought the movie was over-long, or was in gerneral bored in any way. The full impact of the movie in DVD 2:35 is considerably lessened. No close ups. The action is so far away emotions are lost. I was really dissapointed. A great though addmitedly flawed movie. 2 other points: Robbie Robertson of &quot;The Band&quot; compiled the music and did a stellar job. Also I agree that the script was a bit of a mess, but I maintain that CASTING could have been more inspired. While the charismatic DiCaprio does a creditable job, I believe the Irish Colin Farell would have been a better match against the Day-Lewis caracter. Cameron Diaz??? WHAT were they thinking? Too modern. Nicole Kidman would have been a better choice.

0679735909|4.0|At first, I found Possession incredibly dull- I was hard put to keep my mind on it, but after a few pages, I was caught.<br />The concept is intriguing, the writing, for the most part, is beautiful. However, there were several sections that I just couldn't read through, no matter how hard I tried. There is a chapter comprised of the correspondence between Randolph Henry Ash and Cristobel LaMotte that could've been taken out entirely without doing any damage to the novel. The dialogue is unrealistic and an eyesore to read- it's almost as if the characters either can't let each other finish their sentences or don't know how to speak in full sentences. <br />However, those criticisms aside, it's a good choice if you're looking for something to read on a long plane/car/bus ride, but don't pick it up if you're looking for a bit of light reading to loose yourself in after a long day.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I saw Nemesis in the theatre and purchased the dvd upon its first day of release.  From then probably have viewed it another 8 or so times.  So why the chills?  The final 30 or so minutes of this movie is worth everything.  The special effects and battle sequences are the best I have ever seen in anything trek to date - period!  In the theatre I found myself gripping my seat and unmoving for this period.  Even if the rest of the movie was horrible, it would still be worth it just to see the ship-to-ship fights.  As for the rest of the movie, it is far from ugly, as many viewers and especially critics have said.  I don't understand it.  Maybe if you are not a Trek fanatic then it isn't entirely appealing, but for any Trek appreciator, I strongly believe Nemesis will be nothing less of a thrill ride. The story revolves heavily around Picard and his younger clone, &quot;Shinzon&quot;  There are some that knock this because the movie revolves around these characters so much, well, that's why they called it &quot;Nemesis&quot;, it was suposed to.  Yes, Shinzon is scary.  At first I almost laughed in the theatre when his image was revealed, looking almost like Dr. Evil from Austin Powers.  Throughout the movie, in each scene, Shinzon becomes more angry, aggressive, and more &quot;evil and gruesome-looking&quot; (there's a part of the story that deals with why).  Then there's Shinzon's viceroy, played by Ron Pearlman who did such a fine job that he could play the role of the evil-villan in several of the scenes. The dark and resonant voice of the character just sets a very creepy effect that is really cool.  Back to the Picard vs. Shinzon deal; upon first watching I thought it was a bit of nonsense connected to a complete madman.  Well, in a sense Shinzon becomes a madman later in the film when his plans fall apart.  And there is more to this conflict than meets the eye.  Picard is faced with what he would be like if he had lived Shinzon's life.  He tries to resist the emotional attacks from Shinzon on the subject, but you can tell that Picard is really affected at times with the matter in a very deep, person way (naturally).  It makes for a pretty interesting story. Some of the scenes are hard to follow but that is due to the extreme editing for the final cut.  The deleted scenes included on the dvd &quot;extras&quot; allow for some things to make more sense.<BR>The dvd itself is terrific.  The digital video and audio effects are excellent and even better than in the theatre (with a good home theatre system of course).  With the exceptions of the special editions dvds of Treks' 1 - 4, Nemesis has more extras than any other Trek dvd.  <BR>The big problem about Nemesis for everyone is that it is a copy of The Wrath of Khan.  It very much is similar in almost every way.  But the good news is that if you loved ST2, than Nemesis will not disapoint.  Think of it as a new and refreshing sequal to the best Trek movie ever.
0800141660|5.0|This is one of the few movies that I've found are better than the original book. Thompson's adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is witty and vivid, and, for the most part, stays true to the book. The actors are wonderful for their parts- seeing Hugh Grant, for one, as a slightly bemused but benign suitor is a riot. This a must-have of a movie!
B000083E79|5.0|This CD is fantastic! Actually,there is no words to describe how great it is! For all you Cher fans, BUY THIS CD!!! You'll love it!I've listened to it nonstop since I got it and know each and every song by heart!! CHER RULES!!!
0679720200|5.0|A book worth buying and reading one hundred times.  The words draw you in and allow you to feel in the action.  One of the greatest books written.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|This is not a movie I would have ever watched if someone had described it to me, so I had to think a while about why I would recommend it.  Here are the reasons I came up with. First, this is a great story.  The movie flows well, keeps you wondering what's going to happen next, and the ending satisfies.  Second, it only takes about fifteen minutes before you feel as if you live in the family-like atmosphere at the Bagdad Cafe/Motel.  The characters are quirky, but down-to-earth and real: CCH Pounder is awesome in the role of the paranoid self-martyr;  Marianne Sgebrecht is simply lovable; Jack Palance is a little creepy, but likeable and funny as an aged hippie (seeing him in such an odd role is almost worth buying the movie just for this).  Third, it made me laugh - not belly laughs, but chuckles (mostly at the expense of the characters flaws)that might take a second viewing of the movie once you've learned more about the characters.  Fourth, this movie has a great, but unforced message about accepting others for what they are, and just loosening up and living your life.  <BR>  Buy this movie.  It might not be one you'll pull out for the guys on poker night, but it will be one you can watch ten years from now and know it's a classic.
B00000J7JO|5.0|After hearing the first single from this CD &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; I was less than impressed.  I had always loved the funk-rock style on the Chili Peppers' previous CDs, and this song just sounded like another modern rock track, distiguishable from the others on the radio only by Anthony Keidas' unique voice and the tell-tale bassline that makes you think &quot;Chili Peppers&quot; whenever you hear it.<BR>Being a loyal fan I purchased the CD anyway and I was pleasantly surprised.  I foud it to be one one of those rare albums that you can listen to the whole way through, without having to skip over any mediocre songs.  The songs all blended well for a nice listen.<BR>I will always be a fan of the &quot;old sound&quot; of RHCP, but this album gave me faith in their musicianship, as they were able to show their aptitude at other types of sound to produce a stellar recording.
6302814359|4.0|I'm a zombie movie fan, and this movie was too funny!  Its like they weren't even trying to be serious (which they werent)  But as a zombie flick there is lots of gore, and rather cool 80's style clothing.  Nice :)
0066620996|5.0|Wow!  I've been something of a connoisseur of business books for over 20 years going back to Drucker and Porter, but this is beyond a doubt one of the best I've ever encountered.<BR> What distinguishes it first and foremost is the sheer rigor of the research that went into it. Many popular business books are long on ideas and supporting anecdotes, but short on clinical research. This one is firmly grounded in exhaustive study and real numbers. In fact, Collins mentions that a professional statistician who reviewed his methodology stated categorically that the likelihood of any of his key findings being purely coincidental was 1 in 1.7MM!  Yet it doesn't read like a dry, clinical report at all. It's simply an extraordinarily lucid investigation of what allows a few companies to become great when so many of their peers remain just good. And frankly, I don't care how busy an executive is-from the CEO down-the only excuse for not reading this book is a latent fear that he or she may not have the goods to take a company to \\"great\\". Mr. Collins simply lays out a path too clear to be ignored that should guide the thinking of any business leader whether his or her company is large or small, not-for-profit or profit obsessed. It's a great book. (And the perfect gift for any Board member or senior Executive currently wrestling with how to turn in strong results and not run afoul of Sarbanes-Oxley.)
B000002VCU|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project's &quot;The Turn Of A Friendly Card,&quot; their 1980 observation of the world of gambling, is an outstanding prog-pop album, and one of the group's very best works. In fact, I'd probably park this album right behind &quot;Tales Of Mystery &amp; Imagination&quot; as the group's greatest disc. The music composed by Parsons &amp; Eric Woolfson is simply stunning, the arrangements lush &amp; breathtaking, the performances powerful. &quot;May Be A Price To Pay&quot; is a terrific opener, with singer Elmer Gantry taking you into the casino with this first-rate rocker. You can just see those roulette wheels spinning, the dice being thrown, and the cards being dealt while listening to this song, especially during the dreamy instrumental bridge. &quot;Games People Play,&quot; sung by Lenny Zakatek, is a Project classic, another great exuberant rocker and one of the group's biggest hits. Eric Woolfson passionately sings &quot;Time,&quot; another Project staple and one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded (and the only song that seems to depart from the album's gambling theme). I dare you not to melt on hearing this exquisite ballad! Zakatek returns to sing &quot;I Don't Wanna Go Home,&quot; a terrific, rough &amp; tough song about obsessive gamblers. &quot;The Gold Bug&quot; is a wonderfully hypnotic Project instrumental, and then, finally, there's the epic title suite, containing the songs &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;, &quot;Nothing Left To Lose,&quot; and the instrumental, &quot;The Ace Of Swords.&quot; Sung by both Chris Rainbow &amp; Eric Woolfson, this rock suite contains all the hallmarks of classic Project music: marvelous prog/pop, great orchestrations by Andrew Powell, a shimmering instrumental break, and top-notch performances and production---just like the rest of the album! &quot;The Turn Of A Friendly Card&quot; is a glowing gem from Alan Parsons &amp; company, one of their finest. Getting this album is one gamble you can definitely bet on.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This review is basically in response to a review i just read on here from a 15 year old girl. I am only 14, but I think John Mayer's CD is actually a good one, and I normally don't even like this kind of music. If you really hate John Mayer that much, then why did you waste your time going to look up his CD and writing a review. You obviously like something about him if you would take out that much energy and time to talk about him. Just because you aren't old enough or mature enough to listen to his music doesn't mean you have to go trashing him. If you'e not sensitive enough to listen to him, then stop wasting our time and your own. Maybe your the one with the problem. Just stay in your own business.

B00005JLXE|1.0|it started out ok....   however, by about halfway through the movie, i really didn't *care* if our \\"hero\\" won or lost anymore.  my son walked out of the room about 20 minutes into the movie... glad i rented it first instead of wasting the money on a purchase.   if you have pre-teen kids, they'll hate it - pick batman, spider man, blade, or the terminator movies.... just DON'T pick *THIS*.

B00005JKZV|5.0|In the second chapter of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, we pick up right where The Fellowship of the Ring left off.  And this movie ups the ante in every department.  It's more emotional and a more complex story.  And it delivers a powerhouse of visual effects, most notably ferocious battle of Helm's Deep and the devilish character of Gollum.  Never before has a digital character delivered an acting PERFORMANCE of this caliber.  The Two Towers is a fitting part of what may be the best motion picture trilogy of all time!  This DVD is a MUST OWN for any fan of cinema.
0688163173|5.0|Dennis Lehane is a master of writing and surprise. He is one of the best writers of today- his possession of language and description surpass none. His new novel &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is one of the best. Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, U.S.Marshalls, are asked to go to Ashecliffe Hospital for the Mentally Insane to find an escaped patient/killer, Rachel Solando. Ashecliff is on an isolated island off the coast of Boston. From day one none of the staff are very helpful- always below the surface is a subtle message- we don't care, we are going through the motions from those who inhabit this strange island. The worst hurricane of the season occurs, and Teddy and Chuck going nowhere with this investigation, fear for their lives. Will they get off the island, will they find the killer, what is going on in the tower, and why does Teddy have such a hard time forgetting his dead wife?  Will any of these questions be answered? Unless you have a tortured, twisted mind- the ending will clear the air. prisrob
B000002JSN|5.0|Their greatest work. Not one song is boring or ok on this album.  Each song is unique in their style and sounds original (not like most popular groups today, who try to copy other bands to become famous).  People like to say that Zepp 4 was the best (because of Stairway), but this is where their creativity in songwriting hits the peak.  If you don't have this album, and you call yourself a rock n' roll fan, you're missing a big piece of music.
0385507755|5.0|The book is phenomenal. I suppose having come from a background of addiction and being in a treatment center, I relate.  I advise the entire world to read this book. We should all know what it is like to feel the things an addict feels, and James completely and totally shares himself with us.  <BR>I just want to meet him, and hug him. Outstanding.
B00009UW0N|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 10 and it scared me to death!!!

B000002UJQ|5.0|Great album, the best of Radiohead. Your lyrics, for me, vocalist Thom Yorke inspired by the George Orwell's novel '1984',<BR>songs like 'Paranoid Android'(doublethink of Winston Smith),'Karma Police'(Thoughtspolice of '1984') and 'No Surprises'(Lullaby for Smith). My theory is confirmed by the title of the first song of new album 'Hail The Thief: 2+2=5, it's completely Orwellinism, the Big Brother is watching you...
B000063V8S|5.0|The third season finale,The Best Of Both Worlds Pt 1 make the viewers wait in anticipation for the following season.Although Pt II was somewhat of a letdown,the fourth season was no less than a success.<br /> Classic episodes,including Family,The Drumhead,Reunion,Data's Day,Q-pid,The Host,and the season finale,Redemption ,measured up easily with the best of the original series.<br />  The fact that it reached it's 80th episode(passing TOS's 79 episode run),showed that TNG was a force to be reckoned with.
B00000331V|4.0|Recorded live in Detroit, Michigan at the Cobo Hall, and at the Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" was the J. Geils Band's second live offering. It follows the success of 1972's \\"Full House\\" and it was released at a time when the band had reached a high level of popularity among fans for its incredible, fully- energetic live performances.<br />This album contains 17 songs and back when it was released on vinyl (remember records?), it was a two- record set. The songs on this album are mostly fun, funky, good times rock and roll with rhythm and blues influences on many songs. The R&B is strongest on songs like \\"Where did our Love Go\\" (Cover of the old Supremes hit single), \\"So Sharp\\", and others. But the most memorable songs on the album are \\"Musta Got Lost\\", a song known for its introductory speech by lead singer Peter Wolf; \\"Houseparty\\", and all- out rocker that explodes from start to finish; and \\"Give it to Me\\", a funky tune with an R&B groove.<br />This album does expereince an occasional low, and this fact prevents me from rating it higher. I don't care too much for the single \\"Truck Drivin' Man\\", with its country roots. \\"Sno- Cone\\" and \\"Back to get Ya\\" are also forgettable. They are average songs at best and they should have been left off the album.<br />Overall, though, \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" delivers as a live CD. The music is mostly fun and energetic. It may not have the all- out, in your face, shake- your- body- every- which- way feeling that made \\"Full House\\" so enjoyable, but it's still better than your average live CD and it makes a great addition to any music collection. It's a must for any die- hard J. Geils Band fan!
B000063V8U|4.0|While many took note that DS9's premire took a little wind out of the sixth season,TNG juggled with stories that ranged from Playful(Rascals,A Fist Full Of Datas),introspective(Tapestry,Lessons),suspenseful(Face Of The Enemy) to eerie (Man Of The People,Schisms).<BR> The highlight of the season was Relics,which James Doohan's Scotty returns after being in a transporter stream for 75 years.The best episode of the season is the two part Chain Of Command which has Picard re-assigned,then taken prisoners & tortured by the Cardassians.<BR> The season finale Descent,returning with a new Borg threat ends on a limp note(especially after Best Of Both Worlds Pt 1),but season six was definately an interesting experience.
B00004R99K|1.0|I saw this movie when I was little and I enjoyed it. Now I'm 13 years-old and when I recently watched it I relize how bad it is. I hate it. I don't know why...I just can't stand it. The charactors are annoying, especially Alice. The whole movie she's whining about going back home. Urgg! I got so sick of hearing her whine and complain I almost turned the movie off! The other charactors are stupid, the songs are bad, and the plot is boring and confusing.<BR>~~~~~~~~<BR>If you want to see a good fantasy movie, I recommend the original 1939 movie, The Wizard of Oz.
B00000F14B|5.0|i was dating the wonderfull Miss Luckey when this film was made.<br />Damn, i should have married that girl.<br />so it is for personal reasons that i continue to watch and rewatch this film (and Oklahoma).  But i had not seen the dvd until recently and it is greater than ever.  i loved the &quot;making of the movie&quot; clip.<br />  This film is just fun all the way through.  no low huggers, no cleavage, no four letter words.  God how would it be received now?   <BR>    oh, well, we always will have the dvd.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is the only Trilogy that is giving George Lucas Star Wars a run for its money; with battle scenes and special effects that make Luke and Hans intergalatic battles seem like a cheap street fight and acting that is academy worthy The Two Towers continues to make cinematic history... simply stated it is simply stunning
B00006SFBD|4.0|Seems to me the fist time I picked up the album, the songs sounded great but didn't stick in my mind as much as blackwater park did when it first came out.  The main reason for that is that the songs are very similarly written as in blackwater park but with more brutality, not as creative as the older stuff, and the riffs in the songs tend to repeat themself more often then usual.  What makes this album good and original is the odd ending for the last track which is some message played in revearse, the third track (a fair judgement) which is one of the calm songs with clean vocals, the fifth track (master's apprentices) which sounds like a progressive version of morbid angel during the intro, and the breakdown after the ooh and ahhh part is awsome, it is so brutal all of a sudden, other then that there isn't much else interesting in the album.  I'd only recommend it to those familiar with Opeth from at least My Arms Your Hearse, otherwise, don't get this album before you hear the early Opeth.  The early stuff is written from a different perspective mainly because of a different rhythm line-up.  Although My Arms, Your Hearse was with a new line up, it was totaly different from the last 4 albums, also, If you like their acoustic and calm stuff, you'd like the Damnation album which was supposed to be a double album along with Deliverance.

B00005K3OT|5.0|This phenomenon of cinematic excellence is a gorgeous film with fabulous characters that one grows to love.  For those who think the title is spelled incorrectly, you are mistaken.  Chocolat is French for chocolate.  (The story takes place in France).  Binoche gives an outstanding performance as an incredible free spirit who challenges the traditions of old.  Johnnd Depp sizzles as hot as ever in another fantastic role as the mouthwatering &quot;river rat&quot; that captures Binoche's heart.  Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Lena Olin, and Carrie-Ann Moss give outstanding performances in this charming film.  Chocolat is truly delicious!
B000002AH1|5.0|While it is interesting to hear Miles experimenting on the studio tracks, he and the crew are absolutely incendiary on the live cuts. This music is Miles as boxer: the sheer force of it will pummel you like Ali. Possibly the best live fusion there is. Hey Columbia, quit snoozing on the job and open the vaults. The entire 12/19/70 set, please!
0792844882|5.0|You can only understand and appreciate this movie in the entire context of Verhoeven's work. I think his mission is to take the formula of the Hollywood blockbuster, which he understands perfectly (Robocop) and push it (Total recall) and push it some more (Basic instinct) until it explodes (Showgirls). What makes Verhoeven truly admirable is that he keeps pushing (Star troopers) until the movie becomes a pastiche of itself and of the genre. [Note: I haven't seen Hollow Man and I am quite curious whether it still fits the equation.]<br />On this continuum, as I said, all movies fit the blockbuster formula very well: very polished cinematography, great production values, ridiculous plot developments, sex&violence, vacuous acting, etc. Up to 'Showgirls' the formula has the expected effect on the movie-watching crowds; after it (i.e. 'Troopers') the very simple-minded movie-goer funnily enough still likes it on that wham-bang level, but most people perceive it as a satire of sorts. <br />This leaves 'Showgirls' the odd movie out. The ingredients are the same as, but the dosage is different: it's too much to take but not enough to be truly over the top. The movie hovers in a very precarious region around the top making the viewer very uncomfortable. As most of the reviews will testify, many feel guilty about watching it; many criticize it without giving motives (\\"the worst movie **EVER**!!\\"); many give motives that are absurd (plot holes? you need to take a movie quite seriously to dig for plot holes.) or incorrect (poor cinematography? quite the contrary.) or at best questionable (poor acting? not worse than anything with Tom Cruise in it and, besides, a certain mannerism of acting is part of what I call 'the Hollywood formula'.)<br />The greatness of this movie, or rather of Verhoeven's work as a whole, lies in what it says about the person who watches the film. I wouldn't call Verhoeven an artistic genius, because he might simply work mechanically, increasing the dosage of the ingredients with scientifical precision. He might do it out of curiosity, or maybe he even foolishly thinks the more the better. Alghough I strongly doubt he is a fool. The fact that he accepted the Razzie award for 'Showgirls' in person tells me he's in on the joke.<br />Anyway, kudos to him for keeping this grand experiment going all the way and not being phased by the critics, the public or the studios. If not a genius, at least Verhoeven is a director of great integrity.
0061020680|4.0|Terry Pratchett's Discworld series tend to be about the same level of quality because he follows the same formula throughout (at least as far as the first eight books are concerned, which I have read). This one though is slightly better than most. I think the main character Mort should make return appearances in future books and to my knowledge he hasn't. <BR>Basically Mort becomes Death's apprentice. I don't want to say anymore but I have a feeling that this part of the series contributes significantly to Death's ongoing stories as the most recurring character in teh Discworld series. If you want to get into Discworld but, for some reason don't want to start at the very beginning, this is a good sampler.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Identity is a thinking person's film.  From the beginning you are examining everything that you see on the screen.  You know it's a mystery and you know it's going to get stranger by the second, so you look at every clue you're given until the end when it's wrapped up.<br />John Cusack, one of my favorite actors, gives a phenomenal performance as the Ex-Cop/Limo Driver.  Ray Liotta is startling as the Detective and the scenery and weather play just as much a part as any of the actors.  John C. McGinley is one of the greatest character actors around and his performance is very noteworthy.  The hotel is terrifying, and the direction of the film taps into your psyche, making you feel as if you're alone the entire time trying to put this guessing game together.<br />The clue start off as minimal pieces of the movie, and as the plot unfold the clues get bigger and more important until you've figured it out.  I figured it out around key chain #7 which is pretty deep into the film.  Once you do begin to figure out the mystery, you look back on the much smaller clues and see how pertinent they were in the beginning of the story.  I had to go back and watch it a second time just to see how the beginning pieces fit into place.<br />I loved this movie and will be ordering the DVD soon enough.
B00005JKZU|5.0|I think this has to be the best new film this year.<br />I didn't think the first part (Lord of the Rings)could be beaten as it was brilliant, but i was mistaken.<br />Now i can't wait for the third part to come out, but in the mean time i can hire out The two Towers and enjoy.<br />Eventally when all three are out i will purchase them as i think these will be one of those films that will go down in history with it's fantasic story line and brilliant charactors (Well done to the actors that played there parts so well). <br />Definitly a must see!!!! I would recommend to anyone...
B00008S2VG|2.0|I'm a BIG Madonna fan, and was really looking forward to this CD.  Unfortunately it wasn't enjoyable.  By the lack of sales, I guess I'm not alone in this thinking.  The best song is &quot;Hollywood,&quot; because it has a driving beat.  Don't get me wrong -- the CD has lots of potential.  The problem is that it sounds too robotic.  That works for Kraftwerk, but not for Madonna.  Her best albums had imaginative and supportive production (Nile Rodgers, Stephen Bray/Patrick Leonard, William Orbit).  Not so with this one.  Let's hope Madonna has the entire CD remixed so that &quot;American Life&quot; can have a second life.
B000099T2L|3.0|I reviewed this ablum upon it's release and i'm updating the review. This was Beyonce's first time out of the gate.  This CD is not a completely bad effort for her 1st solo effort.It's filled with radio friendly pop and several guest stars that at times stole the show. She's often in danger of being a hook girl. Jay-Z gave her street creditablity and an audience that would have been a little hard for her to reach. It would have been nice to have a little more her than all the guests stars but this helped insure the album would sell big and it has, 4 million to date.  There are some highlites such as Be With You, Me, Myself and I and The Closer I get to you . Her writing and vocals are decent, but a powerful songtress she's not. While she can carry a tune, her vocals are sometimes weak. The big voice she's been credited with by critics who are in love with her anatomy is not there. Some of the songs in the second half could be DC3 songs,which Dangeously in Love is, and kills the 2nd part of the album. It becomes drown out and boring. She's really playing the big booty sex card to death and has become quit tiring. Dangerously in love won 5 grammys and a ton of other awards. While I can't in good nature deny it should have earned a grammy or 2, 5 was differently overkill. Hopefully Beyonce's next solo effort will be a little more creative and heartfelt. When she really expresses her real and true self, maybe she'll gain the real credit for being a serious artist she longs for like artists such as Mary J.Blige, India Arie, Jill Scott, Alicia Keys. Opinions about the songs remain the same. She pulled off 2 #1 singles and 2 others in the top 10 which is a wonderful accomplishment, it would have been even better if she could have kept her clothes on. Serious artist, no, eyecandy yes. For now she's our favorite booty girl.          Dangerously In Love  1. Crazy in Love 5/5 - A completely enjoyable dance song with a Crazy old school horn sample and a hard driven beat. Jay-Zserves up a rapper's delite with his perfect verse giving it exactly what it needed. Her vocals are okay on this one but the lyrics are pretty simple. Their starting to play it too much now though.    2.Naughty Girl 1/5 - Good beat, weak vocals to much whinning and and too much air. She failed to capture the feel of Donna Summer's orginal sexy and sensual vocals.    3.Baby Boy 4/5 - Great beat, Banging Rap provided by Sean Paul(he made the song), felt more like she sang a hook instead of being the primary on the song much better version on the internet,but will be a big club song, it should be the next single too keep the album going.    4. Hip Hop Star 5/5- Classic OutKast Flavor. She agains becomes the hook girl on this one. She sounds left behind when she first starts but catches up nicley. Still trying to be sexy and seductive but not quite there yet, she's holding back. This could have easily been an OutKast album cut with Big Boi and Sleepy Brown on this one, they completey take the song away from her. Their too strong for her.    5. Be With You 4/5 - She did a decent job on this Bootsy Collins hit,toward the end her vocals didn't display the strength to finish.    6.Me,Myself,and I 4/5 - Great song, Great lyrics, wonderful vocal performance. She completely delivers on this cut. You can invision her finding this self discovery.Could have also been a DC3 song.    7. Yes 3/5 - Typical song nothing special, could have been a DC3 song.    8.Signs 4/5 -This is one from Missy, good job, great production and she pulls off the sexy vocals on this one.     9.Speechless 4/5 - Great song, well written and beautifully sung. I think she acheived sexiness and sensuality on this cut.    10.That's How You Like It 1/5 - This is the worst song on the album. She's accompanied by Jay-Z on this cheesy not worthy cut.    11. The Closer I Get To You 5/5 - Fantasic Job. She's Blessed to sing along side The Great Luther Vandross and holds her own beautifully. I was really proud of herwhen I heard this cut. Great Job!!    12. Dangerously in Love 2 - 2/5 Nothing special about this song. Made with DC3 1st time around. Displays the same flavor, nothing new.    13. Beyonce Interlude - 5/5 A clear and honest reflection on how she feels for her special someone(Jay-Z).    14. Gift From Virgo- 2/5 - Although there is nothing special about this song, it lets you in a bit to her personl side. I think it's a song showing how much she cares for him.    15. Hidden Bonus Track Daddy 5/5 - Beautifully written and very well sung by her. She displays her proud and loving feelings toward her father and shows her appecitation in this heartfelt cut.    That's my review of Dangerously In Love. If your are a fan of hers you'll enjoy it and if you like crazy in love don't expect the CD to be more of the same, it's not, but there are a few cuts that are noteable. Remember the music is what counts and not the image. Peace and Love!!!
B000068UXF|5.0|I agree completely with Mr. Marcelino Plaza's (Caracas) detailed review on this marvelous opera. However, Mr Plaza should not worry about cuts in the Nurse part Solti... insisted in presenting the work complete, whether for the public or in the studio, so we may presume this performance is complete, although it is neither so advised in the booklet nor could I check it with a score. <BR>Actually, the score IS complete and this is written in the booklet (p. 16) included with the 2 DVDs.
0451175123|5.0|I thought the Fountainhead was the most compelling and fascinating book I have ever read. However, it is somewhat uneventful at times, and a difficult book to plow through. I would recommend this book to you if you are an intellectual who is interested in being introduced to thought provoking material, and concepts which will enhance your insights. I suggest that if you decide to read the Fountainhead, skim through the speeches and extra information which is not pertinent to the plot, so that you will not become bored. Then, after you have finished the book, go back and read the parts you didnt give your full attention. This way, you will get a lot more out of Rand's ideas, but not lose interest.

B00009V7P8|4.0|The days when Rice fronted the now defunct tedious Juniper seem a long way off. It is hard to believe the same Damien Rice made 'O' one of the best-kept secrets of 2002. Recorded at his house and friends' places in Dublin over the course of two years, it sounds neither lo-fi or over polished but somehow he has created a happy medium without ever getting swallowed up by the principle of either recording styles. <BR>The names of the opening duo, 'Delicate' and 'Volcano', sum up 'O's gentle appeal and emotional intensity; where strings nestle down with acoustic guitars and Rice shares the limelight with singing soulmate Lisa Hannigan. This album has some for the best crafted song of last year and has rarely off my stereo. I have played this album to a number of people and they are amazed by it's beauty. It's an album that gets sadder with every listen and even more beautiful and but better too. Saying all that the album does tend dips in the later songs, there's more than enough pain and poise here to suggest that he'll be a fixture in your future. Advice to record companies sign him up now!!!
B00005JLKB|2.0|This show is just plain bad. The characters are one dimensional, and there is no story advancement for the entire season. Every week there is a different corny villain with no motivation (or acting skills). Clark Kent looks like he is 25 years old, Lana whines a lot, and Pete Ross is annoying. The only episodes worth watching are the first and the last of the season, all the episodes in between are simply self contained wastes (and don't even contribute to the main arc). If you want to purchase a great season of T.V., buy \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" Season Two. Just avoid \\"Smallville\\" at all costs.
B000001EGA|5.0|Being a prog-rock diehard I do not make the above claim lightly. Elton and Bernie are in rare form on this one, perhaps due to the personal nature of the material. I am lucky to also own this on vinyl thanks to my folks who bought it in '75. The blend of songwriting, lyrics, production, and arrangements make this a fluid and enveloping listening experience. It is difficult to comment on individual tunes although I do particularly like the title track and &quot;Writing&quot;. An added bonus is the involvement of David Hentschel (check out his production work with Genesis). The arrangements are excellent with a diverse smattering of instrumentation and the mandatory (and sometimes slightly out-of-tune) background vocals from his band. <br />Elton has a long list of amazing songs and buying several of his other CDs to pick out a good one here and there leads me back to the seamless consistency of &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;. The artwork is among my top 3 favourite album covers--worth picking up at a used record store just to look at. Get out your headphones, lie down on the floor, close your eyes, and enjoy...
B0000A1RJI|4.0|This is a great CD..but there's a catch.  Actually, there's two. <BR>1)ONLY 40 minutes!!!!  Grrr.<BR>2)The theme is identical to that of Gladiator, along with many other of the main melodies (except for tracks 5 and 10, which were taken directly from track 12 of Black Hawk Down)<br />Personally, I don't mind having a CD like this because I loved Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, but if your offended by similarities in music, you might not want to buy this.  For the rest of you- this is great music, heartthrobbing all the way through.  Buy.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This DVD is nothing short of spectacular. The sound, the setlist, the orchestra......<br />The band performs brilliantly with Gates Of Delerium and Ritual highlighting the show.....<br />Jon keeps them rockin with his steadfast vocals.......Chris, always the showman, continues to impress as one of the most talented rock bassists ever.....Steve, rock steady and sounding great...some amazing riffs, you get to see (and hear) up close...<BR>Alan poundin' out the beat and enjoying rockin' with Chris and Igor.....<br />A must buy...!!<br />I saw the Symphonic Tour in Toronto and this DVD brings back a lot of memories.....!<br />Make more of these!!!!<br />YES PLEASE...!!!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|What a great show! I was very impressed with the sound quality of this show..Never wouldve guessed it was recorded over 30 yrs ago!All the instruments are well balanced. Bass couldve been took up a notch but not really noticeable. Highlite for me is Bonhams drum solo.He makes a 17 minute drum solo feel like a drum fill. The show has a few lulls here and there (i.e. Pages violen  bow across his guitar part).But not long enough to let you skip a track cause you know the band comes back in full force...<BR>In a nut shell buy it!
B000002MP2|5.0|Nearly a decade later \\"Dookie\\" by Green Day is still one of the most classic and revolutionary albums of its time. Bringing back the 70's punk which was the Ramones to the 90's. Some reviewers have called this poser music and pop. Well it is definitly not poser music but is pop. The RAMONES were pop, get over it u so called hard core punkers. I listen to The Sex Pistols, Minor Threat, and The Misfits to. Best songs: Longview, When I come Around, and FOD.<BR>(Make sure to look for the hidden track ;))
B00000DHRZ|5.0|First of all I rated this a 5 because I love the Offspring and all of their CD's (yes, there ARE CD's BEFORE Smash). This album seems to get a very bad rep because people think that they are \\"selling out\\". Most of the people who say this, however, are people that have no taste in music in the first place and love to casually toss the term \\"sellout\\" around. This was a good CD and you have to listen to something besides \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy\\" before you can even think of saying something bad about this CD. Another thing that annoys me is hearing people say that \\"you should listen to real punk\\". What is \\"real punk\\" according to these sad souls? No-talent [people] who cant play, sing, or write music whatsoever and just run around and \\"sing\\" about how bad athority is. That, ladys and gentlemen, is [bad], not true punk. REAL punk unfortunately is dead. Just because the Offspring didnt want to say on some [bad] indie label doesnt mean they \\"sold out\\". Listen to real music before you try to judge it. The Offspring is an awesome band and worth checking out if all the tasteless people have convinced you otherwise.
B00008S2VG|5.0|If I could I would rate it with 100 stars!!! It's an amazing album from Madonna. I would make it simple for you...<BR>American life: I guess you've heard it already... It's not my favourite, but it's the best \\"techno\\" type song of the album (3.5/5)<BR>Hollywood: It's another well- known song by now... I didn't like it that much at first, but once I saw the video it just made sense. It has a great beat and amazing melodies (4/5)<BR>I'm so stupid: I hate how it starts... It's so annoying!! It's very \\"electronica\\", but it's listenable though. The weakest of the album (2/5)<BR>Love profusion: A great song!! I love the part when she sings \\"I got you under my skin\\". Although she repeats that a lot it doesn´t bother me beacause it sounds fantastic!!! (5/5)<BR>Nobody knows me: Another \\"electronica\\" song. Better than \\"stupid\\" (3/5)<BR>Up to now... it doesn't say much, but<BR>Nothing fails: The first time I listened to it I just could not believe it. It's FANTASTIC. It's a combination of my two favorite Madonna's songs: Like a prayer and The power of goodbye. It has a great guitar rhythm mixed with syntethizers. Great lyrics and the melodies are superb. The best part is when the gospel choirs joins in: it gives me chills every time I listen to it (10/5... and I'm not joking) <BR>Intervention: A nice song... It says nothing at first, but after a few hearings it really grows in you (4.5/5)<BR>X- static process: Not the sort of thing you would expect in this album. An excellent surprise. Madonna sounds at her best!!! I love the lyrics, I love the melody and I love the simplicity of the song: Madonna and a guitar (5/5)<BR>Mother and father: This is actually the BEST \\"techno\\" song. Verses are alright, but the chorus is very catchy. It's a touching song also. Great, great beat!!! (5/5)<BR>Die another day: I didn't like it very much... But time has changed it. Now I really enjoy listening to it. You've heard it, haven't ya?? (4/5)<BR>Easy ride: If you think this was over, you're wrong. Madonna gives you another amazing song... If you like the beginning wait till you listen to the first chorus... Then wait till you hear the second chorus It will blow your mind!!! (5/5)<br />51/55<BR>Overall, it's a great album. I really can't believe that some of you guys don't like it. Just give it a chance. BUY IT!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|My husband and I rented this film after it was reccommended to us by a Blockbuster clerk who knew our taste: action, sci-fi, and great acting.  I had never heard of it before.  We loved it! I was so surprised after having watched it that it was so little advertised.  I don't believe it ever appeared in theaters in our city.  I've heard it was panned because of a weak and over used plot. The plot I admit wasn't too complex.  It is along the lines of classic Science Fiction dystopia fables like War of the Worlds, Time Machine, Planet of the Apes, and Kubric/Spielberg's A.I. etc., where the idea is more important than the story.  Its also reminiscent of books like &quot;The Giver&quot; and reminded me a great deal of George Lucas' film school break out flick, THX (some number).  But because the plot is so familiar it frees the viewer to concentrate on what the story is really about: the moral conflict and development of the main character, John Preston, masterfully played by Christian Bale.  Bale is the kind of exceptional actor who can convey a complex range of emotions in his facial expression.  Music, set design, costume, all compliment the age old theme of man's conflict against himself.  John Preston discovers that the discipline he's learned as a law enforcing cleric is the key to controlling his newfound emotions, and become the liberator of his world.  Besides the incredible performance of Christian Bale, the action sequences are amazing, a blend of violence and artistry that becomes a poetic experience.  My husband and I agree this is one of the best movies we've ever seen.
0385504209|2.0|All hype, very little to offer. Just skip it. Believe me, you'll forget it in a day if you spend the time to read it. Too bad it is such a big bestseller....lowers the bar, in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and pick up a book by Anne Tyler or Alice Hoffman. Musch more rewarding then this trite book.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I loved this DVD. The first time I saw it was of course on MTV.But I would catch it when I could which wasn't very often. So then I saw the collection at my home library. And I picked it up and took it home. I watched it over and over again. And I fell in love with it. Because it shows the true problems of a teens life. Not the little stupid stuff other tv shows, show like people being irritated by their little brothers. It shows real stuff. Like people having crushes on people who don't even know there alive.I mean the main character Angela doesn't have the perfect life. She's not like the girl who plays on clueless with the perfect life, the perfect hair, rich, and all the good stuff. She has real life problems like her friend Rayane ODS on drugs. And Rickie gets beat at home to the point that he's scared to go home and lives on the street. I mean this is real stuff not the stupid little stories people make up.This is a great DVD home collection and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00008PC2O|2.0|This thing is really not very good. The menus are terrible and not very user friendly, and it takes forever to go from one place to another. The \\"extras\\" are accesible only from a DVD ROM. That's right, they are useless on a standard DVD player. So unless you have a computer with a DVD rom, and enjoy watching DVD extras on a computer screen in an uncomfortable chair instead of the couch, you are SOL. I also found the movie (which of course looks and sounds great, as it should) to be prone to occaisional audio drop outs (My DVD player? Who knows?)<BR>The metal case is cool, even if it does tear up the DVD case and is always dented, but besides that, this thing is nowhere near as good as the Ultimate Edition. It has fewer extras (and virtually none if you don't have a DVD Rom). The commentary track is very uninformative on the techinical aspects of the film, it mostly consists of Cameron cutting off the other guy (the writer I think) and offering pretentious ramblings about his \\"vision\\". And again, unless you have a DVD ROM or can find the easter eggs in the clumsy menus, you can't watch the theatrical version. And last but not least...can we PLEASE stop labeling things as eXtreme?
B00005NGZX|5.0|It has been said more than a thousand times before, but let me have my share too. After a year and half of owning Jane Doe all I can say is - take the scale rating above and add *********. I mean this is THE ONE! I just scratch my head and wonder how MORE can anyone go? Can`t wait for their new stuff... CANT $&amp;%?!!&amp;)=&quot;!!! WAIT!!!
B00008OLYN|5.0|I do not like death metal. I would not have even given this album a shot, but I happened to hear &quot;Death Whispered a Lullaby&quot; on a rare radio listen and I thought it was genius.  Regular OPETH fans will probably not like this album, but this is my first exposure to them and I love what they have done here.  Their musicianship shines through immediately on &quot;Windowpane&quot;, a glorious guitar solo bridge enters shortly after the first verse - blew me away!  The first 3 tracks are very strong and engaging. It is evident that they experiment a lot with the chromatic scales which may be a death metal carryover, but it works well with this new style.  If you like good melody with eerily haunting overtones, expert arrangement, and mysterious lyrics, you will like this.  This is still a ROCK album despite normal OPETH fans' amazement at the softness.  I hope they don't abandon this style on the next album.
B00000JG41|5.0|thematic irony par excellence meets musical perfection to produce some true artistic bliss. Shame it is the last offering of this kind from Patton and co.. Call it post-zappa? I would dare
B00001QEE7|5.0|I loved this film ever since I was a little thing (3 years). It is such a wonderful, romantic story for the older generation like myself, and now when the platinium edition comes out, the younger generation can like it too.
B00000342V|5.0|Curtis is cool. This album is funky, emotional and slick. The extra tracks are great---the more Curtis the better!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Usually when a film is released that borrows its theme, plot, and special effects from others, I tend to degrade its quality even before I view it.  However, in the case of EQUILIBRIUM, director Kurt Wimmer gives us a film that may have begun in familiar territory, but soon enough stakes out its own original niche.  In FAHRENHEIT 451, a fireman who burns books soon enough turns to reading them.  In THE MATRIX, spectacular aerial dueling scenes punctuate a tale of a future, dystopic society.  In 1984, a figurehead Big Brother is the symbol by which the Inner Party rules society.  In EQUILIBRIUM, all three motifes combine to produce an engrossing film that suggests our society is not all that far from the one pictured here.<br />Christian Bale is John Preston, a policeman called a \\"Cleric\\", one whose job it is to ensure that all of society is rendered unemotional via daily injections of a drug that sounds suspiciously like our own Prozac.  The opening credits tell us that after World War III, the surviving political states decided that hyperemotion was to blame for the widespread nuclear destruction.  Thus was born the need for the Clerics, a martial arts trained political police force whose function was to track down and eliminate all those who refused this drug.  At this point, a number of subtexts arise, enough in any case to suggest an allegory that has meaning for us.  To begin with, director Wimmer implies that the forced repression of emotion, while eliminating the negative excesses of that emotion--like war and street crime--nevertheless have unintended consequences.  Unlike Spock's planet Vulcan, where a similar de-emotionalizing goes on, in this society, such a repression of all emotion leads invariably to a concommitant repression of civil rights.  All sense criminals are killed upon capture without recourse to a trial, a point not lost upon Cleric Preston, who complains of much the same thing to his superiors.  As Preston gradually learns that his supportof his superior, called the \\"Father\\" is based on the false belief that the nonemotional ends justify a similar nonemotional means, he begins to associate psychologically with the very people he is sworn to apprehend.  His conversion proceeds slowly, beginning with his killing of his own Cleric partner who has already been infected with the lure of emotions.  Several reviewers have complained of what they see as a maudlin scene of emotional growth when Preston risks his life merely to save a cute puppy dog from extinction.  Yet, such seeming trivial scenes of conversion are need to establish a coherent and convincing segue of a man from emotionless killer to one who now feels such a wide range of emotions that he finds it impossible to hide them.  Part of the joy of this film is the plot twists that evolve into a cat and dog game in which both cat and dog exchange places more than once.  True, there are logical lapses, such as having an untaped police interrogation or not having a 1984-style ubiquitous television camera in every home.  Yet, these lapses do not do more than intrude for the moment.  The incredible \\"Gun-Kata\\" fight scenes between a Cleric like Preston and untrained police officers have to be seen to be believed.  There is also the surprisingly effective acting of Sean Bean and Taye Diggs, both of whom provide the evil counterpoint to the emotional growth of Cleric Preston.<br />EQUILIBRIUM promises to be an untrumpeted current day version of BLADE RUNNER, a similar dystopic future vision.  I cannot recall that EQUILIBRIUM was released to theaters to any great extent.  But after having seen the video, I can see that in this nightmare version of a future prozac state, the ability to remain human is far more than a function of computerized actions.  What is further required is the profound contemplation of all actions that are forced upon one by a Father who is paternal only in the visual sense.  Cleric Preston learns this by the closing credits.  So mustwe.
B00008972S|5.0|This is one great DVD. Just watching \\"West Side Story\\" in widescreen with that gorgeous color would be good enough, but the DVD also provides lots of behind-the-scenes treats, including a fascinating documentary about the making of thte film, Natalie Wood's not-used vocal tracks and more. I have a new respect for this wonderful film now that I have seen how much preparation, thought and hard work went into it. It has to be the best musical film ever made, or at least in the top 10!
6305622914|5.0|What a fun way to use up an evening. It is not a deep movie, it will not give you insight into British politics or humanity itself, just lots of good laughs.<br />We watch as 6 unemployed Yorkshire bloks work up the courage and, dare I say, the talent, to go the Full Monty after the Chppendale Dancers swagger their goods through town. Seeing this as an easy way to fatten their wallets we go through the emotions of these every day guys trying to just make it in the world when they lose their jobs, their furniture and lives when the Steel Mill they work in closes.<br />It is great to watchthe relationships in this movie.  That between Mark Addy's character and his wife that he thinks is cheating on him, because he sees himself as to fat.  Addy and Robert Carlyle as friends is fun and funny. The greatest relationship to watch is between Carlyle and the kid who plays his son Nate. All this stripping hulabaloo started as a way for Carlyle (Gaz) to repay his back child support so he can continue to see his son whom he loves very much, though he may not always be the best role model. The kid is in on some of the casting calls and helps with the music. All the characters are a shear riot to watch.<br />I highly recommend this film. It has a broad range to reach more than just those who enjoy British films, it is not that stuffy! great listening to and trying to decipher the dialect while keeping up witht he movie.
B000099T2L|5.0|I'm a pseudo-fan of the group Destiny's Child, so I took a chance on Beyonce's solo album.  But I was blown away! The lyrics actually had some depth, the vocals were off the charts, and the beats kept me vibing for hours.  It also had great appearances by Jay-Z, Outkast, and Luther Vandross. I'm glad I took the chance and bought this album, it'll be in my rotation for a while.<br />I hate to say it, but I hope she stays solo so that I can look forward to her next album!

0380820846|5.0|Julia Quinn has taken a typical romance plotline (ugly-duckling gets man of her dreams) and makes it the most endearing, complex and REAL story possible. Penelope is a wonderful heroine - she is strong, smart and stands up for what she believes in, despite her general rejection by society. And Colin, who by his own admission lives a charmed life, is still complicated, lovable and realizes that even he had some lessons to learn in the end. <br />It's a great book, and one that re-defines the regency romance with it's quick, witty dialoge that will make you laugh in more than one spot. All of the Bridgerton books are wonderful, but this is the crowining jewel. Enjoy!
0385507755|5.0|I have never read a book that made me actually taste and feel the words on the page....I lived this book down to my bones.   James Frey physcially led me through his experience as a drug/alcohol abuser by the heartstrings.  I couldn't put this book down and I have been thinking about it ever since I finished it 2 weeks ago. He proves that the \\"one size fits all\\" philosophy is [wrong].  I don't even know him, but I am proud of him for choosing to save his life by the terms that he knew he could live with.  I admire his strength, perseverence, humor, and honesty.  This is the best book I have read all year and I have been singing its praises all over Boston.
B000002UB3|5.0|Far and away the best album by The Beatles.  That's all that needs to be said....
B00006BTCA|5.0|...i first heard PDA on kroq while taking a shower. it was completely distinct from what i had recently been hearing. it possessed a glaciel beauty with a crestfallen ambience to it that quickly captivates you and advances you to a darker state of mind. i was skeptic as to whether or not this would be a one hit wonder, but after hearing &quot;obstacle 1&quot;, i realized this band definitely had potential to finally provide us with a new sound reminiscent to great bands such as radiohead or r.e.m. i was so excited to hear the rest of the album. i finally did and quickly knew that Interpol is FOR REAL.<BR>To all of you who love radioheads melancholy sound, and love dark, angelic, gloomy songs...then you'll definitely love Interpol.
B000000W3G|5.0|&quot;the aeroplane flies high&quot; is a box set that contains the five singles of the smashing pumpkins-masterpiece mellon collie and the infinite sadness. aside from the a-side single tracks there are several b-side-songs on each single which in fact could have been on the mellon collie album themselves, as they're altogether of an enormously high quality. these b-side-songs are a kaleidoscope of excellent melancholic rock songs. you can find the heavy and depressive rock sound of the siamese dream era in songs like marquis in spades and mouths of babes (both brilliant, made according to billy corgan during the siamese dream tour), but also bitter sweet songs of a divine beauty like medellia of the grey skies or pennies. there are also a couple of cover songs, among them one of the best cover songs i've ever heard, the cure's &quot;a night like this&quot;, interpreted by james iha, who emphasizes the beautiful melodies of the song and combines them with a deep warm sadness. <BR>all in all you could have made another high-quality double-album out of these songs. the aeroplane flies high is definitely not just for the pumpkins-fan - every friend of music would enjoy the beauty and variety of this collection of songs. It's absolutely worth listening to.
B00005JLXE|3.0|When I first saw Daredevil months ago in theaters, I bashed it as much as I could.  The idea of taking such a great comic character and trying to package it for global appeal just really grated my nerves.  However, after watching it for a second time, I have come to grown a bit of a liking for it.  Ben Affleck isn't bad at all as Matt Murdock who is lawyer by day and Daredevil by night.  Jennifer Garner is nicely cast as Elektra, and Colin Farrell nearly steals the entire film as Bullseye.  Director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson is a self admitted fan of the Daredevil comic (as is star Affleck) and it shows; the showdown between Elektra and Bullseye is almost directly taken from the classic issue of Daredevil #181, plus Marvel comics trivia knowledge is peppered all throughout the film, plus cameos from Marvel icon Stan Lee, writer Kevin Smith (yes, it's Silent Bob himself who goes by the name Jack Kirby in the film, named after another Daredevil alumnus), and the man who forever re-defined the comic series (and whose run on the series the film is seemingly mostly based from) Frank Miller.  While Daredevil does have it's share of good qualities, the film seems to have an uneven flow sometimes, Michael Clarke Duncan is miscast as the Kingpin (and no, it's not because he's black), the computer generated visual effects seem half heartedly put together, and the way the film ends just opens the door for a sequel and an Elektra spin off.  All that aside however, Daredevil didn't deserve all the bashing I gave it earlier, and longtime fans of the comic will appreciate most of the heart that went into the film, but might not like the complete package.  The DVD itself is nicely put together and the bonus featurettes featuring interviews with Stan Lee, Frank Miller, Brian Michael Bendis, Kevin Smith, and others is a must watch for long time Daredevil fans as well.
B000092ZYX|4.0|..in the world that the powers-that-be have constructed around us, then Radiohead feel your pain.  All right, it's not OK Computer, and the song titles are a bit cloying.  Even so, it's the perfect antidote to the Republican sneer.  And if you need even more relief, try to get your hands on &quot;New World Underground&quot; by Metric.  Between the two of them, they should have you feeling better in no time.
0385504209|1.0|I swore to never read anything off the best seller list again, so I got what I deserved. It started off with some interesting premises, meant to make the reader think he/she must be rather clever to understand the seemingly arcane knowlege possessed by the characters. By about page two hundred I realized that this book had gone nowhere, that the \\"hidden knowlege\\" was a bunch of pseudointellectual bull, and that the reason I kept falling asleep every time I picked it up was because it was deadly boring. I kept trying to continue but it was impossible. Phooey. Stick with independent publishers. What a bunch of tripe.
B000003S09|5.0|This is one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. It's that simple. From the pounding opening of 21st Century Schizoid Man to the velvety smooth personality of Court of The Crimson King this album paved a new road for rock. <br />King Crimson created picture with music. Not only do you hear the beautiful sounds they were making but you can see them too. They surrounded the listener with sounds and words so beautiful its almost like pictures, pictures so vivid you can feel encircled in them. What Fripp, Lake, Giles, Sinfield, and McDonald did with this record was take us to a place that was never going to be forgotten. <br />This is one of rocks greatest achievements and a required addition to any true rock aficionado's collection, of which they probably know and have already. If not, get it. It is one of the greatest rock records ever recorded.
0684867621|3.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is the first Stephen King novel that I have read and I found it very boring, it makes me wonder what the rest of his books are like. I have heard great things about Stephen King's work, but after reading this book I'm not sure what all the exitment is about. It was not that scary at all, it was not exiting, and frankly it almost put me to sleep! I did not like this book that much, and I would not recommend buying it.<br />Overall Thought: If you like Stephen King, but not sure if this book is worth buying, get it from the library. I hope the rest of King's novels are better than this one.
B00005JM09|4.0|T2 has a chase with a motorcycle and a semi. T3 has a chase scene with a motorcycle and a crane. T2 opens with Arnold stealing a leather jacket from a thug in a bar. T3 opens with Arnold stealing a leather jacket from a male stripper in a bar. The similarities continue, with T3 making small improvements on a proven action plot. Surprising, however, are the performances of Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. They play unlikely love interests brought together by their inescapable fate. That motif plays well in this movie, as the characters realize they cannot stop the judgement day that has to occur in order for them to exist. There are a lot of special effects and dozens of corner lines, but T3 delivers a fun time and a puzzler of a story if you try to fit the last two movies into this one's future projections. And it ends begging for a T4...
B00005JL78|3.0|How did Max Von Sydow plant the vision of Tom Cruise's future in the mind of the precog? Was that ever explained? This seems like a glaring omission to me.
B00009APK1|5.0|\\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" was one of my favorite movies of all time. I love the trilogy and can't wait until the third movie comes out.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I think this was the best movie I ever saw.I liked it alot because it had almost every thing some comedy,violence,and romance and I think this movie would be good for all ages the violence would be good for teenagers the comedy for kids and the romance for the parents.
B00001OH7P|2.0|People rave and rave over this but I just don't quite get it.<BR>Would anyone have listened to this if it weren't for the image that went along with it?  Well, OK, probably, after all it is catchy -- however I doubt nearly as many people would have taken notice.  The music on its own is kind of irritating.  I still can't deny there are some good hooks like the main guitar riff from &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;.  However there is just some kind of sickly sweet quality to a lot of the music, mostly in the vocals, which just bugs me somehow.  The first time I heard nearly all of these songs I felt it, and it grows with repeated listens.
0671015206|4.0|The book here contains a lot of statistics, with endless quotes &amp; tables about the buying habits of millionaires &amp; non millionaires. It gets a bit much after a while &amp; I started skipping this info.<br />Much more useful was the basic common sense approach. Spend less than you earn, don't buy something now with what you'll earn tomorrow, avoid conspicuous consumption &amp; don't buy Mercedes/BMW etc etc. I agree with all that, how many times have I seen adverts on TV for &quot;Ameridebt&quot; offering to help people out of financial trouble followed by some guy in a Vehix.com ad on the phone trying to find an SUV &amp; laboring the point he wants a &quot;luxury model&quot;! The Siren Song of US consumerism is relentlessly rammed down our throats.<br />I do take issue with the authors on their outlook. Far too often they press home how the self employed are the millionaires, while hardly exploring the risks. I know some who've loved what they've done, so according to this book the money should have followed, but they ended up losing everything, including their home, health &amp; marriage.<br />The section on cars claims that millionaires buy them by the $/pound ratio! A table later goes to collate this info, but really it's silly. From this table the way SAAB could improve its rating &amp; attractiveness to millionaires is simply to put a 500lb block of lead in the trunk! Yeah the $/weigh ratio would improve (more weight for the same money), but gas mileage would suffer etc etc. Stupid if you ask me.<br />Also the quote about taxes &quot;the Liberal politicians &amp; their friend the tax man&quot; does a lot of damage to their credibility. Bush Jr has &quot;given us back&quot; lots of taxes but we'll pay for it in spades because it's all funded by a huge deficit which will rack up interest for decades to come which we will have to pay for long after Bush has left the Whitehouse. If private individuals did that they'd be derided for doing so by the authorsof this book.<br />Basically sound advice, but badly flawed in places.
0060920432|2.0|This book is about five times as long as it needs to be.  The only relevant parts of the book are chapter 3, part of chapter 4 on flow activities, and a few of the ideas from the remaining chapters, most of which consist of examples of people Csikszentmihalyi claim are engaging in flow activities.<br />Mr. Csikszentmihalyi insists... and insists... and insists that his work is scientific and states over and over the academic rigor that has gone into his studies - not to mention quote after quote taken from Greek philosophers and modern psychologists that always almost exactly fail to be relevant to the chapter they appear in.  It seems he uses them to increase the size of the references section.<br />Then, he proceeds to shatter this illusion he creates.  He provides irrelevant discussion and experimental data such as the section in chapter 4 entitled &quot;neurophysiology and flow.&quot;  In it, he speaks of an experiment which shows absolutely nothing about the relationship between neurophysiology and flow.  At the end of the chapter he writes:<br />&quot;The neurological evidence does not, however, prove that some individuals have inherited a genetic advantage in controlling attention and therefore experiencing flow.  The findings could be explained in terms of learning rather than inheritance.&quot;<br />Later, he speaks of martial arts, making all sorts of errors.  He claims that judo, jujitsu, kung fu, karate, tae kwon do, aikido and T'ai Chi ch'uan all originate in China (106).  He says that &quot;Those who can perform it well claim that fighting becomes a joyous artistic performance...&quot;  Hmmm.... Many martial artists (myself included) might object to the use of the word &quot;joy&quot; in describing the flow that comes in an intense combat situation.  &quot;No-mind&quot; or Bruce Lee's &quot;serious play&quot; is not &quot;joy.&quot;  It seems that Mr. Csikszentmihalyi ran out of examples to expand his 50 page book into a 250 page one so he started making stuff up.<br />Don't buy this book - certainly don't read the whole thing.  I already wasted my time doing this.  You don't have to also :-)<br />If you are curious about the concept, go to your local bookstore, find this book, turn to page 208, the summary, and read until page 213.  That's the book in a nutshell.  Then, read from page 72 to 77.  Although repetitive and filled with more examples than &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; it is filled with valuable information.  If you are still curious, read the first paragraph on page 49 on what a flow experience in like.  Then, put the book down.  Continue to browse.  The psychology section is filled with interesting and worthwhile titles!
B000002UAX|2.0|This album was too expensive to buy for my older teenage brothers when it came out, so apart from the songs played on the radio I never got to hear it as a piece- until years later.<br />And I listened to it again last week, but my heart is as further away from the album as it ever was. I danced in my hospital bed to She Loves You as a five year old waiting to have his tonsils out, and I love the rest of their stuff, but this album is only worth buying if you share the cost with a half dozen other people.
0380977788|5.0|Coraline Jones, a self-proclaimed explorer, discovers a world of wonder and horror just beyond the old wooden door in her family's living room.  With the turn of a lock, Coraline is swept into an apartment that looks eerily like her own, complete with a duplicate set of parents.   In this new place, the food tastes delicious, her parents are attentive, and her bedroom is filled with magical toys.  However, Coraline soon realizes that her new parents have evil intentions and may never let her leave. <br />The huge building where Coraline lives is filled with memorable characters.  Miss Forcible and Miss Spink, the elderly women on the bottom floor, entertain Coraline by recounting their former days as actresses.  In the attic apartment, Mr. Bobo spends hours training his mice for a circus act.  However, the young heroine herself emerges as the tale's most remarkable character despite being surrounded by eccentric adults.  Coraline is forced to rely on her courage and cleverness to save herself, her real parents, and the souls of three children from the sinister realm behind the door.  <br />This complex tale of alternate realities is filled with vivid imagery that may be too frightening for some timid readers.  In addition, the rough pen and ink illustrations by Dave McKean help make the scenes even more chilling.  However, Coraline is an extremely exciting story that will delight children who enjoy a good scare and teach them to appreciate the pleasures of everyday life.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I didn't like this CD the first time I listened to it.  True, there are some songs that immediately grab you (Hail to the Thief), but most of it takes a while to grow on you.  (Best tracks:  6, 9, 14, 10, 1.)  I love love love that Radiohead went back to their guitar and drums.  <br />I would rank this album as better than Kid A (which i loved!), but not as good as O.K. Computer (which i don't think can be beaten).  <br />Buy this album!!
B00005JKGV|5.0|I simply cannot wait for Lost Highway to hit the DVD bandwagon,<br />but unfortunately, I must. The film is a enigma, since that is where it's true beauty lies. A film with a plot with no plot.<br />Robert Blake's Mystery Man, is he a devil, or a twisted Jimminy<br />Cricket? The cool thing is the film explains nothing, in which<br />the Mystery Man is anything you want him to be. Creepiest film<br />moment: The Cell Phone Scene. If you are looking for a movie<br />that you can watch repeatedly and find something different with<br />each viewing, Lost Highway is the way to go.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is easily the best album of 2002.  &quot;Parachutes&quot; was a great debut CD, but Coldplay could've easily proven themselves a flash in the pan with this CD.  They avoid that fate by a gigantic margin.  This CD makes Coldplay one of my favorite bands around. <br />This CD is a bit more upbeat than &quot;Parachutes&quot;, which is a good thing.  It still does what Coldplay does best though...melancholy.  &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; and &quot;Amsterdam&quot; are two of the most beautiful ballads I have heard since I don't know when. &quot;Polotik&quot; is also brilliant. If this album doesn't move you, then you aren't listening.
B000001E7L|5.0|This album even after almost 10 years sounds fresh,powerfull and still marvelous...songs are full of emotions and never were so dramatic and moving in Cranberries history (&quot;Empty&quot;,&quot;daffodil lament&quot;,&quot;dissapointment&quot; and famous &quot;Zombie&quot;).it's full of specific irish atmosphere and melancholy...you might get depressed while listening to it too much...I think that everything was written about this album and i couldn't say nothing original about it because everyone elese before me told it...This is a masterpiece,really it is.<BR>While there were many albums as emotional and moving as this only few survived a test ot time...&quot;no need to argue&quot; is one of this albums.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a totally original and creative movie; it's a movie that is worth watching again and again. This Japanese animated film is about a young girl named Chihiro who goes through an incredible adventure that is both surreal and magical. <br />The movie is very beautiful visually. The graphics are so colorful and sharp. The story is amazing and engaging. The characters are peculiar and freakish looking, but it's all so wonderful. I was submerged into this magical world. This movie had some funny parts as well as serious parts. Overall, it's a great movie that you have to see.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I love this CD. It was incredible. The voices, the music, everything...
0385504209|5.0|I admit I was skeptical about reading a mystery thriller when first introduced to this book.  However, the book was much more than just a who done it type of fiction.  The book's plot was intermingled with historical details that made the book far more than your typical mystery novel.  The book really made an impression on me as far as theology goes.  I could not put this book down--it's plot takes so many exciting and unexpected twists.  Even if you don't normally read mystery/thriller books, this is definitely a book I would recommend to anyone looking for a great story that gives you some things to think about history and religon-wise.
0060925000|4.0|What might put off most people from reading this book is its size.I put off my reading of this book too for that reason.But I would like to assure any reader to just go for it without thinking about the size!Coz here the size really does not matter!<br />The book not only keeps you engrossed,but also involves you 'personally'into the lives of all the characters.But more than anything else it transports you into the era of post-independence modern India.Vikram Seth is not just telling the story of the characters ( as one might be mislead into believing because of the title) but more so he is telling about those times - socially,economically,politically and more intrestingly the linkages of these!This wonderful interweaving of events and people dosn't allow the narrative to become slack or unintresting.<br />The book has a hidden 'wisdom'.Makes the reader feel wise and having 'grown' as a reader.Leaves one with a sense of accomplishment( apart from having gained much insight into those times). Definitely a 'must read'.
B000002L9O|3.0|This album is full of fillers and silly songs (\\"Apeman Hop\\", \\"Crummy Stuff\\" etc, \\"Mental Hell\\" shows signs of potential but nothing great. I love the fact that synthesizers we're being introduced more, it adds a great touch. <br />I send it once, I'll say it a thousand times, The Ramones are a band that had the ability to progress and improve out of the world of silly punk songs, but they seemed afraid of stepping into the water too much, which is why I feel they we're never commercially successful. TOO TOUGH TO DIE, ANIMAL BOY, HALFWAY TO SANITY, BRAIN DRAIN, MONDO BIZZARO, & ADIOS AMIGOS all had songs that we're slower, melodic, well written, great guitar solos, synthesizer work, political notions. But the band still made songs like \\"Endless Vacation\\", \\"Weasel Face\\", \\"Mama's Boy\\", \\"Too Tough To Die\\", etc. those songs are just silly. They would have been fine on ROCKET TO RUSSIA & END OF THE CENTURY, but come on, these guys didn't mature as a band, and that's what killed them.<br />GREAT SONGS:<BR>Somebody Put Something In My Drink<BR>My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)<BR>Something To Believe In

B0000AQS0F|5.0|In a nutshell, this show was good enough to keep me in on Friday nights...  ANY other time slot and we'de be watching \\"Firefly\\" now.  It is a real shame FOX cancelled it.  I don't have a bad word to say about it.  The episodes were varied, never a similar plot, always  made you think a little.  I'll wear this DVD out.
B00005JLTN|5.0|The Matrix. A name heard very loud in the year of 2003. High expectations, amazing trailers, daring posters.<BR>Then the movie came along. Then, a lot of fan groups were created, everyone with their own opinion. But three were the basic:<BR>THE FEWER. They liked the movie more then the first one. I'm in this group.<BR>THE MORE. They hated this film. <BR>THE MOST. Although they enjoyed it, they liked the first one better.<br />Yes, the truth is that the film was extremely boring in the first half hour of the film. Yes, it's true that some special effects looked really fake-and some actions scenes too. But did we excpected much?<BR>The movie had more action then dialogue, and when it had dialogue, it was silly and boring. Except the end that is.<BR>Now, I'm not gonna be too descriping because I do not wish to be a spoiler.<BR>What is the Matrix? If you would ask me this question one year ago, I would have answered you with confidence. But now that I have watched the movie, everything changed. Everything is possible.<BR>So, I've got something to suggest to the MORE group of people. This movie is not maybe bad. Maybe it's a bad Matrix movie(for you, that is) but not a bad movie. Think about it, before you hate it again.
1573229725|3.0|I run a book discussion group that is comprised of mostly older women in their 70s and 80s.  I chose this book because it was on a top 10 book club list that I read somewhere on the internet and the story takes place during the victorian era which I thought the women would enjoy.  You can read the reviews from some of the other readers to get a sense of what the story is about...I will just leave it that when I asked the women if they would recommend it to a family member or friend they all resoundingly said NO!! The story provided a lively discussion, however, and it became obvious that we all got confused at times with keeping up with the curves and twists in the plotting of the story. (They did not seem to mind the minor lesbian subtext either).
B000001FT2|5.0|Excuse the hype, but tis true. If you purchase on Jones disc, make it this one. Brilliant!
B000099T2L|2.0|Oh ya cuz of Crazy In Love?  Beyonce is very talented I think this cd was a misstep though. After huge success being the frontwoman of Destiny's Child all 3 decided to do solo albums. Beyonce writes her songs, acts, sings and is very beautiful but I find her album to be dull and one dimensional. <BR>I bought this album after hearing Crazy In Love which is one of the top songs of the summer and has an awesome beat. After listening I found several good songs but Beyonce doesnt sing sometimes she sorta forcefully whines or something in songs like Naughty Girl. Then she has another song with Jay-z which is too much. Songs like Signs I found myself very bored listening to. There are other highlights like Baby Boy the second single with Sean Paul which is a great club banger. <BR>Beyonce you may want to rethink your next solo album and I suggest you pick up Kelly Rowland's Simply Deep which features Stole which is a classic! Or for this summer try Ashant, Monica and even Blu Cantrell
B000003CKH|4.0|Cake's best album is a mixture of boogey down guitar riffs meets jazzy trumpets meets beatnick poetry recital so smooth it can't help but make you smile.  Frank Sinatra is probably the best song on the album and it opens the album with a statement that says \\"hey this aint your daddy's jazz anyomre, were about to blow your mind so just sit back and let it happen!\\"  <br />Anyway Friend Is A Four Letter Word gets better with every listen especially after you finally get it.  Daira makes the best use of the words silk and milk that I have ever heard in a song.  The whole album is quality except for Race Car Ya Yas and the Nugget song which are examples of lyrical annoyance not quite just falling short.<br />Bottom Line:  Kids of today who weren't into music when this came out should put this on their must have list.  The stuff they did since isn't as good so check this one out.
B00009TB5G|5.0|And if this one is like the first Extended DVD, those scenes will help the movie in terms if pace and character development, which will be nice for all of those tolkein fanatics who wanted a vesion a little truer to the book. Those scenes- you probably know them- that deviated from the origional story will likely be justified in the longer version or in Return of the king. I heard the new scenes will include a few more humorous scenes, a couple of scenes in rivendell and Lotloren, a conversation between Gandalf and Aragorn, more of Saruman in his chamber at Orthanc with Wormtonge, and a lot more of Treebeard, including the Ent draught! Some of these scenes will certainly help when watching film 3. This one will also have 2 discs of extras and FOUR commentary tracks with the director, design and post tean, as well as the cast (this one better have Viggo morntensen, because his role is certainly much larger in The Two towers.)
B000069AUI|5.0|Rush of Blood to the Head is the first CD that I could listen to over and over again without getting tired of it.  Almost every song on the album has a part that sticks with you, that makes your heart jump when you hear it again.  On first listen, \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Warning Sign\\" are the easiest to attach to.  But after multiple listenings, I think \\"God put a Smile on Your Face\\" (a totally sexy song), \\"Rush of Blood...\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are the finest tracks.  I bought \\"Parachutes\\" after \\"Rush of Blood\\" and I think, comparing the sum total of the tracks, \\"Rush of Blood\\" is the better album.  (Though I highly recommend \\"Parachutes\\" too).
0060987464|5.0|This book is one of the best ever written. <BR>It has everything, It's sad, funny, scary and wonderful.<BR>And the best part is that it's real. You get to see pictures of some of the persons he talks about and it's very well written.<BR>I love it.
B00001OH7P|5.0|I was in my mid-teens when this album came out and totally changed the scene.  It almost made high school bearable.  Always one to stay off of the beaten track when it came to music, Bowie instantly became my icon of rock nirvana.  Its one of those special albums, so good that every song on it could become a big hit.  An essential.  It belongs in the elite albums of the decade, along with Marquee Moon by Television and Pampered Menial by Pavlov's Dog. I give it my highest praise.
B00001QEE6|3.0|I own every disney Kids movie ever made.  This is one movie that the kids never want to watch or load into the motorhome when we leave town.  Even my daughters have only seen it once.  I still give it 3 stars because My wife and I love this movie.  But given the over 100 movies we now own for FAMILY VIEWING the children just never select this one, or Dumbo or Bambi.  If you are just starting to build your family faire movies, i recommend starting elsewhere first.<br />Here are the ones they love:  Pete's Dragon, Lion king, Beauty and the beast, Peter Pan.  Also check out Princess Bride, Swan Princess, brave little toaster and Land Before Time.
0312983867|5.0|Book eight in the Stephanie Plum series is a bit darker than the previous sevem books. Its still a very enjoyable book, with lots of humor and laughter. Fans will enjoy the book and the return of our favorite characters with a few new ones to chuckle over.<br />Mystery readers will enjoy the story told with Evanovich's special twist of humor, sarcasim and Jersey girl style. As with the previous seven books Evanovich has lived up to the style, humor and quality of writing that we have come to expect from her. Definately worth the reading time!
B00009MGQL|5.0|Jeff Beck has never stopped challenging himself, or us. Picking up where \\"You Had It Coming\\" left off, this collection (which is eminently more listenable but equally innovative) is easily the best outing of the past three, and right up there with the finest Jeff Beck ever. <br />The indescribable mix, which includes techno/acid/thrash/orchestral and of course Jeff Beck's unmistakably distinctive and sonically amazing guitar work used in the most surprising ways, is a far cry from \\"classic Jeff Beck\\" (a la \\"Guitar Shop\\" for instance) but guaranteed to take you places. Get under the headphones, turn it up and just freaking listen. <br />Standout cuts: The soaring hymn \\"Bulgaria/Why Lord Oh Why\\", the gorgeous \\"Seasons\\", \\"JB's Blues\\" and \\"Plan B\\", a super cool soundtracky track with a maddeningly addicting beat. Unlike \\"You Had It Coming\\", there are no wasted tracks (although \\"Pay Me No Mind\\" is somewhat of a triviality), no noisy violently crunchy dead-end cuts. This one is truly great from end to end, and you hear something new every time you listen again.<br />Jeff Beck is the unchallenged master of his instrument, and an evolving musical force on par with late peers such as John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix. He is a treasure, and so is \\"Jeff\\".<br />There are legitimate rumblings that Jeff Beck has gone far enough into this direction (in which his guitar is almost more of a special effect than the lead). True enough. Let's see what he comes up with next.
B00009UW0N|4.0|Contrary to previous reports, this DVD does include the made for television scenes. While they are not incorporated into the film, they are indeed present (watch the 87 minute documentary). The movie itself is without a doubt the best modern horror movie ever made, but I agree with several reviewers in regards to the whole color scheme (or lack of it I should say) of the movie. 5 star movie, about a 2 star DVD transfer, but many exceptional extras boost my rating. ...
B00005JLK1|4.0|This movie stayed in my thoughts for over 3 days. It was all I could talk about!<br /><br />I have no idea why some rate this movie low ... as I think the plot was VERY original. The storyline was complete and full of depth. Ok... the actors may not have been awarded any Academy Awards, but very few scary movies are meant to be great acting acheivements. The build up to the &quot;cliff hanger&quot; kept me guessing all along ... &quot;What the heck happened to these people &amp; why???&quot; ... and then when the viewers are shown a flashback that serves to explain the entire premise ~ I was blown away. I had no idea!<br />And the story was so &quot;tight&quot;, that I kept going over the details in my head for the following 3 days ... wondering if there was any way I could have figured it out before I was given the answers.<br />This movie messes with your head ... and I like that. Reminded me of such movies as Silence of The Lambs, etc. Psychological thriller as well as scary movie. I truly think this movie deserves more credit than it has been given.
B000002INJ|3.0|silly tracks like \\"The warriors prayer\\" ruin what could be an excellent CD.  After reading the reviews on the various Manowar albums, I chose this one since it was so highly regarded.  If this is the best they have to offer, I think I'll pass on the other CDs.  Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad disc and is worth having.  Wheels of Fire, Kings of Metal, Hail and Kill, and Blood of the kings are very good (especially Hail and kill).  If they had a release that had 10 songs like these, they would have a great CD on their hands.
B00005JKN9|4.0|\\"Gangs of New York\\" is my first movie directed by the much-lauded Martin Scorcese.  And I must say I was impressed.  Scorcese brings New York amazingly to life in the early 1860s' and during the escalating Civil War.  Driven by exquisite and extraordinary production and costume design, Scorcese drops you into New York and fills your eyes with color, filth and a good amount of blood.  The opening fight scene between the native and Dead Rabbits gangs is a raw, blood-soaked battle that brings to mind, surprisingly, the vicious hand-to-hand combat of \\"Braveheart.\\"  A boy named Amsterdam witnesses the battle (Leonardo Decaprio, eventually) and his father slain at the hands of William Cutting (a superb Daniel-Day Lewis).  From then on, he is bent on revenge, wanting to kill Bill the Butcher, but make it convincing and a spectacle, the same way he killed his father.  <br />But a revenge-dominated plot has been done so many times in movies, but Scorcese has a trick up his sleeve.  The bulk of the movie focuses on the political corruption, lawlessness and turmoil of of the Five Points, Amsterdams' stomping grounds.  The Butcher has plenty of savvy here, and Day-Lewis hits every note right about him.  Day-Lewis creates a multi-layered, complex and unpredictable character from the moment he shows himself on screen.  Dicaprio stumbles at first with Amsterdam, but as the movie goes on, he becomes more confident, leading to the films' fiery and explosive climax when the Draft Riots insue.  Also, Cameron Diaz is effective as the pickpocket Jenny Everdean, but has the same problem that mirrors Dicaprio in her early troubles but eventual growth into her character.<br />Where the \\"If Flawed\\" part of my title comes from a script that is at times too ambitious and overreaching.  Where the screenwriters paint a vivid picture life and strife in the Five Points, they have difficulty developing characters other then Bill the Butcher and his cohorts.  Diaz was able to pull a respectable character of Jenny Everdean from a part that was often lacking.  There was the same problem with Amsterdam, though not as much.  They needed more text to describe Amsterdam in as much detail as they did Bill the Butcher.  Over the course of the movie though, the character of Amsterdam becomes clear, but not as readily or as satisfying as William Cutting.<br />Is \\"Gangs of New Yrok\\" Scorcese's best film?  Probably not, considering his past successes.  But it is a worthy entry in his repatuare, for its powerful vision of Civil-War era New York and Daniel Day-Lewis' deft and steady development of his big, bad William Cutting.  With repeat viewings, \\"Gangs\\" will reval itself more, showing more of its bravado and sinewy nature.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I have seen this film in various degrees of decay  several times over the years... at least I thought I did. The restored version is like a whole different film. I saw this version (Kino- restored version) in the theater prior to the release of this DVD. There are very few movies that share the intensity and scope of this, an amazing work of art in the world of silent film. Fritz Lang's use of perspective is an amazing example of how it can be used to evoke an emotional response in the viewer. I was amazed by the way this movie moved me, I was thinking about it two days later. One of the most powerful films produced ever. If you ever get a chance to see this in the theater, do it- you will not regret it! I strongly suggest you purchase this DVD.
0792164903|5.0|Through my wife I'm becoming more and more of a Johnny Depp fan, and this movie has added to that. Plus being a fan of Christina Ricci and Chritopher Walken made this a no-brainer. The atmosphere is spooky, the characters wonderful yet a certain surrealism pervading everything (which is dead-on for a spooky ghost story!). Wonderful and inventive re-telling of the legend.
B000054OXU|5.0|This is one of Young's best albums. DON'T TAKE THE ADVICE OF THE REVIEW THAT TELLS YOU NOT TO BUY IT!!<br />Seriously, it's a great album and hugely underrated. It's certainly different, but most of Young's albums are. Have a listen to the samples and if you aren't put off by the sound, then go for it!
B00007E8V4|5.0|Their new album released in 2002 really had me going to the music store to get it. All the songs on this cd are good, especially \\"Innervision\\" and \\"Chic'N'Stu\\". This is System Of A Down at it's best and full of rock energy.<br />1. Chic'N'Stu- Really funny song, lyrics is mainly about food and advertising, which is quite unusual for rock bands. Full of rock energy, very impressive screaming.<br />2. Innervision- My favorite song, very good tune, the introduction is the best, really got me into the song. It's slightly less energetic than the other songs but the chorus is really good.<br />3. Bubbles- Sounds really african-like, mainly because of Daron's speed picking and the way Serj sings. Awesome singing from Daron in the chorus. Very energetic song.<br />4. Boom!- Funny lyrics, this song sounds like a poem, very energetic.<br />5. Nuguns- Weird intro, really strange chorus and awesome singing from Daron in the chorus<br />6. A.D.D- Really good song, bascially everything in this song is good.<br />7. Mr.Jack- Very good singing, but i don't listen to this song much.<br />8. I-E-A-I-A-I-O - Shows Serj's ability to say tongue-twisters really well, chorus sounds like it was played by an african vocal band.<br />9. 36- Weirdest song on the album, just 46 seconds long, lyrics don't mean anything, really hilarious and stays in your memory.<br />10. Pictures- \\"I got pictures on my mind\\", this line in this song is how people would remember this song. Serj pretends to blow a trumpet in the bursts of the drum roll. Funniest bit of the song is \\"I got pictures on my mind\\" because they don't mean anything and its just to make you laugh.<br />11. Highway Song- Really melodic, one of my favorites, great chorus.<br />12. F*** The System- Really hilarious song, weird singing, good song to listen to continuously.<br />13. Ego Brain- Great Song and lyrics, but nothing special.<br />14. Thetawaves- NOthing special, very good intro, very good singing in the chorus.<br />15. Roulette- One of the best songs on this album, acoustic and very stylish. Excellent tune and easy to play on guitar.<br />16. Streamline- Nothing special, boring to listen to after a while.
B00004UBBG|4.0|Mott The Hoople always struck me as the ultimate glam garage band that couldn't care less what the public thought.  This all too brief set is classic and a true representation of what Mott The Hoople was all about.<br />Starting with the piano pounding, &quot;The Golden Age Of Rock 'N Roll&quot;, with the theatrical introduction, the band never lets up.  &quot;Marionette&quot; is a campy classic with ludicrous lyrics that beg several listens.  The string arrangements are perfect for this song.  &quot;Trudi's Song&quot; is a rare endearing ballad that works, but Mott would only rarely release one such as this.  &quot;Roll Away The Stone&quot; is the ultimate Mott with a killer chorus, back-up and clever arrangement in all it's simplicity.<br />The extra three songs really don't add much, but it's a nice addition.  I wish I could have seen this group live, which is said to be the best way to hear them.
B00005A46T|3.0|<BR>Let's get the commericalism facts straight; Slipknot's IOWA debuted at #3 on the Billboard charts. To many people who observe how the music industry works, this came as no surprise. Not to say that they actually pleasured this, but it was seen that many teens today are mere drama queens that would like to think the world is a pile of nothingness, having hatred for everyone in the world for...well, for existing basically (there's really no explanation behind the overrated angst), and beinig overdramatic about some of the most pointless issues that would strive them to be rather negative.<BR><BR>It is now proved that the fault of mainstream muisc doesn't so necassarily rely on MTV or radio. As a matter of fact, Slipknot hardly EVER gets played for either, but most of that fault relies on teens who pretend having it worst while trying to deal with puberty. Seriously, you can't imagine a common, reasonable, intelligent person actually wanting to listen to IOWA. The theory is proven that the record industry is under control by preteens.<BR><BR>After the breakthrough of Nirvana's Nevermind, the teen community was certainly given a big voice to the music community. It's a concept that sometimes comes with rather unpleasant results though, which is proven when many choose Slipknot as a voice of their generation (not to mention Limp Bizkit being the voice to a generation prior). <BR><BR>But another rather not pleasing effect to the band is their overly obsessive use of the concept dealing with despair, hatred, violence, anything that explains negative. This concept is indeed appropriate, but they deal too specifically with those emotions so they never really come out with anything as anthematic as Wait and Bleed or Spit It Out. It was a concept that was first used by Nine Inch Nails, who actually made a WHOLE album based on despair with very pleasing results and something very revolutionary for the fact it was hardly done before but with worse results. <BR><BR>Now with concept and commercialism issues aside, Slipknot has become a band that have these rather obnoxious theories, and since they aren't very artistic and without a rather grand vision, the masked monsters are simply too hard to take seriously. It's not something that would be a bad thing, but Slipknot are, in fact, a band that wants to be serious. <BR><BR>As far as the music goes...well, it's pretty hard to listen to this record without thingking about these facts (unless you're one of the many 'maggots' who need much sympathy for being so called mistreated). It's sad to say, but IOWA is nearly a commercial product. The album doesn't aim towards an audience who are actually into metal, it's for mall dwelling kids who act as if they can barely get out of bed in the morning. And for that matter, it's not the music that puts them in the status Slipknot has achieved, but rather how negative and how untaming their act is. This record, though, offers many interesting things and deserves much credit for that. At the expense of memorable material of course, but that can be easily despited<BR><BR>You heard it people, Slipknot is (sadly) the new voice for this generation of teen angst, misery, and (while it might sound exaggerating) perhaps posture.
B000001Y79|4.0|I love one song on this album &quot;Don't Speak&quot; and I am so glad i was able to get it at a discount price from a merchant.  The blonde has an extraordinary voice.  I can listen to it over and over.  I   discovered they play several tracks on the radio still.

I read THE CITY OF BONES last year and was so-so about the whole uproar.  Well, Mr. Connelly has definitely proven why he is one of the foremost authors in this arena.<br />ANGELS FLIGHT brings together all sorts of topics that all readers of the detective/mystery/thriller novel is interested in:  intrigue, the police brotherhood, betrayal, social cynicism and commentary, murder in all of its horror and \\"glory,\\" and most important of all, Detective Harry Bosch.

The city is blaming cops all over the place, and again, Harry is singled out to solve the murder or be framed as the fall guy.  <br />Unlike THE POET which has a rather implausible finale, or CONCRETE BLONDE which pulls a long-standing character into rather comprised role of the sociopathic serial killer, ANGELS FLIGHT creates a myriad of characters that may easily be a killer.  It is suspense writing at its best and definitely stands alone as one of Connelly's best work.
B000000W5P|1.0|How anyone could actually enjoy this atrocious mess is beyond comprehension.  Mick sounds terrible, the songs are embarrassingly bad, the playing is sloppy (not in a good way), the recording is sloppy, and the production is abominable, absolutely dismal.<br />Go back and listen to Beggars Banquet, Sticky Fingers, Let It Bleed, or many of the early records when the Stones actually cared about what they were doing and how it sounded.

B000092ZYX|4.0|Yeah, it's good.  It's better than alot of things.  But I thought this cd was going to be the one cd that we will remember forever, the one that surpassed ok computer and kid a.  I find that it doesn't even get past the bends, which is an awesome cd but still.  I find it disappointing because it seems radiohead are going in the wrong direction.  They've shyed away from the beautiful melodies, the awesome chord progressions, and the amazing instrumentation that can be heard on previous albums.  I hope the next one will right the wrongs on this cd.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This album reflects some really good songwriting.  The music is a big improvement from her debut album.  My only complaint is that I cannot listen to an entire song of Christina singing without wanting to lower the noise.  She has a very powerful voice, which is an asset but, on occasion, it sounds as if she's shouting.  It's still exciting to listen to though, since she exudes a lot of personality and emotion in her voice and is very versatile.  I  really enjoy the songs on this album, which is one of my favorites.

B000002UDB|5.0|This album is just that- a perfect collection of one gem after another. From the title track to the last,perfection.
B00006BTCA|3.0|Interpol's musical style is what really hooked me.  I really like Joy Division and Chameleons, and Interpol brings their style up to date.  *However*, I find the lyrics on the album to be lacking.  They sound like something a highschooler would scribble into his binder.  The vocals are also too static for me.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|After I watched the movie, I knew that I would have to purchase this soundtrack. After listening to the soundtrack, I felt like Klaus Badelt had done an awesome job of capturing the Pirate spirit, while upholding to the soundtrack standards of the Gladiator Soundtrack. At times it sounds reminiscent of Gladiator, but in no way has it been fully pirated (no pun intended). Definitely a must-have for anyone who likes this kind of music.
0385504209|3.0|The good news: excellent research, interesting premise, intruiging settings, thought -provoking trvia.  The bad news: predictable plot, mundane dialouge, tepid characters, one- page &quot;chapters&quot;, and an unrealistic timeline. It's difficult to identifiy with the protagonist, who is suddently expected to display an ability towards committment, when no prior examples are shown.  Even the antagonists, appear to have come from nowhere. Who are these people ? Other characters appear, make gestures that suggest an actual interest in events, and then walk away or disappear as if recovering from a fugue state. Even foils have to be developed. I was under the impression  that references would be made to several of Da Vinci's works, but this was not so.<br />Overall, it is apparent that there are some aspects of history that demand to remain in the past. To  transplant them into the present day renders them awkward in a way that is worsened by forced attempts to surround it with a contrived plot. After all is said and done, the reader is still  asking &quot;so what?&quot; I better stop here: the more I write, the more stars I end up taking away.
B00005JLXE|1.0|...Every super hero cliche is used to groan inducing effect, from the tired \\"hero\\" pulling out a broken tooth after battle to not killing the main villian because of the scales of \\"justice,\\" a term used about thirty times too many during running time. Watching DAREDEVIL is like watching a montage of BATMAN, THE CROW, and SPIDER-MAN, but just the uninspired scenes. The violent and clever comic book (especially episodes written by visionary FRANK MILLER) has been pillaged to a degree of crime. ELEKTRA is suppose to be thirty-something exotic assassin (think MONICA BELLUCI) not a nineteen year old boy. The characterization in this rubbish is non-existant, and the acting even worse. I don't know if it was the script (if one existed) or COLIN FERRELL who turned BULLSEYE into a silly psychotic goofball. There are soooo many goofy things in this flick, from the kid using MATRIX-style flipkicks to chase away bullies to the intelligence devouring playground fight (the highlight of how incredibly bad this movie is, ...If I could have given DAREDEVIL negitive stars I would've...
B00009UW0N|5.0|I have the un-edited version with all of the scenes added in and it sure didn't equal that much extra running time. I have tried 3 times and it sure didn't reach 104 minutes. I certainly don't need to look it up, since I have the real thing right here and can time it for myself.
B000066NW0|3.0|I'd just like to start this by saying, that I gave this c.d. three stars based on the content of the music and how I feel it ranks in the musical pantheon that is my c.d. player.  Second, I'd like to say that those people who constantly bash this girl for not fitting in to whatever style she says she is, get the fcuk over it...you say she doesn't play the guitar...HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?  And that she's not &quot;punk&quot; - she's SIXTEEN years old, how can you expect her to rebel against authority when her curfew is probably 11:00?  I think so many people care just a little too much and really, it's sad.  Avril Lavigne is probably more hardcore then you could ever be based on the fact that she's not sitting there judging you.  No, I am not a fan of her music, but I am not so petty as to sit here and rip apart a poor sixteen year old girl who is more successful then I will ever be in my entire existence.  Now as for a review?  Well, I'm not a fan of the music...it is a little directed toward a younger audience.  I'm 21, so when I mean younger, I mean teenage.  But that's expected considering her own age.  But pick it up and formulate your own opinion about the MUSIC, not about what she's wearing...
B000002C4J|5.0|I borrowed this CD from a friend and now am very reluctant to give it back. It is one of my favorites, mostly because there's a little bit of different stlyes of music. Dion tends to yell - oversing - but I can handle the melodrama and even enjoy it on some days. Here is my opinion of each song, however subjective:<BR>1. &quot;The Reason&quot; I like this song. It has interesting lyrics that I can agree with and the music is lovely.<BR>2. &quot;Immortality&quot; I don't get this song. Frankly it's boring and a little stupid.<BR>3. &quot;Treat her like a lady&quot; This is one of my favorite songs. I love it. I like the style, I can relate to the lyrics, and partly I like it because it's so different from the other songs.<BR>4. &quot;Why oh why&quot; I like this song. I like the words and the music, and it's a fun challenge to accurately sing along with.<BR>5. &quot;Love is on the way&quot; I love this song. The oversinging is strong in this one, but the lyrics go with the music.<BR>6. &quot;Tell him&quot; I hate this song!! This song is totally cheesy and dorky, both the words and the music. Terrible.<BR>7. &quot;Where is the love&quot; This song is dull and a little cheesy.<BR>8. &quot;When I need you&quot; This song has its cheesy parts, but I like the music.<BR>9. &quot;Miles to go (Before I sleep)&quot; This song is pretty boring and I usually skip it.<BR>10. &quot;Us&quot; Another boring song.<BR>11. &quot;Just a little bit of love&quot; I like this song with its perky beat and optimistic veiws.<BR>12. &quot;My heart will go on&quot; This song is just a little overdone and a little overemotional, but  like the words.<BR>13. &quot;I hate you then I love you&quot; Everything about this song is dumb. That said, it's well done and it's one of my favorites.<BR>14. &quot;To love you more&quot; This is my favorite song. The music is gorgeous and the lyrics are romantic.<BR>15. &quot;Let's talk about love&quot; This song may be a little silly, especially with the childchoir right in the middle of it, but I like it anyway. I like the description of love as &quot;The king of all who live, the queen of all good hearts; it's the ace you may keep up your sleeve till the game is all but lost...as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn lawn.&quot; At least I think that's what it said.

B00009W0U4|4.0|Two lovers are headed for destruction as their story is told over the course of a violent day.<br />`Irreversible' starts at the end, with a shocking killing, and then goes backwards to tell the story leading up to the opening scene<br />There has been much controversy surrounding this film due to it's extremely graphic nature.  While there is full nudity from both main stars Monica Bellucci, and Vincent Cassel, it is  nothing compared to the extreme violence in the film.  The controversial rape scene is horrible to watch, but nothing in comparison to the sex club head-bashing scene, this scene is so brutal it takes your breath away.<br />Now that the controversial topics are out of the way, the film itself is a powerful piece of film making, complete with trendy styling, and strong performances from Bellucci and Cassel, and should be viewed for such.<br />`Irreversible' is definitely NOT for everyone, but those braver viewers in search of a new style film should give it a try.<br />Nick Gonnella
B00004XONN|5.0|this is one of the greatest albums ever made.  <BR>funny thing is that 'pending on my mood it's as high as my favorite radiohead album or as low as my third favorite.  <BR>this really is an amazing album though. <BR>i don't see how this album is disjointed at all (as i read a previous reviewer said it was). <BR>every track is great. <br />track #1-everything in its right place set the tone for the album perfectly. <BR>it lets you know to expect something you've never heard before. <BR>thom's voice is amazingly melodic in it and (as usual) his voice seemingly mealts over the perfect arrangement. <br />track #2-kid a the title track comes in with a haunting piano. <BR>it sounds almost like a music box with wind behind it. <BR>thom's vocals are very distorted on the song-he sounds almost like a robot singing-it's absolutely beautiful. <br />Rats and children follow me out of town<BR>Rats and children follow me out of town<BR>Come on kids...   <br />is how he ends the song-it's truly amazing-i promise you've never heard anything close to similar to it. <br />track#3-the national anthem has one of the most infectious basselines ever. <BR>with the horns and the lyrics the song has a very claustraphobic feel to it. <br />track#4-how to dissapear completely has a part where what i'm assuming is a guitar cries like a violin (well it's a reoccuring part). <BR>this song is (in my opinion) one of thom's top five vocal performances of his musical career. <BR>amazing concept too. <br />track#5-treefingers is and instrumental. <BR>it's great for what but there's not much to say about it. <br />track#6-optimistic is definitely a high point amidst an album of great songs. <BR>the most accesable song on the album for sure. <br />The big fish eat the little ones<BR>The big fish eat the little ones<BR>Not my problem give me some<br />the lyrics are just amazing. <BR>the tune is perfect.    <br />track#7-in limbo is my least favorite song on the album. <BR>the thing is i still love it.<BR>the song really makes you feel like you're in limbo listening to it. <BR>it has a wonderful wavery feel to it. <br />track#8-idioteque is just one of the greatest songs ever recorded by anyone.  <BR>there is such a desperation in thom's voice it's just amazing. <BR>the lyrics are flawless, the drums-unique and perfect, the melody-spectacular, and the way it all comes together is just unheard of.  <BR>easily one of radiohead's best songs ever. <br />track#9-morning bell is just another great song. <BR>sounds like something you'd wake up to. <br />track#10-motion picture soundtrack is just the perfect way to close this album. <BR>it sounds like the beginning of an old fashioned church service. <BR>it's just a beautiful piece of poetry and the intruments expand throughout the track. <br />I think you're crazy, maybe<BR>I think you're crazy, maybe<br />I will see you in the next life<br />what a way to end an album.  <br />so this album is very cohesive and there has and never will be anything like it really. <BR>the thing that's so amazing about radiohead is their lyrics are probably the best in modern music and they are as (if not more) innovative as anyone around.  <br />if you have an open mind pick this up.
B00009UW0N|1.0|Woe is me for purchasing this on its release date.  Anchor Bay has always been such a reliable company (well, excluding their abominable premier release of Halloween in 1997, one that was filled with so many compression artifacts that it was virtually unwatchable), but here they appear to have made a second serious mistake with Halloween.<br />This film is a classic; perhaps the best, most influential horror movie ever (barring Psycho).  On Anchor Bay's previous Halloween DVD release, it also looked like a classic, thanks to a newly-minted transfer that was approved by none other than esteemed Halloween cinematographer Dean Cundey.  That transfer was basically letter perfect, and broke new ground in the DVD market.  As they say, &quot;one step forward, two steps back&quot;.  This new transfer lacks the beautiful color pallette that defines this film's mood and atmosphere.  Specifically, saturation of oranges and blues is almost entirely absent.  What this amounts to is a washed-out print, one in which objects bathed in blue now appear white and blazing orange pumpkins are muted and drained. Since these colours were used by Carpenter and his team to effect a feeling of looming dread in the audience, the impact of the film is noticeably diminished.  It just isn't the same Halloween we know and love.<br />Ironically, Anchor Bay has decided to finally include the Carpenter/Curtis commentary from the long-out-of-print Criterion laserdisc.  It is fresh and worthwhile, a great commentary.  The 89-minute documentary about the making of and success of Halloween is also wonderful.  It's too bad they ruined what really counts - the film.<br />Anchor Bay needs to do a recall.  In the meantime, hang on to your old edition and the extended version (which, for some inane reason, is not a part of this 'definitive' set).<br />No word yet on what Dean Cundey thinks of this edition.
B000096H33|1.0|When I first heard that Mike Oldfield was planning to re-record the original Tubular Bells with updated technology, I thought that was a wonderful idea.  But I did not take into account the measure of disrespect the composer must now feel for his once revered composition.  Rather than making this a stronger recording than the original, it seems deliberately weak and watered down.  Also, the announcing of the instruments and Cave Man lyrics are unbelievably contrived.  You just want to say to him, Mike, are you really taking this thing seriously.  And he seems to say back, I can't believe you ever took it seriously.<br />If you pretend that this is PDQ Bach stealing themes from Mike Oldfield it might just be funny.  But otherwise it's just plain painful to listen to.<br />If you've never heard the original and are considering buying this one first, please reconsider.  This parody may poison your appreciation of what was originally one of the most innovative and emotionally stirring classical rock compositions of the early 70's.
0385504209|4.0|Mr. Brown has done an excellent job of taking lots of facts and theories and weaving them together into an interesting story.  Although its billed as a mystery, its really more of a theoretical theology tale.  Mr. Brown certainly did a lot of research for this book.  A lot of the premises that he sets forth, I checked up on and found them to be real.<br />For example, yes, there really is an Opus Dei.  Yes, there is a web site....Read his description of Da Vincis last supper with a good copy of it at hand to follow along.  Its astounding how the symbolism he describes is there.<br />Im sure that Mr. Brown has done nothing to endear himself with some in the Catholic community, since he does paint the church in somewhat the light of the bad guy, but none the less, he has put forward a very interesting theory.  Im sure that if I were a student of comparative religions, of the Knights Templar or of symbology many of the theories that Mr. Brown has put forward are in the learned literature, but Mr. Brown has put them into an enjoyable read for us common folks.<br />I must however subtract one star from the book for the same criticisms that many of the other reviewers have stated.  The only character that is given any real motivation seems to be Silas.  All the other characters seem to be there for the delivery of dialogue to explain the theory that Mr. Brown is developing.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I haven't seen the film but i'd imagine the soundtrack is cool, I have seen the terminator and thats a good film i like the chase scene, i also like pirate films, my best ever has to be pirates on pirates xxx, that was pretty great!<BR>All in all i'd give the soundtrack 5 as its on a shiny CD
B00005JLXE|1.0|Daredevil was a boring movie to watch.  The dialogue was cheesy and there was no chemistry between any of the characters.  This movie looked like it was just thrown together.  It didn't flow very well.  I am not a big Ben Affleck fan, but he is not what made this movie so bad, it was the writing.  When I watched Spider-man I got really into his character and you can feel his every emotion, but in Daredevil I could care less.  He didn't pull me into the movie at all.  And when Elektra dies I didn't feel sad or sorry for Matt Murdock because their was no real chemistry between them.  The writing could have been much better.  And when Daredevil and Kingpin finally meet there was absolutely no intensity what so ever.
0767836286|4.0|This movie was absolutely amazing- (I just saw it on TV though, so i didn't get to buy it- or watch all the apparently interesting extras on the DVD!)<BR>I live in Reston, VA where the story takes place- and know of a &quot;Michael Farady Rd.&quot; right near where I live (named after an inventor- not the movie..) but this made the movie all the more interesting! And then to think this was a pre-sept 11 movie! What an interesting thought- that your next door neighbor could be a terrorist? Espeically considering that I also have friends who knew the Russian Spy you may  recall.<BR>This moive was AMAZING!!! SOO realistic- makes you think, and makes you angry. Wish I had the DVD so I could watch it again.
B000099T2L|2.0|....<br />My opinion is there are only four songs worth listening to. The ubiquitos single of course, Naughty Girl, Baby Boy, Hip Hop Star, and That's How You Like It. It's sad that only one of those songs features only Beyonce herself, with no guest appearances.<br />The remaining songs left me disappointed. B sounds like a child. Don't get me wrong. The girl has a voice like a woman and is definitely shaped like a woman but the lyrics are juvenille and are more for new, younger DC fans than us in our 20's. Ok, so most of the lyrics are flat but her voice is on point. Except on a couple of songs. It seems to me like songs like Be With You, Speechless, and Yes could have been sang beautifully by Aaliyah. Beyonce sings them but Aaliyah would have *sang* them.<br />I almost forgot. The duet with Luther V. did a great disservice to a classic, romantic song. B needs to stick with new cats like Young Hov and Sean de Paul who she can groove with.<br />All in all, an ok cd by a wanna-be diva who (with enough help and training) could one day become a true star.
B000002G87|5.0|Just the fact that Eric Clapton and Duane Allman (R.I.P.) were in a band together makes you want to listen to stuff... But i doubt you would think it would be as great as it is... and i mean that.  This album is one of the greatest albums of ALL TIME... it should be in everyone collection and in everyone's top 25 list of their favorite albums.<br />Here's a Rundown:<br />1. I Looked Away - 8/10 - Great opener and good vocals from Clapton.<BR>2. Bell Bottom Blues - 10/10 - one of the albums best, great vocals, great solo, great emotion, great song!  <BR>3. Keep On Growing - 8/10 - good... thats all<BR>4. Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out - 10/10 - amazing song that you can listen to over and over and over and over and over, amazing solos from Eric and Duane.  <BR>5. I Am Yours - 7/10 - not bad, not amazing, its good...  <BR>6. Anyday - 7/10 - same as above...       <BR>7. Key To The Highway - 9/10 - wonderful song, wonderful solos.        <BR>8. Tell The Truth - 8/10 - good, strong song      <BR>9. Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad? - 9/10 - love the vocals, and solos, Duane is amazing and does better on solos than Clapton, and this shows it!!!!        <BR>10. Have You Ever Loved A Woman - 10/10 - might be the albums best song, and Erics greatest solo.... Duane also does outstanding well, and i love how they trade off to one another, soo much emotion in these solos.        <BR>11. Little Wing - 10/10 - i love how they didn't try to replicate Little Wing, and no one will ever come close (with exception to Stevie Ray Vaughan) and i hate it when people try to sound like Hendrix, they can't do it... instead they rework this song into some extraordinary and seems perfect for the album, if Hendrix hadn't writin the original it seems like DATD would have writin this version on their own.       <BR>12. It's Too Late - 7/10 - not exciting... but good...       <BR>13. Layla - 10/10 - people always say this is the best song on the album, i disagree, but i still LOVE this song, its amazing, Eric at his best, and the last 4 minutes are truly amazing music, the emotion is there, and it comes together so well, and Duane slide solo is wonderful, it brings a tear to the eye<BR>haha... no really its awesome....       <BR>14. Thorn Tree In The Garden - 9/10 - Good Closer... but i think this shud be song 13 and Layla be 14 (the Closer) cuz it closes an album better thant Thorn Tree In The Garden, but this song is amazing and just might be the most calming of all the songs.<br />ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!!!!!
1563898586|5.0|Every time I read this, I find some new little tidbit to enjoy.  If you were discouraged by the movie, I implore you to pick up the source text to find out what went wrong.  This is an excellent story and a great tribute to early 20th century adventure fiction.<br />I really like this book.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I love this soundtrack!  It brings to vividly to mind the excitement and fun of this movie, but what happened to the rest of it?  I've seen POTC several times and have made a point of listening to the score throughout the movie, and much to my disappointment, the soundtrack has been heavily edited.  I don't think that there are any significant pieces that were omitted, but each track itself has been shortened.  Considering the poularity of this movie, I was surprised that it took them a full two weeks to release the soundtrack, and then I had to go to 4 different stores to find it.  Perhaps Disney underestimated the demand for a soudntrack and hastily put one together, butchering the music in the process.  Let's hope that there will be another full-length version coming to stores soon!
0062502182|4.0|I really enjoyed this very simple and light hearted tale about not being afraid to follow your dreams and take chances.  I can't believe it got so many bad reviews!  <BR>This book is about ones boy's journey as he sets out to follow  his dreams. He meets all sorts of interesting characters who are all somehow connected and know what he is supposed to be doing.  The book is full of metaphors to which many people can apply to everyday life.  All of us have been at a crossroads in our lives at some point or another, all of us have been made to made some  decisions which at the time seemed shakey. This book is not only entertaining but causes you to think a little about what's holding you back from doing what you really want to in life!<BR>Bottom line: A wonderful and quick read!
B000002LND|5.0|Take note: this is the blueprint of what a greatest hits compilation should be. It collects songs from both studio albums and soundtracks/other sources in one place. The versions picked are edits of radio and video versions of the songs. They're in chronological order. There's a thoughtful essay which focuses on the songs themselves. Of course it's easy to achieve perfection when you're assembling a collection of some of the finest pop music ever produced. The only quibble to say is that Madonna had too many hits to include on one cd, and at this time in her career, not enough for two cds, so some classic songs are MIA. Even if you have her other albums this is an essential, historic and joyful disc.
B000069AUI|5.0|I've listened to this album dozens of times and can't get enough of it. Brit-Pop but without the annoying attitude. Combines thoughtful interludes with rock-out sections. This band should be around for awhile.
B00008VGK0|3.0|Felix Da Housecat's Remix of American Life is the sound that Madonna should have been looking for to bring her American Life CD to actual life. Though Madonna did a good job on American Life the single. I think listeners didn't get the idea this song conveys. Every review I read is saying this song brings to light the reality of our supposed sick dream of what it is to be American. The song doesn't speak against life in America necessarily. It speaks of modern FAME. It isn't free. I doubt she could live without it but she goes on to say it isn't for her. Fame comes at a high price. Madonna said to the world &quot;I live the American dream, You are the best thing I've seen, You are not just a dream.&quot; She is saying it came true for me and it is real but don't be a fool. With everything comes sacrifice. Madonna longed to be loved and found what she thought was love in fame. She learned differently when she had her children. Much lover to her and all who learn that nothing makes you happier than the love you have for someone else.
B00009ATIX|3.0|I liked George's performance in this DVD.  It's not his typical type of movie.  It's like a one-man show - he is the central character and the story basically evolves around him.  It's dark (not just the lighting) and very thought provoking.  I am a huge George fan and have seen all his films. This is definitely NOT one of my favorites, but I have to praise the complexity of the story line and his ability to play Chris to the letter.  As for his rear end, well, what's a space movie without a &quot;moon&quot; shot??  The controversy over it was ridiculous and probably generated by the studio...  Anyway, it's a sci-fi must see.  Don't expect monsters and aliens to devour the crew, because it's not that kind of movie at all.  It will leave you wondering &quot;what was that?&quot;  You'll think about it a great deal, for several days before you finally get it.  I had to watch it more than once.  Each time you unwrap a different layer. George is outstanding in his emotional performance...
0385504209|2.0|I had expected a better written book after reading the glowing reviews. The story is fast-paced and exciting at first, but it soon got predictable. Nonetheless, I give credit to the author, for his imaginative ideas. But! do not doubt that this is a poorly written book. It could/should have been better.
0553208845|5.0|This was the first book I had read by Herman Hesse, and I thought it was wonderful.  I myself am not budhist, and I don't think you have to be to appreciate the message.<br />This book is about one mans journey through life, his trials and tribulations while in search of the ultimate spiritual enlightenment.  I also do not think that you have to be spiritual person to read and appreciate this book either.  We all spend our lives &quot;in search of&quot; something, it guides our every move.  I would recommend this book to anyone who questions the meaning of life, their purpose in this world, or has spent their life &quot;in search of&quot; something.  While it does not answer all of lifes greatest questions, it really forces you to do some introspection!  Enjoy!
B000002MUW|3.0|Bedtime Stories has a different sound for Madonna. On this disc she worked with  multiple R&amp;B producers to create a slick album of various sounds. &quot;secret&quot; has a 70's urban funky feel to it. The spiritual undertones are hints of what was to come later in Ray of Light. &quot;don't stop&quot; is almost a dance anthem. The shake-your-booty lyrics and the beats are there, but, the glossy arrangement keeps it from being compelling. After &quot;secret&quot; It's my favorite song on this album and would have made a great single. The title track is phenomenal: Rich, complex and vague lyrics that you could interpet many ways. The bulk of the songs are ballads whose production is bland R&amp;B. The songs are saved however by Madonna's heartfelt and sincere delivery.
B0000508U6|3.0|I bought this album after being blown away by &quot;Rush of Blood&quot;. Not nearly as good as that album. The talent is there but it's not as mature or as much fun.
B00008WG3U|5.0|this cd has very little ska...and is mostley punk....the lyrics have a lot more meaning then the other cd's and the songs are harder to play
B00008DDXC|5.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is yet another live version of the books we love. This DVD has many extras, including deleted scenes (that you can actually get to easily, this time) and interviews. You can explore Diagon Alley, as well as other places, and watch the beloved movie!!!<br />Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Daniel Radcliffe once again strikes us as the heroic and perfect Harry Potter...the perfect match. Rupert Grint stars as Ron Weasley, the funniest character (in my opinion) of the bunch, who delivers many laughs even when the group is in danger. And Emma Watson delivers a perfect performance as Hermione Granger, the &quot;know-it-all&quot; character who always helps Harry and Ron figure out the mystery. <br />This year Hogwarts is in danger. Someone is letting a monster loose on the students, mainly those who are muggle-born, and the students as well as the future of the school is in danger. Harry is a suspect himself, and only Ron and Hermione, and most of his house, stick by him through the troubled time. So he takes it into his own hands to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets...and is led into more danger than the last film.<br />Christopher Columbus does an excellent job yet again. His Harry Potter and the chamber of Secrets movie was directed so well that you feel as if you are in the movie. Great graphics, once again great music by John Williams, and great acting performances make this movie so great it'll take magic to make the next one, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, better than this.
B00001ODGR|5.0|This is an exceptional DVD.  The sound and picture quality are excellent.  Tommy Shaw and Dennis DeYoung are both in fine form.  Styx can really put on a great concert and this DVD shows it.  Tommy Shaw is particularly full of energy.  Check out &quot;blue collar man,&quot; &quot;Boat on the River&quot; and &quot;Renegade&quot; and you can see why this band has been able to rock on even with its personnel changes.  Tommy Shaw is still leading the band and he knows how to play a crowd.
6305696071|3.0|I saw this movie on Tv because I'm only 13 and at the time I was 12 and my mom didnt want me to see all of it. Now my WHOLE ENTIRE family is obsessed with this movie and whenever all the women get together we always end up watching it. It was good, but very predictable.....not that that makes it bad, but I thought it was going to be this brilliant work of art. But it wasnt. It was good and most people will like it, but its not that great.
B00005J6T0|4.0|True Blue contains classic Madonna singles that stand the test of time. &quot;papa don't preach&quot;, &quot;live to tell&quot;, &quot;open your heart&quot;, &quot;live to tell&quot;, &quot;true blue&quot; &amp; &quot;la isla bonita&quot; are pop perfection. Unfortunately the other tracks on the album are just OK. The arrangements are synthy and sound dated: one listen and you know exactly when they were recorded. Even if you already have the mentioned singles it's worth the purchase of this cd for the amazing Herb Ritts cover alone.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer falls into a class of great songwriters like Bob Dylan. His songs are much better conceived than the standard FM radio fluff. His acoustic guitar and great singing voice make for enjoyable songs. His songs are clearly for the young - teenagers or twenty-somethings - and are written from that perspective: somewhat self-absorbed, naive, and all about the potential of the future. His concerns about his &quot;quarter-life crisis&quot; are a little over the top at times, but this is a good album celebrating the wonderfulness of youth.
B00008URYM|5.0|It's such a small price for something so big. A Madonna collectable that may be hard to come by in the next few years. It contains the &quot;edited&quot; version of &quot;American life&quot; without the swearing which is a relief considering i have to change over to the next song every time i listen to the origional on the album. The it contains a &quot;remix&quot; of &quot;Die Another Day&quot; which to the best of my knowledge cannot be found on any other Madonna remix album. Don't just sit there and stare at the price, order it now and listen to it, enjoy it, and make it outsell any of her other singles considering it is doing rather horribly for a Madonna single.
0312932081|5.0|Many adults I have spoken to hate sci-fi books. Again and again i recommend this book to them, telling them that it is not just a sci-fi book, one that you read one page and are utterly lost...but a wonderful plot that shows the imagination of a great author. <br />Orson Scott Card is an author that writes as if he has lived his books and adventures. Ender's Game is the first book in the Ender Series. It is about a boy named Ender who, in the future, is recruited to Battle School...a school that teaches and produces commanders and navigators for the International Fleet from boys as young as six. The &quot;buggers&quot; are a new species that the world believes is trying to wipe out the human race. The IF is looking for one person to command their fleet...to rage war on this species, and win. And that person, that boy, is Ender Wiggin.<br />He leaves his life behind and travels into space to join Battle School, not knowing he is special. But the Buggers are not the only obstacle he has to face. The students themselves, being alone...not able to make friends, Ender has to fight for not just his life and the lives of others, but for his happiness.<br />I used to hate sci-fi books too. But this book is more than a sci-fi novel. It is a book that you will cherish and read over and over. It is a book I am proud to give 5 stars. Orson Scott Card is a genius, just like his Ender, and the book is an adventure waiting just for you.
B00005U11Z|3.0|Journey was a great live band.  There are still flashes of that brilliance - separate ways is great, anyway you want it, escape and some of the others.  At least Neil and Jonathan are still in the band.  But there's no question that it's hard to replace Steve Perry.  Although the band has tried hard to find a sound-alike - there is just something missing.  The sound isn't quite there.  The energy certainly isn't.  It would be great to see a Journey DVD - at their peak - from the Raised on Radio tour - near the end of the rope.  The sound and picture quality are fine - and some of the cuts are quite well done.  But Don't Stop Believin' is just not convincing - Stone in love lacks something...I'm glad to see that they are back and touring = but losing Steve Perry is a really big loss - and that is evident.  (Styx has done much better in replacing Dennis Deyoung with Gowan - but that's because they still have Tommy Shaw singing half the songs. Here - there's no one else to add the old elements).
B00005Q66T|3.0|The packaging for this greatest hits package is amazing: mulitple thumbnails of Madonna's various incarnations is reminiscent of the &quot;music&quot; montage video. Unfortunately the material inside is subpar. It should have been called ICV2. The tracks should be single mixes and radio edits and arranged chronologicaly. There should have been a new single a'la &quot;justify my love&quot; that accompanied it. The insipid essay should have been trashed and replaced with with a thoughtful essay about Madonna's music. Shame on the producers who took such wonderful material and arranged it in such a shabby fashion.
0156421178|5.0|There is Lionel Trilling's introduction written in 1952.  Standing alone the introduction is historic and of consequence.  It appears in the Beacon Press edition of the work.  At any rate, Trilling finds that the moral tone of Orwell's book is uniquely simple and true.  Orwell was a virtuous man.  He had an old fashioned temperament.  Orwell's experience of being declasse , of being down and out after service in Burma, had significant implications for his writing.  Orwell thought the intelligentsia refused to consider the conditional nature of life.  Orwell could never believe that intellectual life would be a political idyll.<br />When Orwell went to Spain he went to write newspaper articles but joined a militia almost immediately.  In Barcelona revolutionary posters were everywhere.  In the P.O.U.M. militia the shortage of rifles was desperate.  Therefore, there was no weapon training, just marching, drills.  Orwell described the smells of war.  Rifles were finally received three miles from the front line. Orwell noted that in trench warfare five things were important, firewood, food, tobacco, candles, and the enemy.  Orwell said he actually saw very little fighting.  He was in hand to hand combat once, and he reported once was too much.  <br />There was equality in the militias.  Military failure could not be attributed to the system of equality.  Failure resulted from the newness, the lack of material, the lack of training, and the age of the recruits.  He found that revolutionary discipline depended on political consciousness, an understanding of why orders must be obeyed.  (What Orwell described is termed the learning curve in other kinds of discourse.) The militias held the line and there were few desertions.  There was a lack of firewood.  Warfare had made the bare mountainous region even more bare of vegetation.  The English and Spanish always got on well together.  When more Englishmen arrived, Orwell was shifted over to that group.  They were now somewhatcloser to the enemy.  Aragon peasants treated their mules well but their donkeys abominably. In late February 1937 they left Monte Oscuro and were sent with all of the P.O.U.M. troops in the sector to make  a part of the army besieging Huesca.  Until late March nothing happened.    <br />Initially Orwell ignored the political side of the war.  Spain seemed to be suffering from a plague of initials and the matter was confusing.  Orwell thought all of the government forces were Socialists, anti-fascists.  In the beginning Franco's real opponent was not so much the government as the trade unions.  A revolution had started in Spain but its progress and significance varied by region.  By October-November 1936 there was a swing to the Right. Power passed from the Anarchists to the Communists.  The Communist leadership sought to suppress the revolution because it was believed to be premature.  Only Mexico and Russia came to the assistance of the government and only Russia was big enough to dictate terms.<br />The Communist Party moved first against the P.O.U.M. and then against the Anarchists.  The war was essentially a triangular struggle.  The P.O.U.M. was a dissident Communist party.  The unions were not necessarily Anarchists in the pure sense and yet they were tinged with the philosophy and made up a huge portion of the forces opposing Franco.  They aimed at worker control and not parliamentary democracy.  They had uncompromising hostility to the bourgeoisie and the Church.  <br />At the time Orwell preferred the Communists because they had a definite policy.  Press censorship was mainly under Communist control.  One of the worst aspects of war is war propaganda.  The Communists and the P.O.U.M. came to write more bitterly against each other than against the fascists.  Orwell was isolated among the most revolutionary section of the working class.  On paper the Communist case was a good one.  Orwell drew back at their actual behavior.  Communists seemed to be not working to postpone the revolution but to make sure it never happened at all.     <br />In spring the peasants plowed the fields.  The landowners had left.  Orwell never did learn if the land had been collectivized or if the arrangements were informal.  The farming implements were antiquated.  Orwell was surprised that no one crossed himself, even as a gesture.  To the people of Catalonia and Aragon the Church was evidently a racket.  When he went on leave, he had been on the line for one hundred fifteen days and felt that it was the most useless period of his life. The time did form a kind of interregnum. The prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism.  The Spanish militias, while they lasted, were sort of a microcosm of a classless society. <br />Barcelona had changed in the three months and there was general indifference to war.  It was no longer fashionable to be in the militia.  Enlistments had sunk.  The Popular Army was replacing the militias in theory, but in fact it was still training in the rear.  Now there was open contrast of wealth and poverty.  Middle class people no longer wore worker clothing.<br />A civil disturbance broke out in Barcelona as the government and Communist forces sought to defeat the Anarchists and the P.O.U.M.  It was all very confusing to Orwell.  There developed a food shortage.  The Popular Army as a body stayed away from the fray.  The Barcelona fighting had given the Valencia government the excuse to assume fuller control of Catalonia.  <br />Three days after the fighting in Barcelona ended Orwell's group returned to the front.  On routine duty he felt himself being the center of an explosion.  He was taken to Barbastro and then to Lerida.  Eight or nine days after being wounded his wound was finally examined at Tarragona.  Sinister rumors of all kinds flew around Barcelona.  It was hard to convey the atmosphere he claimed because in England political intolerance was not taken for granted.<br />At this point Orwell hoped tojust get out of Spain and return to England.  He had been certified medically unfit, but he needed to obtain a discharge.  He had to repeat the circuit of field hospitals and intermediate stations in order to have his papers signed.  Returning to the hotel in Barcelona he discovered the P.O.U.M. had been declared an illegal organization and that he might be subject to arrest.  Andres Nin was taken and killed.  The manner of leaving the country makes exciting reading.  The experience in Spain clearly foreshadowed ANIMAL FARM and 1984.
B0000640VO|2.0|It's surprising that a film like this could fool a large number of people into thinking it adds up to a charming love story.  I hate to say it, but this is not a love story at all.  Amelie isn't even a story, it's an exercise.  The main difference between the two comes with flow and the editing doesn't allow that to foster a good story.  The closest the director gets to telling a story in this movie is in the very beginning where Amelie is introduced and her dilemma is presented.  The rest of the movie is about her solving this dilemma, but here is where the problem with the movie lies.  The rest of the movie feels too processed and disconnected from the true moment of feeling that the characters are going through.  Many times it feels as if the last 3/4 of the movie is simply filled with tiny bits and pieces of ideas that the director thought would be interesting enough.  I don't believe that they are because the beginning prepared me for an odd love story although, I should've known that the plot would be constantly detoured in the beginning when the narrator reveals the ponderous questions that Amelie was wondering while on top of the building. Nonetheless, my lack of foresight doesn't make this film's  lack of cohesion go away.  Add to that the fact that the movie has a constantly strange production quality that permeates the film and allows us to know that strange things will happen instead of just letting the story be strange and surprising us with an interesting moment. The knocks I have about the production don't just affect the story, they sideline it by making it seem like the movie is simply about daft craftmanship rather than the tale at hand.  I don't mind high style  cinematography, especially by this director because I love his previous film &quot;The City of Lost Children.&quot; That film had a strong story driving it's craftiness, this one doesn't. I only give it two stars because I recognize hard work on the visuals and I found some of the materialhumorous and/or dramatically effective, but this is an inferior film, story-wise to the aforementioned film and isn't really a romantic comedy because it's really hard to get past the directors reliance on technical proficiency over plot. It struck me that the film had a good story idea and not enough development to get through.
B00000JZI9|4.0|This is one of the two or three movies made in the last 30 years I actually saw in a theater; the wide screen did help in places. The movie was one of the early efforts at frontier authenticity in western movies and it's a pretty good job. The opening scene returns realism to western movies - remember all the old ones featuring gunfights in which ducking away from a window rendered one invulnerable? None of that [pooh] in \\"Silverado\\". Brian Dennehy is a pip, and Linda Hunt a gem almost flawless. \\"He can't hurt you - if he's dead,\\" she says to a frightened employee, with a grim yet matter-of-fact finality. Finally, the gunplay sounded remarkably authentic, and looked real - Jake shooting two-handed, pulling his guns down out of recoil, was a real treat.
B00009P1O2|5.0|THIS is the greatest live band in the world, performing at their peak.  Who can match the energy level of Freddie?  The voice, the versatility and the musicianship?  Queen reigns supreme here.  The DVD quality is excellent.  Even the interviews are really interesting.  If you're a Queen fan, this is a must have (you probably already have it).  If you're not yet a Queen fan - watch this performance once or twice - and join the ranks.  It's amazing to watch the interaction between Queen and the audience - this is a how to lesson in the art of putting on a great concert.  As Freddie sang &quot;it's better to burn out than to fade away...&quot; and you can really see him smoking here.  Just a shame that we can't still see him live. Wherever you are up there Freddie - thanks for the great gift!
B000002NAK|3.0|Madonna sounds amazing. Her voice is expressive, has power and range. She easily carries the soundtrack. The other leads, Antonio Banderas &amp; Johnathan Pryce are excellent as well. The reason this CD gets only 3 stars is because as great as the vocals are and as nice as the production values are; it still sounds like a 70's bloated rock opera! On screen this is a good thing. The overwraught melodrama adds to the grandeur and scope of the film, but, doesn't work as stand alone music. The exception is the new ballad &quot;you must love me&quot; which is passionate and heartbreaking in it's simplicity. BTW: Don't get this if you're looking for the radio version of &quot;don't cry for me Argentina&quot;. That's a remix and available on the cd-single; not here.

B00008J4P5|5.0|\\"Elephant\\" is one of the best garage rock albums to be released since the genre became popular.  Its unique melodies allow Jack White to further sing his true feelings.  He plays most of the instruments on the album, except the drums, played by his sister Meg White.  He writes, produces, and arranges the songs, sharing his prized ideas.  Though most tracks omit the bass guitar,  the heavy guitar sound fills in brilliantly.  The light but heavy rock sound gives the listener a one-on-one sensation(you'll have to listen to know what I mean by \\"light but heavy\\").  \\"Seven Nation Army\\" opens this album with its bass themes sound, allowing the audience to listen closer to the rest of it.  The other tracks experiment with 70's hard rock and punk rock from all decades.  They prove with this combination that they are one of the most unique musical acts of today, and that they will be around for many more years.  They allow the audience to escape from the sell-out fake pop sound often played on the radio.  Those who love this album will also love their previous album \\"White Blood Cells\\".  <br />***Their Grammy nominations are coming!!!!!!
B0000256KE|5.0|For Your Pleasure is an album that has something for everyone.  It's the perfect Roxy album and a must for those who are interested in the later work, but unaware of where to begin.  The self-titled album is a bit too experimental and unique to dive into first hand for those whom are only familar with 'More Than This' or 'Avalon'.  For Your Pleasure is a great place to start because it is Roxy's tour-de-force album.<br />Do The Strand: Great dance song! Prefect for those upbeat, happier moments.  If you want to put in a song and just have a good time, this would be the song.<br />Beauty Queen: A slower, classic Bryan Ferry ballad.  The lyrics are beautiful and Bryan wears his heart on his sleeve when singing about his young, beatiful lover. You can just picture him so well while 'his starry eyes shiver', shedding 'coconut tears'. <br />Strictly Confedintal: A dark, brooding song with a definate rock sound yet distinct sax and keyboards.  This is a haunting song that will strike you as creepy at first, but it will grow on you.  It's similar to 'Stronger Through The Years' from Manifesto.<br />Editions of You: The classic Roxy hit! This one has a somewhat pre-punk upbeat rhythm to it and will leave you screaming for more. You'll love to rock out to this song and sing along.<br />In Every Dreamhome A Heartache: Where do I even begin with this one?  Ferry wrote this song with inspiration from Orson Welles's Citizen Kane.  Basically, it's about living in a huge house with everything you could ever dream of and still be lonely and sad.  The song begins with the droning guitar and Ferry's deadpan voice, then eventually busts out into the essential Ferry warble and Manzanera guitar solo, which is one of the best!<br />The Bogus Man:  A very keyboard driven song that has an Eno-ish sound to it and seems more early 80s art rock than early 70s.  It has a quick pace but is a master of the synths.<br />Grey Lagoons: Similar to 'Bitter's End' on the self-titled album, this song has an old time 1950s rock sound, a sound that Bryan loves so dearly.  The harmonizing background vocals and the lyrics give it that classic Lounge sound that Bryan is associated with but the guitar, sax and harmonica transform it into that art rock sound that is essential Roxy.<br />For Your Pleasure: This is one of my favourite songs of all time.    Firstly, the keyboards in this are are pure genius and pure ENO.  Eno fans, this is your song.  You'll want to listen to it over and over again for the absolutely beautiful piano/synth.  It has a certain startling, almost atonal effect as the song progresses and ends with a mysteriously haunting fade out.  To me, this is the best song on the entire album.<br />I highly recommend buying this album first before any other Roxy albums.  It gives you a complete taste of what Roxy's Music is.  Not only this, plus Eno! Please enjoy For Your Pleasure, after all, that's what it was meant for. :]
0316666343|5.0|This book has been out a while, but so many people recommended it to me that I just had to read it.  It is the story of 14-year old Susie Salmon who is raped and murdered in a cornfield near her house.  She narrates the story from heaven.  She watches her family grieve and continue life after death.<br />This is a coming of age story for Susie in a strange way.  She never made it past 14, so she perceives life through the experiences of her younger sister.  Becoming a woman and falling in love.  She also watches over a boy she had a crush and follows him while he becomes a man.  She also watches the murderer as he continues to live free.<br />Very interesting concept for a book.  Tough subject matter, but it is written very well.
B000002NAK|3.0|Madonna sounds amazing. Her voice is expressive and has awesome power and range. She easily carries the soundtrack. The other leads, Antonio Banderas &amp; Johnathan Pryce are excellent as well. The reason this CD gets only 3 stars is because as great as the vocals are and as nice as the production values are; it still sounds like a 70's bloated rock opera! On screen this is a good thing. The overwraught melodrama adds to the grandeur and scope of the film, but, doesn't work as stand alone music. The exception is the new ballad &quot;you must love me&quot; which is passionate and heartbreaking in it's simplicity. BTW: Don't get this if you're looking for the radio version of &quot;don't cry for me Argentina&quot;. That's a remix and available on the cd-single; not here.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is one of the best compilations of one of the best bands of our past time.  This DVD is one that leaves a legacy of pretty much the best band to ever come around.  It's one of those types of DVD's that makes you want to sit your kids down to watch so you can inform them on what kinds of things that this band has left behind.  I sure hope that Jimmy Page never stops playing because he is my all time favorite guitar players.  Buy this DVD, and share it with your family, its one of those ones you need to show to them.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tragically, the life of this poet and rapper has been cut short in its prime. Tupac prophesied his own early demise. And he moved toward that end with fatalism worthy of a Greek tragedy. <BR>All Eyez on Me is a set of two CDs that are among the greatest rap has ever produced. Despite his outward insistence on thuggishness, Tupac was very sensitive, far more so than the average thug, or any average person for that matter. Sensitivity led to originality and an important cultural product. Tupac celebrates thug life, along with its pain and its doom.<br />The beats and the production on this album are great and go so well together with Tupac's rhymes. Tupac was a genius who made a commitment to live out his life as a thug and kept it. This was his mission, and he felt he needed to fulfill it, with all eyes staring at him, even those who refused to C him...
B0000019PA|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing CD.  I can remember when I first got it I enjoyed it immediately - but it is one of those albums that improves with each time you hear it. The only negative thing that I originally had to say about it is that it seemed a little bit too college indie \\"freaky for the sake of being freaky\\".  However, I was really wrong about this.  Jeff Magnum pulls you into his inner world and it is a very strange place full of dogs and garbage cans, Anne Frank and electricity, sex and puppetry with humans. A lot of what transpires is incomprehensible but it is also obvious that Magnum is being incredibly honest and trying to reveal more of himself than most artists do. <BR>The music itself is incredible. Neutral Milk Hotel was once described as a sad little marching band on this album and I think that somehow that description really is appropriate.  Although a lot of the songs are wonderful little pop songs dominated by accoustic guitar, when the rest of the band joins in with their bizarre and antiquated instruments the sound is like nothing that I have heard before or since. <BR>Jeff Magnum once said that he knew that he couldn't top this album and the sad thing is that since this was released over 5 years ago there has been no more new NMH music (and I wouldn't be surprised if there was no more in the future.)<BR>This is a truly magical album.  It is haunted by ghosts and half formed memories.  I don't think that it is an exageration to say that this is one of the greatest albums ever made.
1400034779|5.0|This book is a very charming one. Its heroine is both adorable and admirable, and its author is a master of story telling, from comedy to tragedy. All that has been said by other reviewers, of course. I just want to add that the unabridged audio version of the book is a real winner. Its narrator is terrific with accents and characterizations and she really brings the book alive. Apparently she has been recognized for her narration, and deservedly so. This is easily the best-read book on tape I have ever experienced. My husband agrees. So we'd both recommend the audio version over the print version in this particular case.
B000002LCD|2.0|Who's that girl is an essential purchase because it's the only place where you can get &quot;who's that girl&quot; (a #1 hit), &quot;causing a commotion&quot; (a top 10 hit) and &quot;the look of love&quot; (a moody early ballad in the tradition of live to tell). The other Madonna song &quot;can't stop&quot; is dreadful and like the rest of the material on this soundtrack represents the over-synthed dreck that represented pop music in the 80's: it sounded good at the time, but, boy, it sure doesn't hold up now. If The first three songs were available on other compilations I would have given this one only 1 star and advised you to stay clear.
020530902X|5.0|This small volume contains invaluable information on writing style. It is concise and easy to read. I highly recommend it!
B00009V7P8|1.0|I feel I should warn the public, this album is a waste of money. Both Vh1 and MTV gave this man rave reviews and I can't understand why. The whole album is nothing but a slow, repetitive drone. If you appreciate good music at all, pass this one up.
B00005JLXE|2.0|The film Daredevil is the first in a string of comic book movies hoping to cash in on the success of Spider-man and X-men. While it could've been a very good film some major points hold it back.<br />Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock, a lawyer blinded at the age of 12 from some acid. While he can't see, he has more power in his remaining four senses. He soon meets Elektra (Jennifer Garner) who he falls in love with. Soon after Daredevil runs into Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) who wants Elektra's father dead by an assassin named Bullseye (Colin Farrell)<br />The film has some major flaws though. The fights aren't as polished as they should be, the characters (Everyone of them except Daredevil) needed some major character development done, and finally, the dialogue sounds corny.<br />If the rest of the comic-book movies are like this I don't want to see them
B000002NJS|5.0|Amazing and Essential! Perhaps Madonna's best CD to date. While most electronica music is interesting, yet cold; Ray of Light is warm and inviting. More than a collection of separate tracks, the music is cohesive and consistent. Madonna's vocals have never been better. Her voice is rich and expressive. The lyrics are introspective but not self indulgent. With the title track Madonna has you dancing with joy like she hasn't done since &quot;into the groove&quot;. The only drawback is the last song &quot;mer girl&quot; which I find very boring and repetitive. I've owned this since it's release. Time and repeated playing has not dulled the experience at all.
B00006RINF|5.0|This band is amazing.I'm actually surprised that I like them so much considering my typical bands are Slipknot,Mushroomhead and The Haunted although metal is metal.This cd has very catchy tunes and they are very similar to evanescence but better.Perfectly heavy guitars are through the whole album.If you are a bit new to this band,well let me tell you DON'T compare Lacuna Coil to Theatre of Tradgedy.Except for the female vocals,they don't sound at all alike.And besides TOTs lead singer is rather obnocious.TOO soft.But the female singer of L.C(i don't know her name) has a very clear and powerful voice.They also have a male singer.His voice is kind of like the frontmen of Korn and Metalicca yet it is a lot more subtle.Although I like all types of metal,this would probably be the kind of metal for a more mature metalhead.I mean most of the members are at least thirty years old.This band is very melodic and sometimes give spooky tunes.I am very surprised that Lacuna Coil is such an underground band,at least in America they are.If you like evanescence.you WILL DEFINANTLY like this band and many people like evanescence.Lacuna Coil absolutely rocks.
6305546789|3.0|Simply put, \\"Halloween\\" isn't scary anymore.  I hate to admit it, as my childhood memories of the film have haunted me for years, but it just doesn't have the same effect 25 years later that it did in 1978.  Why is it dated, you ask?  The reality is... this film created all of the clich&eacute;s.  There have been SO many \\"Halloween\\" imitators down the years that the original seems like a barebones prototype.  It's historically important, but the only terrifying aspect of this flick is the acting.  P.J. Soles and Nancy Kyes are atrocious, and poor Donald Pleasence, a veteran of the British stage, delivers an over-the-top performance in this film that only Christopher Lee could have matched.<br />If there hadn't been a Halloween, there never would've been \\"Friday the 13th.\\"  There never would've been thousands of horror films.  But honestly... what is scary about this plot: Childhood trauma of discovering sister having sex drives Michael Myers to murdering her, as well as to returning to the scene of the crime years later on Halloween in a mask.  Sex leading to death, babysitters, Bob getting knifed into the wall, even the ending... all clich&eacute; by today's standards.  But you HAVE to give Carpenter credit.  Even if the film looks dated and phony (e.g., the first murder, shot from behind the mask.), it's one that any serious horror film collector must have in his/her collection.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Loved the film, love the music.  ABSOLUTELY loved the music, makes me want to take to the high seas.<br />However.  Except for the first track, \\"Fog Bound,\\" the songs are all named wrong.  For instance:  \\"The Medallion Calls,\\" my favorite track, has nothing to do with the pirate medallion sending out that underwater shock wave; it is Captain Jack's very dignified entrance.  \\"Will and Elizabeth\\" is neither a love theme, nor from a scene that has both characters; it is the music that Will and Jack fight to in the smithy.  Then there are completely ambiguous track names, such as \\"Skull and Crossbones\\" and \\"Bootstrap's Bootstraps\\" (may I point out that the scene in which the two dull pirates describe what they did to Bootstrap Bill has no music in the background?).<br />It's hard to dis a CD like this, since I LOVE the music (have I mentioned that yet?).  But it's hard to picture exactly all the action from the movie when the tracks' titles are so misleading.  Such a shame, I guess I'll have to keep going to the movies to see this picture, until I can analyze the soundtrack and rename all the songs.  <br />I give my highest recommendation for this music, and I challenge anyone out there who likes this movie even half as much as I do to get the CD and have fun renaming all of its songs (except the first one).<br />Drink up me hearties, yo ho!
B000002LLC|3.0|The Soundtrack to Dick Tracy is better than the movie that inspired it. The songs are either very good: \\"he's a man\\", \\"sooner or later\\", \\"something to remember\\", \\"back in business\\", \\"hanky panky\\" or they're very bad: \\"I'm going bananas\\", \\"now I'm following you 1 & 2\\", \\"cry baby\\". The music is arranged in a big-band 40's style, but, with 90's updating. This was recorded pre-Evita voice training so Madonna's voice is not a great match with the material. But, the presentation is heartfelt, the photos are gorgeous and it includes \\"vogue\\", which, deservedly, was an international smash that can still get you to preen around like a demented runway model.
1563890119|4.0|After enjoying Neil Gaiman's weblog for a few months, I decided to give the Sandman series another shot. The first time round, I found it to be ill-suited for the comics medium, lending itself more to a novel setting.<br />This first graphic novel seems unaware of its future, and seems rather ordinary. Particularly amusing is Gaiman's attempt to integrate into the DC universe, including visits to John Constantine and JLA's Mister Miracle. This is funny because of how I had always considered Sandman's greatest strength to be how far away it seemed from all of DC's other comics, the exploration of a previously unseen world.<br />The story itself is sharp, well thought out and still very modern. I had remembered the writing being top heavy, but for these first issues, I see no sign of it. I found the art to be muddy, but tolerable.<br />An excellent read, blissfully ignorant of its coming success.
6305609705|5.0|There are plenty of good reviews if you need them.  This is truly a wonderful movie.  Rent/Buy it and see for youself (the original that is, not redux).
B00005NRQE|1.0|This movie is just plain awful. Sting's performance is unbelievably bad. Thi story is just stupid: Jimmy Cooper is depressed woe-is-me whiny boy who revels in teenage angst everyday. Only in the company of his &quot;Mod&quot; friends does he find some comfort for &quot;horrible&quot; life. Pure white boy pain. Sting prances about as the Mod leader (yeah, right) and once poor Jimmy loses everything from his dim girlfriend to his home and his belief in the Mod ideal, he tries to commit suicide, but stops at the last minute because he is too scared, like any sad white boy. The soundtrack from the Who is equally awful, since the Who were one of the WORST bands ever.<br />In short, this grimy, cheap Brit movie tries to explain to day to day suffering of the poor white boy, and succeeds as an exercise in in self indulgence and pretentiousness.
B00005J6SZ|4.0|Like a Virgin established Madonna as an icon for the 80's. (her subsequent releases cemented her as an icon for all ages. This was only her second album so the jury was still out)The music is uniformly good and at times great. &quot;like a virgin&quot; and &quot;material girl&quot; will forever be associated with the first coming of Madonna. The hooks and melodies elevate them from being disposable novelty hits. Though the material here is classic 80's, it does not sound dated now. Upbeat, bouncy and fun with the exception of &quot;love don't live here anymore&quot; which can still break your heart and is far superior to the bland remix featured on the Something to Remember compilation.
0440237688|5.0|*****Although I read this book when I was only 12, I have now graduated from college, and it is still one of my all-time favorite books. I still think about The Giver and all of its wonderful characters. I would recommend this book to any young person (and even an adult) that is interested in experiencing a society that is so very different than one would expect. It opens one's eyes to different political and social views. What a wonderful book to read on a rainy weekend. *****
B000002UJQ|5.0|Please excuse me while I bash a previous reviewer.  to &quot;The Cranky Reviewer&quot;:  I feel the need to clarify a few things for you.  Radiohead is the greatest musical occurence in contemporary music.  They are not here to please your simple ears and mind.  They know how to write, and they know how to play, and do both exeptionally well.  If you had the mental capacity to listen to and understand the music in an intelligent way, you would find that it is the most brilliantly crafted, carefully and emotionally constructed music available.  THIS IS NOT DANCE MUSIC, NOR IS IT MEANT TO BE.  IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO DANCE MUSIC, BUY A F***ING DANCE CD.  Thanks for your time and generous ignorance.  I have been thoroughly amused by your petty and insignificant presence here - Allan<BR>p.s. good luck with your duran duran
B000002C1W|1.0|This is NOT Pink Floyd. Never was, never will be. This is David Gilmour doing a solo album and trying to do the 80's pop sound that was SO loved at the time. Hasn't aged well. I don't think Nick Mason and Rick Wright did ANY songwriting on this album. ...
B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna's debut is a pop/dance classic. Each and every song is excellent. Thanks to their great riffs &quot;holiday&quot;, &quot;borderline&quot; and &quot;lucky star&quot; are instantly memorable but don't discount the other tracks you don't know. They are just as good. It's impossible to listen to this and not want to move at least some parts of your body to the beats. What could have been throwaway 80's fluff is transformed by joyful melodies and excellent craftmanship into music that has stood the test of time.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I knew I had to buy the soundtrack while watching the movie! Pirates is already in my top 5 favorite soundtracks..the only thing I wish for is that Disney will issue a longer version which includes the end credits music.  Reading the liner notes was funny as all members of the orchestra and production team obviously had fun!
0790729628|3.0|...Sorry for any spoilers.<br />Is Deckard human or an android?  Does being human necessarily mean you are made of flesh and blood?  Why does Deckard feel remorse after shooting his non-human adversaries?  Why does Deckard fall in love with Rachel?  Why does Roy humanely spare Deckard at the end?<br />These are the kinds of questions that I asked myself after watching this film in a theatre back in 1982.  These questions that the movie inspired were one of the reasons why I really loved the film.  <br />With the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, these questions are answered for you.  Therefore, so like most films, it is purely a visual entertainment vehicle that does not require you to think.  As such, it still is a competent and better than average movie, but the original had a depth to it that made it a classic.  <br />Please put out the original &quot;classic&quot; on DVD.
B000002MFN|5.0|Because Erotica was tied in with the horrid \\"sex\\" book and \\"body of evidence\\" movie, most people assume it is more of the same thing: raunchy sex without passion or sensuality. In reality Erotica is a compelling collection of songs with smutty titles that cover up complex themes. The exceptions are \\"where life begins\\" which does indeed have raunchy lyrics (and great music) and the title track which is \\"justify my love\\" part two. The music on this cd is rich and layered and upbeat. The lyrics, however, are dark and challenging. Combined with Madonna's throaty, passionate delivery it's a winning combination. I highly reccommend buying the clean version to save your senses from the stink of \\"did you do it\\" which is an idiotic, Madonna-free rap number mumbled over the music from \\"waiting\\". It is stupid, misogynist, insulting and an unlistenable waste of your time.
B00009MGQL|4.0|Most artists as they age mellow out to some degree. They begin to run away from the aggressive music of their youth, seeing it as \\"immature\\". Mr. Beck, however, seems to do the exact opposite. He grows increasingly more aggressive as he ages. This newest album, \\"Jeff\\", continues to build upon the electronic sounds first started on 1999's Who Else! release.<BR>One tracks such as \\"So What\\" (no relation to the Miles Davis modal jazz tune) Jeff blasts us with a sonic hailstorm of sound, picking the listener up off the floor and beating him or her senseless. These are not tracks for the timid. They explode out of your speakers, the guitar snarls and curls it lip and curses you out like a drunken sailor on shore leave. <br />That said, the album isn't as monotonous as the previous Jeff Beck effort, \\"You Had It Coming\\". The tracks all have sudden stops and starts and surprises. The drum loops themselves are magnificent peices of rhythmic composition. If this album has a weakness, it is that fans of Jeff Beck like myself will find themselves wanting to hear more clearly the beautiful voice of his guitar, as on much of this album the guitar is a member of a larger orchestra of sounds and not always present in the foreground. <br />However, there are plenty of moments where Beck shows that his electric guitar mastery is unmatched: The subtle, clean pickin' (reminiscent of his playing on She's a Woman from Blow by Blow) on the bizarre \\"Pay Me No Mind\\", the soaring blues rock on \\"Hot Rod Honeymoon\\", and the Eastern melodicism on \\"Porcupine\\".<br />Also present is Beck's greatest strength: his uncanny ability to sing on the guitar, sing to your very soul itself. He graces us with ballads of immense power on every record he makes, and this is no exception. We are reminded of this early on with the track \\"Seasons\\" (one of the strongest tracks on the album) during the \\"soft\\" section, but we get it full on with the drop dead gorgeous \\"Bulgaria\\". Also of note here is the floating, dreamy \\"JB's Blues\\". <br />All in all, this might be one of Beck's strongest creative efforts in his entire catalog. I doubt it is as fully listenable as records such as Truth, The Jeff Beck Group, and Blow by Blow, but it certainly ranks as an artistic triumph for a guitarist that continues to improve as he ages. For a musician who has already given as much to us as Jeff Beck has, every album, every song, indeed every note must be treated as a gift. And on \\"Jeff\\", the gifts are plentiful.
0345440900|5.0|Most of the negative reviews of this book are from parents who seem to be looking for a single book that will cure all their woes, or a point of view that they agree with completely. While I think it would be a mistake to follow anyone's advice to the letter, Hogg's basic message of providing lots of love, nutrition while giving the child a sense of independance has made our home, and our baby, extremely healthy and happy. Unfortunately, many of the parents I know who are anti-Hogg are also worn-out human pacifiers after six months who wish they had started the parenting process as they meant to go on.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Ok, I'll be the first to agree with all the accolades heaped on Radiohead's previous work, especially \\"OK Computer\\".  I bought Hail to the Thief based on some rather glowing reviews on Amazon.com and in the music press.  Frankly, I don't get it.  I've listened to the cd about 10 times and nothing really stands out.  It's creative, however it will probably just end up collecting dust in my cd rack.  It's my opinion that some fans just want to say it's great just because it's Yorke and company.  I'm a huge Clash fan, but I'm not ashamed to say \\"Combat Rock\\" was mediocre at best.
B000069HK2|5.0|The thing that I really enjoyed about hte Useds sound/album is they can go through some pretty big extremes and morph from sensitive sweeties (Dashboard Confessional Style) to catchy pop-punkers (Like Simple Plan) and show off some real screechin' rock vocals and styles in other songs (actually theres a touch in most songs).  ALtogether this album is really unique from track to track, which is the basis for me giving it 4 stars.  They lost a star only cuz here and there some of the hardcore songs sound ab it alike, but if you get to know the lyrics you can appreciate them more.<br />The album starts out with &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; where the guys explode onto the scene with a raging rock number.  &quot;Taste Of Ink&quot; Is the reason why I first listened to these guys, its a pop-punk type song with really cool vocals and a super catchy riff, but the chorus still allows for some hardcore sound.  My fave song on the album by far.  &quot;Bulimic&quot; is more emocore, but has a really good guitar riff and is basically a &quot;GOODBYE&quot; song in a rash way.<br />For the album &quot;Say Days Ago&quot; is a bit different as its more screamo-style, but it kinda reminds me of the coast with the guitar work, like almost ska-inspired.  In a huge contrast is the track &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot; which almost comes off as work of poetry, filled with emotion and nice sounds and that really all make sense.  Note the little parisian sample played throughout. &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot; is another one of the rockish tracks but it doesn't stand out aht much to me, altho it does vary greatly throughotu from a strong beginning to a mellower verse (Similar to Abandoned Pools) and going into an angsty chorus, much like &quot;The Taste Of Ink&quot;.<br />&quot;A Box Full Of Sharp Objects&quot; has a Hoobstank-esque riff throughout and is just a rock track basically.  &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot; relives the mellow sound again, but this time its a little bit more uptempo with piano backings and a dreamy-sound-effects voice for most of it.  It just kinda flows nicely.  &quot;Greener With Scenery&quot; is kind've Incubus inspired, with a nice challenging guitar part throughout but again they rock out here and there, not before employing a string orchestra to play throughout.  I really like &quot;Noise and Kisses&quot; because its similar to track two, with good vocals you can make out, and a catchy feel over all.<br />&quot;On My Own&quot; is the softest track on the album and a nice moprh for the band to showcase their skills.  Acoustic guitar, sweet lyrics, and soft vocals make this a song worthy of Chris Carrabba (Can't spell his last name).  In sharp contrast, &quot;Pieces Mended&quot; just rocks out for one last time more or less before the rockin' finale hidden track &quot;Choke Me&quot;<br />Overall the Used display a number of styles on this album all within the emo/punk/rock genre, and the screeching of the lead singer isn't particularly bad, it adds to the unique style htis band possesses.  I'd reccommend it for a few songs, but maybe not the whole album is my thing.
B00008LDPU|4.0|Though not a fan of anime, I felt this DVD contained some amazing quality and well written shorts relating to the Matrix movies. I enjoyed all of them, though a few stood out from the rest. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the Matrix, technology, or computer animation in general.<br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the shortness of the DVD. I felt it could've used more content to watch.
B000002NHN|5.0|I bought this album 6 years ago, and still listen to it (at least) every other day!  I also have &quot;Mask and Mirror&quot;, &quot;Visit&quot;, &quot;Parallel Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Elemental&quot;.  I can say with true honesty; I'll never tire of Loreena Mckennit!<br />Between Loreena Mckennit and Stevie Nicks, I don't know which has gotten me through more days: be it happy or sad!
B0000508U6|5.0|I heard of Coldplay through the song 'Yellow'. It was very popular at the time of its release and my friends and I always enjoyed saying, '...and it was all yelloooow'. I never really thought much of it until a few months after their 2nd cd was released in 2002. After buying and listening to that cd, I knew I had to own this one as well. Coldplay is my favorite band. Somehow they find a way to express feelings that I thought were inexpressable, through their music and their lyrics. The feeling that they generate is truly beautiful, and in a world where music is full of swearing and hate, Coldplay reminds us that there's still hope and 'Everything's Not Lost'. Now for my ratings for the songs:<br />1. Don't Panic (5/5): What a great way to start off the album. Even though this song is somewhat short, it's still very good.<br />2. Shiver (5/5): Probably my favorite song on the album. The music and the lyrics are wonderful, and seeing as how many people have gone through what this song talks about, it's easy to relate to as well.<br />3. Spies (5/5): Somewhat haunting, but still beautiful.<br />4. Sparks (4/5): A slow song, very good.<br />5. Yellow (4/5): A wonderful love song. After finally paying attention to what the lyrics say, I have to say this is quite a marvelous song.<br />6. Trouble (5/5): Another great song, it's upbeat, but not too upbeat. The lyrics are also really great...'If I ever caused you trouble, I never meant to do you wrong.'<br />7. Parachutes (3/5): This one is somewhat harder to judge seeing as how it's only about 30 seconds long. Even though it's short it's still a nice addition to the album.<br />8. High Speed (4/5): Another good song. Not too slow or too fast.<br />9. We Never Change (5/5): A very beautiful song. IMO the lyrics are talking about how people want to change the way they act and be kind to othes, but sometimes they still go back to the way they were.<br />10. Everything's Not Lost (5/5): A great way to end the cd and prepare usfor their sophomore album (A Rush of Blood to the Head). (Also, don't turn off your cd player after the song ends...a few seconds later another song plays called Life is for Living, which is about 30 seconds long, but still good.)<br />Overall, Coldplay's Parachutes is one of the best albums in a long time. But, as great as this cd is, Coldplay's 2nd album, 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is even better. Pick up this cd! You won't regret it!
B000002TQV|5.0|This album was a true quantum leap over &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, and for my money, stands side by side with &quot;Ok Computer&quot; as their best work - it's an impossible choice for me:  both albums are desert island discs.  &quot;The Bends&quot; is simply fantastic from start to finish.  John Leckie's production is gleaming and wide open, and suits the material perfectly.  Though all the tracks are terrific, my favorites would have to be &quot;Planet Telex&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Bulletproof (I Wish I Was)&quot;, &quot;Black Star&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit&quot;.  If you don't own this already, what are you waiting for?
B000003C2U|5.0|My favorite Death album...this one bridges the gap between the old school brutality of the first 3 records, and the progressive- ness of later albums like Individual Thought Patterns and Symbolic...to me this was always the heaviest Death record, and it also has the most technical stuff you'll hear from Death, aside from a few beautiful odd time passages on &quot;The Sound of Perserverance&quot;...Chuck's vocals are on point, the riffs are catchy yet brutal, the solos are amazing and performed flawlessly, the bass parts are really creative thanks to  fretless work by Steve DiGiorgio...the drum work is EXCELLENT, performed by CYNIC drummer Steve Reinhart..he was the first Death drummer to incorporate alot of complex ride cymbal/hi hat tricks, and alot of overall skill and technical mastery..some have accused this drummer and later drummer Gene Hogan of overplaying, but i really think the drumwork adds alot to the music, making it more complete...high lite tracks are Flattening of Emotions, Suicide Machine, Together as One , and Lack of Comprehension...........BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU WANT METAL AT ITS BEST.......RIP CHUCK SCHULDINER, THROUGH DEATH YOU LIVE
B00005RHGK|1.0|I rented this based on a few reviews I'd read (&quot;best horror of the last 10 years&quot; sticks in my mind) and was sitting down, eagerly anticipating a 90-minute scare-fest.  What I got was a guy who looked like Barbra Streisand's son, and a girl who looked like her daughter, and both of whom acted like Madonna's less talented siblings.<br />Other reviews I'd read talked about suspense, building of atmosphere, style over schlock.  No.  What you get is implausibility after another, quickly followed by cliche upon cliche.  To wit, we have a typical bro-sis relationship that allows them to have arguments while stuff goes on unnoticed in the background; an ancient car that you know just won't start when it's needed to; a mobile phone whose battery has run down; a sleepy backward town where the residents don't believe our 'heros'; ineffective unbelieving police; a black soothsayer who can perhaps predict what will happen (hm, why?!), all of this topped off by absolutely dreadful dialogue, delivered with the expertise of a 5-year-old in a nativity play.<br />I think the reviewers were mistaking suspense for annoyance, atmosphere for dismay, and style for... I don't know what. This is just one truly bad film, replete with self-knowing 'post-modernist' lines (&quot;this is the part in scary movies where the audience are thinking don't do that&quot; - or something to that effect).<br />This is the part of the review where the writer is urging you not to get this!  Trust me, you'll be wanting to throw things at the TV, so annoying is the film!
B000059XUO|5.0|Brandon Lee was great in this movie much like he was in every thing else he did this movie just show's how big of a genus this guy was i loved every scene, this is one of those type's of movies you just don't  watch once but you want to watch over and over again geat story about love and Revenge
0451191153|5.0|A lot of people who die hard \\"collective responsibility\\" types are threatened by Rand's ideas in her masterwork The Fountainhead.<br />Some fools actually are naive enough to believe Ayn Rand would have been a fan of America's new batch of hard right conservative commentators and talk radio and TV news pundits.  Are you guys high?  Here's a quote from Ayn on an old Donahue interview, \\"I'm not a conservative, today's conservatives are worse than today's liberals\\".  Amen.<br />Howard Roark is the ultimate individualist.  Strong, content, creative, very much alive, and with a deep love for his flawed America.  The latter trait is something that eternally baffles the majority of the collectivists.  Many of them passionately despise America and can't tolerate anyone who believes otherwise.<br />The book seems to have a love affair with the way the world was before FDR's Great Society programs and his skyrocketing of American tax rates.  A time where you had to sink or swim on your own merits without government help.  And if you sunk it was your responsibility and your alone to get back up again.  There's a certain appeal in this.  The tough individualist, living under a bare bones government, no government programs, having a government flat tax where everybody pays the same, etcetera, where government doesn't interfere in your pocketbook or your private life.  But, sadly, many who espouse this view such as the Christian Reich are simply a kindler, gentler version of the Taliban.  Ayn Rand would point out that today's conservatives are all in favor of big government programs such as faith based initatives, idiotic government witch hunts to root out homosexuals in the Armed Forces, tell people who they can sleep with, what movies they can see, what books they can read, what music they can listen to, what drugs they can put in their body, and on and on.<br />But I digress.  The Fountainhead is marvelous book.  I liked Atlas Shrugged but found it about 200 pages too long, John Galt also needed more characterization.  But check out the Fountainhead, it isn't perfect, but it's close!
B00008MZ0N|5.0|This movie has all you want in a great flick action, good acting,hot women, nice looking and fast cars a must have for any car lover it show's the danger of illeagle street racing and what there willing to bet to keep it all and to be the best
B000002J09|2.0|Here we go again, folks. Another overhyped, overrated effort from the most overhyped, overrated band in rock history. Don't get me wrong. I LIKE some of Led Zeppelin's stuff. I said SOME. Because I like SOME of it I don't blindly assume that every piece of garbage they throw out there is great or blindly worship the ground they walk upon. I am OBJECTIVE. And being objective, there are two great songs on this album: 'Stairway to Heaven' and 'When the Levy Breaks'. 'Rock and Roll' is also quite good but doesn't quite hit the mark of 'classic' status. As for the rest of this, well, we have 3 nondescript ballads which are virtually indistinguishable from each other: 'Battle of Evermore', 'Going to California', and 'Four Sticks'. The problem is these songs aren't catchy and therefore you get confused as to which song title goes with which song as boredom settles in. 'Black Dog' is a monotonous, machine-shop-like grinder with goofy lyrics. 'Misty Mountain Hop' is another one of those mediocre sludgy plodders which seem to be a Led Zeppelin trademark, which sounds like it took about 2 minutes to cook up. So there you have it. If you wanted to have a good Led Zeppelin collection, you would have to get Led Zeppelin I and II and then pick and choose the best 2 or 3 or 4 songs from each of the remaining albums in order to compile a good collection. That's how great a perecentage of their material after Led Zeppelin I and II is simply filler material or worse.
B00000I924|4.0|Jeff Beck has now released his trilogy of techno-rock albums (&quot;Who Else&quot;, &quot;You Had It Coming&quot;, and the new &quot;JEFF&quot;) and while Who Else is a good album, it is probably my least favorite of the three. Still, this is worth a buy as all of Beck's releases are (excepting &quot;Flash&quot;). &quot;What Mamma Said&quot; is a killer opener and it has a great opening riff played by midi-guitarist/guitarist Jennifer Batten, who is Jeff's main foil on this album. &quot;Psycho Sam&quot; sounds very much likes its name... however the first real treat on this album comes from the excellent &quot;Brush With the Blues.&quot; The solo is aggressive, yet tasteful; technical, yet emotional as well. It was recorded live, which is why it is probably one of the better tracks on this album. The other live track is &quot;Space For the Papa,&quot; which contains tasty slide work by Beck. However the real slide work comes in for the beautiful &quot;Angel (Footsteps),&quot; which is an emotional highlight of Who Else. The other is &quot;Declan,&quot; a beautiful cover of an Irish song, where Beck really lets his guitar sing. <br />Overall this recording is worth buying. The guitar playing is fantastic as usual, and Beck strays away from boring rock clichés.
B00006IUL6|5.0|The opening helicopter shots descending into a Northern winter-wonderland are the only authentic pictures of &quot;Alaska&quot; in 2002's &quot;Insomnia&quot;. No matter. You can leave reality at the door...Filmed in British Columbia(the glacier shots are spectacular), &quot;Insomnia&quot; is a brutal, un-relenting, psychological expose of one man's collapse into hell. Of course, he finds the greatest source of his pain resides within his very own mind. Al Pacino(at age 62) and Robin Williams(nicely underplayed) are exceptional in this American re-make of the recent European hit. The slippery-slope failure's of L.A. Det.Dormer are disected with precision by a great director, and perhaps the master actor of our time, the worldly Pacino. This excellent DVD includes a sit-down with Pacino himself...your eyes will not turn away...Lack of sleep and criminal neglect cause our valiant officer to step-over-the-line. His panic is real. What should he do? Try to rest? The Robin Williams tag-line says it all...&quot;Don't worry Will. You can sleep when you're dead.&quot;
B000058T5E|5.0|&quot;You Had It Coming&quot; is in a strange spot. It is after the comeback of &quot;Who Else!&quot;, yet before the amazing &quot;JEFF.&quot; Jeff Beck is also the only real musician here; the rest of the spectrum is filled with loops and programmed instruments. Don't let that throw you off though... Beck does it right. The emotional quality is not lost in all the loops and patches, as Jeff's guitar work is just as aggressive and fiery as before, while not losing the emotional and singing content of the playing that has always been on Jeff's recordings. <br />There are a few standouts of this recording such as the rocking &quot;Roy's Toy&quot; and &quot;Left Hook.&quot; There is also the haunting &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Suspension.&quot; Even more beautiful, though, is &quot;Nadia,&quot; which many consider to be one of Beck's finest tracks, and I agree. It is emotional and exciting with an amazing melody. It is definitely the highlight of this recording. However, perhaps the most exciting thing on YHIC is Jeff jamming with a bird outside his house, something which no one has done before. <br />Many cannot get past the computers on this album, and that's fine. But those who realize it for what it is know that no Jeff Beck fan should go without this recording.
0198534469|1.0|I bought this book in conjuction with a class on complex mathematics I took at a university.  Within two classes I had abandoned all hope of actually learning something and by another class I decided to drop the course entirely.<BR>The book presents fundamental ideas of complex analysis in a quick and esoteric manner.  There is no proving of a single statement in the book.  Mathematics to me has always been about what you can PROVE (for those who think otherwise, consider that it made front page news when Fermat's theorem was nearly proven albeit in hyperbolic space).<BR>I am not a connoisseur of math books, but it would appear from other ratings that Needham has perhaps written other books of value.  However, this has no bearing on the incredibly poor nature of this book.<BR>Unless you have a deep background in complex math or wish to be completely baffled, avoid this book at all costs.<BR>As for my copy, I would be more than willing to part with it for a 50 cent soda.
B00008HCCF|2.0|I really liked Norah Jones's CD so I purchased the DVD.  During the concert Norah did not smile often, had little connection with the audience, had virtually no chit-chat or humor.  In other words, the DVD lacks excitement and vitality.  A review in the Star Tribune of her recent Minneapolis concert made similar comments.  I chose to not purchase tickets to this concert because of the DVD.
B00005JLXE|2.0|I originally expected more from the movie &quot;Daredevil&quot;, but as I watched it I realized that this film was an attempt to cash in on the comic-book-becomes-a-movie craze. I will admit that there are some moments in the film that were pretty good, like the fight sequences between Affleck's and Garner's characters. Other than that, I didn't really find the movie all that interesting.<br />The ubiquitous Colin Farrell gives an odd performance as Bullseye, a killer who never misses his mark. After a while I became a little annoyed with his character's fidgeting. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and just tell him to be still! I also was not impressed by Michael Clarke Duncan's performace as Kingpin. Duncan usually always gives a great performance in his other work, but it seemed as though he was merely cast in this film because of his size and the fact that he can be scary just by taking off his jacket. Ben Affleck gave a sympathetic performance as Murdock/Daredevil, but most of the time he seemed mostly wooden.<br />All in all, I would suggest this film to comic book buffs who like a good dose of action from their favorite stories. All others can skip this one.
0553266306|5.0|I've finally got around to reading this acclaimed novel. It's regarded as Forsyth's best book, some even say it's the best spy novel ever written. I've read five of his novels and think that the only one of his books that comes close is \\"The Fist of God\\" or maybe \\"The Devil's Alternative\\".<br />Some say that reading spy/thriller novels is a waste of time because you already know what's going to happen in the end. Even though one knows the outcomes of spy/thrillers they are not a waste of time because we read these books mostly for seeing how events unfold and come together in a unique way. This particular book is very well known and even many who haven't read it already know what's going to happen in the end. I saw the movie numerous times before reading this novel and still couldn't seem to put it down. I was constantly asking myself questions like \\"how will he get out of this one?\\", \\"when will such and such happen?\\".<br />Another thing which impressed me about this novel is the realism. This is what separates Forsyth from other authors. The assassin in this story is somewhat of a superman, but believeable. All of the other characters and events are also realistic. Forsyth never does things like give people ten PhDs or other absurdities.
0880389052|5.0|I went into reading homeland, rather new to the forgotten realms. the only ever book i have read by RA Salvatore was the Thousand Orcs, a magnificent story. Therefore i had litte prior knoweledge to the DE trilogy's drizzt do' urden character. I bought homeland thinking to learn of one of fantasy's &quot;greatest characters&quot; And that i did. Homeland was an AWESOME book, i'll admit, the beginning wasnt the best, but about 7 chapters in, i couldnt put this book down.<BR> Drizzt's story is excellently portraid, whether it was as a child trying to learn to levitate, or a student learning the blade, Salvatore did an EXCELLENT job portraying the cruelty of Drizzts kin and the humanistic qualities of drizzt. Often times i felt pity for Drizzt in the story,the things this character went through emotionally were..just..wow..<BR> Anyone Interested in fantasy, if you've just read LOTR and want to see what its all about, go to your library and read this story, a very good read.
B00005B36H|5.0|The first full-lenghth album for Tool in five years since Tool's 1996 release of Aenema, you should buy this CD if you don't have it! I have three of their albums), there great! Wonder when they will release a new one?
B00009UW0N|4.0|I am not sure what all the whining about the &quot;color hues&quot; is  about, but the picture is sharp with little, if any artifacting.  An excellent picture!  My only gripe is it would have been nice to have the TV footage as well.  The extras are great with new info.  It is a great supplement to my 1999 double disk from AnchorBay, with a better picture.
0808581945|5.0|\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" by Anthony Burgess is in that special class of 20th century literature that effectively and powerfully exists both in its own world of (science?) ficition and the very real world of the the reader.<br />The film, also a powerful work of art, should not dissuade anyone from reading this book.  In fact, if you've seen the film, you owe it to yourself to read the book and explore the themes and arguments further.  Additionally, the book contains a final chapter, not originally available to american readers, that, by its very dissonance with the film, should make anyone interested in either the film or the subject of criminal justice rush to finish the novel.<br />Finally, the nadsat - the mixture of russian and british slang that Alex speaks in - is almost reason enough to read the book for purely aesthetic reasons.  Through nadsat and the careful use of language Burgess creates one of the most affecting, troubling and tangible worlds in 20th century fiction.
B000066NW0|2.0|When I first heard skater boy, I thought &quot;this is a cool pop song&quot;.  Then people were like &quot;oh avril is so punk&quot;. No way! She cant play the guitar well, she thinks that she is a punk,when in reality she doesnt know a thing about it!  And before she even became famous, she was a prep.  She just wanted people to think she was unique and cool.  She cant write a decent song.  So, I suggest not buying this cd because it has like two good songs on it, which you could easily download.  Dont waste your money on this cd, you will regret it.
B000002G87|5.0|I'm keeping this review short and sweet, and even then, I wouldn't be telling you anything that you don't already know!  Eric Clapton and Duane Allman being paired together was destined to create magic, and this is about as magical as it gets!  Rather than competing with each other and turning the proceedings into a clash of egos, Clapton and Allman brought out the absolute best in each other with their playing, and the results are nothing short of stunning.  There is enough passion and fire contained in this CD to heat up a small town for a month!<br />If you've been living under a rock for the past 33 years and don't own this classic album, BUY IT NOW!
0736041850|5.0|I am so glad to have this book in my library.  This book doesn't really go into any detail on the proper form of exercises, but the anatomy diagrams are practically flawless.  This book helped me identify the areas where I'm lacking and which exercises I should start to improve those areas to balance out my physique.  I'm no fitness pro, but I would recommend this book to anyone who passionately wants to build a better body.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This series of movies is one of the best at following the spirit of the books. Even though the books are not followed word for word, there is nothing that doesn't work in the movie. There's nothing that leaves you wondering \\"How does that fit with Lord of The Rings?\\". The extended dvd is good too. I have the first one and have already preordered the second. The extended version lets you get a fuller story through extra footage that is added back into the movie. Plus you also get interviews with the cast, director, etc. I would recommend watching the movies in order though or it will not make much sense. Particularly \\"The Two Towers\\" since it doesn't really have a beginning or an end.
B00005QGAV|5.0|NOTE: This review is intended for those without a Jacksonian pre-disposition!  That said, is \\"Dangerous\\" a stand-alone good album?  Most definately - the versatility Michael Jackson demonstrates throughout this album makes it more intriguing, and arguably more listenable than even \\"Thriller.\\"  \\"In the Closet,\\" is funky, bump n' grind sexual frustration.  \\"She Drives Me Wild,\\" is just a bright, bubbly, feel-good song about the hot girl.  \\"Remember the Time,\\" is what R&B should be today. \\"Who Is It\\" is smooth and brooding, if slightly over-performed at times on Jackson's part, while \\"Black & White\\" was built for radio - you can take that as a compliment or criticism.  \\"Give in to Me\\" stands in stark contrast to the feel-good pop of \\"Black & White,\\" with Jackson virtually screaming his tormented-soul lyrics over Slash's raging guitar.  \\"Keep the Faith,\\" is an unsung gem of the album, an uplifting rock-gospel song complete with a fervid vocals on Jackson's part and a choir to accompany him.  Last, but not least is \\"Dangerous,\\" put, oddly enough, at the end of the album, after four songs of healing the world, going to soon, etc.  \\"Dangerous\\" leaves the audience feeling much like \\"Smooth Criminal\\" left them feeling at the end of \\"BAD.\\"  Not so much like an album's coming to an end, but as if something new is beginning . . .
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've always been a fan of Christina's and this album surpassed all of my expectations for her second CD. (I'm not counting her Spanish / Christmas albums.) \\"Stripped\\" includes many different genres, so there's something for everyone, and every song is something original and obviously from her heart, ie the gut-wrenching \\"I'm Okay.\\" Although I do think that there is one too many inspirational songs, they really *are* inspirational, and that's saying something. Christina is an amazing artist, and if people would stop criticizing how she dresses and focus more on her craft, maybe she would get the acclaim that she deserves.
B00005QGAX|4.0|&quot;Billie Jean&quot; is to &quot;Thriller,&quot; as &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is to &quot;BAD.&quot;  I've heard the song at least 700 times throughout my life, and I still get worked up when I hear the that line &quot;Annie are you ok?&quot; The melody, the bass line, the percussion - it's insanely slick. . . The rest of the album is good - it does, however, lack the timeless feel of &quot;Thriller,&quot; or perhaps &quot;Off the Wall.&quot;  In my opinion, this isn't so much the result of lesser quality song-writing, as it is the result of the instruments used in the songs.  But who knew synths, staccato keyboard basses, etc., would go out of style? ;). None the less, if you don't dislike the 80s, this is great album of easily listenable pop music.
0060537639|4.0|I accept the basis hypothesis the Ming voyagers circumvented the globe; charted their findings; and European explorers used these as the basis of their own adventures.<br />The Ming voyagers were not sailing totally in the dark.  They knew of the existence of the Americas from Chinese chronicles.  China had explored the Americas from the Pacific eight centuries earlier.  Such is detailed in Henriette Mertz' &quot;Pale Ink.&quot;<br />China was never in any Dark Age.  The Middle Kingdom viewed itself as the center of the UNIVERSE!  China was as technologically, militarily, and economically powerful for most of history (and especially in the days of early European conquest) as is the United States today.  But, maybe even more so.<br />The riches Europe found in the Americas was not as a result of trade.  It was a result of plunder and enslavement.  The original goal of European conquest was to acquire the treasures of the Orient.  China already had them.  So from that, China did not necessarily withdraw.<br />Portugal actually originally attempted to take China by force.  China crushed the Portugese invasion.  It was not until the Opium Wars the West was able to militarily defeat China.<br />China possessed the wherewithall to accomplish the task and probably did.
B000069AUI|5.0|I became intrigued with Coldplay after reading many reviews and articles hailing them as the best British Band and the greatest band in the world.  However, I couldn't remember hearing any of their songs so I didn't have an idea of what their sounds was like.  I'm kinda particular about my rock--I am an r&b/hip hop fan at heart, but appreciate slower, pensive rock with acoustic guitars and soft piano melodies.  I saw Coldplay's performance at the Grammy's and my curiousity was piqued even more and I considered buying their cd then, but it was another performance by John Mayer that sent me speeding to Tower Records the next day.<br />Finally, about 2 weeks ago, I sat through the whole video of Clocks on VHI and realized that I needed to stop procrastinating and buy this cd.  Of course I had heard Clocks before and loved the melody, I just wasn't compelled to own it until then.  Buying the cd last week has truly been the best investment I have made this summer, on anything.  I know that I will listen to this cd FOREVER.  It took me about 3 days of listening to it before I was able to identify its individual song melodies, instrumentation, and little nuances that make you fall in love with a particular song.  My favorite track has to be Politik, especially the final 2/3 when it gets softer and Chris pleads, \\"Give me love over, love over this\\"  I also love \\"The Scientist\\", all praises heaped upon that song are justified, as are Warning Sign, and the title track.  In My Place and of course, Clocks round out my favorites.  That's 7 out of 11, well worth the [money] I paid for it, but the investment of being able to be transported into the mood that these songs evoke, every time I listen to them is priceless.  I know that listening to it as the months progress will remind me of this lazy but troubled summer I've had, and how I was able to cope with the music of Coldplay.  Excellent music from excellent musicians.  I am a fan for life now.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Klaus Badlet did an excellent job on this soundtrack!  And I was pleasantly surprised to see that Hans Zimmer overproduced the score.  Zimmer is a fantastic composer!  The only thing that I was somewhat disappointed about was the fact that they did not include \\"Yo-Ho...A Pirate's Life for Me.\\"  But it is understandable, since the soundtrack is more so for adults! However, Badlet and Zimmer's work exceeded my expectations!  Excellent job!!!
B00006M183|5.0|I must have no taste of music what so ever. Most review I read states Ten and VS to be PJ's best. All reject Binaural. I prefer Binaural over VS, easily.<BR>And now, almost a year after its release, I write about Riot Act. I bought it when it just came out, so, why wait so long?<BR>Well, I have no taste of music. I don't know what a good album is, or a bad one. So I just waited. Played a lot of records in the meantime. And playing Riot Act, over and over again.<br />Of course, not all songs are equally great. I don't like Busleaguer, for instance. But when Eddie sings the opening tune of Love Boat Captain, mumbles 'I'm just walking the miles...' in Thumbing my Way or assures us 'We're safe tonight' in I'm Mine, there's one thing I do know: I'll always prefer this over any so claimed 'Taste of Music'.
B00006J9OT|4.0|NEWSFLASH - THIS CD WILL NOT RIP CLEANLY TO MP3 and YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE YOURSELF A BACKUP COPY.  (Which means, for me anyway, that this CD will never leave the house and will not be loaned out.)<br />As for the music, I'll simply say that it's as beautiful as she is!  I wasn't entirely pleased with the difference in the track list between this CD and her live DVD, (supposedly from the same show), otherwise I would have only bought the DVD - this CD, however, has a rendition of &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; that I had to have.
0783225857|5.0|I don't really feel the need to review \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" The editorial review and the opinion of the American Film Institute should say enough about the superiority of this work. Every actor gives a flawless performance. Atticus Finch is Gregory Peck's finest roll and his performance lives up to character. All the children are simply amazing. One performance that seems to get virtually no attention in reviews is Collin Wilcox Paxton as Mayella Violet Ewell. Ms. Paxton draws together an astounding collection of emotions and releases them in one to the most intense and frightening performances I have seen in any film. I remember seeing the film as a pre-teen (when it was new), and Ms. Paxton's anguished, screaming face is the image that is most vividly burned in my memory. She scared the bejeezers out of me. <br />There simply can be no reasonable rating less than 5 stars for this flawless classic. So I was curious to find out why some people would give it less!?! I scanned through all the reviews and found only a handful who, I feel, had legitimate reasons for giving 4 stars because they felt the DVD transfer was flawed. <br />I was amazed to find other reasons. Several school kids who had been forced to watch (and read) \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" who thought it was boring. Perhaps this says something about our schools, no? And maybe it says more about television.<br />Some people were upset because it was not in color. They were unable to get over their disappointment and see the movie as it is. It was made in black and white at a time when Technicolor ruled the screen. There is clearly a very specific artistic reason Robert Mulligan chose black and white. He made the right choice. The sense of the dusty, dry, poor depression era is beautifully reinforced by the black and white presentation. <br />But the most amazing review was one person that said \\"Racism still serves a purpose...\\"!! Wow! I guess there are still Bob Ewells among us! <br />\\"Too Kill a Mockingbird\\" is without doubt one of the finest examples of American filmmaking. Anybody (particularly any American) who can appreciate the finer things in life, and has any sensitivity to the complexities of human society, should watch this film. And it stands up well to repeat viewing, as does any truly classic work of great art.
B00005JLTN|4.0|I've read some of the complaints about this movie and I must say that I wholeheartedly agree.  And I wholeheartedly disagree.<br />I saw this movie twice; the first time I didn't like it and the second time I did.  Since then I've had lots of time to think about it and try to understand it.<br />I'd like to address the first part of the movie, specifically Morpheus' speech and the resulting mob dance/love scene.  The first time I saw the movie I thought it was absolutely ridiculous.  I tried to enjoy it, but the only thing that popped into my mind was an image of two ...filmmakers from Chicago snickering like little schoolboys as they huddled behind the camera during the filming of the scene.  By all accounts it was at best unnecessary and at worst one of the most awkward and uncomfortable-to-watch love scenes I've ever seen.<br />And then there's Morpheus' speech.  How bland!  How cartoonish!  I'm a huge Matrix fan, but even my enthusiasm for the movie, along with my sincerest attempt to get caught up in the moment, could not enable me to get energized by it.  Not even a little.  I certainly didn't feel like getting up and dancing like the rest of the crowd obviously did.  And my life wasn't even in danger.  Theirs were!<br />The second time I watched the movie I still didn't really care for it, although I was better able to ignore it and wait patiently for the parts that I did like.<br />It wasn't until last night when I read some of the reviews that I realized that there was actually a point to all this silliness.  However, the point is lost on someone who is watching the movie for the first time.  To really appreciate this section of the movie, you must know the whole story.  ...<br />By the way, the only reason why I gave this movie four stars instead of five was because I thought the flow suffered a little due to the blending of the storyline of the movie with the game \\"Enter the Matrix\\".  Some parts that are skimmed over in the movie are shown in more depth in the game.  The idea was interesting, but I believe that the movie could have been better if they hadn't chopped it up and divided some of the scenes between the movie and the game.  Since they won't be trying this with the third movie, I have a feeling that it will be much more streamlined and smooth like the first movie.
0393057658|5.0|Obivously, as a baseball fan, this is required reading for anyone wondering about how things work behind the scenes.  We get interesting portraits of Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford, players who every other team thought were worthless, but are helping the A's win games.  Additionally, it will be interesting to see how Jeremy Brown and the other draft picks discussed in the book pan out in the future.  Throwing money at big name ballplayers is not a surefire way to win ball games (as Texas, the Mets and countless other teams know).  People have been doing things in baseball for so long that it's hard for some to do it any other way.  Hopefully, this book will inspire other teams to spend their money more wisely, which might revive the average fan's interest in a sport that is wildly unfair.  As a teacher, I think Billy Beane's reexamination of how things are done could also help school districts as well.  In times of great financial hardship, school districts should really EXAMINE what they spend their money on.  Like the Oakland A's, they could get more bang for their buck if they learned to think in different ways.
B00008977N|1.0|No excuses. I own a video facilities company and we made DVD as well. This DVD for reasons I can't understand is the worst quality I ever saw. It's simply too compressed.  It's not only &quot;little graininess here and there&quot;, it's not a&quot;television set's fault&quot;. It's the trasfer that is not done properly. Incredible from a production like this and an artist like him.<BR>Save your money and wait for the DVD of the new tour shooted in Milan this May....and let's hope they choose another company for the dvd compression..........
B000084T18|5.0|This album is an absolute must have. With the catchy beats and realistic street lyrics, this album is one of the best CDs I own. Most of the album is about 50 being shot, selling drugs, being in prison, and living on the streets. Giving you a glimpse into the life of a gangsta. Though most of the lyrics in this CD have been said before 50 makes them original with his street credibility. The overall best song on the CD is \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\" witch is a slower, darker song that talks him being shot and living life out on the streets. I don't recommend this CD to anyone whos does not like \\"Gangsta Rap\\". I would say 95% of this album is about the life of a gangsta. This album gives you incite on 50's life and his trials and tribulations. 50 Cent might not be a Tupac or Biggie yet, but just wait.
B0000029GA|5.0|I give this Album 5 stars because Of the Best Lyrics ever seen on any album. Now the Beats are not as good today as back then, but for back then the beats were pretty good, but put it like this, the beats are good and The lyrics are classical, Nas rips the tracks up in this album, If you want to get a classical album to show off your hip hop collection, pick it up right now, get out your seat and get it.
0380715430|3.0|Sadly I must concur with many fellow-reviewers: the numerous important errors that plague an otherwise worthwhile and entertaining book mean you can never be sure when to trust the author's assertions. Bryson's undoubted communicative flair has clearly enthused many lay-readers about language, and that is a heartening sign. His vigorous debunking of bogus so-called language pundits (Safire, Simon, et al.) is also to be welcomed (see Steven Pinker's 'Language Instinct' for an equally enjoyable slaying of the 'language mavens'). <BR>All this makes the book's flaws all the more exasperating and disappointing. They range from the trivial to the quite breath-taking - I won't list them all here, as other reviewers have already highlighted many of them (eg. The French can't distinguish between 'mind' and 'brain'... hmm, I hope he's used some of the proceeds from this book to invest in a French dictionary - and an Italian one, and Finnish...) <BR>What I will point out are the gaps in his grammatical understanding: I'm not talking about arcane, abstruse, pedantic points here, but the fundamentals of grammar, what it is, and how we use and describe it. Almost half an entire chapter (where he discusses the categorisation of words into various parts of speech, and verbs into tenses) can and should be junked. He seems to think the terms and concepts we use to categorise English grammar are absurd, constrictive and inappropriate, merely because they are greco-latin in origin. For example, he doesn't see the need for the dual categorisation of -ing words as both 'gerunds' and 'present participles'; but this redounds to his discredit, no-one else's. These terms merely describe a distinction that we all observe whether we're conscious of it or not. When we hear 'My favourite hobby is swimming' we automatically understand that this does not mean 'my favourite hobby is currently doing a length of the pool'. Likewise, we know that 'I am swimming' doesn't mean 'I am the very act of propelling oneself through a body of water'. <BR>The terms we use to describe grammar are precisely that - descriptive, not prescriptive, and have stood the test of time because they are versatile, adaptable, enable clear, precise thought and explanation when analysing linguistic constructions, and facilitate comparative study of different language structures. <BR>But Bryson's heart is in the right place, and if people who read this book are inspired to widen their language/linguistics-related reading, that can only be a good thing.<BR>Allow me to recommend a couple of other books as essential further reading:<BR>'The Language Instinct' Steven Pinker<BR>'The Power of Babel' John McWhorter <BR>Engaging, not to say captivating, works - ideal for the layperson but packed with real linguistic meat and serious scholarly endeavour nonetheless.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I have never seen a movie where a character was so dispicable in the beginning, yet without changing their behavior one bit, was admirable by the end of the movie. Lewis puts in that great of a performance.<br />Sure Diaz and DiCaprio don't add much to the movie, but Lewis steals every scene, so it does not matter.<br />The sets are tremendous, the music/sound is very well done, the recreation of locations mentioned in the book are so close to the author's description. The DVD extras are exceptional.<br />I don't understand all the criticism on this movie - New York was just a violent place back in this period in history.<br />Buy this, and watch it over and over.
B00003CXAA|5.0|What can you say that hasn't already been said? Classic films on dvd. In fact, Godfather and Godfather II are so good, they're on imdb.com's Top 10 list for best films of all time. III I'll get to in a minute.<br />The Godfather: The start of it and my personal favorite. Featuring superb acting on Marlon Brando's part and Al Pacino(watch when he accepts his role as the new leader, before he doesn't want anything to do with the mafia, next he's very cruel and cold). After Vito Corleone's daughter's wedding, there's an attempted hit on Vito but he lives. After exacting revenge, Michael gets drawn into the life of the mafia. A bit more brutal then it's sequel, to me this is the best. <br />The Godfather Part II: Kind of confusing and a bit long feeling, but if you're ever in an argument about good sequels, like the one in Scream 2, mention this. Lot of them will agree. This is a story seperated in 2: Michael's assassination attempt and him figuring out who ordered it and the trial his family has to do. Second is Vito Corleone(played extremely well by Robert De Niro, if you close your eyes in some scenes, you can swear you heard Marlon Brando talking) and his ascension as the Don of the Corleones. While not my favorite of the 3, it's a great watch.<br />The Godfather Part III: This, well, this is a mixed bag. The plot is rather jumpy and several characters aren't included, but having some good acting(especially on Al Pacino's part). The ending you'll think about long after you watch it. At the end, an attempt(again) on Michael fails but one does get killed: his daughter, Mary. His &quot;silent scream&quot; is rather heartbreaking to watch. I'm sure someone was so overwhelmed with grief and pain that you can't even say something. At the end, old Michael, all alone, collapses and dies in his chair, thinking of the women in his life and the mistakes he's made and his failed attempts to change them. Despite not saying one word, it's such a tragic ending.<br />Well Part IIIis flawed(I said flawed, it's not one of the worst movies to me) and II is confusing, this is the mob movie standard for which others will be judged
B00006690G|3.0|First, a general comment about all the negative reviews... they all seem to boil down to a couple of critiques (that he curses too much; that his beats aren't original) and a lot of nonsense, mostly fueled by envy, tiwsted reverse race issues, and an uncomfortable feeling people who consider themselves \\"underground\\" get when they discover that something they might like is being bought by every teenager in the suburban Wal mart... <br />As for the arguments that \\"he curses too much\\" or \\"his beats ain't original\\" ... don't make me laugh.  I dont know what you call hip hop but I for one haven't heard an original beat in hip hop since Run DMC covered \\"Walk this way\\"...  sampling is has become an artform in itself.. it has gotten so intense now days that I hear hiphop artists lifting beats from other hiphop artists... original beats my huevos.<BR>As for all that nasty cursing... uh... its not eminem.. its the genre... you dont like those naughty words, go buy Will Smith records.... take it from him, though, Parents just dont understand.<br />Now for the real review: this record is good.  The sound is all Dr. Dre... you either like Dre's productions or you are probably some resentful new york hiphop fan still nostalgic for the days when west coast was a quiet backwater and your pissed off that it took a handful of westcoast rappers to turn hiphop into a national business...  and all the old school newyorkers got left in the dust.  Whatever issues you have, though, fact is Dre is syynonymous with hip hop and he has been for the last 14 years and there's no denying that he is one of the best producers in the biz.. Even your beloved Tupak knew that.<br />But what really sets Eminem apart are two things:<BR>1) He is not afraid to turn his internal psychological struggles into song and<BR>2) unlike most fathers, he isn't a p***y or f***t enough to turn his back on his own child.<BR>The classic hiphop artist stance is to try to turn frontin' an art (witness how \\"bad\\" LL thoughthe was)  no hiphop artist had the huevos to admit any weakness... Eminem subverts all of that every time he talks about how disfunctional he is... that makes him more real, and more original, than 90% of the rappers out there.<BR>And as for parternity, Eazy E died of Aids and left a string of illegitimate kids in his wake... and I never heard him even admit to being a father in any song... now that is what I call a f*&^%t.  At least Eminem has the huevos to stand up and accept fatherhood... <BR>In sum, Dre sound, good rhymes, original writer, quite a few memorable rhymes.  Worth the money...
B00005JLXE|5.0|This is the best hero movie since the first two Batman films. There is nothing lolly-pop about it. The hero has problems, some of which the movie only hinted at. And Evanescence's singer Amy Lee's voice matches the dark tone perfectly. Can't wait for the next one, and for the spin off &quot;Electra&quot;
0140186409|5.0|Must read!  Wonderful descriptions and character development.  One of my top favorites.
B000002KDO|5.0|I htink it's too bad that this album is constantly stuck in the shadow of paranoid and their self titled album. Although they were great this album was way ahead of its time. Anyone who likes metal has to own this album or at least know all of the songs on it because if it weren't for &quot;after forever&quot; and &quot;lord of this world&quot; metal wouldn't exist. I think due to ozzy osbourne's stardom people often forget that bill geezer and tony are what make black sabbath great. Ozzy is just the icing on the cake, and this album proves that.
0312117337|5.0|The illustration in each card of this tarot deck is so expressive and well made that for the most of the time, all I need to do is to pick a card and pay close attention to its drawings. Not enough, the book that comes with it has great words of wisdom, and it gave me the most experience in interpretating each card. The set comes in a plastic box with the correct place for the cards and book. It looks pretty much like a VHS case with the cards and book organized inside. Also, the cards were made out of good material that make them last.<BR>A must have for those who want to get in touch with the 'real self'.
B0000029GA|3.0|This is a lyrically sound CD... Kinda like Liquid Swords.. Except gza actually has beats. Nas has no good beats in this whole album. Actually only two... NY State of Mind and Halftime but the lyrics are good and I like nas so I gave this outting a 3 star. Buy Stillmatic, it is much better and by far his best Cd in my opinion.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Just to clear things up since I have seen various references here, the 104 version is not the theatre version.  There are extra scenes that were done during Halloween 2 to fill in for missing scenes that were cut when Halloween was going to be put on t.v.  Not to say the extended version is not a good version, but the extra time and scenes do come at a price: you loose some of the original movie. This is the 25th anniversary of the original movie, not the sequals or any variations of the movie.  If this is bacially adding on to the release they did a few years back, then this will be the ultimate Halloween on dvd.
6303430570|3.0|I know this is suppose to be a great classic of Kevin Smith, but I was not impressed. Although this is the first of the &quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob/Kevin Smith Films&quot; it is probably my least favorite. I give this movie 3 stars because there wasn't anything I really disliked about it, however, there wasn't anything that I thought was really great about it. Although I did like how it was in black and white and it was a good concept.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's 3rd released album was not a dissapointment to me. When 'Reanimation' was released a while back, I got the idea Linkin Park would only have released one PERFECT CD through-out their music career, but was a I in for a surprise when &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; hit radios across the country. After hearing the chorus the first time ever, I fell in love with the song and knew there must be more amazing songs on the CD. After purchasing Meteora, I discovered every single track on the CD is pretty much listen-able. Among my favorites are &quot;Faint&quot; for it's amazing background music and style, &quot;Easier to Run&quot; for the vocals given out by Chester, &quot;Numb&quot; because its aura is awesome, and &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; because of it's chorus.<br />I'm not only reccomending Meteora because I'm a major rock and Linkin Park fan, but because the album itself is of high-quality and you can tell it took time to perfect the album. So if you're a fan, or just heard a song or two from it and enjoyed that, go out and get this CD!
B00009UW0N|5.0|Please don't let the picky whiners deter you from picking up this amazing set.  It has the sharpest and best picture quality of any previous release!  The &quot;concerns&quot; over some minor color differences have been WAY overblown!  Everyone who knows anything about this movie knows that it WASN'T shot in the fall...it is obvious regardless of which version you choose to view.  But what is better besides the sharp picture quality is the commentary and the extras that are included.  If you a call yourself a Halloween fan, don't be a fool...buy this NOW!
B000000WA4|5.0|People who gave Billy Corgan and the rest of the Smashing Pumpkins grief for trying to create a double album need to be shot...where they bleed to death slowly. This album(s) has got to be one of their best. It includes a wide variety of songs from the piano &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; and the mostly-string &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;...then there are the louder, angsty-sounding &quot;Zero&quot;,&quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot;, and &quot;An Ode to No One&quot;. These cds cover a whole range of styles of beautiful, mellow, and loud...but each song sings praises towards Billy's wonderful song writing and the overall talent of the band. If you've never heard the Pumpkins before, this is a definite winner you should start out with.
0425170349|4.0|I stopped reading Clancy after about his fourth or fifth book (all enjoyable reads) just for a break as I stopped reading Grisham after about the same number of good reads.  I got this for my birthday and was reluctant to read it......but after a severe quad muscle strain that left me imobilized for 4-5 weeks, I dove in!  Glad I did!  This is a long (900 pages) but outstanding page turner! Classic Clancy that goes after environmental nazis! And what they do to them in the end is a classic twist of the unexpected!  Get through the first 200-250 pages of introductions of characters, sub plots, and themes and away you go into the world of international terrorism, counterterrorism, technological equipment with cool applications, etc......a pot of gold awaits at the end of this rainbow!
B00005NTJK|5.0|In the vast Tull catalogue, this 1970 effort stands out as a neglected classic, coming as it did on the heels of the hugely successful Stand Up. Ian Anderson's songs were becoming more complex, and shifting away markedly from his early Blues influences. The maturity of his songwriting, and of the band's playing, are illustrated perfectly by the opening track &quot;With You There to Help Me&quot;, a broody and introspective piece that breaks out into a group tour de force. This album also welcomed keyboards player John Evan, who filled out the sound and freed guitarist Martin Barre to assume the leading instrumental role he has played in the group ever since. Listen to his slashing licks, dueling with Anderson's shrieking echoed flute, which climaxes this track. Magic.<br />Jethro Tull were touring heavily in the States at this time, accused of neglecting audiences back in the UK, and finding the darker side of the music business unpalatable. In the notes written for this reissue in 2001, Anderson talks of &quot;a growing cynicism&quot; and &quot;a sense of alienation&quot;. Ironically, it is such conditions that often bring out the best in songwriters, as they lock themselves away in anonymous hotel rooms, escaping the noise outside by drowning themselves in their music. Anderson was no different, resisting the American influences he felt were creeping into many fellow British bands. His flute had endowed Tull with a distinctly Celtic touch from the start, but he now gave full rein to this aspect on songs like &quot;Play In Time&quot;, which is a revved-up electric jig that would have given him plenty of opportunity to play the lunatic on stage. In a similar but quieter vein, &quot;Sossity, You're a Woman&quot; displays a strong folk flavour in Anderson's acoustic guitar playing. Bands like the Strawbs and Barclay James Harvest were to follow similar paths in the 70s.<br />Contrast this with &quot;Alive and Well and Living In&quot;, Anderson's flute and Evans' pianocombining to take the jazz and rock idioms into areas that were to be explored widely in the decade ahead. It's a strong pointer to the conceptual complexities of Thick As A Brick that were to come two years later.<br />&quot;Son&quot; is a more acidic view of the generation gap than, for example, the sentimental picture painted by Cat Stevens' &quot;Father and Son&quot; (&quot;If you're good, when you grow up, we will buy you a bike.&quot;). &quot;For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me&quot; will puzzle anyone born after the 1960s. Collins was the third man in the 1969 Apollo expedition to the moon. While Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got to go down to the surface and fool around, Collins had to stay behind and keep the orbiting mother ship in trim. It was a song that reflected Anderson's own previously stated sense of alienation (&quot;It's on my mind, I'm left behind when I should have been there, walking with you.&quot;). <br />&quot;To Cry You A Song&quot; and &quot;A Time For Everything&quot; were strong guitar-driven numbers which were precursors to the following album, Aqualung. &quot;Inside&quot;, Benefit's single, was arguably the band's last Blues-flavoured song, Anderson's flute motif producing a haunting air over Glenn Cornick's fluid bass lines (it was to be Cornick's last album with Tull). <br />Bonuses on this reissue include the classic singles, &quot;The Witch's Promise&quot; and &quot;Teacher&quot; - described as &quot;close cousins&quot; to Benefit by Anderson, having been recorded only weeks before the album. These stand out in my view as two of the finest musical tracks laid down at the end of the 1960s. The former again illustrates Tull's folk roots in an eerie tale of enchantment, while the latter is a hedonistic rock anthem (&quot;Jump up, look around, find yourself some fun&quot;) that I can recall making parties come alive as Anderson's fierce flute traded centre stage with Barre's guitar.<br />Radio DJs referred to this as &quot;underground&quot; music, and later it became &quot;progressive&quot;. Whatever the labels, it signalled the emergence of the album as a musical art form in its own right. What followed was a sharp contrast from the innocent-sounding 45s that cranked out of tinny speakers on the beach; this was music that made demands of the listener. You couldn't dance to it - at least not a dance that had a name. It heralded an era when musicians began to rule the studios, telling the fat cat producers to just twiddle the nobs and shut up, and challenging the industry to catch up with the creative flow that defied all the established rules. This music wanted you to listen seriously, and think about what it was saying.<br />Recorded on the cusp of a new decade, Benefit must now take its place as a watershed in the rock music idiom. What's more, it's worn surprisingly well.
B00005JLSE|3.0|Ok, so I went to see Chicago with the highest expectations. Everyone was telling me that it was the best musical and that it was better than Moulin Rouge (which I love) so I was expecting something mind boggling. Sorry to say, the movie didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe it was because I had such BIG expectations. <br />Don't get me wrong. I wasn't that I didn't enjoy it. I thought it was entertaining and I simply LOVED the music, in fact I bought the soundtrack. I enjoyed the humor and satire and it was a feel good movie. But I had a lot of problems with the movie and I didn't think that it was the best movie of the year.<br />I liked Zeta-Jones. Queen Latifah was hilarious and I love John C. Reilly. (HAve you noticed that he plays the exact same role in the Hours, Chicago and The Good Girl? Nice, kind, husband with suffering/unfulfilled wives?) I personally do not like Richard Gere and am thus prejudiced (At leat I admit it). He dances rather well (specially that one tap scene during the trial), but i just couldn't stand his voice. There was just something about it that sounded so childish. His voice didn't seem matured or developed. Catherine Zeta-Jones, though, can really dish it out. I love her voice. But Renee Zellweger? She just couldn't compete with Zeta-Jones. Zeta-Jones has this really rich, gorgeous voice and she just commands those dance numbers. Zellweger sounded like a high-pitched screech owl in comparison. Ok, so maybe I'm being a little harsh on Zellweger, but seriously, if your going to make a musical, give the lead to an actress that actually can sing or has experience for God's sake! She's really the reason why I couldn't enjoy this film. <br />And it just seemed so calculated. Chicago certainly \\"razzle dazzles\\" us with all the visual elements of Moulin Rouge (the bright lights and ostentatious, over-the-top costumes) and showcases a very popular cast, but the thing is, Chicago the movie is more about SHOW than SUBSTANCE. Why else would they hire Zellweger when they could probably have found a better qualified actress to play Roxie? Because Zellweger is a big name actress, fresh from her Oscar nomination in Bridgit Jones. Why Why else is Lucy Liu in this film for all of 2 minutes? Mya for like 5? Because this movie was all SHOW. It was as if the studio execs said \\"Hmm....in order to make our movie as popular as possible, let's gather up every big named actor we can think of...forget TALENT\\"<BR> <BR>I guess what I have to say is really best described by Billy Flynn, \\"Give 'em the old razzle dazzle/Razzle Dazzle 'em/Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it<BR>And the reaction will be passionate/Give 'em the old hocus pocus<BR>Bead and feather 'em/How can they see with sequins in their eyes?<BR>...Long as you keep 'em way off balance/How can they spot you got no talents?/Razzle dazzle 'em/And they'll make you a star!\\"<br />So, yes, I was entertained by all the \\"razzle\\" and \\"dazzle\\". I though Zeta-Jones was excellent. I liked the songs for the most part, yet I still came home dissapointed because, once again, it was all about show instead of substance.
0061020710|4.0|Overall, I think that Terry Pratchett's 'The Colour Of Magic' is a magnificent and imaginative masterpiece. I like the way in which Terry Pratchett has combined humour with seriousness, and how he has made me always want to read on. The storyline is told well, however, clarity of plot could have been focused on in more depth, as it is sometimes hard to concentrate and understand exactly what is going on. I give this book four stars, because I think that it is a great book, and I recommend it to anyone who likes humourous stories.
B00006SFBD|4.0|Opeth is band often referred to as &quot;Progressive Death Metal&quot;, which although somewhat accurate, is not completely true. Opeth has since their first album produced the most emotional and artistic music that I have ever heard. Whether you are a fan of death metal or not, all of Opeth's albums are moving and brilliantly orchestrated. Opeth's general style is to start of songs either with a soft melodic opening and switch fast into a rhythmic riff with distortion guitar and blast beats. Then somewhere in the middle of the song, it switches back to the soft acoustic interlude where the singer sings with strong emotion. During most of the heavy parts of the songs the singer does the infamous death vox growl that is so typical of most death metal. And a final note about Opeth is their song lengths. The typical Opeth song is about 10:00 long. <br />This album I found to be Opeth's worst. It is not a good place to start if you are choosing an album because it might turn you off them. I suggest Blackwater Park to start. Not to say that this album is terrible, it isn't, but Opeth has made better. I'd say my biggest complaint is that the songs just weren't as interesting. I liked the previous albums, such as Still Life, where the album told a story. There was a whole plot intertwined with the music, an emotional story told through the melodies and the lyrics. In this album, the lyrics are boring and not really creative, which surprised me. Generally Opeth's lyrics are poetic and beautiful, yet this time the way the lyrics were written gave me the impression of magnet poetry for the fridge. I hate to say that about a band as great as Opeth, but it is true. Don't buy this album first, you will appreciate it a lot more once you buy other Opeth albums. Once you have 2 albums, then this one will seem amazing too.
0962477060|2.0|This review is for people who already play, or are studying playing, who might be interested in sight reading, who are basically approaching the guitar as a serious musical instrument rather than a chord-drone device to sing over.<br /><br />This book is nothing new.  Nothing at all.  Did you know that any scale has a different fingering and form for each of its degrees?  If you know that (and come on, how you be a serious player and not at some point figure that out?) then you're way, way beyond this book.<br /><br />Still, this could be useful for absolute beginners, or chord-droners, or people that play in E or A and know a pentatonic box pattern or two - and that's a LOT of people who play with the guitar.<br /><br />But let's face it, everyone.  The guitar is one of the most difficult instruments out there, yet one of the easiest to just plug away on.  If the guitar were a foriegn language, then most people can say \\"Please\\", \\"Thank you\\", \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\".  The vast majority of these people can't actually speak the language, though.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, just the way it is.<br /><br />I don't mean to sound too harsh.  But there is NO good 'quick-fix' for ANY intrument.  Heck, if you like the instrument, why would you even WANT a quick-fix?  I can absolutely PROMISE that if you study theory and correct technique this book will quickly become virtually useless.<br /><br />I'm writing this because there might be some people looking at this who don't want such a casual approach, and their time would be better spent - and infinitely better rewarded - elsewhere.  Troy Stettina's scale book, for example, or Steve Khan's books, or \\"Advanced Modern Rock Improvizing\\" by John Finn.  Satriani's \\"Guitar Secrets\\" is another good one.  So is \\"Blues You Can Use\\".<br /><br />It just depends ultimately on how serious you plan on getting with the instrument, and how far you want to go.  It takes work, but that's half the fun.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Those who have read over many of the reviews for this album are most likely wondering if this truly is one of the \\"lesser\\" Radiohead albums recorded, of if it has simply been underrated or perhaps misunderstood by too many. After a thorough listening of this album, I believe the latter is true: Amnesiac is an amazing work, and one that has been grossly underrated and overlooked by many, including a lot of so-called Radiohead fans. <br />Amnesiac is not an album that is particularly welcoming to the casual or passive listener looking for a more traditional approach to alternative rock or electronic music. This is perhaps why many have not found it to be their taste. Instead it is better suited to the contemplate, to those who will listen with both ears and appreciate Radioheads approach to music. I find Amnesiac (like all Radiohead's works) is a breath of fresh air from much of the lightweight music that floods today's music industry. Here you may not find cute top 40 songs with catchy sing-along choruses, but you will find beautiful and original arrangements performed with soul and passion. <br />One of the things I find appealing about Amnesiac is that it feels complete. All of the 11 tracks flow quite seamlessly together, and all seem to embrace the same mood and atmosphere, and carry on the albums themes consistently. From a musical prospective, Amnesiac dwells in the minor keys, and is rather dark, yet melodic, often times revealing a jazz/bitnik influence with smooth and haunting maj7 chords, and major-to-minor changes. And of course, the vocals of Thom Yorke are nothing short of brilliant. <br />Those dissatisfied with the predictability and shallowness of many of today's bands, or those who simply enjoy creative and innovative music, will almost certainly find Amnesiac to be worthy of five stars as I have. I recommend this one highly along with their new release.
B00000FC5H|5.0|this is as good if not better than the other hits collection.  it rehashes a lot, but its nice to have the big ones in one CD collection.  get this if you're not into buying complete albums!
B000002OCP|4.0|As many of the previous reviews have emphasized, Electric Mud is indeed a departure from Muddy's more familiar Delta and Chicago blues style. However, for die-hard Muddy fans, such as myself, this album has much to offer. First off, the album is by no means a thrown together novelty, but is a very well produced and performed work, featuring some of his most famous songs in a style that new and younger generations of Muddy fans like me can relate to. For those who only wish to hear Muddy in his \\"pure\\" blues stlyes, I'd recommend getting \\"His Best: 1947 to 1955\\". However, for those who can appreciate hearing him backed with fine psychedelic rock, this is a must own.
B000002MX7|5.0|This disc shows the wonderful artistry of Chaka.  She is wonderful on the smooth soul of &quot;Ain't Nobody&quot; and captivating on the Jazz Standard &quot;The End of A Love Affair&quot; which was originally made famous by Billie Holiday.  There is also some very electronic sounding jazz with &quot;A Night In Tunisia (And the Melody Still Lingers On).&quot;  Th new tracks aren't really standouts but you can't be upset about that.  Anyone who's a fan of Chaka's will enjoy this sampler of the greatest moments of her career.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Includes the great new song, &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; which was not in the original.  Some bozos think that &quot;Human Again&quot; is a new song but its not, it was is the original release.  You must go back in time and view this movie at the theaters to confirm this, but take it from me, its true---Walt.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This CD is another in the link of straight wonderful releases from the fantastic band.  This takes on a reggae vibe and it fits in well with the ska of their past. it is so nice the hear Gwen's sexy vocals over the grooves.  A totally enjoyable record and something to cherish for a long time
0380002930|5.0|The book, Watership Down, was a very good book to read. The book was about a group of rabbits that flee their home before a land develoer destroys it. They find a place, called Watership Down, that ends up being their new home. When they realize that they don't have any does, female rabbits, they set out to find some and have a few adventures.  <BR>     I liked that the book had action in it.  For example, it had action when Hazel, the chief rabbit, and his followers fought against the Efrafan rabbits in order to save Watership Down. Another time, they fought a cat at Nuthanger Farm while trying to get two female rabbits out of a box. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that sometimes it dragged on by giving way to much detail.<BR>  This book is different from other books I have read because I have never read a book about talking rabbits before. Watership Down is similiar to other books I have read because there is action and suspense in it. The biggest suspense is when Bigwig fights General Woundwort, the Efrafan rabbits leader.<BR>  This book is one of the best books I have ever read because of the story of the rabbits and their adventures. I would definitly recommend this book to others.
B00003CXXS|5.0|The third installment to the JP franchise is full of action and shows the viewer what they truly want to see in a dinosaur movie. The way the Kirby's came together and(even though they had their problems and were divorced) were sacrificing everuthing to save their son is great. Seeing how the Kiby's end up being a family again was wonderful.
B00004U8JU|5.0|I have to disagree to the 13-year old from Oregon who believes creationism is correct while disbelieving in evolution.  Sorry to burst your bubble, human beings has only been on the earth for 5 million years.  There is no evidence that man coexisted with dinosaurs because the temperature on the earth was a lot warmer than it is today.  I wish people would keep their religious views to themselves, and let people enjoy these kind of movies.  Jurassic Park is a great movie with good acting, great special effects, and exciting action sequences.  If you have a good 5.1 home theater receiver and speakers and a subwoofer, you will really enjoy this movie.
B00004U8JV|5.0|This movie is awesome! Michael paid some honor to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World and Mr.Spielberg took it a step further and made an homage to the 1925 film The Lost World. Well the film is called THE LOST WORLD : Jurassic Park! Some of the best scenes are the trailer sequence and the T.rex rampage in San Diego.
6304806418|5.0|Eventhough, its partially true what the other opinion says about Nazis scaping from Germany, something else should be said. In that order, it should be known that Argentina helped the jewish community as no other country did. Argentina holds -as a fact- the third largest jewish populations of the world, so the words of the other comment should be taken in the appropiate scenario.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park is my #1 favorite film. The movie's concept was new and refreshing for it's time and it's ground breaking CGI is awesome. It's CGI even looks better than what is shown in some recent films (i.e. Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone, Star Wars Episode II : Attack of the Clones, and The Matrix Reloaded). I am sorry for those 3 people who haven't seen it.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Go ahead and buy this one.  The movie is an absolute riot.  Anyone who has ever looked at a home improvement project and thought, &quot;piece of cake&quot;, will probably need to wear Depends while watching this movie.<br />There are so many great lines in this movie that they just keep cropping up in my life.  All I need to say to my wife is, &quot;maybe a little dinner, some dancing, that's it&quot; and she's on the floor.<br />There is one &quot;conflict&quot; scene that I think the movie could've done without, but what do I know, I'm only a viewer.  But it does give a setup for a great plasterer line.<br />If you have &quot;weak trees&quot;, bad plumbing, or any of a plethora of other home adventures you will enjoy this movie.<br />Recommended with absolutely no reservations.
B00008YLV2|5.0|It's about time!  Sony Pictures finally got around to releasing a deluxe edition DVD of director Ridley Scott's magnificent fact-based war thriller &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;.  Fortunately, it's well worth the wait; sporting three discs with every concievable extra feature, it could well be the best DVD package I've ever seen.<br />Possibly the finest of all pure war pictures and unquestionably the best movie ever made about the Special Forces, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; recounts the fierce battle that ensued in Somalia on October 3, 1993 during a mission by the Army's Rangers and elite Delta Force operators to capture two lieutenants of a repulsive warlord. <br /> The film presents a raw, vivid dramatization of the fight, with graphic depictions of violent death on both sides.  The difference is that Scott, unlike many of his contemporaries, mostly manages to steer clear of sentimentality, preachiness and jingoism (no small feat when you're making a war movie).  Understanding the need for occasional breaks in what is essentially a two-hour-long battle scene, Scott also injects a little comic relief in the form of three lost Rangers and some other great little moments (my favorite is the part where Sgt. Eversmann, played with surprising vigor by Josh Hartnett, has to pause in the middle of battle to pull a scalding-hot spent shell casing from inside his uniform; little details like that are cinematic gold).<br />The first disc has the film along with three outstanding audio commentaries: one from Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer; one from screenwriter Ken Nolan and Mark Bowden, author of the original book; and, most interestingly, another by four actual veterans of the battle, who expand on true elements of the story and comment on some of the film's technical innacuracies (&quot;This scene is really cool - too bad it never really happened&quot;).<br />Disc two features a 150-minute &quot;making of&quot; featurette that explores just about every facett of theproduction, including technical accuracy, CGI effects and footage of the actors at Ranger boot camp.<br />Disc three has two absorbing documentaries about the battle from the History Channel and PBS's &quot;Frontline&quot;.  There's also a feature that allows you to watch the fast-roping insertion scene from multiple camera angles and some Q &amp; A sessions with the filmmakers and actors.  There's a nice moment in one of these sessions in which Jason Issacs, who plays the aptly named Capt. Steele, comments on how &quot;BHD&quot; actually made him a better person: &quot;After knowing what these soldiers went through, you feel a bit embarrassed complaining about the size of your trailer.&quot;<br />&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, simply by virtue of its adherence to telling the story as it happened (as much as is possible, at least, within the confines of a 2 1/2 hour movie), is much more military-friendly than many of the artsy war pictures that depict soldiers as victims or, even worse, as psychopaths.  It's also a far cry from the simplistic &quot;super soldier&quot; flicks of the 1980s that stressed a comic book mentality over respect for what real American warriors have endured over the centuries.  &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is a profoundly patriotic movie, but its patriotism is more subtle, mature and real.  The only American flags you really see are patches sewn onto the right shoulder of the troops' uniforms.  The flag is backwards, so that the stars are closer to the soldier's heart.
B000000132|5.0|ANNIE HASLAM<br />Through the years there have been many, many great female singers, with powerful, angelic voices, Barbra Streisand, Grace Slick, Nancy Nevins (Sweetwater), Celene Dion, Enya, and some of my current favorites, Sharon den Adel (Within Temptation), Floor Jansen (After Forever), Vibeke Stene (Tristania) and Loreena McKennitt to name a few. However, to my mind, none have ever topped Annie Haslam when she was with Renaissance. Haslam's voice had a magical quality and a smoothness that few others had. Though she had no formal training, her voice, seemed to me, to be the most perfectly pure and the the most purely pretty voice of all. Perhaps it is good that no one messed around with her voice, when you are on top, any change is downhill. But I digress too much, let's get to Renaissance and their beautiful music.<br />RENAISSANCE<br />&quot;Running hard towards what used to be<br />Losing ground in changes sliding endlessly<br />Reaching out for mirrors hidden in the web<br />Painting lines upon your face inside instead&quot;<br />I'm sure many of you are familiar with them but for those of you that know little of Renaissance, let me edify you. The Phenomenon of Renaissance was originally started by ex Yardbirds, Keith Relf and sister Diane. Renaissance created a unique niche in the 70s with their exhilarating, passionate brand of progressive, neo-classical rock with historical, folk tendencies that preceded and is somewhat akin to New Age music. Although it is somewhat common today for many European and some American bands to borrow classical melodies even symphonies to be blended with rock or heavy metal, Renaissance was the first band that I can remember doing that and none, in my opinion, have done it any better. Annie Haslam is the pre-eminent vocalist of her time, with a five octave range and a compelling emotional ability to reach the listeners, she is the most important cog in the Renaissance juggernaut. But this melding of talented artists was a symbiosis, evidenced by the fact that Haslam's solo career has floundered. the members of Renaissance seemed to feed off each other and were not as good separately. The Michael Dunford-Betty Thatcher writing team intermittently produced enough strong material to keep Renaissance fans happy, and the production, while recording for Capitol, was top notch.<br />TURN OF THE CARDS<br />&quot;Changing moods and stranger feelings<br />In my dealings with the world<br />Faces that I've seen before am I sure<br />Or has my brain turned<br />Thinking about things I don't understand<br />Thinking about things I don't understand&quot;<br />It's hard to believe this album is almost thirty years old, so I guess many of you reading this weren't even born yet. That doesn't mean the music is dated though, this music is like traditional architecture it gets better with age. In fact Renaissance are constantly getting new and younger fans.<br />With Turn of the Cards, the Annie Haslam fronted version of Renaissance changed its technique slightly and as a result Renaissance really hit its apex. After keyboard dominated albums Prologue and Ashes are Burning the band went with a more orchestral sound and their next two albums, Turn of the Cards and Scherazade excelled and became two of the greatest albums of the 70s &quot;progressive rock&quot; movement.<br />CREDITS<br />Annie Haslam - Percussion, Guitar (Bass), Vocals<br />Jim McCarty<br />Jon Camp - Bass, Guitar, Vocals<br />Keith Relf<br />Terence Sullivan - Percussion, Drums, Vocals<br />John Tout - Keyboards, Vocals<br />John Camp - Guitar (Bass), Vocals<br />Michael Dunford - Guitar (Acoustic), Guitar, Vocals<br />Betty Thatcher Newsinger - Composer<br />&quot;RUNNING HARD&quot; Long songs are the rule with Renaissance and at 9:37, this is no exception. &quot;Running Hard&quot; is a progressive rock number characterized by an exceptional piano introduction followed by inimitable Annie Haslam and the orchestra. It starts out somewhatprogressive but changes to a symphonic mode at about 5 minutes after another brilliant piano solo. The last half of the song remind me of &quot;Ashes Burning&quot; another classic Renaissance song.<br />&quot;THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND&quot; 9:32 Again stars out with a contemporary sound but is characterized by the final angelic voices breakthrough, after the last symphonic excursus at the piano, enriched with the outstanding colors of Annies voice, whose abilty to harmonize the melody is enormous and wonderful as well.<br />&quot;BLACK FLAME&quot;<br />&quot;I am words, I am speaking<br />I never heard my conclusion<br />Lost the way in my confusion, in illusion<br />Lost inside the picture frame&quot;<br />&quot;Black Flame&quot; 6:29 begins with the simple elegance of an acoustic guitar until Annie and the orchestra enter at 1:45.<br />At 4:30 the keyboards and piano come in strong again.<br />&quot;MOTHER RUSSIA&quot;<br />&quot;Pays the price, works the seasons through<br />Frozen days, he thinks of you<br />Cold as ice but he burns for you<br />Mother Russia, can't you hear him too?<br />Mother's son, freedom's overdue<br />Lonely man, he thinks of you<br />He isn't done, only lives for you<br />Mother Russia, can't you hear him too?&quot;<br />&quot;Mother Russia&quot; 9:20 is like a suite, a wonderous song that give you the exact feeling of the subject matter. The song is dedicated to Alexander Solzhenitsyn and other victims of Soviet repression. This song puts special emphasis on keyboards along with Haslams voice which, soars over and above, as well as through, the melodic ascension of the music, demonstrating that she does not need to be singing actual words to contribute to the beauty of a song.<br />SUMMATION<br />For me, with Turn of the Cards, Renaisance was at their apogee. The preceding and succeeding albums were also very good and worth consideration but this album was their pinnacle.<br />SIMILAR GROUPS<br />This is a tough one!

B00009V8Z9|5.0|First off i must say that I am very picky about rating a cd of five stars, but Gavin DeGraw's &quot;Chariot&quot; is not your average album. It is a rare delight to be able to listen to the entire cd without skipping a single song. He is being compared to John Mayer and Jason Mraz, but there is something different about Gavin. He sings every song from his soul as though he means every word he says. This cd shows off Gavins musical talents, including his voice and excellence at the piano. Highlights of this album include his single &quot;Follow Through&quot;, &quot;Chariot&quot;, &quot;Belief&quot;, and &quot;I Don't Want to Be&quot;. I love absolutly every song, but at the moment I can't get enough of &quot;Over-rated&quot;. It beautifully wraps up the album, and i just die when i hear him sing &quot;Take my home, take everything i own&quot; in the oppening lines of &quot;Over-rated&quot;. This is overall an excellent and amazing album - a must buy as long as you appriciate well-made music. Also, I hope you'll get a chance to see him in person because he is even better live.
B00005JLRT|1.0|I awaited this film in great anticipation...I shouldn't have bothered. The script is ridiculous and is only surpassed in its mind-numbingness by the plot which plods along from one unexplained and ill thought out set piece to the next. <br />The film starts promisingly with a wedding scene which still manages to show some of the humour and a dash of sentimentality that are a hallmark of Star Trek films. It's downhill fast from here folks...<br />We are soon transported to another world where, as luck would have it, Picard and co stumble across the dismembered body of a predecessor to Data. Thereafter follows a completely unnessecary and totally unbelievable car chase / shootout with a group of aliens that looked suspiciously like the 'Sandpeople' from Star Wars. And guess what...they just happen to be driving ATV's aswell! I strongly strongly suspect that someone on the design team for this film has spent a great deal of time playing 'Halo' on the X-Box! If you have played it you will know what I mean. <br />The villian pops up out of nowhere and somehow manages to overthrow the Romulan government with the help of a few skeletal creatures with a deep aversion to sunlight (handy on the battlefield huh!). No attempt is really made to explain this properly apart from the fact that he spent years in slavery in a Romulan mine and now hates everyone. Oh, guess what, said villian also happens to be a clone of Picard who, wait for it, needs Picard's blood to survive. This whole episode is eventually explained away with a liberal dash of Star Trek uber-mumbo-jumbo, but by this time you don't even bother trying to decipher it as you have resigned yourself to the fact that you are watching an absolute turkey of a film that is an absolute disgrace to the memory of Gene Rodenberry. <br />Last and least we are treated, YET AGAIN, to the Enterprise crashing into something....snore. And I nearly forgot, after Data has sacrificed himself, we learn that all of his memories have beenplaced into his prototype 'brother' who is now crew on the Enterprise. Wow...I wonder what's going to happen there?! A cunning plot twist.<br />To sum up:- This is a lazy film, with a juvenile script and story that leaves you not giving a toss whether they ever bother to make another Star Trek film. It's more like &quot;The A-Team&quot; in space. The team on the next film, assuming they can find backers for a new one after this pile of tosh, should take a good hard look at 'Khan' and 'The Undiscovered Country' - easily the best films of the franchise. HUGELY dissappointing!

B00007DWRZ|1.0|Even if is a good cd of music,I'm really disapointed because it is imposible to listen  it by a  car's cd player.The reason is the recording protection. In the store they explain me that mabe only in very good cd player's could be posible. So the persons who buy the cd insted of coping it, are punished if they don't have an expensive car's cd player.Always the same inocents pay for thiefs.
B000002W5J|3.0|En casi todas las listas de los mejores discos de los 60's Surrealistic Pillow aparece al lado de Sgt. Pepper, Are you Experienced, Astral Weeks, Pet Sounds, Forever Changes o el debut de los Doors, pero en mi opinión ni siquiera es el mejor trabajo de los Airplane (After Bathing... lo supera con creces y Crown of Creation por poco. Aún asi seguirá siendo la obra maestra del grupo y contra eso poco se puede hacer. Ahora mis razones.<br />Pocas canciones de la época me parecen tan sobrevaloradas como Somebody to Love, un tema sin fuerza y mejor logrado en el original de Great Society. Al contrario, White Rabbit es lo mejor del disco y donde Grace Slick demuestra que aparte de ser apta para estar al frente cantando también puede componer. Los pastorales My Best Friend y How do you Feel no resisten repetidas escuchas, aunque en el mismo contexto Comin' Back to Me y Today son dos puntos altos. Lo cierto es que con contadas excepciones el disco no logra sonar sicodélico, la instrumentacion es demasiado ortodoxa para una de las bandaras líderes de San Francisco y en ese sentido parece más cercano al folk y no al revolucionario estilo que ese mismo año con distintos matices mostraban entre otros Moby Grape o Country Joe &amp; The Fish. A lo mejor no pretendían sonar aventureros y ácidos, y el probema es que no siendo compositores muy dotados tienen que echar mano a otros recursos, algo que en Surrealistic evitaron, pero cuando quisieron hacerlo en sus siguientes entregas los resultados mejoraron ostensiblemente, aunque al respecto las opiniones seguirán estando divididas.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem... Love him or hate him, you've just got to respect him. Most of his works on this one are angry and loud, and every rap has a point. My favorite: Kim. I love the beat and it may seem kinda, um,well... you'll see. ( It's a guilty pleasure!) You can just get lost in the raps, and sometimes you'll swear he talking about you, not him. Just listen, and you'll see what I mean.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I am not one of those people who likes to analyize and nitpick every aspect of a movie.  Don't get me wrong, I can certainly do my fair share of interpretation when it's needed, but for the most part I prefer to simply sit back and enjoy a film.  Not so for Solaris.<BR>  This film is not for those who feel like simply &quot;taking in a show.&quot;  The film is a deliberatley ambiguous exploration of human malaise and relationships.  Like its minimalist script and interesting camera work, this film ultimately conveys more by what it leaves unsaid than anything the characters do or say.  In the case of Solaris, the meaning is found through implication rather than much direct association.  In this way, the film is able to capture the true complexity of human emotions and relationships.  There is no riding off into the sunset, no passionate &quot;I love you's,&quot; no traditional 2-dimensional film love.  Rather, Solaris shows the audience the subtle and often vague nature of human interaction by focusing on short, simple incidents that make up life.  While this necessarily slow pace may unnerve viewers who prefer to have all their conflicts neatly resolved and explained to them by the time the credits roll, Solaris tries to express itself through uncertainty and the opaque.  Although some people might certainly find this tedious and boring, those who choose to follow the development of the relationship between Kelvin and his wife will certainly appreceate the degree of interpretation this film allows and the bittersweet feel of the final resolution (or lack thereof).

To many people who observe how the music industry works, this came as no surprise. Not to say that they actually pleasured this, but it was seen that many teens today are mere drama queens that would like to think the world is a pile of nothingness, having hatred for everyone in the world for...well, for existing basically (there's really no explanation behind the overrated angst), and beinig overdramatic about some of the most pointless issues that would strive them to be rather negative.<BR><BR>It is now proved that the fault of mainstream muisc doesn't so necassarily rely on MTV or radio. As a matter of fact, Slipknot hardly EVER gets played for either, but most of that fault relies on teens who pretend having it worst while trying to deal with puberty. Seriously, you can't imagine a common, reasonable, intelligent person actually wanting to listen to IOWA. The theory is proven that the record industry is under control by preteens.<BR><BR>After the breakthrough of Nirvana's Nevermind, the teen community was certainly given a big voice to the music community. It's a concept that sometimes comes with rather unpleasant results though, which is proven when many choose Slipknot as a voice of their generation (not to mention Limp Bizkit being the voice to a generation prior). <BR><BR>But another rather not pleasing effect to the band is their overly obsessive use of the concept dealing with despair, hatred, violence, anything that explains negative. This concept is indeed appropriate, but they deal too specifically with those emotions so they never really come out with anything as anthematic as Wait and Bleed or Spit It Out. It was a concept that was first used by Nine Inch Nails, who actually made a WHOLE album based on despair with very pleasing results and something very revolutionary for the fact it was hardly done before but with worse results. <BR><BR>Now with concept and commercialism issues aside, Slipknot has become a band that have these rather obnoxious theories, and since they aren't very artistic and without a rather grand vision, the masked monsters are simply too hard to take seriously. It's not something that would be a bad thing, but Slipknot are, in fact, a band that wants to be serious. <BR><BR>As far as the music goes...well, it's pretty hard to listen to this record without thingking about these facts (unless you're one of the many 'maggots' who need much sympathy for being so called mistreated). It's sad to say, but IOWA is nearly a commercial product. The album doesn't aim towards an audience who are actually into metal, it's for mall dwelling kids who act as if they can barely get out of bed in the morning. And for that matter, it's not the music that puts them in the status Slipknot has achieved, but rather how negative and how untaming their act is. This record, though, offers many interesting things and deserves much credit for that. At the expense of memorable material of course, but that can be easily despited<BR><BR>You heard it people, Slipknot is (sadly) the new voice for this generation of teen angst, misery, and (while it might sound exaggerating) perhaps posture.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|OK, I know we can't have everything in one package, but:<BR>there are songs that must have been put on this CD.<BR>I don't think that I feel fine, Eight days a week, Day tripper and We can work it out is amongst Beatles' classic tunes. NO WAY! This compilation is a weak effort in many ways, though it's enjoyable and listenable for a newcomer. But for a hard fan as I decline myself, this is nothing but almost garbage.<BR>The following tracks are MUST-HAVE on a Beatles best of CD:<BR>- Oh, Darling<BR>- Here Comes The Sun<BR>- Birthday<BR>- While My Guitar Gentle Wheeps<BR>- I Me Mine (not so popular but excellent track from Let It Be)<BR>- Drive My Car<BR>- Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds<br />I think we can't have a Beatles comp. without the above songs.<BR>This album is just kidding. One of their best albums, The White Album is not represented here, there are no excuses for that.<BR>If you take my advice, skip this, and get The White Album, Abbey Road, Let It Be, Sgt. Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour in order.
B00009XITP|5.0|What a girl wants is a story about a seventeen year old girl named ,Dapne Reynolds,and she searches for her father.Along the way she falls for a guy named Ian and he's a muscician. When she gets there her father is running for some campaign and along  the way of that she acts like a clutz or just a fun person and decides she has to change.This is a great movie for everyone at any age. I love this movie it was very entertaining.
B00003CXE7|4.0|I didn't completely understand what the history was between Maxium (Russell Crowe) and that lady, but it was a little confusing.  There were a lot of surprises in this movie that I didn't expect!  It is definately worth the time (I think it's about 2 hours long) and money.
B000060P79|1.0|This may be the worst cd out there, what is really the difference between them and the backstreet boys or N'Sync. Both are willing to do anything to get on MTV and play the most commercial brand of Music. Both have legions of teenage girls who sing along to there lame music. They even both wear makeup! Take a look at the album cover, O' they are so cute! I guarentee that these guys where never into Punk Rock 3-4 years ago, and are just out for the cash!
B00003CXTG|4.0|This movie was definately not what I expected.  I thought that once Rafe (Ben Affleck) died, the movie was going to be a love story between the nurse and Danny (Josh Hartnett), and for the most part is was, until Rafe comes back!  BIG SHOCKER!!!!!!!  Then, Pearl Harbor gets bombed.  Well, I don't wanna ruin the ending, so you'll just have to see the movie!  :c)
6301963911|1.0|Annie Hall is Allen's attempt to be Groucho Marx.  If you need a witt fix watch A Night At The Opera or Duck Soup!!  This is the single worst movie I have ever purchased.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie was so awesome. The DVD should have a whole bunch of cool things on it like deleted scenes and cast bios. I just hope that they make a third X Men movie.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Movie itself - it's still wonderful. But you knew that.<br />New transfer - muuuch better. Less grain, little to no burns and or scratches, sound much better. To be honest, I was hoping for the same clarity as the rereleased and cleaned up &quot;Sunset Blvd&quot;, but Casablanca is a much older film, so I will take what I can get.<br />Extras - Haven't had a chance to listen to the commentaries tho the Ebert one scares me. The &quot;Bacall on Bogart&quot; featurette is cool and neat to see the few outtakes and deleted scenes. It is hard, however, to glean any new information about the actors and/or the making of the film after having read and/or seen all other documentaries and books (I have no idea of the validity, but &quot;Round up the Usual Suspects&quot; by Aljean Harmetz is an entertaining read)<br />If you are a Casablanca fan and want the clearest copy of the film, then you need to add this to your collection. =)
B000007ODM|5.0|When the world has gone crazy around you and you just dont want to argue, fight, yell at others, press play. <BR>Just listen to Era for a few minutes. It seems as if the chaos around you slowly moves into place in your own mind and you find yourself owner of your senses again. <BR>Usually, by the second music, I can find peace in my mind...<BR>Its worth a try and it works!!! I take this cd with me wherever I go.
B00006JDS4|2.0|The attackers -- the so-called attackers -- in this film could have avoided all subsequent revenge (or even problems with police, courts etc) if each had said to the woman, \\"You better get some ice on that\\" after completing the act.  That admonition (some might call it counselling) renders inoperative all suggestions of rape or assault, allowing the perpetrator to skate away free -- and even, in some instances, glean widespread support from society, as happened in one particular Arkansas rape case.  In this film, however, the perpetrators did not skate away scott free.  Rather, they experienced justice.<br />It was startling to find this film cast in DVD format, as it would normally be considered one of those old cheap throwaways, but obviously the producers thought otherwise.  Enjoy -- and always remember the magic everything-is-okay, no-problem-at-all phrase following such an assault:  You better get some ice on that.
B0000072VM|5.0|As you probably know, PFM is an Italian progressive rock band. This is their second album. The sound quality on the CD is excellent. It is 35 minutes long.<br />I don't think this is as good as their first album, Storia di un Minuto. It is a little bit more bombastic and pretenious. Overblown excesses by groups like Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer are what killed off progressive rock. This ablum suffers a tiny bit from that on songs like Generale and Il Banchetto. Some of these songs can get tedious on repeated listenings. But, it is a minor complaint and this album comes close to 5 stars.<br />The lyrics to this album are in Italian. There is a reworked version of this album with English lyrics called Photos of Ghosts. Pete Sinfield (who wrote much of the early King Crimson lyrics) supplied the lyrics. No one in PFM had much English speaking ability and the English lyrics are sung phonetically. The lyrics are meaningless and take away from beauty of the album. It is better to get this Italian version. Photos Of Ghosts does have one extra track, Celebration, which is an English verion of E'Festa from the first album.<br />PFM was a completely different band in concert. Instead of playing mellow, progressive rock, they were a hard core, jamming band. Many of thier live albums are excellent. I would reccmmend the 4 CD set, Gil Anni Live 1970 to 1981. If you can't find that, get Live in USA (also called Cook).
B00009EIQE|3.0|Buddy,  remember you're a blues \\"guitarist\\" first and foremost.  Turn it up and please let it rip!  Break free of the corporate strangehold and give us another \\"Stone Crazy\\"....please! Having said that, this is a decent blues album from Buddy, but far from his best.  What elevates this to a 3 star rating is Buddy's passionate vocals (unfortunately it is not his guitar).   If you want classic, \\"acoustic guitar\\" Buddy Guy, buy the Muddy Waters cd \\"Folk Singer\\" instead of this one, you won't regret it.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Right there at the bottom of the Comic-book-turned-movie heap. Slow and unexciting, only two things make the movie worth watching...Colin Farrell as &quot;Bullseye,&quot; who adds energy everytime he's on camera, and Jennifer Garner who adds real sparks. But just as she starts to gain your interest - she's gone! Ben Affleck apparently thinks being blind means walking through scenes like a zombie (sort of like his performance in Pearl Harbor!) Even the action sequences are enervated by the jumpy, dark (and boring) effects trying to show Daredevil's auditory bat sense.<br />There are also some tremendous &quot;suspension-of-disbelief&quot; howlers, and the climactic fight scene is truly weak and anticlimactic...designed only to set up a sequel. Now if the sequel could feature a resurrected Jennifer Garner it might be worthwhile. <br />Buy it and watch it? Only if the only thing on television is another insipid &quot;reality&quot; show!
B000069AUI|4.0|well,firstly im a fan of radiohead(in the bends,radiohead era at least) and coldplay are one of them bands that have a slightly similar style..this album is chronoloically good and bad withthe first 5 songs(politik,in my place,god put a smile upon your face,the scientist,clocks)an excellent collection of piano and guitar driven songs in tandem with chris martins vocals..however,and this is only my opinion,the album falters somewhat with the last songs relying excessively on martins vocals with little instrumental assistance..regardless this gets 4 stars because like most albums every song isnt perfect(ie..the bends;blackstar,sulk) and similar to radiohead they will havea job living up to the success of this..still its a good album worth buying
B0000A36J1|5.0|Lord of the Rings is the best movie i have seen. I have seen both of the ones that have been released in Australia, and I think they are the best!!!!!
0788821075|4.0|The classical drama \\"Pretty Woman\\", directed by Garry Marshall and with actor Richard Gere (Edward Lewis) and actress Julia Roberts (Vivian Ward) was really hilarious.  Julia Roberts won Best Actress in 1990 at the Academy Awards and Best Actress in 1991 at the Golden Globe for her performance in this move.  I can see why! Julia Roberts with her beautiful smile was a wonderful actor in her role as a prostitute and then portraying a woman who is of class and wealth.  She really gave herself away when she walked in those high heels though and her talk. <br />Edward Lewis is rich businessman who recently broke up with his girlfriend.  Edward is in Los Angeles on business and he gets lost on his way to Beverly Hills Hotel.  He gets acquainted with Vivian (Julia Roberts) when he stops to ask for directions on Hollywood Boulevard. Vivian is prostitute and she thinks he is looking for some action.  She gets in the car to show Edward to Beverly Hills Hotel.  After she spends the night in his room, he asks her to stay the week and how much it will cost him for her to stay.  Edward needs Vivian to escort to the rich parties so he gives he money to purchase clothes to wear.   This is a once in lifetime opportunity for Vivian as her and Edward is from two different worlds.<br />Edward begins to see that Vivian is more than just a prostitute, that she is beautiful, fun to be around and that she makes him feel like a better person.  However, Vivian has to deal with Phil (Jason Alexander) a co-worker of Edward's who keeps reminding her of her past and that this relationship will never work.  Vivian is given a chance to start her life all over again and not have to live on the streets to make ends meet.<br />I love movies with Richard Gere he is so handsome.  And Julia Roberts is just beautiful I cannot think of any other person who could have played pretty woman in this movie.  I give this movie 4 star for romance and comedy mixed together.  It kept me laughing and yet the romantic part is every woman's dream.  I just hope young women do not look at this movie and think that being a prostitute is okay way of life and that this could happen to them.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|Portishead's Dummy was one of the nineties most special records -beautiful, swooping torch songs set to an (at the time) fresh and original sounding 'trip-hop' and scratching fusion.  And then there was that voice.  Beth Gibbons' vocals simultaneously made and destroyed Portishead.  She was simply too good for the confines of the project, often sounding like an ingenious sample rather than the inspiring showstopper she really is.<br />So, here, four years after Portishead's 'difficult' second album, comes Out Of Season, recorded with ex-Talk Talk man Paul Webb.  This is stirring, emotionally volatile stuff.  Ten simple, elegant folk songs, sparsely arranged, all individual and distinctive with ample room for Gibbons to showcase her talent.  At its best, Out Of Season is truly incendiary.  The opener Mysteries is at least the equal of Dummy's finest ballad (Roads), while Tom The Model is naggingly catchy without ever coming close to grating.  Romance is all Shirley Bassey-kitsch, while Resolve, perhaps the highlight, is utterly heartbreaking.<br />Highly recommended.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This movie is a must have for anybody who loves thriller movies. I don't even care if you like thrillers just get the movie. Lots of other people have already said what it's about so i'm not going to say again I just have to say that when i first saw it and it got out i  was like wow!!!!!!!!!! This movie is one of the best movies ever. If i were you just buy this movie and don't listen to anybody who sais it is bad. THEY ARE WRONG IF THEY SAY IT IS A BAD MOVIE.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Like David Gray's White Ladder, 'O' by Damien Rice is one of those rare word-of-mouth successes and adds further weight to the claim that the Irish (who picked up on this and White Ladder at the time of release rather than a couple of years later) have impeccable taste.<br />'O' sounds merely great on first listen.  Rice's alternately ragged/choirboy vocals(think Jeff Buckley without the histrionics) marry perfectly with Lisa Hannigan's fragile whispers.  The songs are deceptively simple lullabies - Volcano swoops and embraces, Cold Water is suffocating and disturbing, The Blowers Daughter a near-perfect folk song of unrequited love - but they reveal their true depth only on play 19 or 20, when the entire album hangs together and the nuances become clear.  <br />I was lucky enough to see Damien at this years' Glastonbury Festival and he was the highlight of the weekend (despite a rather thin crowd) - I fear it's the last time he'll play to such a small audience.
B000002UJQ|5.0|listening to this album each time is always a new learning experience.  this is possibly the greatest album ive ever heard, if not, than Kid A is deffinetly it.  radiohead are music geniuses and we should all recognize that by now.  please keep this album @ a 5 star rateing because it offends me and all ateasers when this album isnt given the perfect rating it deserves.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack follows the Movie....exciting.  The music is invigorating and fun to listen to!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I am a big fan of zany comedies with far-out premises that aren't very realistic (such as the Airplane and the Naked Gun movies).  The more oddball the better, as long as it's done right.  These comedies are hard to do, however, and very easy to mess up.<br />When I first heard of Zoolander, I thought it was supposed to be a more mainstream comedy, though the premise sounded a bit outlandish.  I never really made the time to see it, however.  That changed when I caught it on a local movie channel recently, and I was riveted to the screen.  Zoolander is a farce about the fashion industry.  It is also one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in a long time.<br />Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the hottest model in the business, having won the VH-1 \\"Male Model of the Year\\" award for the last three years.  However, this year he's beaten by the up-and-comer Hansel (Owen Wilson).  On top of that, Time magazine has branded him an idiot for certain actions Derek did at the awards show (not to mention the fact that he truly is an idiot).  Derek decides to retire and return to his family, coal miners in New Jersey.  This doesn't work either, though.<br />Meanwhile, the new Prime Minister of Malaysia has promised to raise the minimum wage, ending the fashion industry's source of cheap labour.  The secret coalition of fashion designers that has been behind every major world calamity for the last 200 years decides that this can't happen.  Whenever they need a patsy, they get a model.  So Mugatu, the visible head of this group, decides that he has the perfect idiot, er, man for the job.  He calls Derek out of retirement to headline his new \\"Derelicte\\" line of clothing, and when the Prime Minister is in attendance at the opening, Derek will kill him.<br />Joined by Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor), the reporter that besmirched his name, and his rival model Hansel, Derek must stumble...I mean, Derek must stop this insidious plan before it can come to fruition. In the meantime, he learns that not everything is about good looks (though they certainly are the most important).<br />Stiller does an outstanding job as Derek Zoolander, the model with the trim waistline and the brain to match.  I have often thought of Stiller as a funny guy in more conventional comedies, but here he is at his zany best.  He plays stupid very well, making the character immensely likeable even as we groan at some of the things he does or says.  We really do care about what happens to him.  I felt for him when he made his mistake at the Fashion Awards and saw the subsequent issue of Time magazine.  He really does have a good heart, even though he doesn't know how to demonstrate it.<br />Owen Wilson is classic as Hansel.  I've been a big fan of his since Shanghai Noon, and he doesn't disappoint here.  He has the perfect blend of arrogance, talent, and the ability to change his mind when necessary.  But like Derek, he's a bit stupid. Wilson pulls it off with flair, and his reconciliation scene with Derek is a wonder of comic timing.  You alternately laugh at him, hate him, and then love him, all in the space of one movie.<br />The other major character is Matilda Jeffries.  I don't think she worked quite as well as she should, though she doesn't detract very much from the movie.  Christine Taylor does a pretty good job with her (far removed from her Marcia Brady days), but she just doesn't quite fit with the rest of the cast.  I know she's supposed to be the straight woman, but she's almost too straight for this cast.  I didn't find her as funny as the rest of them, even given the straight lines she has.  She's not horrible, but she's just \\"ok.\\"  I didn't find the budding romance between Derek and her to be that believable, and I think that's down to her.<br />The villains of the piece are priceless as well.  Will Ferrell chews the scenery with gusto as Mugatu (but since this is the type of comedy it is, he's supposed to do that).  Milla Jovavich plays the heavy like she was born to play it, and Jerry Stiller basically plays himself as Derek's manager, Maury.  It was music to my ears when he started on one of his \\"Stilleresque\\" rants at his wife.  All of them add the perfect blend to the mix, making the outcome just about perfect.<br />What really makes the movie, though, are the jokes and the cameos.  There are a lot of shots taken at the fashion industry, but most of the models appear to realize that it's all in jest, because they make cameos in the movie.  Numerous other Hollywood stars make cameos as well, though I won't say where lest they spoil the fun.  Some of them fit in perfectly (David Duchovny), some are just there for sight gags (Gary Shandling), but all of them work.<br />There are so many great sequences in this movie that I did not stop laughing for more than a few moments.  Even the tragic deaths of Derek's friends come in such a blackly comic fashion that it's hard not to laugh.  Hansel and Derek face off in a \\"walk-off\\" with the winner taking all.  The awards show is wonderful.  It's all good.  In fact, at a trim 89 minutes, I can honestly say there is not a bit of wasted time in this movie.  Every scene either forwards the plot or makes you laugh (and oftentimes both).<br />Is it remotely believable?  No, of course not.  Is it hilariously funny?  You better believe it.  If you like zany comedies and don't mind that they're not really based on reality, then give this movie a try.  However, I take no responsibility for medical bills incurred when falling off the sofa.<br />David Roye she was born to play it, and Jerry Stiller basically plays himself as Derek's manager, Maury.

B000002P86|5.0|A few years ago, before I moved to Minneapolis, I was in town visiting a friend and was having a hard time finding my way back to his house at night.  Because I was trying to find the correct street that lead to the freeway I was having problems concentrating on the radio, so I gave up and left it the radio on the next station to come up on seek.  It happened to be the local blues station playing &quot;The Thrill is Gone&quot; by B.B. King and Tracy Chapman (from this album), and a few seconds later the blues had a new fan. <br />With one or two exceptions, the entire album is great.<br />Highly Recommended!
6305508550|5.0|Possibly the best film I have seen in years. Many truths are laid open (The printer jamming is a great example!). Wicked sound track too. Very well cast, and just generaly great. Highly, Highly recommended
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Nothing can ever sooth the anger that I hold for Firefly being yanked off the air but a DVD set containing all 12 aired episodes plus the three that weren't and a ton of extras is a welcomed distraction. For those returning home to Serenity it needs no introduction but for those new to the 'verse Firefly is a Science Fiction medley with Western themes set 500 years into the future after a huge civil war. Sound odd? Maybe but five minutes into the series premiere and it all comes together with the help of superb acting, ingenius writing and storylines that speak to what makes us human whether it's now or in the future. No firefly fan should be without and nobody should go through life without watching this amazing show at least once. But trust me, like 'Pringles', you won't beable to watch just one so make sure you have the whole day free!
6305428050|5.0|despite seeing it 1,000 , 000 i still love it. it's funny as hell and i laugh every time i watch it.
B000002NIW|5.0|OK this first thime i heard this album i gave it 2 starz, wow big mistake, like all deftones cds, this one also grew on me, one of their better cds, go get it now ASAP!
B000067CPX|5.0|I must admit that this is a bit softer than the previous releases of the RHCP, but I still think it's fantastic.  There aren't (m)any weak tracks on their albums, although it's plain to see that they don't rock out as hardcore as in years past.  Thankfully, however, they make up for it with clever lyrics, and a surplus of wild harmonies both thanks to John on guitar and backup vox!  I'd say this is a must-buy.  I guarantee if you give each tracks two listens, you'll be hooked on just about every track.  My personal faves are &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, &quot;Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;On Mercury&quot;, and the PHENOMINAL &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;.  A true winner.  You won't regret it - just don't expect the constant edge of Bloodsugarsexmagik.
B000089RVX|5.0|\\"catch me as i fall, say you're here and its all over now. speaking to the atmosphere, no one's here and i fall into myself. this truth drives me into madness, i know i can stop the pain if i will it all away...\\" -Whisper<br />A friend recommended this CD to me, and i was absolutely blown away. the first thing that struck me was Amy Lee's voice...it's refreshing to hear a female vocalist who has actually undergone proper vocal training, and therefore can get away with transcending far beyond the average singer's range, on both ends. honestly, if it weren't for her voice, evanescence would be merely a linkin park ... however, after being enchanted by the vocals, the lyrics truly moved me. being an avid poetry writer, this stuff inspired a lot more of my writing. also, a lot of the songs struck an extremely personal chord with me, especially \\"my immortal\\", a slow, piano driven ballad about how after someone leaves you, they remain a part of you, and you can't ignore the pain. \\"i held your hand through all of these years, you still have all of me...\\" the tone of the whole album is slightly eerie, gothic, and gives one chills. i absolutely believe these lyrics came from the heart, and were meant to give the rest of us something to relate to, we are all feeling the same kind of pain at some point in our young lives. other favorites of mine include \\"Hello\\", \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"Whisper\\". if you can appreciate emotionally driven music with intense instrumental effects, i totally recommend this album, and i also believe anyone who is {brought} in by merely a beautiful voice can like it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is their undisputed #2 album behind Bloodsugarsexmagik as far as I'm concerned.  It's almost impossible to get tired of listening to this album without listening to it about 100 times first.  It's great because it definately reflects maturity in their sound, lyrics, but they still have a bite to their music.  There are some true winners on this album.  One of my all-time fave albums!
B00005K9LM|5.0|Judas Priest is a name that will live on in the metal world.  While Iron Maiden probably remains as my most favored, that doesn't stop me from tipping my hat off to the members of Priest, Rob Halford, Glen Tipton, K.K. Downing, Ian Hill, and Dave Holland.  Priest was going strong thanks to a large, fervent following, and after they broke gold in 1980 with \\"British Steel,\\" these guys were on their way to becoming metal legends.  While most fans claim 1982's \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" as their prime album, my favorite album is their next one... 1984's \\"Defenders of the Faith.\\"  Why?  Read on and see why:<br />Freewheel Burning - A fast and furious track, this is by far one of the band's greatest offerings!  Rob proves his vocal integrity as he spitfires rapid fire vocals in the midsection.<br />Jawbreaker - A hard and hit-em track with some great guitarwork by Glen and K.K.  A must-have for fans of the Priest.<br />Rock Hard Ride Free - Originally entitled Fight For Your Life, this anthemic hard rock gem is one of my all-time favorites and anyone who doesn't headbang to this must be braindead.<br />The Sentinel - MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FROM THIS ALBUM.  What a great song and it was the one that hooked me to Priest.  The vocals and guitars are perfect and I especially love the midsection where Rob lowkey sings the haunting lyrics.  WOW!<br />Love Bites - A very dark and gloomy track but still heavy, this is Priest's take on vampirism.  The chorus will hook like no other will.  Listen and see what I mean.<br />Eat Me Alive - A fast and satirical track, Priest pokes fun at sex here.  This song enraged Tipper Gore and Nancy Reagan that they tried to ban Priest from television!<br />Some Heads Are Gonna Roll - One of the monster hits from this album, this is a very anthemic song with a catchy chorus.  It's not one of my favorites, but still worthy of the Priest catalog.<br />Night Comes Down - It's still heavy, but it's structured like a \\"gloom and doom\\" ballad; this one's a really dark song with some of Rob's best vocals.<br />Heavy Duty - The title says it all.<br />Defenders of the Faith - The title track is an anthemic rocker with great instrumentation.  You can tell it would be a great live track, and by the bonus tracks on here, you can see why...<br />~Bonus Tracks~<br />Turn On Your Light - a mellower track, this is actually a good b-side.<br />Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith (LIVE) - Two good tracks, put together in a live setting.  This one's pretty good and it shows Priest's greatness live.<br />METAL LOVERS, this is essential to your library.  Priest helped define what heavy metal was all about and this is my personal favorite Priest album.  Actually, I'm not sure why most consider \\"Screaming\\" their best because this album has NO FILLERS WHATSOEVER.

B00009UW0N|3.0|This is a pretty good dvd.  Although, things were missing that were very important.  First, the extended edition which had the 12 minutes of deleted scenes in it should've been included in the dvd. Also, due to the film being shot during spring the crew had to paint leaves for the neighborhood. As I recall this movies name is Halloween, it doesnt look like that compared to the old version because they made the grasss so bright than it took away the fall colors. It now looks like spring in the movie. The special feature disc is great with all new interviews w/ the cast and crew which is 87 minutes and more on that disc. Anchor Bay, I wish you had included the extended editon and I'm not spending another 20 bucks for another movie that I already own in 3 forms. Anyways it has good sound and it gives you a storybook to go along with the DVD. Even though they forgot to include some things it is still mi favorite Horror flick.
0142004235|5.0|I first read East of Eden as a freshman in college. To be frank, ABC was premiering their miniseries, and I wanted to have some knowledge base before it started. To say that I am not a fan of Steinbeck is a severe understatement. Whenever we were required to read one of his novels in high school, I truly wanted to cry every time. I went to a very small college in Wisconsin, and the library only had one copy of the book that had not been checked out in a loooong time. I brought it back to my dorm room with the idea that if nothing else, I could use it to aid with my insomnia. By the end of the first paragraph I was hooked!! To say that it was a difficult read puts it mildly. It really does have the power to strip pieces of your heart away as you take the journey with Cal. It's also one of those books that you know that when you finish, you will not come back to it for a long time. You can't. The emotions are just that powerful. I watched the mini series afterwards, and was pleased at how true they tried to stay to the basic essence of the book. I'm glad Oprah's brought this beauty back into the light for everyone to enjoy. But, be prepared for the bruises that your emotions will take along the novels journey.
B00008VGK0|2.0|After awesome CD's like Ray of Light and Music, I was so excited for a new album from Madonna. Saddly, I'm VERY disappointed. The songs are all so average. When all the controversy happened over the American Life Song, I had to check it out and I immediatley thought it was so corny! Everytime I hear it I have to turn off the radio because it annoys me, especially that part where she raps about being, or should I say, not being &quot;satisfied&quot;. The &quot;Hollywood&quot; song really bugs me too. There are a couple of ok tracks but mostly this is a disappointment...not Madonna's best...bummer...I'll be looking forward to her next CD, hopefully it will be worth the money.
B000001FN8|5.0|Let´s start looking at the time this album was released...Hair Metal ruled the rock scene in the late 80´s, with a lot of ridiculous hype bands raising the hit parades, and the \\"appice\\" of this \\"movement\\" was the Def Leppard´s<BR>album \\"Hysteria\\" (1987),where the band sold millions of copies of this underrated album...Scorpions´ last hit was \\"Still Loving You\\"(one of the best rock ballads ever), and I think that the pression was very strong to the band repeat the success on \\"Savage Amusement\\",so...That album has the shape of Hair Metal(take a look on the back cover - they´re looking like Def Leppard or Bon Jovi - ARGHHH!!!),the production points this way all the time and this album, at first, has everything to be the worst Scorpions´ album...but it is NOT!!! Incredibly, they recorded the best Hair Metal album I´ve ever hearded!!! It´s serious...Def Leppard,Bon Jovi and Poison don´t have Klaus Meine<BR>on vocals neither Rudolf Schencker on compositions and Mathias Jabs kickin´ ass on solo guitars!!! Try listen without prejudice to this album (don´t look at the back cover and don´t watch the video clips, please), and what you´ll hear is the great melody and sensibility of this GREAT rock band...An exemple: the solo in the introduction of \\"Believe In Love\\"...the shape used on the recording was pure Hair Metal, but take a \\"look\\" deeper in the melody...it´s beautiful!!!Listen carefully to Klaus´ vocals in \\"Walking On The Edge\\" and \\"Believe In Love\\"...it´s beatiful!!!Listen to the song \\"Rhythm of Love\\"...it´s a rock masterpiece!!! \\"Don´t Stop At The Top\\" is a strong rock song; \\"Passion Rules The Game\\" and \\"Every Minute Every Day\\" are slow rock songs like only Scorpions know how to do; \\"Love On The Run\\" is more fast and aggressive than the other songs,with an almost-punk beat; \\"We Let It Rock...You Let It Roll\\" and \\"Media Overkill\\" are genuine Hair Metal, but yet with the talent of the band making difference(listen to Mathias Jabs´ solos!!!)...That´s it, guys...In my opinion, \\"Savage Amusement\\" is an underestimated classic of rock, but undoubtly a CLASSIC!!!
0385504209|1.0|While the conspiracy theory piece of the novel is well researched and interesting, it cannot make up for such egregious stylistic faults as the over-use of the verb 'grin', eyes constantly described as 'twinkling', and the author's inability to trust either his characters or his reader.  Everything is over-explained to a fault, and the two page chapters go from annoying at the beginning to insulting by the end.  One of his characters is a French woman, but her dialogue reads like a first year French student.  To get around the fact that he obviously does not speak French, Mr. Brown uses the completely unbelievable tool of making English part of her personal history.  Her flashbacks inevitably begin with an insipid, childlike question in French, countered by the admonition &quot;English in the home!&quot; from her grandfather.  Anyone who has ever lived amongst the French will recognize immediately how completely implausible this scenario is.  Why not italicize her speech so that the reader knows that it has been translated for his or her benefit?  There are many other ways to accomplish a bilingual novel that respect the intelligence of the reader and make the characters believable.  There is not enough space provided here to detail all the flaws in this book.  But I can say this: I gobble up trashy mystery novels and sophisticated literature alike (and everything in between) - I love to read and will read almost anything - but this book made me regret having learned to read.  I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.  Had I not been on an airplane when I finished it, I would have thown against the wall!  If you're interested in the history of Da Vinci and the Mona Lisa, this is not the place to get that information.  Mr. Brown did do a fine piece of research.  The history of the Priory and Opus Dei was truly interesting.  It is unfortunate that he chose to write \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" rather than a non-fiction piece.  Suffering through the plot is too high a price for knowledge that could easily been found in some other, better book.  Dan Brown successfully did this research, and I advise that you do the same.or knowledge that could easily been found in some other, better book.  Dan Brown successfully did this research, and I advise that you do the same.
B000002MY3|5.0|Maybe it's the catchy tunes, the way it brings me back to my childhood, the way I can relate perfectly, or just the pure honesty of Jagged Little Pill that makes it one of my favorite albums of all time.  Alanis has such a unique sound that distinguishes her from anyone else you hear on the radio.  It's so refreshing to hear a different, opiniated voice in a world of hearing clones that are polluting our radio time on a daily basis.<br />Possibly my favorite thing about this album is that it's not one of those complete, mushy girl-power albums that guarantees instant inner strength and confidence to girls in our society.  It's great that some people are empowered by strong women singing about kicking butt, mostly that of guys.  To me, however, it's better to face reality.  Although there are some feel-good, empowering songs on this album, Alanis very much speaks the truth, from relationships to religion to family life.  By sharing her personal experiences with the world, even if it renders her vulnerable at times or angry or sad at others, it helps me to relate to these realistic, HUMAN emotions.<br />In short, I recommend you buy this album.  It's one of the few CD's that I can listen to over and over without getting sick of it, and it's an absolute essential for every music-lover's collection.
B000092Q7O|5.0|I am a history buff. I will admit that up front, so when I heard they were making a movie about the Warsaw Ghetto during WW2 I nearly jumped out of my seat. The movie begins with Adrien Brody playing the piano. Right then you are rivited, because it is awesome. If you are familiar with the story of the Warsaw ghetto, you would know that the Germans came into Poland, and literally walled up the city, and housed 500,000 people in hellish conditions. Throughout the movie, you see Brody's charatcter endure horrible things at the hands of the Germans, all the while you know that he is one of the greatest pianists in history. After spending almost the whole war in running from the Germans and the concentration camps, near the end of the movie, while hiding in a house, Brody's character befriends a German officer who takes pity on him and brings him food and other amenities. After the war ends, he continues playing the piano on a grand scale, and lives all the way until his death a few years ago in 2000. What makes this story so great is that it is true, it really happened. All the way through the story, you watch and think &quot;this really happened to someone.&quot; It is a very sobering experience to watch this movie. If anyone has seen Schindler's List, you will understand. I strongly recommend this movie to people who want to appreciate the efforts of people involved in WW2.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. <br />What an EXCELLENT movie. Wow.<br />Absolutely FANTASTIC.<br />Go watch it NOW.
B00008H2LB|4.0|The single &quot;Faint&quot; was the first thing to catch my ear and I immediately bought the cd.  After listenting to the whole album I quite enjoyed it.  What can I say it's GREAT.
B00004YW6I|5.0|When I saw that PJ Harvey had released a new album I was immediately excited, having spent countless hours of listening to past work. After a quick listen, I was immediately disapointed wondering if this was the same artist that had put out &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. I was expecting more of the raw power and declarations along the lines of &quot;I'm gonna twist your head off, see? / Till you say don't you wish you never never met her&quot; (Yikes!).<br />But then I gave it another listen, and another, and pretty soon I was listening to this album all the time. At some point I realized- this is a great album. It still contains the fantastic guitars in the opening &quot;Big Exit&quot;, though perhaps under an extra layer of production, and later in &quot;kamakazee&quot; and &quot;This is Love&quot;. The wonderful lyrics are there, but this time extoling love, and is she ever in love. This is an album that digs up the truths that one can relate to; from late night conversations (&quot;You Said Something&quot;) to the existance of non-rational feelings on &quot;This is Love&quot;--&quot;And when I watch you move / And I can't think straight&quot; to the euphoria &quot;Do you remeber your first kiss / Stars shooting across the sky&quot; on &quot;One Line&quot;.
0385504209|2.0|I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. The Da Vinci Code is nothing special; it's a religious mystery that feels a little too familiar at times. This is one case where the book doesn't live up to all the hype surrounding it.<br />And maybe that's why I was so disappointed by it. We've seen this before, and better. How many time have we followed historians or archeologists who are seeking the Holy Grail? This time around, we're following historian and art expert Langdon and Sophie, a young French police officer who's grandfather has just been assassinated. Before dying, the old man wrote a strange message in his own blood. Once decrypted, the message will put Landon and Sophie on a road they do not necessarily want to be on.<br />And that's pretty much all there is to it. I love mysteries that make you work for your money. This one didn't. When the characters are faced with a problem, the answer will usually come to them as if falling right from the sky. They never work really hard to achieve their goals. Everything is pure coincidence. The book - and author - believe themselves to be much more clever than they actually are.<br />Their search leads them across France and England, as our two heroes try to find what they seek all the while trying to dodge the police (and their many enemies). I have to admit that the pacing of the books was pretty quick. Written in short chapters, this was one quick read. But maybe a little too quick. I wanted more out of this story. I wanted more complicated characters, situations that were not so easily solved, and a plot that didn't feel so deja vu.<br />In the end, The Da Vinci Code is nothing special, more the product of a great publicity campain than a real innovative thriller. This book almost reads as if it was written with one sole purpose in mind; to become a Hollywood movie. As it now stands, The Da Vinci Code is just another religious conspiracy thriller that is all talk and no action.
B00000ILDF|3.0|\\"Aliens\\", the preceding film in the series, ended with on a high note.  Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) succeeded in dispatching the deadly Queen Alien to the vacuum of space.  And this time she was not the sole survivor.  \\"Newt\\" a young girl, and \\"Corporal Hicks\\", part of the attack force survived as well.  Ripley, had also salvaged the torn remains of the android \\"Bishop\\" (Lance Henriksen).  All resided peacefully in their respective tubes as we faded to the end credits.<br />Alien 3 continues the saga, and quickly sets a somber tone.  An alien \\"face sitter\\" is loose on the ship, USS Sulaco.  Acid from the creature leaks out, causing a fire.  The emergency initiates the automatic collection of the sleeping tubes into an escape craft.  Released from the Sulaco, the craft falls into the atmosphere of Fury 161, a planet used as a prison facility, and crashes lands into what is presumably a body of water.  A rescue party reaches the craft, and upon breaking in, finds that only Ripley has survived.  The child Newt, and a bloodied Hicks lie dead in their tubes.<br />Alien 3, doesn't have the suspense of Alien, or the spectacular excitement of Aliens, but it does have a story that doesn't degenerate into pure rubbish.  There's even time enough for love.  Some things do remain constant.  The creature kills, and the Company wants it alive.<br />The maximum-security prison, operates with a minimal staff, with the inmates also running a mining operation.  Ripley's presence, sends shockwaves through the all-male population, and the presence of \\"lice\\" (where are they?) leads to the shaving of her head.  Sporting a reddened eye, she is emotionally crushed after learning that her friends are dead.  Medical officer Clemens (Charles Dance) becomes her ally, as she anxiously investigates, searching for evidence of the Alien's presence.<br />Director David Fincher, keeps things dark and dreary.  Pacing is a bit slow, as Ripley's arrival is an unwelcome break in the peaceful monotony of prison life.  Prison superintendent Andrews (Brian Glover), seeking to maintain the status quo, has no time for Ripley and her \\"monster\\" stories.  In the matter of maintaining order, religion and faith, are factors too.  Prisoner Dillion (Charles Dutton) serves as a spiritual leader and enforcer among the men.  These futuristic events have a distinct \\"British\\" flavor, as Dance, Glover and many others, speak with accents, and use English slang.<br />The creature begins its rampage, uniting the survivors in a common goal, as they confront the Alien without any weapons, in a broken down facility.  Ripley has her own more personal problem, discovering the presence of an alien growing in her body.  Computer generated effects are used extensively, resulting a faster moving, and more active Alien.  Led by Dillion and Ripley, the prisoners attempt to trap the creature.  Luring the Alien through tunnel, after tunnel, after tunnel, until it is trapped and killed.  Not very plausible, but still exciting.  The Company, conveniently arrives on the scene, with Bishop II (Lance Henriksen) making one last plea for the life of the alien inside of Ripley.  Ellen Ripley's death, would seem to have brought the series to an end, but then we all know better.<br />Alien 3 is not a great movie, but it is good solid SF that delivers some thrills, and should not be missed.  You see pretty much what you expect, and there are no big surprises, though the CG effects allow a more dynamic presentation of the Alien.

B00006879E|4.0|I first heard about Maroon 5 from my cousin. When i asked her to describe what they sounded like, she was at loss for words. I thought, how hard could it be to describe the kind of music a band plays. I went to the store to go CD shopping and i saw that their CD was less that 8 bucks... and since my cousin is 'in love' with their music i decided to pick it up since it would probably be good. Maybe this time i'd be able to describe their music.<br />As soon as i started listening to their album i immediately understood why she couldn't describe what they sound like. Their music along with front man Adam Levine's voice, together is unlike anything i've ever heard in my life...but its a good thing. After listening to the album a couple of time through i've come up with the description of 'funky jazz'.<br />When i say 'funky' i don't mean funky like foul or bad. i mean 'funky' like funk music...<br />I can't really explain it... you just have to hear their music to understand what i'm saying. All in all, its a great album. I would suggest listening to a few clips before buying it. But i'm pretty sure that you would like it.
0553382179|4.0|We've been 'flying' at work and home for a year now and I would encourage anyone who is buried with too much to do and NO HELP to get on the flylady bandwagon.  This is not a book about how to clean your house, although she DOES get you moving in that direction.  Marla really is writing about changing our attitudes from resentment (poor me, Pity party) to joy.  AND she succeeds!  I had really been struggling with running my own business and my household and organizing 3 kids and a husband - and I was getting quite annoyed about a number of things.  Marla reminded me of what I have to celebrate - and feminist that I am, I still can roll up my sleeves and clean a toilet with a smile.  THIS IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT!
0312305060|2.0|I saw the movie first and wanted to read the book to see if there was any explanations for a bunch of stuff I found confusing.  The book was almost exactly like the movie for the first 50 pages, so I got bored and stopped reading it.  It now rests in the bookcase between an Authentic Italian Cookbook whose recipes were way too complicated, and my Young Lady Chatterley DVD.  If you're really into literature, I suppose you'll love it, if you're a casual reader, you'll probably grow bored.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm not a Radiohead junkie, never was, never will be.

Don't worry, your offspring may one day attain Homo Sapiens status. For now, off to your cave with you!<BR>Thirdly, although it is practically impossible for Radiohead to top OK computer with future efforts, I wish they would try. Kid A and Amnesiac were cutting edge only in so far as Pop music is concerned.

0375413405|5.0|This book has it all.  It's easy to understand and follow.  It's a lovely book.  However, for the casual cook like myself, this didn't fit the bill as far as a few nice, simple French dishes I could experiment with and put together in a few hours.  These are delicious recipes, but they are complicated and time consuming.
B00008H2LB|5.0|what everyone thinks. Ive liked Linkin Park for a while now and I can say that this album is amazing. Some people say that it sounds just like Hybrid Theory, and well, they must be deaf. The music and lyrics have grown and matured. Linkin Park has definatly triumphed to their true fans with this album.
6305546789|5.0|This is still like the best horror flick ever.  I never get tired of it.  I am just glad I didn't tramp around in high school, drink, and live in Haddonfield because Jamie Lee's trampy hard-drinking friends meet some pretty gruesome ends!  I love her dark-haired friend whose dad is the cop.  She rocks.  Too bad she didn't realize locked car doors don't unlock on their own.  Anyway, even after 20 some odd years, this movie still scares me to death every time I watch it.  I love it.  There is some boobies, a ton of suspense, and, actually, a lot of humor.  I loved it and highly recommend it to anyone who likes a horror flick, and if you do, then I am sure you have already seen it, but if not, or you haven't seen it for years, try it again.  It's not dated.<br />The DVD is fine.  There was a special edition out with loads of extras, but I missed it and I think now it's gone.  Try to track one of those down, the one I have doesn't really have any extras, just a few trailors, and you can select wide v. full screen.  This is the movie you want extras.  But the DVD itself is fine.
B00009UW0N|4.0|This new 25th Anniversary edition is nice to have simply for the new extra features included. However, in my opinion it's not the best DVD release as far as the picture is concerned. I own the Halloween DVD limited edition which contained two DVD's presenting both the theatrical and extended TV versions of Halloween. The picture is quite clear in both versions and the colors were correct in the older editions. You can still purchase both of the old Halloween DVD versions in either the Theatrical or Extended version. These previous versions had the approval of Halloween's director of photography Dean Cundey. I find it hard to believe that this new 25th Anniversary DVD had the approval of Carpenter or Cundey.<br />It seems that in this new 25th Anniversary edition there's been some color recalibration and color grading. The colors are different in some scenes and not really for the better. My main complaint is with the daytime scenes. The color appears faded and way too bright. The blues and oranges appear strongly \\"muted\\" and it detracts somewhat from the sinister feeling of the movie. IT LOOKS LIKE SPRINGTIME IN HALLOWEEN NOW!!! This goes against the look that Carpenter and Cundey originally aimed for. The picture itself may be a bit clearer than the older DVD releases, but I'd personally prefer that to this newer color transfer. This is why I only give this new DVD edition a 4 star rating.<br />With that aside I'll comment on the extras for this new version compared to the old versions. The new packaging isn't up to the caliber of the old Hologram DVD artwork. It's nice to have a full-length commentary by John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis and Debra Hill. It appears to be the old Criterion Laserdisc commentary which was recorded in the early 1990's. It's amazing that Anchor Bay was able to use this since Criterion rarely gives out access to their materials. This was something not on any of the older DVD's and is a very welcome addition. The two new featurettes are also excellent extras with a wealth of information. The first featurette runs at 87 minutes which is practically a movie within itself. The second featurette runs about 10 minutes, with P.J. Soles and others revisitng the original Halloween locations as they appear today. There was a featurette on the old DVD's which is not included on this new DVD. There were some things that were covered in that one which are not covered in the new feturettes. Also included are the Theatrical Trailer, TV Spots, Radio Spots, Poster/Still Gallery, and Talent Bios. Most of these are the same features as contained on the old DVD's. The new DVD-ROM features include the original screenplay (NICE!) and some screen savers for your computer. It would have been nice to have a new DTS soundtrack option, but the 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is still well done.<br />In closing, this isn't the end-all definitive home version of Halloween. I'll keep my old DVD version simply to have the extended version of Halloween, and with the correct color presentations. I'm not saying I prefer the extended TV version, it's just nice to have for fans.<br />I'd still recommend this 25th Anniversary edition to fans of Halloween simply for the new extra features. Even though the picture is hardly perfect, most viewers shouldn't notice it too much.so excellent extras with a wealth of information.

0316666343|3.0|The book was good. I think the investigation with Mr. Harvey was going good and then it stops...But maybe in real life that is how is works for many people. <br />What I liked it the most is the ending. When the family gets together, Susie is in peace. It is a message that the loved ones who leave us are at peace when the living find peace...As long as we continue to grieve and not live our life on Earth, neither do our loved ones enjoy their perfect Heaven....
6304698623|5.0|Both this movie and the book are very enjoyable, but they are also VERY different, so if you love the book you should probably enjoy the movie as an independent masterpiece.<br />In the book Sara is a strong-minded girl who believes that she should behave like a real princess, kind and calm and polite, even when facing severe adversities and insufferable people.  She also loves to pretend that things are better than they looks like, which gives her strength in the most desolate circumstances.  Overall the Sara in the book has a very distinct character that makes the book very intriguing and helpful, but she appears so much older than her real age that she doesn't look very realistic (but that does not make the novel less enjoyable).<br />In the movie, Sara is closer to girls in real life.  She is still as soothing and kind as in the novel, but she does lose her strength and calmness momentarily, even does some mischief, just like an ordinary child.  The prevailing message in the movie is rather &quot;all girls are princesses, whether they are ... or ...&quot;, which roughly means the same as &quot;all people are born equal&quot;, as portrayed by Sara's friendship with not-so-clever Ermengarde, not-so-young Amelia, black servant Becky, Indian servant Ram Dass, poor people in the streets, the rats in the attic, and even the not-so-friendly Lavinia at the end.  This theme is very different from the one in the book, but it stands on its own.  In the movie Sara also pretends or &quot;make believes&quot;, but the portrayal of these things seems to be a bit weak --- anyway it is hard to make these things believable in a movie.  The scene where Sara hugs Lavinia for their reconcilation at the end is really touching, but I don't particular like that end for Miss Minchin.  Making such an old woman do such drudgery is a bit less than humane, and she really isn't THAT bad anyway, just rather snobbish and cold-hearted like many other businssmen.  I prefer that she gets some other job that doesn't involve dealing with other people, such as accounting or typewriting, where the wickedness in her character won't do any harm.<br />Enough for the movie's plot and you can see that I have mixed feelings about that.  However, as far as picture and sound quality is concerned this movie is really a masterpiece.  The colors are vivid, the music rememberable, and the snow dance scene is beautiful beyond imagination.  These make the movie worthy just for its &quot;loveliness&quot;.<br />Note that this review is based on the translated Video CD version of the movie, which is the only version available in mainland China, but I think everything in this review should also be relevent for the original DVD version.
B00008977N|1.0|I'm very careful about the DVD's I buy, but I wish to god I could return this one. A total waste of money. <br />I've long felt that Peter Gabriel's albums are so overproduced that they lose any sense of real musicianship, but his live albums reveal just how good his musicians are without all the studio tricks. Characteristically, though, his &quot;live&quot; recordings are still prone to what he calls &quot;cheating,&quot; meaning lots of overdubs.<br />I have my doubts that any of the vocals on this DVD were actually performed live in any concert setting. It's not unusual for concert films to be culled from several performances, but you have to really search for evidence of it in Talking Heads' amazing Stop Making Sense. Here, there seems to be no concern for what makes live performance lifelike. The fact that at one point all the musicians leave the stage and the music keeps playing pretty much says it all. Why does he even bother bringing them along?<br />The visuals in this concert are artful and well mounted and, in most cases, smartly filmed. There is one sequence (Digging In The Dirt) which is most obviously not a live performance, but in some ways it's the most honest part of this film. This is not a record of anything that ever existed in real time--it's a poorly refined addendum to what must have been an extraordinary event.<br />I've owned the audio cd of this show for several years. It's wonderfully produced, allowing for studio overdubs, but the mix on this DVD is apalling and completely unprofessional. I've listened to it in both 2.0 and 5.0 and find it totally mystifying. The volume keeps shifting, usually dropping out every time the vocals come in, meaning there's a continuous volume differentiation that is maddening. <br />My tenuous respect for Peter Gabriel has fallen by the wayside. Rent this falsified document if you must, but don't bother adding it to your library.
B0000AC8N4|5.0|At first, Dexter Gordon's \\"Our Man in Paris\\" seems an unlikely choice for the RVG series, because Rudy Van Gelder didn't record it in the first place. Unlike most Blue Note albums which were recorded in Van Gelder's studios, first in Hackensack then Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, this one was recorded in Paris (5/23/63) by Claude Ermelin, as Dexter Gordon two years earlier had traded in his New York address for France. Maybe Mr. Van Gelder thought that through remastering, he could fix the minor sound deficiencies that had plagued an otherwise perfect album. Well, the new issue does sound fantastic! This date, featuring fellow expatriates Bud Powell and Kenny Clarke, along with Pierre Michelot, was originally supposed to feature Kenny Drew on piano, and a program of all new material penned by Gordon. Powell was called in at the last minute, but he wanted to only record standards on such short notice. In classic jazz fashion, a potential disaster turned into one of the most magical performances in the Blue Note catalog. Welcome back from Paris Dex, and Rudy thanks for adding your two francs.
0553382179|4.0|I enjoyed this book so much!  Yes, it isn't about being perfect...but rather getting up and doing something, anything to get started. Working consistantly for 15 mins at a time doesn't seem like much, but you would be surprised at what can be done.  Simply starting with the kitchen sink is just a place to start, the kitchen is the center of the home and does set the tone for the rest of the house.  <br />I would suggest this book to anyone responsible for the upkeep of a home.
B0000A5A0T|4.0|Wait a minute, I already own \\"The Ultimate Blue Train\\" so what is this CD supposed to be, Super-Ultimate?!  Clearly with this reissue of John Coltrane's classic \\"Blue Train,\\" the folks at Blue Note have returned to the mindset they had during the deletion-happy, series-slashing days of the late 1980s (when they reportedly deleted the majority of that year's jazz releases to make way for a then new Garth Brooks album).  I am delighted that Rudy Van Gelder has been able to remaster one of the greatest sessions that he ever recorded, but that fact alone does not warrant another reissue.  \\"The Ultimate Blue Train\\" was worth buying to replace the original CD -- it had remastered sound, two bonus tracks, and a multi-media component featuring rare photographs and more.  It was what CDs were supposed to be!  Yet another CD reissue of the same material that we all are supposed to buy again, that furthermore confuses potential new jazz buyers, is not!  The only reason I give this CD four stars and not less is because this album contains some of the greatest jazz ever made.  I love John Coltrane, but I hate manipulative marketing.
6304119046|5.0|Citizen Kane <BR>Movie Review<br />Citizen Kane was filmed in 1941 and was directed by, produced by, and starred Orson Wells.  Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Wells wrote the screenplay.  In the opening scene there was a lot of symbolism such as wrought iron fences, fog, a moat, a light on the hill from the house and the light going out when the main character of the film died.    It was during this scene Charles Foster Kane, the main character, speaks the word \\"Rosebud\\" and then drops a glass globe that shatters on the floor.  Just before it shatters, the viewer looks inside at the falling snow and then Kane dies.  The story is based on the true story about William Hearst, newspaper tycoon.  <br />I give this movie 5 stars because from start to finish this movie keeps you intrigued with one thought and that is, \\"What is Rosebud.\\"  Orson Wells never overworked any scene as so many movies do nowadays.  The movie was filmed with a lot of symbolism which keeps the movie viewer's interest and also feeds the viewer's thoughts well beyond the length of the movie. <br />The movie takes you back to the time just before Charles Foster Kane became one of the world's richest people in history.  Charles Kane's story began when a boarder could not pay for his rent at a boarding home owned by Mr. & Mrs. Kane.  The boarder gave Mary Kane a deed to an old abandoned mine for payment. The mine was later called the Colorado Lode Gold Mine and the 3rd richest gold mine known in the world.  Mary Kane took $50,000 of that fortune for her and her husband.  She then gave custody of her son, Charles Foster Kane, to Mr. Thatcher, a banker from New York, who would manage the fortune and boy until he was 25 years old.<br />Kane bought the New York Inquirer and immediately became publisher and printed news by \\"his definition.\\"  Some called Kane a \\"yellow journalist.  Mr. Jedediah Leland, a schoolmate, \\"best buddy\\" and dramatic critic for the Inquirer stated, \\"I was his oldest friend,\\" and Mr. Kane \\"never gave anything away,\\" \\"newspaper was his life...and he loved himself,\\" but Kane \\"didn't know how to love anyone.\\"<BR> <BR>After Kane's death the big question on everyone's mind was \\"who or what was Rosebud.\\"  A newspaper reporter interviewed Kane's 2nd wife, Kane's General Manager, and even his butler-in-charge at his well known estate, Xanadu, but no one knew what the significance of Rosebud was.<br />Charles Kane loved to collect beautiful things and among those collections were statues, paintings, and pictures that could have filled 10 museums.  Kane's collection was worth billions.  Charles Foster Kane had the 6th largest private fortune in the world.    Even though he could buy anything that he ever wanted, Kane was never able to buy love and happiness, consequently Charles Kane died alone.<br />During the liquidation of Kane's estate the packers and movers were told to burn items that had no significant worth.  The camera zooms in to see a man throwing a boy's sled into the furnace that had Rosebud painted on it.  The sled was the only possession left of Kane's boyhood and memories when he went sledding in the snow.  Most importantly though, the sled symbolized the time in Charles's life when he had a mother and father and a home and when he was loved.

B000096IB6|3.0|The Daredevil of the comics has thrilled readers for decades.  This Daredevil was a pre-politically correct visually challenged crime fighter who did not allow his constant exposure to riffraff affect his inherent moral compass.  The conversion to the movie Daredevil by director Mark Steven Johnson gives a glooomier red-costumed figure who has to deal with a continual need to re-evaluate just why he needs to swing from rooftops to catch criminals.  <br />In DAREDEVIL Ben Affleck is Matt Murdock, lawyer by day, and Daredevil by night.  The first fifteen minutes sets the basic philosophical tone about the need for vengeance.  The 12 year old Matt is bullied by his peers (One of whom is Robert Iler, a teen actor from the Sopranos who in real life was arrested for mugging) and has to run from them.  After he suffers the loss of his sight, his other senses compensate so that when these bullies return, Matt thoroughly thrashes them.  Matt could have simply absorbed their taunts, but as they were walking away, Matt manhandles them, thereby setting in motion an emotional kinetic force that demands blow for blow.  When his father, an unretired boxer who refuses to throw a fight is killed for his lack of co-operation, Matt again is faced with choosing vengeance or allowing the law to handle matters. <br />  Unsurprisingly, Matt chooses the former. To this unhealthy desire for vengeance, he adds vigilantism.  When a rapist is unjustly found not guilty, Matt as Daredevil chases him down and throws him in front of a train, killing him.  Finally, when his girlfriend Elektra (Jennifer Garner) seeks revenge, first on him for thinking he was the killer of her father then on a hitman Bullseye (maniacally played by Collin Farrell), the entire question of the justness of seeking revenge is muddied by the glee of those who find it and their sorrow afterwards.  <br />Fortunately for the audience, DAREDEVIL is not a visual tract on philosophy or ethics.  It is, instead, a visual feast that presents the viewer with nonstop action sequences that are so over the top that their logical flaws get lost in the shuffle.  Director Johnson would have you believe that the ability to make astounding leaps and impossible dives is not limited to the hero, which in any case is hard enough to swallow.  Both Bullseye and Electra have no problem performing the kind of aerial stunts made popular in HIDDEN DRAGON, CROUCHING TIGER.  It is this trio's ability to fly on command that stands at the core of viewer interest.  This other nonsense about the need for vengeance is window dressing, tossed in only to give a break between action sequences.  On that visual basis alone, DAREDEVIL is worth the price of a rental, but for more substantial filmed analyses of introspection, this will not do.
6305313687|4.0|First off one of the best things about this movie was Edward Norton's performance. In my opinion he's one of the best actors in hollywood. <BR>. The plot is somewhat predictable but this doesn't subtract from the powerful theme. This story attempts to delve into the social tensions between minority groups and focuses specifically on the circumstances and environment that create someone like Derek, a guy who becomes fraught with hatred after his father is murdered by black drug dealers. The movie doesn't begin there; rather, it gradually traces the circumstances that influenced Derik's racist thinking. <br />I wouldn't say there are any political motifs here. Some may call this \\"liberal propaganda\\" but I'm not quite sure that is the case. Sure some of the racists held 'conservative' views but I'm against Affirmative action, for welfare reform, and a proponent for individual responsibility. Does that make me a racist? Absolutely not. Besides the fact that I'm Mexican-American, I do not think that because I hold these views I therefore think that everyone has equal opportunity (the level of opportunity accorded is dependent on social class) and that social inequities are necessarily the result of indolence, racial inferiority, or personal irresponsibility. I personally found this film to be very interesting. Racism is not a black and white problem. Racism comes from all sides.<BR>I recommend this film.
0385504209|5.0|First of all, this has been one of the best books I have read. The flow of the story and the suspense are two great reasons for picking up this book. But the fact that this book has been well researched and is able to mix real life with fiction made me like it even more. This is a great gift. Anyone who picks up this book won't want to stop reading until it's over with.
B000002J03|5.0|To say that Led Zeppelin does not deserve to be as highly praised as they are, I think it would be a crime against humanity to deny people from this work. Now, I admit, I have not heard all of Zep's albums, but I still love this.<br />It kicks off with 'Whole Lotta Love', which I think was released live as a single. Nevertheless, it's still a great album, and I love the way it goes from speaker to speaker in the middle.<br />Next is 'What Is and What Should Never Be', which, at the beginning, seems to be one of their slower songs. But then it kicks in, again doing the speaker-to-speaker transition.<br />'The Lemon Song' has some similar lyrics to Jimi Hendrix's 'Killing Floor', and has some interesting lyrics also.<br />'Thank You' slows the alum down, and I enjoy the track. But, of course, it is shattered by 'Heartbreaker', which is a great track as well. 'Living Loving Maid' flows with the end of Heartbreaker, and is the albums shortest track. 'Ramble On' starts of all acoustic, then starts to rock. Nothing needs to be said about 'Moby Dick', but I do enjoy it, and you have the closer 'Bring It On Home', which is really cool.<br />So, if you're a fan of Zeppelin, need this one last album to complete your collection, or you just want some good 'ol fashioned rock, get this.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this film at a drive in(remember those?)when it 1st came out! I didn't really know what to expect except the small amount of knowledge(that it was a Horror-Zombie<BR>movie)that I got from trailer's on tv. WOW! What a pleasant suprise, &amp; scare! Yep scare; this was probably the last Horror film I saw that did scare me!<br /> I took a girlfriend w/me to the drive-in that nite. There was another 'horror' film on 1st, but because &quot;Evil Dead&quot; was such a great film &amp; suprise I cannot recall the other film. About 1/3 of the way through the film, we had an incredible,(but thankfully very brief)lightening &amp; thunderstorm descend upon the drive-in! The lightening was so intense for several mins that it actually enhanced the overall 'spooky' feeling of this film! The girl simply kept her eye's covered with her hand, after the 1st violent act occured!!<br /> Anyway, Sam Raimi(imo)hasn't made any decent films(Except &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; I didn't care for &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;)since this one, even though my 22 year old son tells me another 'Zombie-horror film' is in the works from Raimi! Why not? He went on to make a ton of money, &amp; could have used some of it to do what he does best, make another true horror film! But no. We get schlock like<BR>&quot;Spiderman&quot; &amp; all the other junk he's directed.<br /> Where have all the smart young director's of real horror films gone? Why not make a horror film 1st, take chances like Raimi did, &amp; experiment. I can't recall what &quot;Evil Dead&quot; originally cost..my son told me, &amp; it was a ridiculously low figure, a figure that most independent film director's can work wonders with if they're truly talented! Another good example is Robert Rodriguez' &quot;El Mariachi&quot;, or Tarrentino's &quot;Resevouir Dog's&quot;. Now the last was a higher budget independent film but you get the idea. Where are the director's willing to take a chance on showing their genius(like Raimi did here)in a horror film.<br /> The performance by the cast is phenomenal, including that by Bruce Cambell. However, the unique placement of the camera's(the overhead tracking shot while Bruce is walking or running through the house, along with the 'wooshing' sound each time he passes<BR>through a door, reminds me of Scorsese's great end seaquence of the brilliant &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, when Travis has killed everyone &amp; saved Jodie, &amp; sits on the couch while the police arrive. Martin<BR>actually cut out a huge section of the upstairs floor to get his shot, &amp; I would imagine Raimi learned his technique from that?)and the excellent very creepy, segments in the house's basement, along with the great use of fog &amp; gore make this probably the greatest Zombie film ever made.<br /> I sure hope my son's right? Raimi needs to return to 'what got him going in the 1st place', &amp; new,1st time director's NEED to give the Horror genre a 'shot in the arm' &amp; revive it, by making it their 1st film. One can only hope. What a wonderful, clever well thought out film by a 1st time director&amp; a group of no name actor's! Bravo. But please, we want more.
B0000069DB|5.0|This is the very best version of &quot;Turco&quot; in the market today. Cecilia Bartoli makes a really good &quot;sing lesson&quot; with her Fiorilla, Corbelli is a very funny Geronio, Vargas is a Narciso with a very beautiful voice and De Candia is a Poet really inspiried. Pertusi is good, but no enough, He's maybe boring.<BR>Chailly conducts very well with a great chorus and a great orchresta.  Do you want a second option for a good &quot;Turco&quot;?

B000084T18|2.0|What happens when you take Dr Dre's gangsta's voice/lyrics and cross it with Eminem's deminor/\\"witty\\" word play?<br />To tell you the truth, I don't really know. I guess you get 50 cent.<br />50 cent: to be truthful, is pretty wack. That isn't really a bad thing - But his gun tokin' lyrics have a funny sence to hit.<BR>Songs like \\"U Not Like Me\\" have this funny personality, but gangsta lyrics.<br />Maybe because 50 cent has expierenced the \\"thug\\" life - it's just a funny subject to him? Can't be taken seriously? Perhaps. But that is mainly why this cd gets 2 stars - Because he takes \\"used to be\\" serious subjects, like being shot, stabed, robed, put in jail, oppressed against - and makes it into a funny subject manner. The last \\"real\\" subject that rap has left, and 50 cent is f*ckin' around with it - Tryin' to make it sound like its no big deal - When it *reality* it is a big deal.<br />And this is why he will never be 2pac. 2pac took what happen in his life seriously. He took like a lesson - and expressed it seriously. <BR>50 cent on the other hand, is talking like taking 9 shots is funny. That to me is pretty wack.<br />But other then that. His \\"dumb found\\" flow is catchy. The beats are cool and catchy as well. \\"High all the Time\\" \\"U Not Like ME\\" \\"Back Down\\" are pretty good songs. Personally - I didn't like \\"In Da Club\\" - and Eminem's producing is just wack. Whats with all the strings and trumpets? <br />In conclusion - An entertaining album - But 50 needs to wise up, if expects to stay hot.

B00005OAIE|4.0|Normally, on a CD that has 2 or 3 big hits, the other 9 songs on the CD are poorly written filler material.  However, Mayer backs up the billboard charts with equally good songs.  No song on his CD falls into the category of filler, and all add to the overall quality of a nice, enjoyable CD. Mayer's relaxed singing style and folksy approach to his songs make this a great CD for background music, and although the lyrics are not the most thought provoking, inspiring words out there, the overall quality of the CD grounds it as one of the best albums I've seen for a while.  It's perfect listening music to set in the background around the house and a great takealong for the commute to and from work.<BR>Replayability:  5 out of 5<BR>Lyrics:  3 out of 5<BR>Uniqueness: 4 out of 5<BR>Song variety:  5 out of 5<BR>Overall:  4 out of 5<BR>Favorite tracks:  My stupid mouth (3), Neon (5) St. Patrick's Day (14)

0062502182|5.0|When I finished the book about five minutes ago, I was immediately compelled to write a review for it before I go back and read it again.  It's simplicity and brevity harks back to the Prince and like that book, its message is ageless.   Very few books leave such a feeling in me, this one definitely did, no doubt.   I recommend this book to anyone who is open enough to question their ultimate destination and the path that takes them there.   Thank you Paulo Coelho for your refreshing novel!
B00008K7AM|5.0|I did not go to see this in the theater because I was thinking, &quot;okay this is just another Rob Schneider attempt at being funny&quot;  In fact the only thing I had previously seen with him in it that I thought used his talent correctly was The Waterboy.  Anyway, I was very surprised by seriousness of the beginning movie setup which was markedly different than the rest.<BR>Lets face it people... fart jokes, body oder and bodily functions and yes even homosexuality still work as comedic fodder.  This isn't your typical Chevy Chase pratfall or Three Stooges romp.  It addresses real issues that kids have faced in high school and spins it like a top to exaggerate the complete nonsense of how cruel the popular people are to those with lesser looks or little money.  The movie did not drag (in my humble opionion) as other reviewers had said. Instead it moved from one carefully, sometimes predictable, but always hysterical scene to the next.<br />If you need to chuckle, rent something else, this one will make you laugh until you wet your pants. (Just pray there's a nice attendant to help you out afterward)

B00009ATIX|5.0|This 2002 version of SOLARIS is everything the 1972 Russian version wasn't. Indeed, this latest release resonates with me more and more as I dwell upon it.<br />Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a psychiatrist going through the daily motions. Then, he receives a video message from his friend Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) beseeching his help out on the space research station circling the planet Solaris. Gibarian doesn't specify the problem, but two astronauts have already perished.<br />On his arrival at Solaris, Kelvin discovers that Gibarian has since committed suicide. Only the station's commander, Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis), and Snow (Jeremy Davies) remain alive. Gordon is locked in her cabin, reluctant to come out. Snow seems in a world of his own, curiously semi-detached from reality.<br />Chris is soon confronted with the presence of Visitors, physical manifestations created by the planet Solaris of humans residing within the memories of the space station crew. For example, there's the young \\"son\\" of Gibarian, and the \\"brother\\" of Snow. We never learn who Gordon's Visitor is.<br />Kelvin awakens one day to his own Visitor, his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone), who'd previously committed suicide back on Earth after an acrimonious verbal confrontation with her spouse. Chris, who loved her dearly, has been weighed down with her loss.<br />The power of the SOLARIS story lies in the concept of a life form created from the another's psyche. As Rheya puts it to Chris, her existence and essence is solely dependent on his memory of her. The viewer watches as Rheya mentally discovers who she is via Kelvin's memories, fed to her (and the viewer) in flashback form by, presumably, the planet's intelligence. Poignantly, Rheya - a tragic figure - is profoundly saddened that all she'll ever be is determined by Kelvin's recollections, that she'll never know the rest of herself. Chris, on the other hand, mired in the twin emotions of guilt and love, clings to his resurrected \\"wife\\". As he admits to her, \\"I don't know anymore if you're truly Rheya; I only see you.\\"<br />The 2002 version of this film is, mercifully, 70 minutes shorter than the 169-minute 1972 edition, which dragged on interminably. Plus, the planetary special FX are better, and the interior of the space station doesn't look like something clunky out of the Soviet 50s. Clooney, who delivers one of his best performances, benefits from being familiar to American audiences, something Donatas Banionis in the earlier Russian release wasn't. McElhone, a relatively unknown actress, has a stunning, mature beauty worthy of any man's obsession. Davis is powerful as Dr. Gordon, a realist who knows what must be done if the station's survivors are to live.

Plus, the planetary special FX are better, and the interior of the space station doesn't look like something clunky out of the Soviet 50s. Clooney, who delivers one of his best performances, benefits from being familiar to American audiences, something Donatas Banionis in the earlier Russian release wasn't. McElhone, a relatively unknown actress, has a stunning, mature beauty worthy of any man's obsession. Davis is powerful as Dr. Gordon, a realist who knows what must be done if the station's survivors are to live.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Well nobody has ever expected that the sweet 17 years girl that singed \\"I am genie in a bottle baby\\" can turn to a woman who will shut everyone`s mounths. Believe me I liked Christina because she was cute before, now I respect and love her because she shows a great talent, brain and more feelings. Stripped is an album that can make you cry, can make you feel sexy, can make you smile and can make you continue living your life. Stripped is the best album I have ever heard. Christina has laways got a class but thats absolutly A! I am sorry to say it but if you think Britney is a pop princess then Christina has to be the \\"all styles\\" queen. You won`t sorry that album will take your heart from the first moment you hear the songs. I love Chris but that is not the reason I write this. She reserves aour aplouds and our respect. I take of my hat to you, Christina!
B00009W0WM|5.0|The new digital transfer from the original nitrites is incredibly clear.  The movie looks better than I have ever seen it.  I haven't checked out the bonus material yet, but I screened the film as soon as I got it, and it looks awesome.
B00003CX96|5.0|This one is well worth owning -- the cycling is absorbing, and while not always realistic, it comes closer than films like American Flyer. I'm a grad student at IU Bloomington, and before I came here this movie was my intro to Bloomington. The Little 500 still is a great spectacle, and this movie captures it well, along with the town-gown tension.
B00005JLRT|4.0|In many ways Nemesis is best Star Trek movie and in others it is not.  For example, the SFX on Nemesis far outstrip First Contact or Inserecction whereas it lacks in storyline as opposed to The Voyage Home.  All in all I was very impressed with Nemesis and would pay good money to buy it.
B000001Y42|4.0|The Limp Bizkit three dollar bill is the best cd in my view.  It is a lot more heavy, and less rap tracks.  If you like the two new cd's, you most likely won't fall in love with this one.  Though if you don't like the new stuff bc it's to soft and mushy get this one.
B000087EY0|5.0|Finally, A Lion King DVD from Disney that has all the songs with the words and some fun games as well. My two year old has learned the words to I Just Cant Wait to Be King, Circle of Life and Hakuna Matata. He has also learned to distinguish various animal tracks from one of the games included. If you are looking for the movie wait for the Special Edition in October, but if your child loves the Lion King and plays the audio tape over and over this is the DVD for you!!
B000000I0J|4.0|There is nothing left after Bombastic Instrumental works such as \\"Incantations\\" or \\"Ommadawn\\".Mike did his first short rock album without long suites and many complicated changes.It is much more catchier but some of emotions that were in his previous albums had gone with the change of style...but it doesn't mean that the music is bad...oh no - the music here is fresh and just wonderfull....<br />The main track is \\"Platinum\\" - about 20 miuntes long suite, but divided into 4 songs...\\"Platinum suite\\" sounds a bit mechanic but is a really impressive work - especially \\"Charleston\\" part with crazy trumpets,some ghost choir and great bass line - the other parts are interesting also and Mike proves here that almost everything that he tries to play turns into gold...And also we can hear him on backing vocals here...<br />\\"Sally\\" is a nice love song, typical seventies pop style,nothing special but listenable and fun - the interesting story is that \\"sally\\"...is not the original song - Real \\"sally\\" was kind of a joke and was too silly that right after the premiere of this album Virgin records forced mike to put something more representative for the album - so he did and recorded the song \\"Into wonderland\\" that became second \\"sally\\" -The new remastered edition\\" contains \\"Into wonderland\\" instead of amusing original mix...<br />\\"I got rhythm\\" (Cover of gershwin's track) is another nice and romantic pop ballad, but features very expressive guitar solo and more interesting lyrics about how MIke is happy after finding new way and being in peace with himself...<br />The most outstanding tracks \\"Woodhenge\\" and \\"Punkadiddle\\" - first one is very dark and has a bit nervous atmosphere.strange sounds,creepy guitar and scary loud sound of Tubular bells at the end...everytime when i listen to it i have visions of some old abandoned house in a dark forest,witches and stuff like that...creeeepppyyy. While \\"Woodhenge\\" has intensive atmosphere, \\"Punkadiddle\\" is fun and fast rocker with \\"OI!!!\\" screams and catchy guitars.Also some fake audience in some moments...nice fast rocker tune...it is kind of a joke from Punk music that went high on charts and eliminated more progressive and ambitious artists like Mike off the top...<br />\\"Platinum\\" is definitly not as full of emotions and sadness as previous albums - it's much more catchier,lighter and fun to listen - very impresive music, full of positive vibrations...it sounds different too - while before in almost every moment 7 instruments and more were playing, here sometimes it is only Bass,guitar,keyboard and drums - simple but effective rock instruments...Another impressive work from Mike Oldfield....
0060512806|5.0|Stephenson had me riveted throughout the book.  He combined humor, action, and technology masterfully, and switches between viewpoints flawlessly.<br />Without a doubt it is on my list of great hard Sci-Fi.<br />P.S. I loved it so much I went out and bought a copy, which, considering me, is saying something!
0142004235|5.0|I'm amazed that it took, of all people, Oprah to encourage me to re-read this Steinbeck novel.  But, after 35 years, I bought and read the new Oprah-recommended book, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it, particularly because of the vivid descriptions of early 20th Century-era Salinas, California, which is close to where I live.  Steinbeck is a very talented writer.  Because he was born in the early 1900s, he had a good feel for that era, and even gives an interesting insight into 19th century America with his descriptions of the childhoods Adam and Charles Trask, and their father.  If you are ever in Salinas, be sure to check out the Steinbeck Museum on Main Street.  Also, after reading this book, you might want to also read Steinbeck's depression-era masterpiece, \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and check out the 1939 John Ford movie starring Henry Fonda.  Steinbeck did a lot of screenwriting in Hollywood, and had a hand in the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" script, as well.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I wanted this cd the moment I heard the theme song while watching the movie for the first time.  In the cd the theme song is very repetitive but with many different variations, so if you don't like the theme song don't buy the cd.  I was a little disappointed that it only lasts 45 minutes, there might have been some scenes left out.  However, it is very well orchestrated, you can imagine exactly what would be going on in the movie while listening to the music.  Track #5 &quot;Swords Crossed&quot; is wonderful, you can see the &quot;skeletons&quot; cleaning the deck in time with the loud beat.  I call it the skeleton musical :)  All in all this is a very good buy.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Written in the vein of action movies like Gladiator, in which the score is a mixture of period and contemporary, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an incredible thrill ride which never fails to impress.  Klaus Badelt instantly moves up in my estimation as a composer usually I am enamored with the statesmen of film music like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith, along with the excellent Hans Zimmer, but Badelt certainly makes a strong case for himself here.  I enjoyed his score for Time Machine, but Pirates of the Caribbean is simply mindblowingly fun to listen too.  It is among the best scores of the year, a bold action score with just a hint of 17th century cues to give it authenticity, rather like James N. Howard's Treasure Planet.  I would recommend this score to anyone who enjoys good action music.  It's not Korngold but then if it was, then the music would not have fit the movie.
B00006AW2M|4.0|A stupid name for an album, particularly when it´s not in the least bit nasty or dangerous. That, the barmy costumes and the appaling mistake of Sing This All Together at the end of side one are the things that gave this record a bad name. Apart from those, and of course the endless jam on Gomper, this thing can be played from beginning to end painlessly.<br />If it wasn´t for Bill<BR>You may not want to throw In Another Land so wantonly away. Maybe you´d be careful to put it in the bin marked `plastic only´, or if you really can´t cast off anything belonging to the Stones then why not scratch the record so that it skews from Citadel straight to 2000 Man. If this appears blasphemous then try to pretend it´s Bill Wyman singing instead of somebody with a new effect pedal who´s just walked in off the street whilst everyone was having lunch.<br />People were very annoyed with the Stones back then. And there was a lot of sneering when this came out. But if you don´t insist on comparing it to Sgt Pepper, and nowadays you shouldn´t- because all this happened nearly 40 years ago and fresh thinking is positive thinking and good against encroaching senility, you can enjoy the way it is.<br />She´s a Rainbow and 2000 Light Years are the best songs and deserve to be called classics. The latter in addition ranks as one of the greatest works the Stones ever did. For it´s texture and structure, imagination and atmosphere they should all have been knighted on the spot.
6304973187|5.0|Romeo + Juliet is a beautiful film. The camera work is so...diverse and completely artistic. And the story line is so lovely. I love the way they modernized it, but kept the old way of talking and the original script (though some of it was new). My favorite scene, by far, was the part after Romeo shot Tybalt and goes to Juliet's room to be with her. The passion and romance is completely there. You can feel it in your bones. All in all, I find this to be a very romantic movie. It's very lovely and you should definitely own it.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Nemesis is better than its predecessor Insurrection.  It also boasts the most extended space battle scene of any of the Star Trek films.<br />Unfortunately, the plot suffers from serious logic gaps.  The Romulan generals grow impatient with Shinzon (Private Twombly in 'Black Hawk Down')for not attacking the Federation immediately.  Then, when he is engaged in combat against the Enterprise, two Romulan ships enter the fray to assist Picard.  Why would they turn against Shinzon after assisting his rise to power?  And would a Romulan commander use a slang term like &quot;We are dead in the water&quot; after her ship is knocked out of commission?<br />We can understand why Shinzon is mad at the Romulans, but his beef with the Federation is never made clear.  Star Trek fans deserved better than this lazily written story. A new creative team is needed to breathe life into this franchise.<br />Star Trek is supposed to be about exploring new worlds and meeting new life forms.. but the films appear to have strayed away from this concept.  If there is going to be another Star Trek film, let's hope the Enterprise returns to its original mission.

0812550706|5.0|Personally, I had never even heard of this book until a friend recommended it to me. But when I picked it up, I could not put it down. Very few books ever had that effect on me. <br />What makes this book so great is its characters. The main character Ender was especially interesting. He was drafted to attend &quot;Battle School&quot; at a very young age learn to lead the human race against the alien &quot;Buggers&quot;, and was separated from his family. He was bullied by his brother at home, and bullied at school (both at his regular school and at the &quot;Battle School&quot;), but he eventually becomes the reluctant hero in mankind's fight against the &quot;buggers&quot;.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys compelling storytelling and characters.

0156027321|2.0|This is a classic case of overpromising and underdelivering.  After reading some of the rave reviews here, we chose this book for our reading club, since it seemed to include a number of different themes and ideas for discussion.  Unfortunately, it proved to be rather thin on both counts.  <br />One of the real disappointments was the lack of real, substantial religion and faith in this book.  Pi is described as a boy who is drawn to his native Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam simulatneously.  But there is no mention of what draws him, aside from a couple of nice men, and pretty accoutrements.  No mention of what each religion was lacking which drew him to the others, or how he reconciled their contradictory elements.  And this is just one of many disappointments.  <br />Worth reading. But don't expect too much.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Wow!  This was my reaction about a minute into listening to what should(and in my humble opinion is) become the album of the year.   After the breakup of At The Drive In, I must admit I was a bit crushed by the prospect of not hearing anything new from Omar Rodriguez Lopez(lead guitar) who I considered to be an innovator of guitar rock in the late 90's.  Little did I know, the passing of A.T.D.I. not only spawned Sparta(another off-shoot of A.T.D.I.) who put out a strong record, but what could be the best new band of the decade, The Mars Volta.  I have not taken this CD out of my player since I got it, and I can tell you this, I'm not even close to taking it out.  This record moves back and forth from Latin rhythyms, to punk, to flat out rock and back again.  This record is like what would happen if you put Santana, David Bowie, Rush and Fugazi in a blender a let it rip.  I really can't say enough about this album, the playing of Flea and Jon Theodore redefines what a rhythym section should sound like in the modern rock era.  The album, inspired by the suicide of Julio Venegas(a free spirited artist from El Paso who was a friend of Cedric and Omar) is to me an instant classic.  If you are the kind of person who enjoys rock that pushes the boundaries as far as they can go, this album was sent down from the Gods for you!  Run...don't walk...to your local record store and lay down the cash for TMV...I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!
B000068R1X|5.0|When people say that this album has been remixed, they are being misleading.  It has not been remixed as in having Ozzy sing to different music or anything like that.  The original mix of Bark at the Moon was a bit off in places and they have fixed that with this release.  To demonstrate what I mean, listen to the title track on any previous release and then listen to this new version.  The bass, guitar, and drums are all much clearer and are heard together, whereas on the original version(s) the bass sounded more drowned out by the guitar.  There are a few other minor differences, such as the bell at the beginning of Centre of Eternity sounds a little different and on You're No Different Ozzy's vocals do not have a heavy echo effect like on the original (they are not re-recorded and are the exact same vocals, just with the effect removed).  The same is true for the laugh on the title track (it no longer has an echo effect but is otherwise the same).  These differences aside, this is a very good version of this album with a much higher sound quality than all previous releases.  I prefer this version of the album.  Unlike Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman, the 2002 remaster of this album does not have re-recorded drum and bass tracks, but is the original recording.  Nothing has been re-recorded, only arranged slightly different (in a way that does not negatively affect the album).  Buy this album and ignore the bad reviews!
0316174483|5.0|I love to be creative when sending out birthday cards and notes.  The characters that you can create with Ed's books make you feel like you have an artistic flair...even if you failed art in grade school.  What is nice is that there are a variety of ways to use the materials and make your own versions of cartoons by incorporating different faces, etc.  I bought the first book by Ed for my son when he was in gradeschool and I promptly hid it...why should he have all of the fun?  You can make the prints in plain black ink and use colored markers to make the pictures pop. It is well worth the $.
B00008EY9G|4.0|I have always been a sucker for a good thriller, a film that keeps you guessing, throws in red herrings, steers you in the wrong direction and gives you an ending you just didn't see coming. `Identity' may seem like a standard old slasher thriller and ultimately it is, there's nothing remotely revolutionary, most of it borrows from past ideas and its pretty clichéd but that's the irony of the film. How do you explain the casting of Ray Liotta (`Unlawful Entry') and Rebecca De Mornay (`The Hand that Rocks the Cradle') who both played menacing terrorisers in the 90's and are now on the opposite end of the knife. <br />It's a stormy night in the middle of nowhere and a family have stopped to fix a punctured tyre. As the father (John C. McGinley) is changing the tyre, his wife (Leila Kenzle) is struck by a limo. With the wife gravely ill, the limo driver (John Cusack) attempts to get help and takes the family to a nearby motel. The torrential rainstorm also forces several other disparate people to seek shelter in the motel. Included are a young newlywed couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); a faded actress (Rebecca De Mornay) who was being driven by the limo driver; a prostitute (Amanda Peet) and a cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a killer (Jake Busey). Meanwhile the motel is run by a creepy manager (John Hawkes) who isnt all that he seems.  The rain doesn't let up and the 10 strangers are one by one murdered. Who's the killer? Naturally the killer is the first suspect or is it the creepy motel manager? Could it be a ghost since the motel was built on an ancient burial ground? As the murders intensify, the remaining guests begin to find a connection to the murders. Meanwhile the film intercepts with an eleventh hour hearing for a man (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who is convicted of several murders and is about to be put to death. Is there a connection?<br />James Mangold hasn't really demonstrated his as good of a director as he is for attracting good casts and he usuallyhas more talent than he can utilise with his past films including the star studded `Girl Interrupted' and `Copland'.  In `Identity', again he doesn't use his cast to the greatest effect (De Mornay is doomed pretty early on), but with such an ensemble cast, there isnt the need for any stand out performances because with more characters standing out than others, it puts the film off balance. Everybody is a suspect, nobody is immune, which is very important in figuring out the film because it doesn't go for the easy answer, it makes you think. This all leads to one of those trick endings, which makes you relive the entire film and put it all together. Some may not think it works, but it grabs you and also makes you kick yourself for falling for the detours and tricks the film has in hiding its secret. Its ending is the first conclusion that fooled me since `The Sixth Sense' and `Fight Club' from 1999. <br />Mangold though has a nice visual style and though clichéd, the brutal rainstorm is a necessity for a good thriller, it has an ominous effect that works well here. The motel setting is creepy yet authentic and again there's nothing terribly insightful here, but a standard setting with some killings. The industry has evolved that most thrillers rely on shock tactics to scare audiences, but `Identity' doesn't have any gruesome scenes or outrageous deaths, it's relying on a terrifying and menacing script to creep the audience out and make them think like a good old whodunit. None of the cast are overly great, though Amanda Peet continues to prove herself a great actress while John Cusack and Ray Liotta may be photocopying past performances but they're still good. <br />`Identity' is a good old thriller that deceives the audience, plays with their mind by giving them detours that go nowhere and requires them to try and piece together the mystery; before ultimately giving them an ending they probably would have never guessed. Its these type of films that make the thriller genre one of the best and we like to play detective and its good to get a good old scare and `Identity' is an effective way to exercise our sleuthing capabilities. <br />My rating: 8 ½ / 10
0553382179|5.0|Yes, I am a Flybaby, so Marla's book and website have been very helpful to me.  She made it clear on her site that the book contains most (if not all) of the basic information on her website about setting up zones, Morning and Evening routines and FLYing or &quot;Finally Loving Yourself.&quot;  The book is intended for those who might not have access to a computer or just want to feel something real in their hands as they begin to try to organize their lives and homes.  I would like to reccomend both the book and website, for college students who are having a hard time being away from home and the routines of high school for the first time.  <br />What amazes me about the critiques of Flylady's plan, is that her instructions aren't hard!  It is simple to clean a room for 15 minutes, do some reading for 15 minutes and do a chore for 15 minutes.  The process of developing your routines take time, but it isn't revolutionary.  Marla's &quot;ideas&quot; are similar to those of AA, or other self-help groups, where to change destructive behavior you develop different routines.  I am not comparing disorganization and lack of focus to alcoholism, but our lives are built around routines.  Look around your home, school-life, or work-life--there are so many routines we have which often jeapordize our goals.  Read her website or her book, and she will guide you in recognizing what routines are and aren't working, and the FlyTools, by which to change them.
0385509456|4.0|I love watching human behavior and &quot;why people do what they do&quot;.  This book allowed me to understand in an easy format, how an autistic person thinks.  In many ways, they are way more logical than we are (ie.  when a friend says &quot;nice day, isn't it?&quot;, are they really looking for an answer?  What if YOU&quot;RE not having a nice day?  Should you tell them?  Are they talking about the weather or their experiences of the day?  An autistic person can't compute this grey area and cannot respond to the question.  We never really think like this, but it DOES make sense).  It was VERY entertaining and fascinating - every time I picked up the book I felt disturbed, since I was entering a whole different way of thinking again.  But once I would continue reading, I'd feel very enlightened.  It's very absorbing.  I'd like to meet the narrator now that I understand him, and I want to see if we could have a conversation (now that I know how he thinks and what his rules are for talking to people).  What a challenge that would be.
B00007JVBI|5.0|Truly one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. I don't even mind that you can hear her fingers running on the strings with every cord change because it's so good.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney is still the best, no matter what, in this album she prooves it, it might not be as matture as &quot;britney&quot;, but is definetly better than her previous, songs like: Oops.., stronger, satisfaction, what u see is what you get, lucky and cant make you love me are great, and if that is not enough, it has a song written by her (dear diary), wich is o.k, buy it.
B000002UAO|4.0|I thought this album was better than \\"Revolver\\".  This is packed with great songs like; \\"Drive my Car\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Nowhere man\\", \\"Think For Yourself\\", \\"Girl\\", \\"The Word\\", \\"If I Needed Someone\\" & \\"Run For Your Life\\".  I like mostly every song on here.  Overall, this is a good album, although, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" are my fav. Beatle albums.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Animated or not, Spirited Away is one of THE best films ever made. It might have won an oscar, but it deserved 10. It's an action packed, emotional story with great characters and subplots that'll keep you amused for weeks, if not months. Watch it, even if you don't buy it. At least watch it!
B000005RR0|3.0|When I bought this album, I had been a Rolling Stones fan for some time. But I hadn't gotten into collecting albums on CD yet, as I had only vinyl of \\"Some Girls,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" etc.  When I saw this compilation, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to have all the Stones' major post-ABKCO hits on one CD, and save the cash on buying albums I had on record already.      Well.....not quite. When I first bought it, I liked it a lot. But that changed after a few complete listens.  Although the bigger hits are represented (i e \\"Start Me Up,\\" \\"It's Only Rock N Roll,\\" etc.), and the collection covers a span from '71 to '93, you'll begin to notice that songs like \\"Miss You\\" and \\"Beast of Burden\\" were edited. Also, weaker tracks such as \\"Undercover of the Night\\" and \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" were included, at the expense of fan favorites like \\"Shattered,\\" \\"She's So Cold\\" or even something like \\"Moonlight Mile,\\" which was not on the previous \\"Hot Rocks\\" and illustrates how the Stones progressed from country and blues-inflected rock to the stadium rocker \\"Rock in a Hard Place\\" from '89's \\"Steel Wheels.\\"    At any rate, with the exception of \\"It's Only Rock N Roll,\\" which IMHO was a weak album altogether, buy the old albums first.  Even a beginner should start with something like \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" \\"Tattoo You,\\" or \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" among others, before shelling out the cash for this one. ~LBS
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent's \\"Get Rich or die tryin' CD is probaly the best CD in the year 2003. Theres a perfect mix beetween gangsta songs with raw lyrics, Radio Friendly songs and even a love song in there. The CD starts with 'What up Gangsta' which probaly will be a hit. Then Eminem backs him up in 'Patiently waiting'. After that is the raw 'Many men' and the huge hit 'In da club'. Other good tracks on the CD are if I cant, PIMP, Wangsta and 21 questions. If you are a hip-hop fan pick this up now! And if your not a hip-hop fan pick it up still.<BR>GO 50 ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY!
B00009W0U4|3.0|I'm certainly no film expert, I just like to watch movies.  I did not like this movie.  However, it is one I will certainly never forget.  The backwards Memento-style direction was derivative but very appropriate for the story, exacerbating the tragedy that befalls the trio of characters in one night.  The incredibly graphic scenes in \\"Le Rectum\\" and the underpass walk a thin line between a necessary exposure of the unglamorous violence and depravity in the world and a shocking indulgence in our freedom of expression.  Did we really need to see that rape scene for 9 minutes?  It could have been 9 hours.  It's enough to make you a rape victim advocate and pro-death penalty in one fell swoop.  Word to the wise - unless you can detach yourself from incredibly disturbing content, don't watch this film.<br />The jiggling camera and flashing lights at the end are annoying at best - cheap effects.  But that rape scene is still making me sick to me stomach 3 days after watching it.  Very powerful stuff.
B000007R1M|5.0|I ran into a copy of this album, by Kraftwerk while dropping by the library yesterday. I hadn't heard their work before. I was very impressed. Big names from the late seventies/early eighties, like Tangerine Dream, Jean-Michel Jarre and the whole Gary Numan-Depeche Mode-wave come to mind. These guys really set a standard in the seventies! Very interesting material. Worth listening to attentively.
B000002VCB|3.0|Eve is not a very uplifting album.  As another reviewing wrote, it doesn't take you to another place like Pyramid or Eye in the Sky.  For the most part, it's harsh reality.  When I first saw the cover, I thought the concept was prostitution.  Inside the gatefold is a menacing photo of Eric Woolfson and Alan Parsons standing at the corners of an alley (they do not look like fellows I would want to meet in an alley).   Perhaps it is Adam getting his shots in on that devious Eve.  The most bitter track is &quot;I'd Rather Be a Man&quot; (&quot;You don't fool me with your tinted eyes and make-up,&quot; &quot;You sparkle like a snake,&quot; &quot;I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do,&quot; &quot;I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do&quot;).   Eve is one of my least favorite APP albums, but there are still some good tracks that make the record worthwhile.  The two instrumentals are excellent, although I do not like the &quot;Dum Dee Dee Dum&quot; stuff in the middle of  &quot;Secret Garden.&quot;  &quot;You Lie Down with Dogs&quot; is a good hard rocker.  &quot;I'd Rather Be a Man&quot; is highlighted with some awesome synthesizers.  &quot;You Won't Be There&quot; is a very nice ballad.  &quot;Winding Me Up&quot; is a cute little number (maybe a little too cute considering the lyrics); however, I read in the APP fanzine 'The Avenue' a few years back that this song was Alan Parsons' least favorite.  My least favorite APP song is on this album, but it is not this one.  <br />The second half of the album is rather weak.  I admit, however, that I enjoy the single &quot;Damned If I Do.&quot;  I like to think I do not like that track, but I find myself humming that song as much as, if not more than, &quot;Eye in the Sky,&quot; &quot;Time&quot; and other more memorable APP tunes, so it must have taken hold of me.  Eve, appropriately, has the only APP tracks I know of with female vocalists.  I am glad they are the only ones.  &quot;Don't Hold Back&quot; (sung by Clare Torry) is my vote for the worst APP song.  Other reviewers may enjoy the lyrics but, musically, I think it is dreadful to the point of embarrassing.  I am also not as crazy about &quot;If I Could Change Your Mind&quot; as most of the other reviewers are.  I do not find it memorable at all.  I'll listen to it a few times and not remember how it goes after it ends.  This track is nowhere near the same level as &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Time.&quot;   I am no feminist, I just know what I like in music and, musically, Eve is a good album but is not even in the vicinity of the greatness of other Woolfson and Parsons &quot;projects.&quot;  If you are just beginning your APP journey, I would start with Ammonia Avenue or Eye in the Sky.  Save Eve for when you are ready for something a little harsher.
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay so Amy Lee is beatiful, but if you look past that you will fing a really good album.  With most of the [music] coming out of the hard rock/alternative area it's nice to have a women give new life to music that was starting to sound the same.  I've heard friends say that all the songs sound the same, but if you actually listen to the album all the way through, you will realize they are all unique.  Track four \\"My Immortal\\" is a good example of Amy using her talented voice with a soft piano in the back ground.<br />  I highly recommend this album, and hope that Evanescence stays around for a long time, and shows us all how to rock!!<br />  Oh Amy, you rock my world!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a beautifully written show where Sci Fi meets Western, with characters that you love and want to know more & more about.   Sadly Fox did not see this as a great show and canceled before they even showed all the shows that were made.  Three were never aired in the USA.  Even the music is terrific.  With plans for a movie this DVD would be great to have.  It has everything, action, humor, sadness and great actors!  You will fall in love with this show and its charactors and will be begging for more like the rest of us that were able to catch on TV before canceled.

B000002JPA|5.0|This is the best prog-rock album ever. Never mind bands like King Crimson: Dream Theater gets it done! I have never heard such musical ability. All members of Dream Theater were skilled in music at various universities. If only bands like Cream, Black Sabbath, or Led Zeppelin could play with this kind of talent. Where as all of these bands rip-offed their fans by doing the same, simple &quot;music&quot; on every album, Dream Theater just gets and and matures: offering fans thinking man's music, sacrificing emotional depth for musical virtuosness, the way music was meant to be played. This album is their best, although it is difficult to choose. I also highly recommend the equally amazing &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;. But this album is mind boggling: the track &quot;Metropolis&quot; is the best song of all time, with a bass solo that puts anything Geezer Butler ever did to shame. John Pattatruci is the most underrated guitarist ever: I have never heard a man more skilled at his craft ever, and the whole band is prominent on every wonderful song on this epic album. Five well-deserved stars!

B000001GEM|5.0|In a century entirely dominated by the often brutal progress of man, i.e. a male individual, through industrialization and the invention of railroads, cars, steam engines, the steel industry, coal mines and so many other - often polluting - things, in a century where the male figure of life and death dominates, alienates, exploits all beings, Brahms sings the earth, the growth of nature and grass, the call of the wild and open space, immense space and unlimited time. Brahms calls to his side the feminine, the female mother-earth from which all life and sustenance come and to which all human beings go back for their last sojourn on this planet and for their last comforting home and sleep.<br /><br />Brahms dedicates this Requiem to the mother, the evercomforting woman who can take all suffering men in her embrace, in her arms, in her warm tear-sprinkled patience and understanding, love in a word. Brahms moves the Requiem from the male figure of the Father, God, or the male figure of the sufferer and savior, Jesus, to the female suffering and yet comforting figure of the mother.<br /><br />Brahms is at the antipodes of the German myth : Death is « der Tod », hence masculine, a male character, but Brahms makes it an incarnation of the mother, the archetype of all mothers, of Mary weeping at the foot of the cross. Yet at this moment we remember what the dying Christ said, near the end, to his disciple and his mother : « See, this is your son ! See, this is your mother ! »<br /><br />This reflects the suffering of Brahms in front of a world that is changing too fast and is becoming blindingly inhumane, in front of the loss of his friend Schumann and the loss of his own mother. He is able to recapture his lost past, the love of his mother, the friendship of Schumann, the comforting certainty of mother-earth, in this shifting of a death dominated requiem into a motherly and comforting communion with the very principle of humanity that the mother represents on Earth.<br /><br />In fact he goes back to the old Romanic and Romanesque tradition of the mother church in the Middle Ages and rediscovers the mother in a male dominated Germanic world.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignanold Romanic and Romanesque tradition of the mother church in the Middle Ages and rediscovers the mother in a male dominated Germanic world.

B000005HFH|5.0|The &quot;Editorial Review&quot; repeats a falsehood by claiming Chet Baker's career took off as soon as he arrived in California from Oklahoma. Although Baker always called himself a Okie, he moved to California with his family when he was in elementary school, many years before embarking on his career as a professional musician.<br />That said, I love Baker's unique voice.
B00005R2IS|3.0|In 1981, THE ROAD WARRIOR was released in to the United States and became an instant hit, but George Miller's story of angry cop Max begins with his 1979 classic MAD MAX.  <br />Mel Gibson plays the title character, &quot;Mad&quot; Max Rockatansky, a cop in a postapocalyptic future (when exactly isn't specified).  He's the best cop around, patroling the highways for speed-hungry gang members.  Well, after his best friend is killed and Max steps in, the gang gets a little mad.  In the end, Max (now gone a little beyond Mad) sets out to avenge the death of his wife and infant child, both killed by the gang.<br />MAD MAX is a sci-fi classic that spawned one of the best-loved sci-fi series of all-time.  Miller's directing style brings the needed impact to the seemingly dead futuristic earth.  Gibson is also good in his star-making role (look at how young he is...wow!) - plus Brian May (not the Queen Brian May) contributes a good score.<br />Top-notch sci-fi action entertainment and one of the greatest (and funnest) films to come out of Australia.  Followed by MAD MAX 2 (THE ROAD WARRIOR) and MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME.
0780625129|1.0|This movie is so horrible: it relies on cheap shock tactics to hold your attention because it has no real story, at least not one that's been told before: confused white boy is angry at black people because his dad told him to be and is finally redeemed. First of all, the argument is made unconvincing because of a real fact: the black guys that Derrick kills for breaking into his car are in fact BREAKING in to it. And they were armed. I mean, come on, what would you do if you looked out your window and saw that? If you had a family to protect and if those hoods had guns? He had a right to protect his family, so the idea of him going to prison for protecting his family from ARMED GANG MEMEBERS is ludicrous, but it shows really how decayed the justice system in America is. Don't get me wrong, I am not a racist at all, but some of what this movies tries to explore is the unspoken truth that divides races today in America. Daniel's perspective is often true, especially during the dinner scene, where he speaks of Rodney King. One thing that was particularly disturbing is the gay rape scene in prison. It's pretty disgusting. I mean, they could have left that implied: I don't need to see a gay rape scene in this movie. That alone puts it over the top. It's very revolting and demeaning to men everywhere. <br /> I don't like how people who disagree with this movie's unclear \\"message\\" are taken for racists because most of the time this film teeters back in forth. Just don't bother with this one, folks.
0060512806|5.0|Yes, it's big. Yes, it's long, occasionally slow-moving, and weighty in more senses than the obvious. <br />But every one of these attributes is a virtue, when employed with this much skill. <br />_Cryptonomicon_ is a complex, elegant examination of code-making and -breaking in WWII and the present day, and of the two generations of people whose lives it alters. Past and present are interwoven with often breathtaking subtlety, with each new chapter illuminating the work as a whole, both thematically and in terms of the plot. <br />The intelligence at work here is both broad and incisive, yet the novel is far from being a sterile display of intellectual prowess. At heart this remains a deeply human story, full of flawed characters and ethical complexity; _Catch-22_'s influence runs deeply, most overtly in the comically illogical missions Bobby Shaftoe's team carry out to prevent the Germans from discovering their code has been broken, but more generally in the way that the impact of extraordinary events on ordinary people always remains in view. Furthermore, a strong historical awareness ensures that environment, ideas and story enjoy a healthy, mutually-reinforcing relationship. The evocation of the wartime Philippines is superb, but there are numerous smaller triumphs (the present-day ultra-PC American academics are a personal favourite...).<br />In short, this is clever on more levels than I can begin to describe, yet never fails to be engaging. Stephenson has constructed a novel that manages to be simultaneously astounding, enlightening, moving and witty - a novel that revels in its length, tackling a decades-spanning story that would be ill-served by anything shorter.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Talk to anyone that knows me and you will find that I'm a big Jeff Beck fan. That said, I was a little apprehensive when this album came in. Of course, the guitar playing would be good, but what about the rest? Would it live up to his other albums? <br />I did not immediately love this album. I did like it when I first listened, but when I listened to it a 2nd, 3rd, 4th (you get the idea) time, I really began to love it and I realized it was a masterpiece. I am moved more by each listen. You don't get songs like JB'S BLUES and SEASONS anywhere else... nor LINE DANCING WITH MONKEYS or SO WHAT. This album rocks and those who hate it are only afraid of what they don't understand. The only track I would pass would be HOT ROD HONEYMOON, but the others more than make up for it. Listen to SEASONS and BULGARIA... this man is a master of his instrument and can express every human emotion so well it hits you right in the gut. <br />If I reviewed this album the first time I listened, I would've probably given it 4 stars. But now, if I could give it 10, I would. Some may like this album, some may not. But I love it.
0064409422|5.0|7 years ago my fourth grade teacher assigned this book for us to read and 7 years later the magic has not left. <BR>Whimsical and enchanting this novel takes us to a time where the battle for good and evil is fought by witches and princesses; lions and stags; beasts and fairies and...four children. <BR>Not only does book provide a temporary escape to a fantasy world, but allows one's imagination to grow with each turn of the page until you can almost smell the scent of Turkish Delight!
B000089A07|4.0|Previously produced in 1986 as MANHUNTER (by &quot;Miami Vice&quot; producer Michael Mann), RED DRAGON is the adaption of Thomas Harris' best-selling novel and the latest installment in the Hannibal Lecter series.<br />Chronologically the first in the Hannibal series, Edward Norton plays retired FBI agent Will Graham, who is taken out of retirement by FBI Special Agent Jack Crawford (Keitel, taking over from Scott Glenn), because Graham has the psychic ability to see inside the mind of serial killers.  Now he's tracking the elusive &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; (Ralph Fiennes), but Graham knows there is only one way he can get on the right track after all these years of retirement.  Now he must travel to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and visit insane genius Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), whom Graham put away years ago.<br />This is a high improvement over Michael Mann's cult classic MANHUNTER, returning the Hannibal Lecter series to it's original form.  Brett Ratner, director of RUSH HOUR, pulls off his job considerably well.  Ted Tally returns to write the film, and does a good job.  Danny Elfman scores, and his score is excellent.  And, of course, while the cast is all terrific, Hopkins is the stand-out...although Norton (this was his first film that I'd seen) left a good first impression on me.  RED DRAGON is also lighter than the previous Hannibal films, particularly THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.<br />Thomas Harris fans will be pleased with the outcome of this film, and well they should be.  It is a terrific film, top-notch entertainment and the second greatest out of all the Hannibal films.
B000002J09|1.0|This album is so godawful it's impossible to describe. The dumb opening track gives way to some of the most horrible songs ever written: the only decent one being \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", one of the band's bigger songs, but better than horribly produced \\"When the Levee Breaks\\". You can't even tell what the lyrics are because Robert Plant is squealing like a woman: he doesn't even sound like a MAN. This album also has two wimpy ballads, whose titles I forgot. I don't know what people say Zeppelin was metal: listen to some of the newer stuff for REAL metal.<br />Led Zeppelin is the most overrated band in the history of music. People consider them to be the original heavy metal band. Totally untrue. The first really heavy band was Grand Funk Railroad. Zeppelin was also a thief band; ripping off lame blues songs and redoing them, so why does everyone have so much repect for them? The musicianship is just awful: Robert Plant has the worst voice ever; high and whiny, he sounds like a woman or some guy on estrogen; john paul jones is an awful bass player; john bonham couldn't keep a straight rythym if he played next to a drum machine; and jimmy page is the worst guitarist ever: loud, flashy, and totally obnoxious. Trust me, for some real metal: listen to Slipknot, Dream Theater, or modern Metallica.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Although I haven't seen the John Ford classic &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; which seeing from his other classics is probably better than this, but this one remains number three on my list of the best westerns of the 90's [with &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; at #1 and &quot;Unforgiven&quot; at #2], and one of my personal favoriet westerns in general.  <BR>  And although Henry Fonda has been claimed the best Wyatt Earp on screen, Russell gives us a great performance as the great sheriff.  Despite his performance as the main character, this movie undoubetly belongs to Val Kilmer who portrays the ailing Doc Holliday, which almost every film critic has said as the best Doc Holliday ever.  Other notable performances in this movie are Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Robert Burke, Sam Elliot, Stephan Lang, Bill Paxton, Billy Zane, Terry O' Quinn, and a small but notable performance from screen icon Charleton Heston.  <BR>  The movie starts out with the cowboys [the villians in this movie] riding in on a wedding about to take place and eventually killing quite a few people.  It then moves to the town of Tombstone where Wyatt Earp and his bride have just got off the train.  He soon meets up with his brothers and their wives as they try to start a buisness as he tries to get away from his past as a sheriff.  This works for a while until an event sparks his fury which I won't mention so that it won't ruin it for the viewers who haven't seen it yet.  At the same time Doc Holliday decides to join Wyatt in his battle against the cowboys, simply because he's the only friend he ever had.  With Wyatt's wife becoming addicted to oppiom, he meets an atractive women in town for the time being and soon falls in love with her.  <BR>  With George P.Cosmatos of the &quot;Rambo&quot; fame, the movie goes off without a hitch.  The Vista Series DVD is a DIrector's Cut which has many deleted scenes and an audio commentary by the director himself, with many other special features including a card game on DVD ROM.  This western won't disappoint you, and don't settle for the regular edition, go ahead and pay ten more dollars for this version, it's well worth it.

B000006IUQ|1.0|Well this film really [was bad]. It was just like every other lousy hollywood films Ive seen. First of all. I got this dej vu feeling when I started watching, and I thought: Ive seen this before (I hope you all now what I mean with this), but I kept on watching the whole films. Later I realized how sentimental,silly and simple it was. Not even the bears looked real. I could (only) find one god thing with it though: Alec Baldwin...Hes absolutely gorgeous!! He played the kind role hes perfectly capable for and did it pretty well actually...So if you like him. See it! Otherwise, dont!
B00004Z459|1.0|Linkin Park are not punk,hardcore,or metal. Just a really sucky rap band that became really popular in a fad. Oh sure, the cd was perfectly fine the first week I listened to it, but after that it all began to wear on me. That freaking rapper talking through out the song made me want to through myself into the highway to end my misery. Then there's the fact that the guitarist and bassist are two of the most untalented musicians I've ever heard. If you really listen the only thing the guitar plays is power chords over and over and over and over and over. And the bass is worse. The only guys with any talent are Hahn and the lead singer, but I still probably won't like this music. People who think this is really hardcore should spend just 2 minutes looking up bands and I'll garuntee you'll find something more hardcore. Some hardcore bands at the top of my head would be; At the Drive Through, Refused, Nodes of Ranvier, Living Sacrifice, Thrice, Strung out, and Suicidal Tendencies. Those aren't the best, just the ones athat popped in my head first.<br />The only thing worse than Linkin Park is P.O.D.
078322818X|5.0|This 1973 film was directed and written by George Lucas.  It runs 112 minutes in length.  It has an all star cast consisting of:  Richard Dreyfuss as Curt Henderson, Ron Howard as Steve Bolander, Paul Le Mat as John Milner, Charles Martin Smith as Terry \\"The Toad\\" Fields, Cindy Williams as Laurie Henderson, Candy Clark as Debbie Medway, Mackenzie Phillips as Carol and Wolfman Jack as the Disc Jockey.<br />This film is about a group of teenagers who have recently graduated from high school and their adventures revolving around one summer night of cruising the streets in 1962.<BR>The film opens as Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander are set to leave for college the next morning but Curt is reluctant to leave.  Steve tries to convince him that leaving is the only option and the wise thing to do.  Meanwhile, Steve's girlfriend Laurie Henderson pleads with him to stay behind and remain with her.<br />John Milner is the \\"cool\\" character in the film.  He drives the fastest car and always has someone challenging him to a race.  On this particular night his challenger is Bob Falfa played by Harrison Ford.<br />Terry \\"Toad\\" Fields is the nerdy member of the group.  His adventure begins when Steve gives him the keys to his car and asks that he take care of it while he is away at college.  Toad happily parks his scooter in exchange for the car.  His luck increases when he spies Debbie Medway walking down the sidewalk and picks her up.  This pair creates quite a venture in their endeavor to score liquor.<br />This is a brief explanation of the characters in the film.  It is very entertaining and regardless of the time period when you were a teen anyone will enjoy reliving the evening with the cast of this film.  The film is also equipped with an excellent sound track of music from the 1950's and 1960's.<br />I give this film five out of five stars.  This movie makes you feel as though you were present with the characters throughout their life-changing events.  It made you feel asthough you had stayed up all night just as they had.
0451191153|5.0|Since the first man who could think conciously the human race has been searching for the elusive philosophy of life. I think in every twenty years or so there emerges some radical new line of thought which is against everything which was thought true uptill then. Ayn Rand by some stroke of genius has atleast for me opened up a new line of thought.<br />The book is essentially based on the glorification of the human race and more specifically we as concious individuals. It deals with the struggles and aspirations of a young architect who is determined to do things the way he knows is right. The power of one against his thousands of detractors.<br />But actually this book transcends all boundaries like age, career etc and caters to the basic human being in us and urges to realise our selves and our dreams.<br />But like all other philosophies Ayn Rand's one isnt totally complete. It is a bit extreme in its approach but the book is extremely useful in the sense that it opens the door to a new line of thought rather than takes you to utopia. It gives you the crucial push needed to complete and augment your philosophy.<br />Any reader who reads this book with an open mind will understand the virtue of this book and if possible adapt himself. It takes us one step closer towards perfection.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|I have to say this. It's not another Awake or Godsmack that's for sure. I tried to like this album but the songs are just well. They sound almost identical to awake. Not a very interesting CD. Sorry Godsmack but this just doesn't cut it.
038533558X|4.0|Will Klein has lived with shadows for over 11 years. It was that long ago when the girl he loved was viciously raped and murdered. What's worse is that his much idolized older brother Ken fled after being figured as the lead suspect. The Klein family has lived with the shame of not knowing whether or not their older son is innocent, and they have faced the accusing looks of neighbors and reporters for over a decade. Flash forward to the present and Will is working with at-risk kids. He's living with a wonderful, loving woman. His life seems to be fine until his lover disappears just shortly after his dying mother tells him that his brother is alive. From that point forward, Will's life is turned upside-down as he risks his life to find out the truth. He races against an old friend, The Ghost, who has turned into a sociopathic assasin, and he fights to find the woman he loves and to restore some sanity to his broken family.<br /><br />Yes, Coben seems to be borrowing from his own plots. The assumed-dead and now-alive person is straight out of Tell No One. However, I like the characters, and I like Will's voice throughout the book. This is a fast, fun read that doesn't require a great deal of thinking--it's perfect for the beach or for a lazy weekend. It has mystery, suspense, action, and humor. It may never win a literary prize, but I liked it quite a bit, and I anxiously await my next Coben book.<br />(reviewer: mellion108 from Michigan)

6303314015|5.0|Odd, but this is one of few movies I have ever seen that helps depression.  I was depressed at one time.  And since we know that about one it eight teens get depressed, I will share with you only a few things that help.<BR>   In the widely-known song, &quot;Can You Feel The Love Tonight,&quot;  Timon and Pumbaa realize that their best friend has found someone - Nala - and they are worried that he will fall in love, therefor they lose their best friend.  This helps you understand that everyone, cartoon or real, goes through problems.<BR>   It is important that when you are depressed, you tell others how you feel and you have someone to help cheer you up.  Scar tells Simba that it was his (Simba's) fault Mufasa died.  Scar tells Simba to &quot;run away and never come back.&quot;  Simba does, after being chased by the hyenas.  Simba lands and gets knocked out.  Once he finally wakes up, Timon and Pumbaa find him.  They notice he's depressed, so they teach him &quot;Hakuna Matata.&quot;<BR>   To find out the other things, I want you to purchase the tape/DVD.  You will understand what I mean.<br />P.S. - The music sounds GREAT on a stereo...but also good on your normal television set;).
0380820846|5.0|I  Read this excellent book in a total of 2 days and only because I had to read the Duke and I first. Colin the infamous playboy finally falls hard for Penelope Featherington the lonely spinster. As always their is lots of humor and wit and it always is great lead-in  for the one in the series. Her books are getting more detailed and also every one book has a continuance of a more detailed problem to get thru. And as for the final build-up the great Ms. Whistledown is revealed. You will have to read the book to find out who the secret person is. I'm anxious for the final 3 in the series and can't wait. I highly recommend this series.

For the people who say they are inappropriate for children, you must be sheltering your kids.  I think these books are wonderfully creative and would recommend them over and over again.

B00009ATIX|2.0|Although I understood and could follow the plot line of the story, it was confusing..  Most of the movie was done in semi darkness so that it was hard to really see what was happening.  At times the music drowned out the voices so that you could not hear what was being said.  It reminded me of a low budget film.. This is a movie that I would not have purchase if I had known what it was like before hand.
0790730960|5.0|Far and away the best of the Batman movies, Tim Burton has a handle on the fairground-for-lunatics atmosphere of the world he's chosen to inhabit, and Keaton's down-to-earth sensibilities manage to support the Batman character, rather than taking away from it.  The production design is fantastic (as was the first film's, which boasted the late, great Anton Furst), but the characters really shine through here - a pleasant surprise in a Tim Burton film.  Absolutely the best of the lot is Michelle Pfeiffer's appallingly sexy Catwoman.  Of all the actors, she seems to have the best handle on the duality of her character, going from shy and nervous to confident and scary in the blink of an eye just like... well, just like a real person.  Danny DeVito's Penguin is another nasty treat; an obscene confection of excess and prosthetics wrapped up in a tuxedo, he's the scariest of the lot, and the most disturbing.  The film's ace in the hole, however, is the halting, clumsy romance between Pfeiffer and Keaton, two characters so lost and broken that they seem to understand themselves only by understanding each other.  It's a sad story, gleefully told, and it makes for a showstopping film.
0060005424|5.0|This was my favorite out of the series. The character is great and really easy to relate to. Garth Nix is a fabulous author and I look forward to reading many other of his books
B00004YRQA|5.0|Without this item, you would have to leave your system on forever, or at least until you can finish the game
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is great! I loved the humor in it. Even though Shrek is an ogre, he is still kind and lovable. And when I first watched it, I was crying from laughing so hard when the princess was singing with the bird (if you havent seen it, I don't want to spoil it). Great for kids too! And there are pop culture references hidden in there (If anyone has seen West Side Story, etc.) Gotta love the animations, all around great movie! Oh, and the extras are awesome too!
0790729652|4.0|A good, if uneven film overall, on a sub-par DVD that Warner has had ample time to re-issue with some kind of reasonable special features.  Here's hoping there's one in the works, but in the meantime, back to the movie itself.<br />Jack Nicholson is the real star here, regardless of the billing order - the Joker is a gleefully mean-spirited maniac and can't nobody do mean-spirited mania like Jack.  The transformation scene and nearly all the dialogue with Michael Keaton's jut-jawed Batman is superb.  Things drag a little between Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale, played with an appalling lack of chemistry by Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger.  Keaton, at least, appears to be trying - Basinger is more of an accessory than anything else.  When all is said and done, however, everyone plays second fiddle to the dementedly cartoonish production of the Joker and his thugs tearing through town, but the menacing specter of Batman, imagined by Burton as a terrifying sort of Dracula-cum- James Bond figure gives him a run for his money.  It's a lot of fun.
0064471837|4.0|This book was amazing. The reason I only gave it four was because it took a while to fully understand the book. A little confusing at the begining but then it all falls itto place. Great book,I would recommend this to anyone.
B00008OWZC|5.0|1972 was a year when Led Zeppelin were at the peak of their powers. Robert Plant still had an amazing range, the best vocalist around at the time. Jimmy Page was playing fast, creatively and powerfully, and was still full of lots of great ideas of how to entertain and awe with the guitar. John Bonham was always powerful and full of raw energy, speed and perfect timing at the drums. And John Paul Jones was ever-ready to provide the bass and organ foundation, staying out of the way but more-than-apt with his creative bass playing. Keep in mind that on their Studio recordings, which up to that point had included the latest album IV with Stairway to Heaven, Page's studio wizardry was extremely accomplished. They were selling out concerts based on the strength of the studio albums, but their true strengths lay in the live sound. They went into overdrive, turning 6 minute jams into 20 minutes of mesmerizing captivating sound. Dazed and Confused provides an excellent live vehicle for Jimmy Page's guitar, his bow work, and Whole Lotta Love also has some interesting Theremin sounds. Bonham shines throughout How the West Was Won with total dominating authority over the Drums, and Moby Dick is arguably the best drum solo on a recorded live album. Keep in mind I am a Buddy Rich fan, so I listen to Jazz, Rock, fusion, all the genres. ANY DRUMMER should get How The West Was Won if only to have this great drum solo! Robert Plant's vocals continually surprise with his range(hitting high notes he would be unable to reach within a year or so later) and there are plenty of Zep folk and rock tunes to showcase his talents. You can hear all the instruments in the mix on this entire collection of alternating songs from the 2 California concerts in June of '72. The sound is as good as any live show recording I have ever heard. Whether or not you are a fan of rock or Led Zeppelin or if you are a neophite to the Led Zeppelin sound, How the West Was Won would be as excellent a beginning to one's Zeppelin collection as it would be a capstone for the Zep fanatic!
B00006879E|2.0|I picked up this CD because I'd heard a sample and found it mildly promising.  And it was pretty cheap too.  But as I listened to the disc, all the songs started to run together.  In fact, most of the album consists of bland filler songs that all sound the same.  There are a couple tracks that stand out from the rest, but that's not really saying much.  And too many of the songs remind me strongly of N'Sync with guitars thrown in.  Not to mention the lead singer's voice sounds whiny after awhile.  I'm can't say that I'm impressed with Maroon 5.
B000001FKY|4.0|Though this record doesn't quite live up to the bar set by Pyromania it is still an amazing album and a must have of anyone who likes rock music.  my reviews for each track are as follows:<BR>  Women: Good opening song.  Sets a good tone for the rest of the record.<BR>  Rocket:  One of Def Leppard's finest songs (to bad they shortened it on Vault). Very cool.<BR>  Animal:  Not one of my favorite Def Leppard tunes, but none the less a good song.<BR>  Love Bites:  Ah...their classic ballad. i'm not much of a ballad fan but Joe Elliot's voice totally makes them rock.<BR>  Pour Some Sugar On Me:  The most well known of all their songs and i must say this is no surprise.  The song is in one word: AWESOME!!!!!!<BR>  Armagedon It:  Nice radio hit.  It doesn't really stand out to me like some of their other stuff but it still kicks!<BR>  Gods of War:  Awesome song.  Different from a lot of D.L.'s more well known tracks but different in a GOOD way.<BR>  Don't Shoot Shotgun:  I didn't like this song the first time i heard it but it's one of those that kinda grows on you. Now when i listen to Hysteria i like this one just as much as any other.<BR>  Run Riot:  FUN<BR>  Hysteria:  The title track and rightfully so.  though not as fast as Rocket or P.S.S.O.M.  still a nice single.<BR>  Excitable:  I Love this song and i'm not sure why.  it's just cool.  really good dance beat and (though kinda repetitive) a great track<BR>  Love and Affection: This is probably my least favorite song on the album.  however the whole album is killer so even my least fave is still very good and worth listening to.. though it's a weak end to such a good record.<BR>  Basically if you're a Def Leppard fan (and for some crazy reason you don't ALREADY own Hysteria ) BUY IT!!!!
0140186409|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath was the masterpiece of Steinbeck's carrer, the full embodiment of his previous writings, his social, political, and religious views, as well as his look on human nature.<br />Take it as a prediction for a socialist revolution in America, take it as a revelation of human injustice, take it as a story of the American Dream and the will to survive, whatever the book means to you, you'll take something away from reading it. Even if you don't buy into Steinbeck's political and religious views - that we are all &quot;one soul&quot; and that should work together as one big family - you will feel a compassion for the injustice that has occured to the working poor throughout history. It is a harrowing and powerful novel well worthy of five stars and its place as a classic.
0553382179|5.0|This book is awesome!  I stumbled across FlyLady's website about a month ago, immediately bought the book, and not only is my house starting to return to normal, my family is even coming around - on their own - and helping!  I never would have believed that a shining sink would be the start of order and cleanliness throughout the house, but it has!  I had to try it to believe it.  My home had gone downhill over the last few years after a series of family problems hit me from every direction and pushed me over the edge.  I work full-time and go to school part-time, in addition to running around with my very active preteen.  I knew what I had to do, but I was so overwhelmed, I just didn't know where to start.  FlyLady told me what to do and when to do it.  She motivated me, taught me to see how much I could accomplish in just 15 minutes and energized me.  The benefits are even spilling over into my professional life.  Others in my office are so impressed, they are also becoming hooked!  Getting my home back in order has brought peace to my life, as well.   Read the book with an open mind, give it a good chance, and watch all the pieces of your life fall into place.

B000002KNY|5.0|The &quot;Fear of Music&quot; CD represents a true masterwork as performed by the Talking Heads and David Byrne at their apex. The range of music, tonality and original compositions represented here are supernal in nature. Even Mr. Byrne himself could not replicate this number of fine songs on one CD again!<br />There are only two weak songs on this release. The rest are of a quality to be seen only after decades in time.<br />Every audiophile has this work already.  <br />This CD is a &quot;Must Have&quot; for all lovers of music. You can trust me on this one!<br />Jim
B00009MGQL|5.0|Take a huge amount of eastern techno flavored acid, add some vocal sampling and heavy distorted drum beats, throw in a hint of spacey symphonic melody for taste and stir it up with classic fuzzy guitar riffs and you got a recipe for some tasty ear candy. (Hint: absorb a few prime cuts from the 2 previous releases as an appetizer). Buy it. Listen to it. Digest it.

B00008438V|1.0|Bad news for John Hughes fans, those waiting for feature-laden new special editions of his holy trinity - Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Weird Science - will undoubtedly be disappointed by the upcoming reissues. Although all feature newly remastered 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfers and Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround tracks, there are no extras included at all aside from trailers, and Sixteen Candles doesn't even get that. While retail is a low $$$$$$ apiece, after all the wait and endless postponements, such bare-bones reissues are just another thumb-in-the-eye to the consumer. There are different versions of both films from TV and video, there have to be deleted scenes and outtakes, not to mention the fact that commentary from Hughes, or any of the films stars should be easy to get. This is the cd scam all over again - don't wait for a third, or fourth version of the films to come out - make them do it right the first time!!!
B00004RF98|5.0|The best of its kind, simply pure joy.  Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are absolutely spectacular in their dance numbers.  The Make 'Em Laugh number alone makes the DVD a worthy purchase.  When Donald O'Connor walks up the wall and does a flip, you'll be scratching your head wondering what you just saw.  The choreography is masterful, not the best acting you'll ever see, but who cares?  Debbie Reynolds looks like she's about 12, but she gives a fine effort.  Still the greatest musical/comedy/dance movie ever made.  A treasure.
B0000029DD|5.0|Just in the past year have I discovered Jeff, and it makes me almost weep when I realize I will never get to attend a concert of his. What a tremendous talent he was, and if you didn't know, there is a DVD of a live concert of his out there. The more you hear this CD, the more you will love it.
B00006879E|5.0|I noticed that this disk came out over a year ago.  Yet only now are they getting noticed on MTV with the single &quot;Hard to Breathe&quot;.  This is pretty amazing because these guys are a perfect rock-pop band for the tubes.  I guess it took time for the wave of rap-rock to depreciate.  I wish nothing but the best for this band.  Perhaps a little too poppy for my taste, but they have great songs never-the-less.  And the singer has a great unique voice; very soulful like Jamiroquoi. I could only hope MTV embraces more bands like Maroon 5.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Even a newcomer to the heavy music world knows that this is and will always be a great album.  If you like At The Drive-In or Sparta, this album will excite you through and through.  Gorgeous melodies, prolific guitars, jaw-dropping percussion.  This adds up to one of the best albums you could buy.  If you've been nervous about buying a new and different cd, afraid that it will dissappoint, then you should invest your money in this, for it will be worth it a hundred times over.  You'd be a fool to spend it on anything else right now.
B00007BH3A|5.0|This CD is amazing and i love dancing to it. gwen is sooo cool! this cd combines rock,punkie,and pop. so if you like rock punk and pop you should defenately check this out!
0783231032|3.0|I give 1941 3 1/2 stars. Not quite 4 stars. The film is very funny and is still good even though it is now nearly 25 years old. It is worth viewing once every 2-3 years and is worth purchasing for under $$$$. Bulushi and Aykroyd are very funny. Good screwball comedy preying on the fears of people in California and along the western coast of a Japanese Invasion just after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Slim Pickens is hilarious as the country bumkin captured by the Japanese. It is worth just seeing Slim. Worth the price of the DVD.
B000001Y79|5.0|I love this CD because the beats are so catchy and positive and i love the songs. Gwen is sooo cool shes my idol! if you like Save ferris no doubts first two CDs, you will probably like this one too. (i should know because i am their number one fan!)
B00006CXSS|5.0|I viewed Band of Brothers over several nights and I found that it was a good series. The genre of film making is akin to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and has the same feel to the series. I think this series along with Saving Private Ryan and Schlindler's List should be viewed by all junior and senior high school students in their American History classes. It will give insight to younger people what their great grandfather (It use to be grandfather) endured in time of war. The film hits home with me because my father was an Allied paratrooper during that time and my grandfather participated in the Normandy Invasion. A good aspect of this film also includes mentions of the British and Canadians who also fought as part of the invasion. They're contributions and death toll of men is sometimes overlooked in films. As time goes by, large percentages of the American population may begin to believe that the invasion and defeat of Germany was only an American effort. The defeat of the Reich couldn't have been done without the Americans,but the British and Canadians were needed too. <BR>The film Band of Brothers shows the dirty and fearsome aspects of battle. The depictions of the bombed out towns of Holland, France and Germany are very realistic. The scenes in Bavaria at Hitler's Eagle's Nest are spectacular. I found the interviews with the actual men from Easy Company to be very interesting and insightful. The only weak part of the film I found was the casting of David Schwimmer(I think that is how his name is spelled) from the TV series \\"Friends\\". Other than that, the effects are good, the story is good and the cast were excellent. I recommend this to anyone who wants to know about World War II and get a slice of what it was like for the average soldier along with their junior officers. Highly Recommended...5 Stars.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!  Chad Kroeger's voice is perfect.  It is so distinct; whenever you hear a new Nickleback song on the radio, you know it's him.  There are two excellent singles on this CD - &quot;Too Bad&quot; and &quot;How You Remind Me.&quot;  They are both very catchy, but some of the songs on the CD that are not played on the radio are even more catchy.  Nickleback has great guitar solos in their songs, too.  Some songs are pretty heavy, but never too heavy - they are just right.  Many of the songs on this album are about anger at broken relationships in one way or another.  My favorite song is probably &quot;Never Again&quot; - its very catchy, it has great guitar in it, and it represents Chad Kroeger's voice very well.  The only bad thing about this CD is that it is too short, but it seems like most CDs are these days.  The songs don't get annoying, though, so u can listen to it three times and not get tired of it.  Buy this CD - it rocks!  But, unfortunately, it costs more than a nickel :( - but it's definitely worth the money!
0394827996|5.0|FISH IS FISH is a delightful book.  It's fun for children, and a pleasure for adults to read out loud.  The illustrations are beautiful.  Two young \\"fish\\" are friends.  One fish stays a fish; the other turns out to be a tadpole.  The real fish refuses to believe that his friend is changing.  How like real life!  After tadpole goes up on land, he actually has more to add to their friendship - great stories about what he has seen on earth!  When fish jumps onto land to explore, he almost dies.  Tadpole saves him.  In the end, both fish and tadpole are happy with their own unique worlds.  Fish tells tadpole: \\"You were right ... Fish is fish.\\"  This story is so simply and wonderfully symbolic of how friends can remain friends, even when they change as they grow up.
B00004TBWR|5.0|THIS CD IS A CLASSIC.CCR MADE 4 GREAT CD,BAYOU COUNTRY,COSMOS FACTORY GREEN RIVER AND THIS CLASSIC WILLIE AND THE POORBOYS.JUST CHECK OUT THE POORBOY SHUFFLE AND IT GOES RIGHT INTO FEELIN BLUE.WHAT A GREAT COMBO,BUT THE WHOLE CD IS GREAT.THE 20BIT REMASTERING IS REALLY WORTH THE MONEY,BECAUSE THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT.
B000002GK1|5.0|This album is a blistering, bold and beautiful. Rusty Cage and Outsined were my introductions to this album but I found my two favorites on this album were Jesus Christ Pose, which has some of the most amazing drumming I have ever heard from Matt Cameron, and Mind Riot. Mind Riot deserves it's own sentence, that song just caught me off guard when I heard it. Chris Cornell is wailing his throat to the point where he was probably puking into a bucket after the recording cut. People need to buy this album. I promise it will never leave your cd player.
B000002IAZ|5.0|I personally consider Buffalo Springfield to one of the great Rock and Roll bands of all time, right up there with the great sixties acts such as The Doors, The Who, the Stones, The Yardbirds, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and Cream.<br />  This is a very good Buffalo Springfield set. It contains all of the best songs, and I think anyone who isn't a fan should give it a try because Buffalo Springfield is usually ignored by the radio stations and For What It's Worth is superb but not all that representative of the band as a whole.<br />  But also consider getting each induvidual Buffalo Springfield album. They only have 3 and every song on each album is worthy of being on a best of compilation. A single disc could never hold all of Springfield's classics, since their first album is 12 tracks (same as Retrospective)<br />  So in other words, this is a great set but if you want Flying on the Ground it Wrong, Hot Dusty Roads, and all the rest of the great Springfield works, get each studio album. They're like 10 bucks each, and well worth it. I only wish &quot;Down to the Wire&quot; was on this set since it is one of my favorite Springfield tunes and can only be found on Neil Young's &quot;Decade&quot; double album compilation.
B00005JKN9|1.0|of this movie.  Yeah, it's because this flic is more fiasco than Felini.  It is a very very confused wanna-be epic with a diffused theme and catoonish characters.  The actors, rather than appearing like quirky iconoclasts come off more like bit players from Pee Wee's playhouse.  Save your money, it'll be on TBS pretty soon and then you can nod off when you watch it for free without the remorse over what the DVD cost you.
B00005JLEU|5.0|&quot;Spirited Away,&quot; lastest of animator Miyazaki Hayao's masterpieces, is an endearing tale of personal growth through effort and compassion. Given Miyazaki's strong socio-political beliefs, one can easily stumble into the pitfall of over-analyzing this film. However, it is simply a fantastic story of a girl who overcomes great obstacles and thereby gains a greater appreciation of life (and the freedom of her parents from a curse). The simplicity of the plotline in spite of its deep emotional content is what makes this film so refreshing!<br />There are two (very) minor problems I have. First, and most importantly, some of the original meaning and dialogue is lost in the translation. I highly recommend watching the movie in Japanese with English subtitles. Second, the ending seemed a bit abrupt and rushed; Chihiro's journey was so grueling yet the basic problem of freeing her loved ones from the curse was resolved in an instant. However, it could just be that the story focuses entirely on the journey and the resolution could vary without changing its essence.<br />As with most Japanese anime films, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; does contain more scenes that may be frightening to young children than your average American cartoon. However, for Miyazaki, violence is very minimal in this film.
0425166805|1.0|Here, in a nutshell, is Von Daniken's theory:<br />- Primitive savages (i.e. non-Europeans) weren't intelligent enough to create these monuments, and their own great civilizations for that matter, all on their own. Thus, those outside influences that created these civilizations MUST have been aliens who, coincidently, looked much like Europeans. -<br />It's not difficult to counter Von Daniken's claims. From a scientific standpoint, he has a theory and twists \\"evidence\\" to support it; evidence that would counter his hypotheses is conveniently ignored. In fact, he rarely uses any evidence at all. He merely dismisses the accepted ideas out of hand, and then floats his own ideas as if these constituted evidence itself. When he did try to present physical evidence, as he did with pottery depicting flying saucers, these were proven to be frauds (\\"Nova\\" found the potter and Von Daniken had to admit the fraud he perpetrated when confronted). This, boys and girls, ain't science.<br />I'm torn in rating this book. On the one hand, I found myself laughing a great deal, so in that respect it provided me with a great deal of entertainment. However, it has also contibuted to a lack of scientific understanding of many people today. There are those who accept it without question, and I find this fact scary as hell.
B00005JLZN|5.0|Great movie, smart ending - with good suspenseful &quot;build&quot;. Spacey hasn't missed a beat in my opinion since LA Confidential.<br />I also happened to rewatch Arlington Road this weekend and could not help draw comparisons in the plot line.<br />Arlington Road is a great movie too, so if you get the chance try and view them both in the same weekend.
6305972591|2.0|Ok here is what I have to say about children of the corn its not a nice story, gothic children slaughter people becuase of their religion, a man and his wife or going to that same town that  the corn children took over, 3 years have passed since murders in the coffee shop and around the city of Gatlin, victims were apparently mutilated, they killed their parents, and destroyed eachothers families. The man stops the car to find that a boy's destroyed corpse lays in the highway, which was surrounded by cornfields. they enter the city where the nightmare begins, no population, nobody else's car drove nobody walking across the street, as silent as a ghost town. Then they find 2 survivors, a little girl and a boy, nothing else! then there was a gang children armed with blades, machettes, scythes, knives, too bad there was no police, there seems to be no laws in Gatlin, now that they are changed by insane children. Compared to village of the damned this story was more messed up then those villager kids !
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok, being a reviewer from the UK I have seen more of this show than anyone from the US, and all I can say is - Why have Fox canelled the best darn show ever made?!!? From the first scene of the Pilot Episode (shown in the UK - not so much UK now!) I was hooked. This is the best Sci-Fi-Western-Space Drama ever written and Joss Whedon should receive an Knighthood for it. I am so devastated that Fox cancelled it. Although this collection is not available in the UK yet (always second place!) I'd recommend anyone with a liking for Sci-Fi to check this series out because it leaves Star Trek and Stargate SG-1 at the starting blocks! Please bring it back!
0375414053|4.0|The story of Kate Reddy, the city trader mother of two small children who struggles to be perfect in both the home and work spheres, while battling an industry that doesn't believe in giving mothers a break. In her attempt to be good at absolutely everything, she never manages to reach any of her high standards. This is a great book, with large lashings of humour that many readers will identify with - even if you are not a mother (or not even a woman) you are sure to find moments in this book you identify with - the struggle to reach your goals, annoying relatives, attempting to keep up with the Joneses. There is a 'story' to hold this all together and try to make it more than just a list of goings on (this book developed out of a newspaper column), and while that works, I found the day-to-day description of Kate's life the interesting thing. <br />In the end, it all comes to a head, and Kate acknowledges something has to give (Don't read any further if you don't want to know a main plot point)and chooses family over work - her husband is a big factor in this. Her choice feels a bit of a let down/sell out - I wanted her to manage both and show everyone it can be done - but even when she 'retires' she can't quite give up, hatching future plans.<br />I liked Kate, and even though I don't have children myself, I identified with her - the unfairness of expectations on who does what in the home sphere being an annoyance I totally understand. I also like the fact that the author doesn't resort to making all the male characters bastards and all the female characters angels.<br />This is a really enjoyable book - like me, you might come to this book expecting a soapbox, but luckily, you would be wrong.
0156027321|2.0|Although creative, this book was not one of my favorites.  It was EXTREMELY slow to start.  Other than establishing Pi's personality, the religious theme did not seem to fit with the rest of the book.<br />Ironically, the story turned to a plot of &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;, more about evolution than religion.  Although I understand the realism of &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;, the graphic descriptions re: the animals being destroyed bothered me.  <br />Pi was a brave and resourceful character, but overall, I struggled to get through this book.  I read it in a week, and was very happy to finish it.
0553275976|5.0|This is probably *the* book of the 1980s - it explores the fragile, false world of Wall Street and Manhattan society with witty, cruel glee.<br />A one-off freak accident lands Sherman McCoy in a world of trouble. McCoy switches from a life of unquestioned privilege and superiority, to fear and questioning when the facts and evidence come together to point the finger at him for a hit and run.<br />Wolfe shows his brilliance as a writer with this book - his characters manage to be embodiments of stereotypes and complicated individuals at the same time. The reader feels sorry for un-likable characters. Little details build up - for example the male characters preening and deporting themselves in ways they think make them look strong, powerful and handsome, only when we are given another point of view we see that they just look silly and vain - the vanities of this book are many and varied (Savonarola, he of the original bonfire of the vanities, would probably be happy with the comeuppances this book provides).<br />Ultimately, this book is a modern classic because it manages to successfully combine all the elements - explorations of society, equality and motivation that still manages to be a great story; sparkling and witty prose that is never really flippant. It is a book that makes you think and manages to entertain at the same time.<br />It took me a long time to track down a copy of this book, but it was worth it - Sherman McCoy, his friends (so called), adversaries, and everyone in between, make a fascinating morality tale with a moral that manages to be blindingly clear and ambiguous at the same time.
B00008J2WB|5.0|Linkin Park's latest album, Meteora, is impressive and creative.  You can tell in every song that each lyric, each riff, each scratch was painstakingly rehearsed, recorded, mixed and perfected before it hit the stores.  This was not an album thrown together by the band to make record sales.  I have been a loyal fan of Linkin Park even before &quot;hybrid Theory&quot; was out and they became Grammy award wining artists (for the single, &quot;Crawling.&quot;).  And I have to say, this is their most impressive material to date.  The efforts and energy they put into their live shows (you dont watch an LP show, you experience it) and music videos (their DJ/director, Joe Hahn, is chaging the way people make videos) is awe worthy to say the least and only contributes to the album and band's ground breaking talent.  Track 6, Easier to Run, is amazing.  With stunning lyrics, Chester's haunting yet pain stricken voice, and Mike's soothing and expressive raps, it leaves you blown away (the crashing guitars give it a unique sound as well.)  And, just when you think you've heard the best song the album has to offer, Number 9, Breaking the Habit, plays.  By far the best track, the lyrics offer just about everyone something to relate to, the singing keeps you listening, and the instruments keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next, until the very last bar of the song.  With this latest effort, Linkin Park truly proved that they deserve to be in a genre of their own. This album has something for everyone and no one should be disappointed upon purchasing it.  Hear for yourself, it was well worth the wait...
0743455967|5.0|I have only ever read one of King's novels, when I was about nine years old. I don't remember much about it, only that I was scared stiff, and that reading it under the bed covers with a torch was probably not a good idea. Since then, his work has never really appealed, but this book has changed my mind - if his novels are as good as his non-fiction, they would be worth the effort.<br />This first third of this book is a brief background of King's life - his chaotic childhood, his menial jobs and teaching before his breakthrough, and a very honest opinion of his battles with addiction.<br />The main section of the book is taken up with how King writes. He writes this part as a how-to, but it can also be taken as an insight into how a successful author does his thing. A lot of how he does it differs from the traditional how-to-write guides, but it seems to work. I really like the idea of not using outlines and plots, but working on uncovering 'the fossil' as you go. <br />The last section tells of King's life-threatening accident. It reads as a very harrowing ordeal, but King infuses this part with the humour used throughout the book.<br />An interesting, funny and inspiring read for want-to-be authors and appreciators of good writing alike.
B000063DI8|4.0|Well I loved all of the Iron Maiden stuff I heard before I bought this album, I could safely call myself a devoted fan.  I heard this was supposedly one of thier really not so good albums.  I'm one to give a great band a chance, so I bought it.  The first couple spins I gave this album, I REALLY tried to like it and I just thought it was very bland and unenjoyable.  I was ready to sell the thing, until it started to grow on me a little.  Then it grew on me a lot, and I play this at least once every day.  I can't get enough of it.  My favorite track is the ultra catchy &quot;Hooks In You&quot; with the title track coming in second place.  The only tracks that after so long have not caught on to me, and I still find to be not that great at all are &quot;The Assassin&quot; and &quot;Run Silent Run Deep&quot;.  So if you love Maiden's other stuff, give this one a chance!
B000002P2W|5.0|Ah, what a great album. For many years The Who were the voice of the rebellious teenagers that made up a large quantity of their fanbase. The Who made a whole album addressing teenage frustrations (Quadrophenia), but no one is a teenager forever, and everyone grows up. So Pete Townshend, being human, wrote a collection of songs questioning the longevity and relevance of adolescent rock past the age of 30...and thank god for it. It allowed The Who to grow up and write beautiful, instrospective, and often depressing songs. This album is among the best Who albums, including Who's Next and Quadrophenia.
