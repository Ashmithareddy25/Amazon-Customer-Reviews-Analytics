B001L2L0LY|5.0|This is the best new show on television. It is ground-breaking in the way that The Shield, The Sopranos and Nip Tuck are. The Creator/Writer was also the head writer on The Shield.    This is a politically incorrect, violent and sexually explicit show that is completely addictive and thoroughly entertaining. It is about a fictional outlaw motorcycle club in the town of Charming. They are the biker bad boys that you just can't get enough of.     Ron Perlman and Katie Sagal (wife of series creator Kurt Sutter)are brilliant, as is the entire cast. Charlie Hunnam is awesome as the series heart throb, and his love interest, played by Maggie Siff, is the perfect counterpart to Hunnam. The sexual tension between these two is palpable.    This is one of the best written shows I have seen in a very long time. The season finale, which aired the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving, was so artfully done that I have watched it over and over. It was picked up for a second season before season one was complete.     I downloaded all the episodes right here at Amazon.com. They are in pristine condition, without any commercials. They don't jump, stall, or hang up. I can now watch them on my computer, my Tivo, or stream episodes directly from Amazon when not able to watch any of the other ways.    This is definitely an adults only show that is well worth your time if you are looking for something fresh and different and highly entertaining. Season Two will be even better!    But do yourself a big favor now and download every episode of season one, then watch them in order so you can see the story develop. I have watched them all several times already myself and never get tired of it.

0312383320|3.0|I am a die-hard Janet Evanovich fan. I am thrilled that the annual releases of her by-the-numbers Stephanie Plum series seems to align with my birthday each year. Ms. Evanovich has written scenes that when I think of them, I start to giggle. Mrs. Plum running down Richard Noxon and a bunny? Hilarious. Lula and Stephanie driving with the feet of a corpse sticking out of a car trunk with a red flag, pea-your-pants funny. \\"Plum Spooky\\" is therefore a disappointment. Janet seems to have taken the easy way out. Enter Ranger, \\"Babe!\\" nuzzles Stephanie, exit Ranger. Morelli strolls in now and then looking for a little sumpin', sumpin. Enter Diesel, who like all other men in New Jersey is panting to get Stephanie in bed. Janet's story lines seem to be thinning, so to add humor, she throws in a foul-fingered monkey. Monkeys are funny, right? I don't know, Janet just seems to be taking the easy street to humor. She needs to stop with the contrivances and get back to the personality developments that made her earlier Plum novels so much fun to read. Flame farts, Janet? Seriously? I would rather wait two years for a new Plum novel than get whacked with a limp attempt at humor that only seems to have drained my wallet a bit while lining the wallet of Ms. Evanovich.
031606792X|1.0|I absolutely loved the first 3 books, I must have read them within 3-4 days. The love story was beautiful, capturing, and mind blowing..it seemed to get more intense once Jacob was involved. I couldn't wait to read the 4th addition..    If this book was mine (I borrowed it) I probably would have burned it by now. It was terrible..in fact, I read only half of it and then skimmed to the last chapter. I couldn't believe what I was reading.    *Bella immediately marrying Edward, after all she put Jacob through. I don't mind that they got married, but I think it would have been better towards the ending and more dramatic..    *Bella getting PREGNANT..OMG I had to put the book down for a few minutes because I was completely stunned. When did vampires have live sperm?! I don't even know why I kept reading beyond this point.    *Edward eating the mutant baby right out of her (I had to read that part twice, because I seriously could not believe I was reading the same series.) The details were disgusting and unnecessary.    *Bella becoming a Vampire, after the first 3 books stressed so much on her keeping her humanity. Thats what made it so romantic...a human inlove with the supernatural. And the way she become a vampire was totally ridiculous. Edward injecting a syringe with his venom straight into her heart while she is torn to pieces after giving birth to this mutant baby..how romantic. I don't even remember reading when he milked his fangs.    *The whole everyone now has super powers and 'talent' thing really annoyed me. I felt like I was reading something out of Star Wars.    *Jacob claiming the newborn mutant baby as his MATE (I guess this part was suppose to be cute since he couldn't have the mother..) How is that not disturbing to some ppl? I loved Jacob! But Meyer totally screwed with his character in this book.    As you can see, the romance that leaves you with butterflies in your stomach no longer exists. Instead, I was left quite disturbed. This whole book was sodisappointing, utterly disgusting, and just plain ridiculous...I don't know what the author was thinking.    Edited to add: If the author were to make a 5th book, with Bella waking up from a coma and all this weird chaos (4th book) was actually a nightmare she was having..I would gladly read it. In this book, Bella really didn't dwell on what she was giving up, and hardly even thought about Jacob even though she saw a vision of herself having children with him. In my happy world, Bella would have chosen her humanity and ended her relationship with Edward to be with Jacob..and Jacob would have given up his spirit wolf (thus avoiding imprinting with someone else) to be with Bella. It makes sense to me since Jacob hated being forced into a werewolf, and Bella would be able to keep her humanity not have to watch everyone die around her. I just don't see how she mananged not to sacrifice ANYTHING..    This book had the potential to be awesome, heartwarming, and maybe even cry worthy...but it sure didn't. I don't plan on buying this book, nor reading anything else from Meyer.
1590171993|5.0|We should all thank the New York Review Books Classic for re-releasing this extraordinary novel.  Perhaps one of the toughest things a novelist can do is make an ordinary life fascinating.  This is is the brilliance of such writers as Chekov, Carver and Pym.  It is also at the center of John Williams' \\"Stoner.\\"  I had never heard of the novel until a friend recommended it to me.  I was stunned at how good it was given its relative obscurity.  The prose is as crystal clear as Willa Cather's writing at its best.  I've already ordered his other books. This is one of the very best books I've read in recent memory.
0385340990|5.0|For a novel told strictly through letters it is hard to convey information sometimes and even limits plot points for a writer, but these women who authored this book did an outstanding job creating a full, populated world without sacrificing anything.  I loved the hominess of the book and the feeling of piecing together the story bit by bit.  Similar to a \\"diary format\\", this novel lets you enter immediately into the characters' lives and use your own imagination to fill in the blanks.  This is a perfect read for bibliophiles who take pride in their book collection.  Fine story.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Great movie.  I know...many will say the stage play is better...but I have no possibility of seeing that production.  Love the scenery...love the music....a great story.  Very well done.  Need something to raise your spirits?  Watch this!
B001KSJ08Y|5.0|I'm in my twenties and I have a little friend who's 9-years-old. We know all the words to the songs and swoon at Bella's Lullaby. Every night she plays the CD when she's in the bath. When I first heard Robert's songs, I was put off a little because I wasn't sure they fit in Twilight. But now, we both absolutely love the way the words flow from his soulful, masculine voice sounding like warm honey. Great soundtrack--I have a lot of new music to love.     Hope to hear more from Pattinson in the future. (please)
B000J10ER4|5.0|I saw this movie in IMAX back in 2006. I didn't like Superman but he is the best (yes better than Batman). The whole plot of this movie is that Clark Kent hasn't been Superman in ages but now he's back baby. The first thing he does in the movie as Superman is saving a jet from crashing. It was originally that a space shuttle would ride on a jet back to Florida before its next launch so they decided to invent a way so you can carry the shuttle to a certain point then it would detach and head for space while the jet heads back to the ground. BUT, the seperating mechanism fails so the jet heads for space with the ship. So Superman heads up to seperate the 2 and save the jet from crashing. The only 2 lines I remember are as follows<br /><br />Superman: (weekly) wha-what is that<br />Luthor: Krrrrryptonite!<br /><br />So I am probably gonna get this movie but I need to think first.
B0019FOC5E|3.0|I can't believe that there are people who can rate this CD 5 stars. Pierce Brosnan's awful singing alone drags this cd down to at best a 3. It's painful to watch him try to sing in the movie and equally painful on this CD. I rated it a 3 because the women were able to carry it off and in the movie Merle Streep and Amanda Seyfried did a great job in both the acting and singing department.  Why these men, esp Brosnan, were cast in this movie when they clearly have no voices beats me. My guess is that someone owed Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth favors. There is no other explanation.  For my money, the ABBA box set Thanks for the Music is a much better purchase. That box set is one of the better engineered of the ABBA CDs and it shows the theatrical nature of many of the ABBA songs and some of the best aren't even in this movie.  BUT, rest assured that all of the movie songs are on the box set and you don't have to skip over SOS and When All Is Said And Done to get through it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This was a well needed upgrade from the Sixaxis controller. Unlike some companies, this controller includes a non-removable, rechargeable battery. By the time the battery needs to be replaced, the controller will be well beyond its warranty. You get about 4 hours of play time between recharging. It will take from one to 2 hours to recharge depending how the charge left on the controller.
B00000253N|5.0|WHAT IS THE BEST BOB DYLAN ALBUM? THAT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION TO ANSWER, 'CAUSE THE MAN IS A POET AND HE HAS WRITTEN SO MUCH GREAT MUSIC. BUT \\"BLOOD ON THE TRACKS\\" IS A HEARTFELT EFFORT, TRULY INSPIRED. AFTER KIND OF FALLING OFF THE MAP FOR AWHILE, DYLAN CAME OUT WITH THIS GREAT OFFERING IN THE MID 70'S. HE SEEMS TO HAVE REDISCOVERED HIMSELF ON THIS ALBUM. IT'S GREAT FROM BEGINNING TO END. ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN RECORDING.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|All true. They just don't get better than this one. Funny, surprising, thrilling, touching, thought-provoking.... I can't recommend this too highly.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|The film has got to be one of Pixar's absolute best.  So much complexity with so little dialog.  A new even more realistic yet still \\"cartoonish\\" style.  Also, as is often the case, as much care and detail has been put into the DVD structure and extras.    Particularly interesting was the hisory of Pixar.    Ahh.  It's all great!
B000QQFKYE|4.0|At once tedious and interesting, INLAND EMPIRE reiterates Lynch's fascination with his home town of L.A. and what that screwed up, wonderful/terrible place can do to a mind.     That's it, in a nutshell, and the way he embroiders that idea continues to be interesting, but, quite demanding in terms of time. Definitely recommended for Lynch fans.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Wow... I got this one with the new Rambo movie. It was sooooo worth it. All 4 RAMBO in BLURAY. If you can get this for cheap, then buy it. This thing looks great in my 1080p sony 46in. I dont have surround sound so I cant vouch for that, but it sound great in stereo. If you have a choice between getting a DVD or a BLURAY. GET THE BLURAY (look for sales).
B000002L68|3.0|Has all the Prince songs from the soundtrack.  Most are great, a few are awful.  Too bad it doesn't have the other artists songs as well.  If you saw the movie, you know what you're getting.
B00005JNQS|4.0|i was very happy i got a good price for this movie! The movie is funny, my young boys like it.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|I was very pleased with the condition of this CD. Though it was used, it works great and I and the person I gave it to are very happy.
B000YABYLA|3.0|With the opening sequence, I thought I was in for a very creative film akin to \\"Napolean Dynamite, \\" but I was so wrong.  Though the film was not long, I felt it drag and assumed I had missed something critical perhaps while putting my hand into the popcorn or jordan almonds which I'd prepared in advance.  Every aspect of the script seemed to be contrived and the language grew thin with Juno's quips becoming boring after awhile.  The tension never actually climaxed and I was more entertained by the music than the story.  In a nutshell, this movie is far from a classic and weak in the entertainment.  I prefer my films to be more full bodied than light unless the characters or story can carry them to fruition as entertainment.
B00005QGAX|4.0|Five years later he was back with one of the most sonically spotless albums of the decade.  That's not a detriment, but \\"Bad\\" does sound a lot more mechanical than \\"Thriller,\\" to some degree because it's so darn consistent.  Yes, consistency is good, especially when you're consistently excellent, but \\"Thriller\\" wasn't the best-selling album ever because of consistency.  \\"Thriller\\" had a spookfest, the most paranoid song in pop history, and a rock anthem.  \\"Bad\\" has a very macho title track, but it never pushes any limits, playing it safe with songs where the message shaves off a lot of the danceability--which is a huge part of the attraction, since this is a pop record if ever there was one.  That isn't to say there isn't some really good stuff here: his duet with Stevie Wonder is terrific, even if it's nothing new and looks remarkably tame in comparison to something like \\"Billie Jean.\\"  \\"Another Part of Me\\" sounds solid, and it's got a stellar groove; \\"Man in the Mirror\\" is gentle and straightforward, and all the more powerful for it.  And yeah, \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is pretty smooth, and \\"Liberian Girl\\" is a small gem, but the only song that's aggressively bound-pushing enough to live up to Michael's reputation is \\"Dirty Diana,\\" which is pretty rough and tough.  It definitely isn't bad, it has some thrilling moments, but there's no way it's a \\"Thriller.\\"
0783229372|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater as a young boy, it made a lasting impression on me.  I've always been taken by the biggest airplane/airship to ever fly.  That, plus the level of accomodations that the passengers enjoyed.  I bought this film so I could show it to my young son, who has picked up the interest in the Hindenburg from me.  Just watched it, and I was very impressed with how the film stands up, especially the special effects (most of them, not all).  Yes, the transfer of the film is not very good, but I can deal with that.  I was moved watching the film, and following the \\"sabotage\\" plot--which I believe has never been fully ruled out in the disaster--was interesting.  For the end, seeing the destruction was emotional, and the way the filmakers weave in the actual footage of the Hindenburg's destruction with the filmed scenes is extremely powerful.  George C. Scott is excellent in the title role, and the supporting cast is very good.  I appreciate the historical accuracy of the film, and like I said, even though they follow the sabotage theory, this has not been disproven.  I highly recommend this film.
B000002KY8|5.0|In 1982, \\"Thriller\\" burst through doors that Prince had been trying to unlock.  With those doors unlocked, he presented his first real work of genius.  Some songs stand above others--the titular apocalypse romp, for one, or \\"D.M.S.R.,\\" the ultimate party track.  The best of the bunch is the divinely salacious \\"Little Red Corvette,\\" which, for the last time, is not about a car, but which is one of the best songs of the decade.  Most of the songs are just damn good funk ditties that are danceable and brilliant.  The anti-war piece, \\"Free,\\" is a little heavy-handed, and that brings things down a little--but then \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" is a resurrection of Lazarean proportions.  The album never loses any momentum--and for a funk record composed of six- to nine-minute songs occupying 70 minutes, that's something special.  As is the artist behind it all: with \\"1999,\\" he proved he could write brilliantly-constructed songs that would get a dead man dancing, but also that he could make those songs socially relevant.  He's even interesting when he veers off into surrealistic Dickian abstraction (\\"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)\\").  How many funk/dance/pop artists could you say that about?
B001H5X7I4|4.0|I liked the concept about a bumbling film crew in Vietnam making a war movie.     Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Michael Downey Jr. do a fine job in this comedy.    As the director, Stiller keeps it moving at a healthy pace.    Worth a watch.
015603283X|1.0|Five-stars? Pérez-Reverte a genius?? mystery for intellectuals??? Are you freaking kidding me. When a movie, which is its self mediocre, easily bests its sourse text in terms of plot, character development and style what more can you say. On a scale of 0-10 I give this book one mark above the Da Vinci Code: a one. If you want to read a book that is actually deserving of this trumpted up spew/hype then check out Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose.[[ASIN:0307264890 The Name of the Rose (Everyman's Library (Cloth))]]

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Critics gave the film a positive response, in particular Craig's performance and credibility. During production this had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as Craig did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark, and suave. The Daily Telegraph compared the quality of Craig's characterization of Bond to Sean Connery's and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions. The Times compared the more assertive portrayal by Craig to Timothy Dalton, and praised the action as edgy,[64] with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.[65] Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films,[66] Kim Newman of Empire[67] and Todd McCarthy of Variety[68] all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal, and cold.<br /><br />The film was similarly well received in North America. MSNBC gave the movie a perfect 5 star rating.[69] The film was described as taking James Bond \\"back to his roots\\", similar to From Russia with Love,[70] where the focus was on character and plot rather than the high-tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticised in Die Another Day.[68] Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie an aggregate rating of 94%, the highest rating for a wide-release of the year. It is the fifth-highest rating for a Bond film on the site behind Goldfinger which received a 95%, The Spy Who Loved Me and From Russia with Love which both received a 96%,[71][72] and Dr. No, with a 97% score.[73] Metacritic gave the movie a Metascore of 81, signifying \\"Universal Acclaim.\\"[74] Entertainment Weekly named the film as the fifth best of the series,[75] and chose Vesper Lynd as the fourth best Bond girl in the series.[76] Some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by Craig's performance to consider him a viable candidate for an Academy Award nomination.[77][78][79] Roger Ebert gave the film a four out of four star rating, the first for any of the James Bond films he reviewed. Ebert stated that Casino Royale answered many of the questions he had begun to ask himself about the 45-year-old series, like why no character seems to have any real emotions. Ebert also felt that this was the first Bond film that got him to care about Bond, and the rest of the characters.[80]<br /><br />However, the film met several mixed reactions. Though American radio personality Michael Medved gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \\"intriguing, audacious and very original... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas\\", he commented that the \\"sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics.\\"[81] Similarly, a reviewer for The Sun praised the film for its darkness and Craig's performance, but felt that \\"like the novel, it suffers from a lack of sharpness in the plot\\" and believed that it required additional editing, particularly the finale.[82] Commentators such as Emanuel Levy concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.[83] Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of The Observer who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.[84]t gave the film a four out of four star rating, the first for any of the James Bond films he reviewed.

B000IOM0WY|1.0|We have a top of the line Sony 52\\" XBR TV and Sony Blu-Ray player we purchased for Christmas and I purchased the Blu-ray version of this movie because we enjoy the movie so much.  It wasn't worth it!  It has trouble rewriting quickly during the action scenes.  We actually compared it to the regular DVD that we own and to be honest... it isn't worth the additional expense to purchase the Blu-ray.  Overall, we have noticed that with all of the older movies that have been converted to Blu-ray... they tend to be a disappointment in the blu-ray version for the same rewriting problems.  However, animations are incredible and all of the new movies that have recently been released in the theaters that are just coming out on Blu-Ray are great... like Ironman... that one was incredible on Blu-ray.
031606792X|2.0|Five members of the family read this book (including four middle school/high school members) and overall it receives an average 2 rating (the first three all were ranked 5 stars). Honestly, as one reviewer already said, it felt like someone completely different wrote this book.  I think that the more mature viewpoint of Edward and Bella (and baby), might have made more sense if a fourth book had transitioned their story (and Jacob's involvement in the triangle)to a fifth.  Additionally, the conflict with the other vampires, which had been more of a subplot before, needed another book to transition to the major plot.  Essentially, the first three books were fantasy/romance novels; this one read more like a fantasy/action adventure with a romance undertone.  Jacob is the only character that seemed consistent with the past for most of the book (though his personality was a bit watered-down with the imprint issue) and the change in Bella's father was a major disappointment. At the end, we all found ourselves longing for a less \\"happily-ever-after\\" and a more \\"realistically-ever-after\\" ending.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This was an excellent movie... probably one of Robert Downy Jr.'s best.  Unlike most Blu-ray movies that are older that have been converted to blu-ray, this one (being so new) was meant for Blu-ray.  It is truly incredible in HD.  The colors are so vibrant and you can see ever little detail on our 52\\" Sony Bravia.  This is worth every penny!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I thought that the buzz about an Oscar for Heath Ledger as the Joker was over-hype. No! It's well deserved. An excellent follow-up to Batman Begins. A great comic book movie! No sleeping through this movie. I thought that it almost crossed the PG-13 line into R territory.
031606792X|2.0|It actually took me some time to define my opinion about this book. There are so many people who hate it (seems like about a third of those who have read Twilight series) and even more of those who love it. Few are in between.<br /><br />Although I haven't been a Twilight die-hard fan, I enjoyed books 1-3 quite a bit. Just like everybody else, I skipped through them propably in a week. I never disillusioned myself about SM's quality of writing, but yet, we all have to admit, there is something about these books that just draws you in.<br /><br />And then, I started reading Breaking Dawn. I didn't have any kind of high expectations, but like everybody else, I knew there were things that were destined to happen based on the story lines of previous three books (just the same way we knew that, let's say, Harry Potter would take a stand against Voldemort). This things were: wedding, consummation (don't lie to yourself, this is what we all were looking forward to!), Bella becoming a vampire, Volturi's claim on Alice, Edward and Bella.<br /><br />All these were touched upon in BD, but the that was all, just a touch. These events never became a focal point of the plot of the last book in the series. All these issues did come up and were resolved instantly, without any hesitation or struggle. Nobody opposed the wedding; wedding night went almost without a hitch, lacked romance, intimacy, or any kind of details; Bella became the bestest vampire ever and never experienced bloodthirst everybody was warning her about.<br /><br />So what is left to drive the story? This is where comes in the craziest, most absurd and illogical \\"twist\\" that so many fans defend - Renesmee (did I spell this right?). Her existance didn't make any sense, her presence killed the romance story we all loved so much.<br /><br />Impossible pregnancy aside, what surprised and disappointed me the most about this last installment was total lack of any kind of believable conflict (peaceful Volturi standoff instead), but abandance of useless narrative (J.Jenks storyline, Jacob'Seth'Leah endless patrols, numerous new vampires with special talents nobody cared about).<br /><br />I won't go as far as to rate this book at 0 or 1. There were few entertaining scenes, and the book did give some semblance of closure. But this closure was similar to the one you get from reading fanfiction. Yes, it shows you your favorite characters happy, but you know it's not the real thing, the real book would have been so much better and truer to the story. But unfortunately, we will never read that \\"real\\" Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />Many fans defend this books saying that this is SM's story and she wrote it the way she wanted it to be written. That's fine, but looks like this story of hers wasn't all that good.<br /><br />The saddest thing about Breaking Dawn is that it managed to alienate so many dedicated fans. I've never heard of such a thing before, honestly. It pains me to see how many fans now try to find solace in making fun of SM and the entire series. Very sad...<br /><br />Breaking Dawn could have cemented S. Meyer as a great storyteller, instead, this book exposed her (in my opinion) as an extremely weak writer. What does future hold for her?

0446579939|5.0|This was a great read,Highly recommened. Amazing that a photograph is good luck while Logan's in Irag and then he takes this journey across the country to give the photo back and finds Beth,the women of his dreams. Can't give too much about the story because don't want to ruin it. I got this for Christmas and couldn't stop reading it. Only took a couple of days to read.LOVE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL THING!

0375826726|4.0|i bought this for my grandson who is 11 yrs and he has been waiting for it i guess for a while. he loves this type of book and read it in a few days, only reading at night and some after homework. good read according to him
B001ECDVZE|5.0|Although Frank Miller's The Spirit has been recieving terrible reviews, you can't deny the majesty of this movie!  I could go on and on about all the different aspects of the film (including the beautiful women!) but [..]sez it better:    Review by Jeremy Wheeler   As far as comic adaptations go, Sin City is an unprecedented book-to-screen translation that's locked, loaded, and rip-roaring ready to introduce movie audiences to the mad genius that is Frank Miller. By meticulously re-creating the acclaimed comic creator's most personal work, co-director Robert Rodriguez has given Miller's creation the chance to live and breathe using the exact hard-nosed dialogue and iconic camera shots from the acclaimed graphic novels. The end result is a mad brushstroke of digital filmmaking that is risqué enough to be considered bold, while palatable enough for exploitive entertainment purposes. It remains to be seen what the unprepared masses will think of Sin City -- in fact, there couldn't be a better, more PC time for the flick to hit. Basically a slap in the face to neo-conservative ideals, the film is so full of gleeful graphic violence and raw, steaming sexuality that there's sure to be some kind of backlash somewhere. The cast is a knockout, with major kudos going to Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, and even a smaller, supporting appearance by Rutger Hauer as they fulfill their inspired casting choices and take delicious delight in this world of corruption and sleaze. The stark black-and-white visuals are the real star here though, merging film noir sensibilities and dynamic comic panel storytelling with the help of a heap-load of computer graphics and inventive filmmaking to create something that's new, raw, and refreshing. Additionally, the direct translation is both exciting and a bit jarring, lending an unusual pace that you don't see in modern cinema; just as the gusto violence will turn off many and probably create more cynics in the critical circles, so too will the film continue to polarize its viewers due to its experimental nature. Comparisons will no doubt be drawn between the page and screen for years to come, which might hurt the film simply because it is an adaptation and no matter how direct a translation it is, there's bound to be things that are lost in the process. Still, after years of being jerked around in Hollywood, Miller is finally given the tools to strut his stuff on the big screen and, love it or leave it, perfect or not, that's exactly what Sin City is.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|having just a passing knowledge of the P&P book I could never figure out why this film was called P&P...never saw ANY incident of either, rather justifiable emotions...was annoyed with the Lizzy wardrobe, geez, Jane had decent gowns, why the brazen slipnot stitch overkill???  The dialogue was too sharp for a female even in this era and too witty for believability...what were the duties of all these people in even overseeing the workers, farming, cleaning, even Mr. Bennett just played with orchids and dragonflies, although loved Sutherland in the role...just rich people worried about balls n who has how much quid per year...and one last gripe, the bust of Darcy was exquisite but the back side looked hideous, did they run out of money for the most important piece in the gallery??? pithy items aside, I really fell in love with this film even tho the music score was limited and threaded simply throughout, the majestic mountain and the meeting at sunrise scenes remain in my heart n soul...they seemed very real and deep and poured through my body, wonderful feeling that compares to very few moments in film, my life, or imagination. Kiera is abs stunning except when she starts yelling after the Darcy proposal, her jaw looks too harsh and oh yes, the makeup at sunrise was waaay overdone...personally, that hottie that married  the youngest did not ever get enuff screen time IMHO ...
B001ECQ6PG|4.0|I am very very happy with this turn table so far.  I got it today and it was ready to go right out of the box.<br /><br />Great sound from it's internal speaker and I love how portable the unit is.<br /><br />So far I've recorded about three albums onto my computer and the sound quality is very good - even on records quite scratched and warped with age.<br /><br />I am a Mac user and the correct software was NOT bundled with the turntable.  I had to go to Numark's website to download the right software, but am happy with the result.  The noise reduction in audacity requires some tinkering but you can get good noise reduction results without sacrificing too much of the original audio of your recordings.<br /><br />I'm very happy with my new toy and will be recording records onto my computer and playing records on this little portable wonder for years to come.
B00122N0MU|5.0|Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler have been making alot of very good music for a long time (I admit Money For Nothing was the first song I really knew from MTV) and often trying to put together a set of music for artist like this is hard.  There are a couple of things missing, The Princess Bride is one of my favorite movies and soundtracks of all time, but this collection is very go and not simply a Greatest Hits Package.    Of course there is Money and Sultans of Swing, but songs like Brothers in Arms, a very moving track that is not as well known and Skateaway show that in putting this together the good breadth and depth was considered.    Very well done and not just a throw together greatest hits.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Fleet Foxes are the once and future kings of the currently thriving \\"bearded indie folk\\" music scene (along with the likes of Iron & Wine, Bon Iver and Sea Wolf), and there's a good reason for that. In addition to the heaps of accolades from indie music gatekeepers like Pitchfork (who picked this record and its prequel EP \\"Sun Giant\\" as the best of 2008),there's the music itself - at once timeless and thoroughly contemporary. Rare is the band that can deliver compositions which seem to have been dredged up from some lost archive of American musical history (the classic example being the debut record from The Band), but the songs on this record could as easily have come from 1800s Appalachia as from Seattle in the 2000's.     Shimmering, echoey harmonies combined with delicately eclectic instrumentation, and lyrical imagery that conjures up everything from Edward Gorey illustrations (\\"White Winter Hymnal\\" with its line about \\"following the pack all swallowed in their coats/ with scarves of red tied round their throats/ to keep their little heads/ from falling in the snow...\\") to sun-drenched California beaches. That's Fleet Foxes - easily one of the most accomplished and beautiful releases of the past year.
6302862949|5.0|As a Gregory Hines fan, I was not disappointed in this movie. Though not a big ballet fan, Baryshnikov was excellent and a suprisingly good actor. Just the right amount of action and suspense make it worthwhile owning/seeing.
140120841X|5.0|This is by far Alan Moore's best work. His later work delves into more arcane moral problems but this book confronts the evil of fascism and group think with an amazing clarity. I consider this one of the best books I've read, graphic or otherwise.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|This is hands down their best album in 18 years!   It ranks up there with the albums of the Bon Scott period. I can't point out any songs because all of them are amazing. I am wanting to listen time after time to this Album. Simple and liquid. It don't tire me while listen for ýt does be simple and liquid.    I think best rock album of 2008 and 2009. If you like a rock, just buy it. Because your job!
B00005K3O4|2.0|I know there are plenty of people who love this movie and I remember seeing it when I was young.  It was not scary then and its not scary now.  It is good cheesy fun though with a lot of bad acting and a plot to not even care about.  I liked it enough to set through once again in my older years now and I have to say my movie tastes have changed enough to where this movie isn't worth a second watch.  Special features aren't great at all even though they are there for people who care.  Picture quality is good and so is audio but other than that not much going for it.  I know its a cult favorite and that's fine for most fans if you like it that much but its not really going to be for everyone.  That is usually the way it goes for cult favorites though it is usually love or hate.  It is good to watch again if you haven't seen it for a while but other than that not much here anymore.
159448385X|5.0|After the the Kite Runner I thought that his books could not get any better, but this book right here surpassed my expectations.  So well, written, I was so attached to the characters, wonderful ending, I could not put this book down. Emotional, Adventurous, keeps you anxious to see what happends next.  Shocking in some ways... Please write another one, Khaled.  I highly recommend his book, the best I've read! What I can say... Read it and see!!!!!
B000UBMSB8|2.0|I'm on my 4th attempt to get a playable copy of this product. The first three times I received my order, the main wide-screen, original theatrical version of the film had scratched areas on the surface that made the disc unplayable.  I didn't even bother to check the rest of the disks. The abrasions have to be occurring either in the manufacturing or packing process, because all of the disks in the set arrive properly seated in their case. Buyer beware!
0143143492|4.0|I have read the book and am now in the process of listening to the book on CD's.  Wow - I can relate to most everything Eckhart speaks to, but I am struggling with the \\"how\\" - how to put it into practice.  I am going to be joining an \\"Eckhart Tolle\\" discussion group this week and hope to gain more insight by sharing in other's experiences during or after reading the book.  Bottom Line...it just makes sense.  I think anyone who picks up the book will have some ah-hah moments, but it does require some concentration and possibly reading certain parts over again to gain a better comprehension of what Eckhart is saying...worth your time - worth all of our time!
B000W74EQC|5.0|This is the first of a series of very entertaining movies for the family.  I look at the movies as something completely different then the books, which makes them both different and both enjoyable.
B001IWO870|5.0|I teach reading at the Junior High level and am a fan of young adult books. This is well written, moves quickly, and provides a great introduction to Greek Mythology. This is the fourth installment and is the best since the first book, the Lightning Thief. The entire series is masterful, on the same level as Tolkien and Harry Potter. I strongly recomend this series and can not wait till the fifth and final book comes out in may.
B000W4KT64|5.0|This movie was one of the best I have seen in a while .It was very funny and entertaining.
0723257639|5.0|Beatrix Potter's, The World of Peter Rabbit, book set is fantastic.  We purchased this set for our seven year old son because the books were recently pulled from our public library.  Potter's vocabulary affirms the intelligence of children and her imaginiative world of talking animals is captivating for both young and old.  This set of classics is well worth the dollars sacrificed to place it on our home library shelves!
0920668364|5.0|I sent this book to a friend who has been caring for her mother, aged 98.  She enjoyed it, and shared with her brother, saying it meant more to them as adults.
B000CNESU8|5.0|A vision of today; writ large by powerful performances and outsized egos. The excellent commentary track, quality audio transfer, and fairly good video transfer more than make up for the second (filler) disk.
0140157352|4.0|I have also read (next to \\"you can negotiate anything') the second version of the above book written by Roger Fisher and William Ury. The ideas in this book are meant to show ¡§how to get what you are entitled to while still getting along with the other side.¡¨  The author focuses on four points. 1/ separate the people from the problem, then 2/ focus on interest and 3/ invent options and lastly 4/ insist on using objective criteria.  In focusing on separating the people from the problem you should ask yourself ¡§Am I paying enough attention to the people problem?¡¨ The way through is thinking in three categories { perception, emotion and communication. Substantive issues and relationship are listed by the author .  A working relationship where trust, understanding, respect and friendship are built up over time can make each new negotiation smoother and more efficient (as I experienced myself, with Schoenwald being the third hotel from which I have purchased china).  To focus on the interest, you should focus on the human needs. ¡§If you want the other side to stimulate your interests, begin by demonstrating that you appreciate theirs¡¨ declare the authors, and suggest making a list of specifics interests.  Identify interest by asking why and why not, and especially look for share interest.  In understanding the interests of the other side well, you may invent ways of reconciling interests on the value of an ongoing relationship. However, you will always face the harsh reality of a conflict of interests.  The key action for inventing options is brainstorming. The authors propose three steps fro creative options - brainstorming, during brainstorming and after brainstorming .You should generate many options before selecting among them. ¡§Invent first, decide later.¡¨  The other side is more likely to accept a solution if it seems the right thing to do in terms of being fair, legal, honorable and so forth (principled standards). Principled negotiations (based on objective criteria such as market value, precedent, efficiency, cost or tradition) produce wise agreements amicably and efficiently.  On page thirteen the authors suggest how to switch from positional bargaining to principled negotiation in five steps.  BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) is the only standard that protects you from accepting terms that are too unfavorable and from rejecting terms that would be in your interest. The BATNA has to be prepared carefully because the better the BATNA, the greater your power. Negotiations only make sense if you are likely to achieve better than your BATNA.   The three-step process to develop the BATNA is: 1/ invent a list of actions to take if no agreement is reached, 2/ improve some of the most promising ideas and 3/ select the one alternative that seems best. This will not only enable you to decide the minimally acceptable agreement but will help you to raise the maximum.  In the \\"ten questions people ask about Getting to Yes\\" (which are the main part of the review) the author provides answers about dealing with people, tactics, power and fairness and principled negotiation.   The author's last suggestion is how to make best use of your potential power by using each source of power in harmony with others sources and not using the strongest power alone. To be more efficient as a negotiator you should believe in what you are saying and doing, so you are comfortable.
1582701709|5.0|I actually have read this book several times and each time get something else out of it; loved the book.
032147404X|5.0|I have been working with film cameras for years but found the information in this book to be very helpful in adapting what I knew to my new digital equipment.  I have recommended this book to friends and bought one for my brother-in-law who recently bought his first dslr.  It should be the first digital photography book you buy.    The information is presented just as if Scott was standing there talking to you.  Not full of technical jargon but very informative.  He likes to throw some of his personal humor, and you don't always see it coming but it helps to make it a good read.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|This DVD is so much fun!  As the Doctor would say, \\"Fantastic!\\"  The episodes are exciting and scary with some ongoing mysteries running throughout them.  The extras are fun to watch and the commentaries are funny and interesting.  I love the variety of monsters they bring to this season.
B001N44BVQ|1.0|I don't know who did the casting in this movie, but this movie should be enough to make sure that they never work anywhere of repute again.<br /><br />Dicaprio (still looking about 14 years old) tries very hard to breathe life into his character-- which is supposed to be that of a hard-nosed, foul-mouthed veteran spy. But it just doesn't work (and that's being generous). The role would have been more appropriate for someone like Billy Bob Thornton or Michael Wincott.<br /><br />The plot is not all that interesting, and it was hard to sit through the whole movie. Or maybe it was a marginally interesting plot-- but it collapsed under the weight of trying to believe DiCaprio's character.
032147404X|5.0|I can't say enough good things about Scott Kelby.Since I read Volume 1&2,my photos have improved immensley.If you want to know more about your camera than you ever did,get these books.Scott explains in detail how to take great photos.He tells you what equipment he uses and makes recommendations according to what you can afford.This is by far the best investment I've made.I am now planning on upgrading to an DSLR! Thanks Scott for these books.

B000F9RB8A|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle is one of those films you might easily pass up.  But I rented it one day and was incredibly surprised.  The story isn't the main point even though it is a good one.  But the characters are the big kicker.  All the fights are great to watch. Now trying to get the wife to watch it is a different story.  But if she is cool or you just want great fun in a movie, I would even buy it without even seeing it first.  Especially at the low cost.

0060872675|4.0|This children's book follows right along the lines of most of the other Disc World type books that he has written. Probably good for about 2+ children. It is a story about a man who is reading 'Where's My Cow?' to his son. So in a since it is a story...within a story. Very cute and the illustrations are also very good.
0446615641|5.0|The book was David Baldacci at his best. I am a big fan of \\"The Camel Club\\" and this book was no exception.

B000OVLBFS|5.0|This is the first in the Jesse Stone series of four movies and is very well done. I would stronly recommend anyone buying this movie buy all the other three as well. My wife and I made a weekend of watching the entire series in order and really enjoyed it... Tom Selleck is great, the acting is well done by others in the cast. High quality for a made for TV series.... If I could give it 10 stars I would.

1439130833|4.0|...I'm one of those people who don't know how to exist outside of the monotinous 9-5 rat-race and as soon as I got this calendar I was overjoyed!  Now I can sit in my cubicle and envision all the things I want/need/wish I had rather than mutter explitives under my breath.  One day I was just getting to work, totally psyched about the new day's page, when I realized it was gone.  Unbelievable!  So I sat at my desk and envisioned my calendar. I tried tapping into the power of attraction, softly speaking and eventually coming to a crecendo shouuting \\"UNIVERSE RETURN THAT WHICH I HAVE EARNED TO ME!\\" Sure enough, the next thing I know BAM the calendar hits me in the head (I also heard my secretary saying something like \\"it fell on the floor dumbass\\").  Simply marvelous!<br /><br />Look, you want to feel good about yourself for less than $15?  Give that money to a homeless guy and stop whining.

B0013D8LOK|5.0|This is an important occasion in my life for it is the first time I have ever taken to a musical (which I usually find really silly) to the point where I played the soundtrack while I applied my makeup in the morning, while I ate breakfast, while I drove to work and even while I cooked dinner at night...   I sing Helenas' part of the stirring 'My Friends' while I walk my dogs at the dog park-  \\"I'm your friend too, Mr. Todd.  If you only knew, Mr. Todd.  Ooh, Mr. Todd,  You're warm  In my hand...  You've come home...  Always had a fondness for you,  I did.\\"  Oh, I sing this soundtrack constantly. My co-workers just love it when I break into `By the Sea', which I do at least twice a day, kissing my boss. I sing 'A Little Preist' while I use the snow blower at the top of my lungs outside and I don't care who hears me.   This music is addictive. Who cares if Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter aren't the most excellent vocalists on the planet, they are perfect to me. If I ever met Helena, I'd drop to my knees and cry. She's that good in this role. I can't imagine anyone better for Sweeney Todd and I'm glad Tim Burton picked them in his infinite wisdom. This movie  helps me get through my boring life and I'm grateful for it!   This is like chocolate for the soul.

7119005901|5.0|I don't want to leave a long comment because the truth is the book is a great classic. My only problem with it has been constant grammar errors. Once Lord Guan Yu is referred to as Lory Guan Yu, and just things like that. In fact, on the back of the book their is an error in the first line, so I will say that I wish the editor would have done a better job with the errors, but other than that, it's flawless!
0743437497|2.0|This book sucked. The ideas and themes were interesting sometimes, but the writing was awful. Let me give some examples.<br /><br />\\"Whimpering with fear, she began to pull herself upwards again. Ten steps, a dozen, a baker's dozen.\\"<br /><br />Stephen King seems to be full of these little things, call them puns or quirks or flaws, they're everywhere, and they're totally stupid and distract from what otherwise might be a passably interesting story.<br /><br />Also, he puts parentheses in the middle of sentences explaining things that are obvious already. He does this constantly, sometimes up to five times a page.<br /><br />Other examples include Wendy being \\"Afraid he would pop up like a jack-in-the-box--pun intended.\\" Why in god's name would Wendy, clutching a knife and afraid her husband is going to murder her, be making puns?<br /><br />Another gem: \\"A nightmare flood of thoughts flooding through his mind in a split second.\\"<br /><br />The action was good and easy enough to make me keep reading, but I found myself groaning more often in annoyance than fear.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Why can Hollywood make wonderful movies like \\"The Road Home\\" It is a beautiful, moving love story, goes back and for between the past and the present. The past is in black & white and the present in technicolor. I highly recommend this movie
B00006AFF5|5.0|This is a great movie. It is a remake of the classic cartoon \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\\" Very well done! Now to the DVD...    Disc 1 is the same Collector's Edition DVD that is also available by itself in a single disc edition. It includes the Full Screen format instead of Widescreen though. It has the following bonus features: Spotlight on Location, Deleted Scenes, Outtakes, Makeup Application and Design, Seussian Set Decoration, Visual Effects, Faith Hill \\"Where are you Christmas?\\" Music Video. It also includes Max's Playhouse (Sing-Along Songs, Read-Along: \\"The Care and Feeding of a Grinch\\", Dress the Grinch, and Rhyme Time). I am quite sure that Disc 1 is exactly the same as the single disc edition of \\"The Grinch\\", except that the film is in full screen rather than widescreen.     Disc 2 contains the widescreen version of the film. It also includes: Enhanced Feature Commentary with Acedemy Award Winner Ron Howard, More Who-liday Recipes, Fun-Filled \\"Who-Bilation 1000\\" Games, Put the Grinch in your Photographs (on DVD-ROM), and much more!     If you are debating whether to buy the 2-Disc Deluxe Edition or the Collector's Edition, I highly suggest that you purchase the Deluxe Edition because it contains the same film and bonus features as the Collector's Edition, as well as many more. It is also pretty close to the same price as the Collector's Edition.    It's a great movie, at a great price! Get it today!

031606792X|5.0|I personally thought that Breaking Dawn was excellent. Its even my favorite and I'm an older reader, so when I got hooked on the Twilight Saga- I was surprised. I think people should back off from Stephenie Meyer's back for her choice in plot. If anything, I see potential for working off from Breaking Dawn--I really really hope she does. She's a brilliant writer who creates brilliant plots.
031606792X|3.0|I loved the first three books so I admit, it would be hard to live up to my expectations.  There were a lot of things I liked about this book such as the wedding, honeymoon and Renesme.  As a mother myself, I was a little worried about Bella missing out on the experience of motherhood so that was a pleasant surprise.  But then there was really no climax to the story.  The scene in the field w/the Volturi was pretty boring.  And we definitively never found out if vampires have souls, though it was hinted at.  I am sad that the saga is over and am already missing Edward and Bella.

After a whirl wind night, Margo disappears and is now an even bigger mystery to him. Q is determined to find Margo...<br /><br />This author is a first for me, but John Green's writing is very compelling and pulls you into what quickly became an awesome read.  I felt frustrated, amused, wherever the author took the characters, I was there with them.  There's not too many authors out there who can pull me into a story to this degree.  It was a new, refreshing plot, and a read I think anyone would enjoy. A great read, and I know I'll be looking for more John Green books!!

The 2 disc addition is the one to own.

From cover to cover, I enjoyed reading about how people view choices and incentives and what kinds of forces exist that distract us from making sound decisions.  It truly is a fascinating study into human psychology and its intersection with economics.<br /><br />I personally disagree with the author's broader interpretation of his studies regarding economic policy and the need for intervention to save people from making poor choices.  I argue that even if a person makes an objectively irrational choice, as long as that person perceives the decision to have made him or herself better off, it's ultimately a good choice.  Again, objectively, this may not always be the case, but from a subjective standpoint it works.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I heard the hype but I still refused to get too excited. Then I saw it! WOW! The film is amazing on every level. Heath Ledger took a well known and often played character and made it his own. This is not your dad's Joker...this is the Joker that terrorized us in The Dark Knight Returns and the Killing Joke (2 of the finest Batman graphic novels) and he elevated it. The hero is only as good as his villain and this movie delivered. See it! All of you! Even if you don't like comic books or superhero movies!<br /><br />This is not for kids under 16 (13 if you are a liberal). Save your money the 2 disc special edition is not special at all!
0743201140|5.0|After taking survey, the top 5 results gave me clarity to my personal strengths and I have used them to further my career.  In addition, I've bought copies for my entire management team to compare individual strengths and how we can be a strength overall to our Company.
0060512806|5.0|It took me a couple tries to get into this book... multi inch think books can be a bit daunting.  However, once I was through the first section I quickly found myself infatuated.  The interweaving of multiple different story lines into one tale makes for an interesting read.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|So, I finally saw The Dark Knight.    This film attempts to do a lot. On some fronts it utterly succeeds. On several, though, it is blithely simple minded.    The action is spectacular enough, but I don't really buy into the nearly perfect timing of everything, particularly around the character of the Joker. For those who don't know this film the Joker is deftly painted as Satan incarnate, and his resulting efforts at destruction are fully befitting the Evil One himself.    But, the puzzle is a little too machine like, a little too perfect. There's nothing earthy about this film, as was in Batman Begins. There was far and away much more being attempted in TDK, and because they tried to do so much they actually did too much. The film suffers from repeated episodes of the bad guy doing bad things to good people over and over. I realize that in reality life very much emulates that, but in a two and half hour film I don't need to get the point more than once. Not that tragedy isn't wanted for understanding, but seriously how many versions of light versus darkness must we endure in order to finish a story?    Perhaps I'm not far enough into comics to understand what's going on here, but I got the distinct impression that the writers of the film didn't want us focusing on Batman or the Joker, but on ourselves, and I came away feeling clipped like someone had just tackled me by the ankles with their feet. It just didn't come off well. It was very good action entertainment, and it packed a message anyone over the age of 14 should be able to grasp, but it was in no way worth the $500 million it earned at the box office. I think the American audience has lost it's respect for real art. What we want now are special effects and intricate plots and methods, but no actual substance. At least that's what we are getting. Films that attempt to do too much have been en vogue since Titanic came out.    Perhaps I am too much of an old school entertainee. But, really, watch the originalStar Wars again and recognize why these films were so good to begin with. That film did plenty with a not so obvious cast, unusual artistry in the production of action, and a budget that went for somewhat less than $20 million, even well done for 1977. And, the Star Wars enterprise could have easily taken on the concepts presented in this Batman film. In many ways it did, but the majesty of it is still unparalleled in film to this very day. The Dark Knight doesn't even come close.    Stop trying to trick me, the viewer. I got bored with the third slight of hand activity presented. Subtance over confusion, any time.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Man on Wire is technically a documentary but feels like a good drama with humor, suspense and character development.  I was only vaguely familiar with the actual history so I was completely blown away by Petit's incredible feats.  I originally saw it on the big screen;  I think the DVD will be best appreciated on as large a flatscreen as you can get.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|Okay so I am biased because I am a HUGE Fall Out Boy fan, with them taking up a good portion of iPod in video and song. I will however try to tell you honestly of the high and lows of each song, because it's definitely not perfect, but it sure as hell ain't a 1 star. My iTunes is weird so the songs aren't exactly in Cd order...sorry.     1) I Don't Care: The opening chords resemble \\"Man I Feel Like a Woman\\" and the lyrcis aren't exactly epic, I'll admit that. It is catchy though, in the way that a single should be. The video is grand.    2) America's Suithearts: What a title. Pat's vocal range takes on a new form in this song, hitting notes in amazing ways. The chorus is sure to get stuck in anyone's head. Lyrics are fun. The video creeped me out big time at first, but I find myself loving it with time.    3) Coffee's for Closers: It starts out a little low key considering what they've been doing lately, but it's nice. The bridge picks up steam and delivers a driving chorus.    4) Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes: This one flies under my radaar for some reason, but it's a good enough track. The very begining doesn't hold any jazz (for me), but once again it picks up quickly and the chorus reminds me of something from Cork Tree with their 'in your face' way of words.    5)Headfirst Slide Into Cooperstown On a Bad Bet: Song title aside (it irks me for unknown reasos)the begining has an intriguing ring and Pat's voice sucks you in. The chord's played are short and to the point, but they're unique in the way that they ring. The lyrics are pretty good and the slower part of the chorus really hits home.    6)She's My Winona: Um...this one is beyond me. Not bad, but I feel like I'm missing out on some inside joke with this song...not in it's meaning, but in what makes it so enjoyable to some.     7)The(Shipped)Gold Standard: The lyrics are bouncy and witty. The chorus is brillantly arranged. The chords are perfect. It's soft, but deep. Overall jus an amazing track.    8)Tiffany Blews: The BEST song on the entire album. Insanely catchy, the begining shows of Pat's vocal range like no other. The lyrics are just as witty and in your face as those from previous albums. Listen in to the 'little black dress' it's just so genuis. Lil WAyne (I have no idea why he's in the song) doesn't ruin it, he actually fits in quite well.    9)W.A.M.S.: The chords and chorus got stuck in my head instantly, it's just so catchy! Lyric wise it's pretty good. Very enjoyable.    10)West Coast Smoker: The opening rings and sucks you in. The lyrics aren't epic, but they're decent. The chorus gets you, but not completely, if that makes sense. Another random fact, why do so many bands mention bulls? (Think Academy Is...)    11)What A Catch, Donnie: Take it for what it is...the Golden of Folie a Deux, but revamped. It's slow, it's sweet, it's there. Don't skip it, listen in, it's not all for nothing. The guest singers add the depth as Fall Out Boy looks back to their past. The singers are great (though Brendon seems really shrill) in adding a thoughtful but nostalgic tone to the song.    12)20 Dollar Nose Bleed: The begining is so Pretty.Odd but wait!- that's because Brendon Urie is a main vocal component in it. Him and Pat go head to head as they stretch their voices to maximize the witty lyrics given to them. Epic. The song is upbeat, bubbly, and worth it all. Quirky brillance.    13)27: Gasp! A legit swear and in the opening words, no less. Otherwise it's a good addition to the album. The vocals and notes are once again to the point and quick but they make each word and chord unique. Overall, it's a very good song.     Folie a Deux was different. It's not Take This To Your Grave, or From Under The Cork Tree...those days seem to have passed, but they are not forgotten. It's not Infinity on High though either. It's a combination of it, with new elements and surprise. I may not sound as enthusiastic as a 5 star should, but that's because no one would take me seriously if I said \\"It's an amazing song!\\" over and over.     That is supposed to be a real look on the songs...despite my bias. I hope it helped.
B000O179FO|5.0|This BD version of Dreamgirls is just great.  Besides the movie itself (which is very good), Dreamgirls is beautifully reborn on BD.     Video and Sound quality is just awesome!!  This is my first Blu Ray disc and I feel no regret at all spending money on different format (I own DVD version too).    The movie is good and the price ir right... WHY NOT.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A thoroughly enjoyable movie that gets the most of its stars and locations, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is just about as much fun as you'll find in 2 hours of a movie.

1416575464|5.0|This is a great book. I must have about 50 interior design books and this is in my top 5. I love the bold colors, and the use of surprising elements.
B000002P7R|4.0|I was so glad when this album was released.  It was a wonderful addition to the Hendrix cannon.  You'll enjoy some \\"demos\\" of Hendrix classics and some deep unreleased cuts.  It's just nice to hear some new cuts from such an amazing musician... even if it's not a total earth shaker.  This is NOT a greatest hits collection.  But, if you love Jimi's music, this is a chance to see deeper into what his musical process was like.<br /><br />Top Tracks:  Sweet Angel, Power of Soul
B00008WT5J|2.0|When you think AC/DC, you are thinking \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", \\"TNT\\" and \\"For Those About to Rock\\"... not movie soundtrack score.  But, that's what you get with \\"Who Made Who\\" which was essentially the soundtrack for Stephen King's \\"Maximum Overdrive\\".  In the context of the movie, the score Angus and the boys put together totally works... on it's own, it's just kinda blah instrumentals (save a couple of exceptions).  Do yourself a favor and just buy the title track as a single... that song does rock!<br /><br />Top Tracks:  Who Made Who
0345495004|5.0|This was a good book and easy read.  It helps bring into focus that famous people are real and have faults just like everyone else.
B001JG8AU6|4.0|When You Are Engulfed in Flames by David Sedaris is his latest book of short stories.  Most of these stories center around his life with his boyfriend, Hugh, but some don't.  I'd heard Monster Mash before because it's also on Holidays On Ice.  Most of the stories are humorous and some are hilarious.<br /><br />Carl and I roared with laughter as we listened to In The Waiting Room.  In it, Sedaris tells about quitting French classes (he was living in France) and just using d'accord (roughly translates as okay) as his all-purpose answer and the troubles it got him into.  Since we lived in France for two years, we could really relate to this story.<br /><br />There is lots of adult language and crude humor in these stories.  Town and Country in particular, but I will admit to chuckling as I listened to it.  Just keep in mind that these stories aren't for children or those who are easily offended.<br /><br />Like any collection of short stories, some of these are better than others.  Overall, I enjoyed them.
B0011NVC98|1.0|Beowulf is a classic tale that deserves better than this. I hated the video-game style imagery. The poem is beautiful to hear, and to adapt it visually it deserves a beautiful visual style, more lushly beautiful, more fantastic, more starkly ugly, grittier and more brutally realistic, whatever. I found the style bland. The sound design could have gotten it a second star, if I could use it as an audio-play, that would be ok too, but no luck there, the sound design is similarly bland and artless. Now that this much money has been spent on this boring piece of drek it will be at least a decade before another production company takes a crack at this wonderful treasure of literature. What a waste.
B001GAOY5U|3.0|Better 3D glasses might have helped.  Not bad, but, overall I expected a little more in the way of plot, acting, scenery, and especially effects.  Blu-ray in general is so great because of its sharpness and its wonderful color rendition (saturated and sharp).   This movie didn't quite have the presentation I expect from a Blu-ray movie.
0312383320|4.0|I don't know what book the rest of you read, but I found this to be her best 'in-betweener'.  That's what this is; an in between the numbers novel; not the regular Stephanie Plum novel.  I actually developed a liking for Diesel in this book as well as Carl the monkey who wore on my nerves in the numbered book.  This is just fun fantasy folks, not 'The Grapes of Wrath'.  I wish all you people who keep stating you're disappointed in all the latest Plum books would just quit reading them then and find something else.  If you think it will be a waste of money to buy them, get on the waiting list at your library when the next ones come out.  Get a life people.  This was a fun ride and I laughed out loud!
0316066524|2.0|I just finished laboring through Infinite Jest, and have to say that this may well be the most incoherent, unsatisfying novel I've ever read.  In short doses, it's intriguing, but the sheer length (about 1,000 pages, and boy do I pity the editor) would suggest that there would be some degree of resolution by the end of this arduous journey.  But there isn't.      The book starts with an interesting set of scenes (a top-ranked tennis player getting rejected at the University of Arizona after a medical/psychotic meltdown in the Admissions office, a set of odd interactions around procuring drugs in Boston).  But we then go back in time, never to emerge.  When I finally got to the novel's conclusion, I just couldn't believe that so much undisciplined, rambling prose would leave the reader out in the wilderness.      Save yourself lots of time and find another book to read.
B001GQO50I|3.0|I would love to hear the first generation tapes but really, the cd doesn't sound that bad. Based on comments here I expected it to sound like the band was playing underwater. The guy who recorded it did a great job.    As to the issue of releasing cleaned up bootlegs, well, whoever owns the master tapes does not own the performance. The Doors have every right to release their music from whatever source they choose. Once stuff gets bootlegged, the owner of the masters loses lots of clout. I am surprised the band didn't pony up for the tapes though. It's not as if they can't afford it and you'd think they would want their archive to be best possible. It's for the ages right guys?  I doubt Neil Young would release something like this.
B001HYY35G|4.0|This video captured the energy of these boys music and some bad chicks too!!!  I just wish there was more concert footage.
0312370849|4.0|This is the first book I've read on the French roundup and camps during WWII, so from that perspective the book was compelling. Sarah's character had too much going on that didn't seem necessary or relevant to the story, but that didn't take away from my interest in the story. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B000RJO578|3.0|I hate giving this movie such a low rating since I am such a fan of S. of the Dead and of Simon Pegg himself. The worst thing about the movie is that it drags too often. I can stand a few slow spots, but it occurs frequently in the movie. What saves the movie from being a complete bore are the few scenes that are absolutely hilarious! When it's funny, it's really funny. Nick Frost, once again, does a great job at playing the bumbling side kick who has an obsession with Action movies (particularly Point Break). Simon plays his character dead serious, as the character is ment to be played, but it makes the character not interesting. Overall, an average movie. It just leaves me wishing it was better than it was.
B001676320|5.0|You really don't need a huge paragraph to describe this dvd folks. I will be speaking for the young generation on this one. I am only 19, big time listener of Chicago and I have been looking around for a Chicago dvd but with two greats like EWF and Chicago...... oohhhhhh man!!!  I saw this before with some friends and decided to buy it but this time on Blu-ray and I was amazed by the quality.  These two greats will amaze you with tight horns and will be one of your favoirte dvd's to watch when you need that Chicago or EWF fix......  GET IT NOW!!

B000002LQQ|4.0|A very good recording and some of Mark's better tunes. Some are contemplative and others rock. Love \\"Calling Elvis\\" and the titular track! Knopfler's voice is gravely, but well suited for this genre. Again, the recording itself is very clean and has some great guitar work and plenty of deep bass...even though I listen almost exclusively to Hi Rez music, this one sounds great in 16 bit stereo. Turn it up and he is right in the room with you! Recommended!

B0010ZR160|4.0|PLOT  An unlikely partnership of private detectives, a young couple, is hired by a dysfunctional family to locate a missing toddler.    REVIEW  Who would have thought Ben Affleck could equal Clint Eastwood as an actor-turned-director? I certainly didn't. And when it comes to the interpretation of Denis Lehane novels (Eastwood brought Lehane's \\"Mystic River\\" to the screen in 2004), I'd have to say Affleck just might have bettered his seasoned counterpart.    This is a complex, frightening, but ultimately uplifting film. Lehane's Boston, in all its understated, multi-layered glory, is captured methodically. The plot is dense and carefully imagined, and the main cast, Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, ensure the film plays out as a deeply personal, emotional tale.    \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" was a real surprise. Even if only one of the many brilliant sequences had made it to the final cut, it would still have lifted the film from the quagmire of today's cinematic mediocrity. But, you see, such sequences role by one after another, after another, and the gestalt effect is memorable.    ELEPHANT STAMPS  Ben Affleck for Directing.  Casey Affleck for Acting.  Ed Harris for Acting.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a beginner in exercising...so I promised myself to wake-up and do this every day this week; I started on Monday and was not able to do this workout again until this morning(Friday)because my entire body was aching!!! ---that was just from LEVEL 1    This is unlike any other workout dvd I have tried....I can feel it working (and especially in the following days you'll feel it) I hope to be able to wake up EVERY morning and do it....because in no time...I'll be thin!   Thanks Jillian!!     P.S. Make sure you have 2 5lb. hand weights for this one!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Loosely based on fact about Alvin York, the Tennessee troublemaker turned religious disciple after getting struck by lightning (really didn't happen, but hey...makes great story!). Entranced by the young 'Miss Gracie', Alvin decides he must marry the girl and be a proper farmer with bottom land to grow his crops. York proves his marksmenship using old cap and ball muskets during a turkey shoot to help get the money to buy the land. But fate once again denies Alvin his desires.<br /><br />Avid follower of the Bible, York reluctantly goes into the army after being drafted because \\"War is killin' an Ahm against killin!\\". Only after being handed a book on American History by his Commanding officer does York realise the seriousness of this overall, and goes to France to fight.<br /><br />The story then takes more actual facts based on actual events, showing York in action against the Germans, using his Tennessee woodsmen talents to pick off and shoot the Germans \\"Just like huntin' Turkeys\\".  Whats more impressive is York's solo capture of 124 Germans, thus earning him a Congressional Medal of Honor.<br /><br />Gary Cooper did a fine job portraying York, even had the real Alvin York coach him during the filming. With an all star cast, you can't go wrong. Child Stars such as Dickie Moore (\\"Ma wants ya Alvin....Ma wants yah!\\")and June Lockhart portray York's younger siblings, Walter Brennon plays Pastor Pyle wonderfully, guilding the confused York in tough times.<br /><br />A classic film that earned Cooper the Oscar. This is a film that should never be remade, its a classic from the start.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|Bought this for Christmas for our 8-year-old son. He likes it alot. The only thing he did not realize until after we put it together was that the smaller dart gun is a single load by hand. The larger gun and the two guns put together allow for multiple shots between reloads. One of his favorite things to do with the gun is to shot both put together at the same time.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have the DVD version and now have the Blu-Ray version. Yes it's THAT good.  Tom Hanks didn't feel he was done with the story after \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  The amount of reasearch, devotion and energy that went into this project will not soon be eclipsed.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This is the original trilogy I grew up with. They will always be better than the prequels...But, now my son gets to enjoy them (all six). We bought both box sets. We only wish they had a box set that contained all six episodes (they probably do).

B000W04S6U|5.0|This was an excellent soundtrack!  I play Halo, and appreciate the music, but this soundtrack surpassed all of my expectations.  It is a powerful, clever, and intelligent soundtrack.  If you are a fan of orchestrated soundtracks to movies, you'll love this!<br />  This soundtrack blends themes from the first game, and the second game, as well as a few new sounds.  Also, this was performed by an orchestra, not MIDI files.  The 2-disc set places the songs in the chronological order found in the game, with the rock song \\"LuVrFriends\\" at the end.<br />  Overall, this was a soundtrack that I will continue to listen to, for a long time to come; it just doesn't get old...
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This is a really fun movie and I knew all the lyrics! Why doesn't Hollywood make movies like this more?
B00102FELM|4.0|I thought the DVD was great from a song list and line-up standpoint. The Uli Roth era songs (with Uli) were great as well as seeing the brothers Schenker playing together.    I agree with other reviewers - the way the DVD was shot was very 80's MTV (I guess its no coincidence since the Scorps were the biggest in the 80s). Too much jumping around from band member to band member without focusing on the guest axe men.    I give the DVD a 4 out of 5 rating.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I bought this CD in the early 90s and I still can't help but crank it up, especially while driving on a sunny summer day. This is truly a masterpiece and I think it's one of Joe's best albums.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|A lot of nice and good new songs; not as many 'fast' ones, like \\"Picture to Burn\\" or \\"Should've Said No\\".  Consequently, they also all begin to sound the same, but that's just my opinion.  Take a listen for yourself before you buy.
B001DHXT2U|4.0|If your children are young to older teens, they will enjoy this high action flick.  If you grew up with Marvel Comics, and read the Hulk, you will also enjoy it.  Interesting special effects!
0743496736|2.0|Full of cliches. Every stereotypical teenage issue is included. You never even find out the shooter's thoughts or why he performed the act- he never really explains anything. We see everyone's point of view but his.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Excellent acting + excellent cast = great movie!!  This is a very good and well done movie, which the whole family can enjoy.  Hollywood!!! Listen up!  You don't have to have gore and sex to sell a good movie!
B001KW0C96|3.0|RIGHTEOUS KILL has a few things going for it. First off is the A-list talent. Pacino and De Niro are two of the greatest American actors alive today, with filmographys that include many of my favorite films of all time (TAXI DRIVER, THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS, CASINO). While the plot is not the most imaginative, it is suitable cop-drama fare. The twist that comes at the end may not surprise many, but at least it is consistent with the film.<br /><br />The real problem with this film is a script that does not allow De Niro or Pacino to dial into what has made them the actors they are beyond their formidable acting skills: playing interesting, well written characters. Cast as two NYPD officers with many years of experience who are frustrated with The System's inability to keep the bad guys off the street, Turk (De Niro) and Rooster (Pacino) decide to take matters into their own hands. The concept itself is cliched, but might have worked if these two great actors were given the opportunity to bring any depth to their characters. This is where the weak script really kills this movie. Pacino, fresh off the flop that was 88 MINUTES (also directed by Jon Avnet so he might have known to steer clear of this one) is mired in yet another work-horse of a plot with very little emotional depth or character development to really let him shine. De Niro looks defeated throughout, as if the lines he is asked to deliver are killing is soul. The impression is that this might have been an excellent film with better dialogue and more character development, that it might have been a classic right up there with films like Casino, that it had that potential but fell far short.<br /><br />Most of the criticisms leveled at this film (including my review) have a lot to do with \\"what might have been.\\" The expectation level for a film with two film greats in it was so high that it makes what is really an average film appear worse than it actually is. There is nothing wrong with a cop-drama buddy romp for old-times-sake. However, actors of this caliber cast in the same film do raise expectations, possibly even unfairly high. \\"There's nothing wrong with shooting,\\" says Pacino at one point in the film, \\"as long as the right people get shot.\\" In this case, it's Di Niro and Pacino facing a firing squad made of professional movie critics. It's up to you to decide if they deserved it.<br /><br />2.5/5 Stars. Worth renting if for no other reason than to build your hopes that the re-make of HEAT (currently in production) will be the movie that RIGHTEOUS KILL wasn't.mes-sake.

B001EE3DBO|3.0|\\"An eye for an eye does not make the world a more peaceful place...<br /> just full of more blind people\\"<br /><br />A seventeen year old bullied kid puts his foot down one day and  shoots up the whole school. But with  every crime there are consequences. The book instantly draws the reader in with that first scene but then jumps back and forth to examine the events and possible explanations leading up to (and after) the incident. Picoult's depiction of the characters backgrounds accurately predicts their behavior and  decisions. This book starts off on a very fast pace but soon slows down to allow the reader several glimpses into each character's personality, how they deal with the tragedy and how each may or may not have played a part in its occurence, whether by remaining ignorant or simply uninformed. There are several other underlying messages like society's unspoken rule about the masks we sometimes wear to get through each day and the illusions we allow ourselves to create. There is a love story as well and several exciting  suprises towards the end.<br /><br />I began reading this book after a local library featured it as their monthly book club discussion.  I recall another  member  saying they felt a bit depressed and had to put it down at one point, honestly so did I. It was overall a bit long and drawn out(that's why I gave it three stars) but for anyone who's ever asked WHY of the Columbine HIgh or Virgina Tech shootings this book is worth the emotional roller coaster ride.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Danny  Boyle is a filmmaker who crafts strong works of cinema.  What I mean by that is that his films don't just feature good acting, or fun scripts, or terrific pacing...but they make you feel quite clearly that the experience you've  just had is one you can only get by seeing a movie.      Let me illustrate in an obvious manner:  The recent film DOUBT is based on a play.  In seeing the film, I can also imagine seeing the stage show and probably not feeling greatly different about it.  It might be a good movie, but I don't feel it is IMPORTANT to have been told as a film.    Danny Boyle's best works (my favorites include TRAINSPOTTING, MILLIONS & 28 DAYS LATER) use EVERYTHING film has to offer.  Editing, composition, music and even variations in film stock and color saturation.  He tells his stories through all the elements that go into filmmaking...nothing is left to just sort of happen by itself.  And he also understands that film can TELL A STORY AT A MORE BLISTERING PACE THAN ANY OTHER MEDIA.  A book might be described as a \\"fast read,\\" but are we individually really capable of reading faster for one book or another?  A play might be \\"fast paced\\" but it is still padded with scene-changes and perhaps even an intermission.  TV can come close (if you have a channel without commercials), but unless you're watching it with a theatre-sized crowd...you don't get the group viewing experience that Boyle somehow knows how to play to.    His films are not perfect.  His blistering pace sometimes allows for some, frankly, sloppy performances or difficult to understand framing or editing.  His movies often have actors/characters with HEAVY accents, which can take a bit of attuning to.    So having blathered on for so long, we come at last to SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.  This is probably Boyle's best film.  It has him at the top of his powers and a story that is truly fascinating and involving.  It also features the weaknesses of the past.    It's the story of two brothers, Jamal &Salim, living in a VERY poor neighborhood in Mumbai, India.  At a young age, they lose their mother, and thus spend some time in an orphanage (naturally one with a proprietor who DOESN'T have the best interests of his charges at heart).  They also spend most of their teen years living on the streets by their wits.  And then they become young adults and begin to make their ways in society.  Along the way, they are occasionally joined in their misadventures by Latika, a lovely young girl with whom Jamal falls more or less immediately in love, and the feelings might be mutual.    But the film is FAR, FAR from linear.  We open with the adult Jamal being tortured by two policemen.  Why?  Because Jamal is doing EXTREMELY well on India's version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.  How could a  poor, young \\"kid\\" from the slums know so much?  He must be cheating.  But Jamal is able to explain to the police exactly why he knows each answer...because each answer took him back to a place in his past.  And as Jamal explains, we see the story of his life unfold.  It's a device so different and so clever as to bring a smile to my face.      Jamal and Salim led a very difficult life, and their personalities grew very much different.  Salim, the older brother, clearly bore the burdens of taking care of his brother with some difficulty, and he grows in his resentment of Jamal as he grows in his brutality.  Life has forced him to make some violent choices, and those actions have scarred him.  Jamal, as a young boy, is prankish and full of life, but grows to be somewhat passive.  He is smart though, and sees everything around him.  But what really gives his life meaning is the yearning to be with Latika.  He has almost infinite patience.  And when you see WHY he really went on MILLIONAIRE, you'll be touched.  It isn't just to win some money.    The three main characters are played by 3 different actors...children, teens, young adults.  The younger performers are excellent and thoroughlyconvincing.  The scenes of their childhood are brutal, funny, painful & even tender.  It's hard to believe India is a \\"modern\\" country when watching some of the early scenes of life in the slums.  Squalor has never seemed more squalid on film.  Boyle, using super-saturated film stock, practically makes the smell of the place come through the screen (which is scary indeed when a key early scene takes place in a public outhouse!).    How the lives of these three parallel, diverge, intersect and eventually achieve uneasy understanding is the heart of this film.  But Boyle also shows us that Mumbai (and the people of India) may be squalid, crowded & noisy but is also beautiful, vibrant and musical.  His editing, cinematography and soundtrack practically burst off the screen.  (And his recreation of MILLIONAIRE is pretty spot-on as well.)      In the center of the delightfully palpable story, a story that is both completely believable and charmingly magical, is Dev Patel, the young actor who plays the grown-up Jamal.  And while I understand that Jamal doesn't really come to life unless he's with his beloved Latika...Patel plays Jamal so anemically in so many scenes that he actually comes across as a little dullwitted...which is NOT how the younger versions of Jamal come across.  I have read a lot of reviews that fawn over this young man, but to me, he was the big flaw in Boyle's film.    The other flaw is the very breathless pacing that makes the film so energetic and immediate.  I sometimes wished, especially in early scenes, that Boyle has been able to slow down a little and give us a little background.  The film assumes we understand the socio/religious/political undercurrents that ran through India society...but I'm not really up on my history of India in the `80s/'90s.  I was left to speculate and fill in some blanks.    But while Patel's performance didn't move me as much as another performer's might have, I still  had myself one heck of a good time.  And to top it all off, the final scene (playing beneath the closing credits) and feature Patel and the radiant Freda Pinto (Latika) in easily the most joyous...heck, darn near perfect...closing credits I've ever seen.  It's worth seeing the whole movie for that scene alone...and the movie is quite a wonderful ride itself.

B0015AARJI|4.0|I bought the PS3 Bundle with MGS 4 for a friend and needed an extra controller so that he could play it with friends and family at home. I have been using the dualshock controller since the days of the PS1. I like the design and am glad they kept it until now.
B000JLQSW4|4.0|The infamous Alan Parsons who helped produced Dark Side of the Moon for Pink Floyd has his own gig which combines a rock band with a studio symphonic orchestra. The fusion of both works fine throughout the span of his recordings starting from the mid-70s thru the 90s. APP is categorized to be melo-rock but it's more than that. Each song seem to separate and branch out where both the orchestra and band come together to enrich their brilliant sounds. Their music always seem to be bright almost never dark.     \\"I Robot\\" is great release but unfortunately, this may upset a few fans, is not as good as a couple of their other releases. The release of I Robot was definitely ahead of its time. The singles \\"I Robot\\" and \\"Genesis\\" were standouts for being one of greatest recordings during their tenure. However, Everything in between \\"I Robot\\" and \\"Genesis\\", except for \\"Break Down\\", were not that inspiring rather it seemed at times it felt like being at a 2001 Space Odyssey flick.  The digital-remastering of their recordings sound are crisp and clear and enhances the quality of their music.  All in All \\"I Robot\\" was a great release, however, I believe that \\"Eye in Sky\\" and surprisingly \\"Try Anything Once\\" are better.
B001KEGRC0|5.0|This was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The effects were amazing without things flying at you. My husband and I had been debating a cruise or Grand Canyon after seeing this movie and getting chills from it we have decided to take the trip out west I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I've been watching Star Trek since I was a kid. The first episode I ever saw was the animated episode \\"Beyond The Farthest Star\\".    So my jaw dropped when I was at a friend's house one day (who had cable) and I first saw \\"The Savage Curtain\\". I was astonished... this was a LIVE action series too? I asked my friend.    The first VCR my family bought was at MY request... because I wanted to record and KEEP every episode.    The original unaltered episodes are on my home recorded DVD collection somewhere, collected off of the Sci-Fi network during the constant reruns of several years ago.    But...    I have always wanted my OWN copy of the unedited episodes... usually significant dialogue is clipped out to make room for commercials. With VCR tapes we just couldn't afford to buy 'em all.    But now we have DVDs, the Internet, and occasional deep discounts.    We also have brand new special effects, which are very creatively done and NOT overused. I completely agree with many of the other reviewers... as a long time Trek fan I was extremely skeptical but they MADE IT WORK.    These episodes look and sound as great as ever... there are even vessels from the ANIMATED series that now appear in the episodes!    Absolutely wonderful!    Every once in a while, I go back in time and rewatch these shows again \\"for the first time\\".    And now I really can... in their ENTIRETY no less!    Our kids and grandkids are used to modern looking stuff... the old series just don't seem to look as cool or impress them very much.    So - as with the first three orginal Star Wars movies - this is a GREAT way to share a part of television history with our kids and grandkids!    \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" was always my favorite episode of all time, and this show in particular is SPECTACULAR using the new effects. It's like watching an epic motion picture!    Some of the episodes don't show us much... an occasional alien planetary background or a ringed planet we didn't expect.    But then there are the ones where the original affects are still similar, just enhanced and modernized in the way they would have been done had the technology been available in the 1960's.    This is truly Trek at its best... the ONLY way I would have sprung for all 79 episodes.    (And don't forget... we also get \\"The Cage\\" and an extended version of \\"The Cage\\" in the Season 3 set). One of them has enhanced f/x and one of them is classic with an introduction by Gene Roddenberry himself (originally released as a VHS tape).
1602830452|5.0|Gave this BBC radio set as a Christmas present to a visually impared person.  Have heard part of it myself and it is extremely well done.  As is not usual, there is a full cast of readers.  There are nuances in the stories that were not captured in the BBC TV series starring Jeremy Brett (although that was wonderful and I own the entire series).  Additionally nicely presented in a box with informative covers for the CD's.  A must have for Holmes fans!
072325804X|5.0|It's a beautifully complete book with all of her stories and incredible illustrations.  It's made all the more special and substantial with the protective sleeve insert.  Something that can be shared and passed down from generation to generation...

B001G9LVGG|5.0|Well, it is a holiday recording but......  For those of us who need to own all of Loreenas material this work is a must.  I have allways wanted to hear Loreena sing \\"Star of the County Down\\" and was suprised by the treatment with \\"Seven Rejoices of Mary\\". I think she consider singing it.  A winter garden only suffered from being short, this work compleats the circle.
1572816295|5.0|I've been a long fan of Paulina Cassidy, I have many of her works. Prints, cards. Such amazing and erethral pieces and fantastically affordable! When I heard in her newsletter she was drawing a full Tarot deck, I was over the moon!     Then the looong wait ensued. It was more than worth it in this case. The images are an almost perfect replica of her images scanned online. USG had these cards printed in China and I love the cardstock! For the past few years they have been having all their cards printed in Italy and they have been heavily laminated. Many have complained about this. I myself didn't mind them at all, and even liked some aspects. But the cardstock on The Paulina is more reminescent of AGM decks. A light matte lamination and quality paper.     I've been using, studying and reading with this deck for about a week, and it's been a sumptious and eye-opening journey. This is so far to me a very intuitive deck with gorgeous delicate detail. There is so many layers to each image. I catch sight of something absolutely enchanting everytime I look! The deck as a whole is very coherent and gives one the impression of entering a fairyland world.....a very specific one with it's own population, style of dress, habitats, rituals and traditions. Paulina Tarot is strongly RWS based. But the artist has used a large amount of creative twists and imagination. It's not a slavish clone.    Paulina obviously knows her Tarot well and put much love, thought and amazing energy into each image.     The Paulina Tarot certainly isn't for everyone (which deck is?). It's colours and tone is soft and gentle. More muted and dreamy. There are many vibrant and striking hues though throughout the deck. But on the whole it has a misty and dream-like energy to them. Those that prefer strong colours and distinct lines or bold images won't be taken with this deck. But there are a few friends who prefer the things I mentioned above but on seeing my deck have been captivated and infatuated andwanted their own copies right off!    Just something about this Tarot's aura and exquisite energy. It really draws you in.    The cards measure the average size of most USG decks.....2 3/4\\" x 4 3/4\\". The backs are lovely and serene. I wish I had a scanner or camera, but alas none of those to show the backs. They are reversible with 2 soaring birds, flowers, plants. Muted and soft colouring. They happily \\"fit\\" the images and style of the cards themselves. We all know way to many decks where the backs of the cards leave you with WTF were they thinking?!    The LWB (little white book) is pretty well-done as far as LWB's are. She describes the cards lyrically and shares her ideas about some of the symbolism on each card. Per usual though the Majors get a little longer treatment. The interpertations are fairly standard with some interesting twists. No interesting spreads, just the yawn inducing Celtic Cross. Wish more different and interesting spreads would find their way into LWBs. I won't hold my breath though!    If you love and enjoy all things faerie, magical, fantasy, victorian and otherworldy.....you will really enjoy this deck, you will NOT be disappointed!
B000Q66PXE|5.0|This series is extremely well written and fun to watch. It quickly spans the life of Julius Caesar and the start of the reign of Gaius Octavian, while showing you the lives of everyday people that lived then as well. The series is truly amazing in scale and performance and is a great buy for anyone who loves Rome/History. Saying that the series isn't that historically accurate. A number of the characters have had a redo of their real life personalities and a number of the events in the series are completely made up. However, none of this takes away from the glory of Rome, and how amazing a show it has been. I only wish there was more to come.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This movie is clearer than Ratatouille, which is something I didn't now could be achieved. I don't have a DTS-HD Master Audio home theater setup so I can't vouch for the multi channel audio but the Blu-Ray video is nothing short of stunning. I've heard the movie on a Wilson Audio system and the sound in 2.0 channel stereo is incredible. I can't fathom the full DTS-HD Master Audio.    The only annoying thing is the bonus \\"geek\\" version has people silhouetted on a sofa doing commentary. This is annoying and masks the bottom right corner of the screen. Other than that, this thing is flawless. 5 stars all the way, all day. every day.    Highly recommended if you want to show off how good your HDTV picture is.  :)
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Radio said this CD was great.  Bought it just on that and every song rocked me.  Start to finish this band did a great job as I liked every song which is surprising because I can't say that about many of them out there now.  I played it as background music while entertaining and others inquired as to who it was.... they too have since bought it.  If you like bluesie type music then you will enjoy this album.  Thanks to Amazon, you can hear a few clips and get addicted too.
0525478183|4.0|The title of this review could have been \\"very GREAT.\\" This review could have gotten 5 stars instead of 4. I really did like this book because of all its suspenseful moments with the clues and everything (to unscrew the door, the post on the website, the graffiti in the minimall, etc.) and Ben brought some funny-ness to the book but here's what I didn't like:  1) the ending. 'Nuff said.  2) the 200 or so pages leading up to the ending (except for a few parts). It felt like it just kept dragging on. The whole time I was thinking, \\"hurry up and figure it out already!!\\"  3) the character of Margo at the end of the book. Geez, is there anyone in the world that is really so self-centered that instead of being appreciative that her friends took the time to come and find her, she bitches at them?!  I enjoyed this book, but I don't know if it's something I'd read over and over again.
0743455967|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and I highly recommend it, especially for aspiring writers.<br /><br />\\"On Writing\\" is not your ordinary, boring, english how-to manual. It is a book written by a successful author (who started off as an unknown himself), who gives the reader tips on writing a good story... their story.<br /><br />Throughout, we learn of Stephen's past which not only keeps our interest but allows us to relate to him as a person - not just another successful, unreachable author.  He has endured problems in his life, much as many of us have, and through each one he has conquered and improved as a person and as a writer.<br /><br />As an author myself, I personally like the quick, to-the-point tips that he gives, as well as the encouragement for all of us to keep writing.  After all, he is \\"the great Stephen King\\"... he could just as easily give us a tip or two and then hope that he stays at the top forever.  Instead, he encourages company at his desk of success, and notes that he enjoys reading our books just as much as we enjoy reading his.<br /><br />I found Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" an enjoyable read and one that should be on the shelves of all authors.<br /><br />J.R.

B0017MO10U|4.0|Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series.  I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both.  I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement.
0142001104|1.0|I saw the Zanders speak and read their book.  He is unbearably narcissistic.  She seems thoughtful if a bit vague and trite.  Unfortunately he runs the show.  He is much like the seminar leader in Jim Carrey's film \\"Yes Man.\\"  The message of their talk and book is basically a version of \\"Say yes to everything in life and the world will be your oyster.\\"  As Jim Carrey finds out, no it won't.  I would suggest that others not waste their $.
B00005JA2B|5.0|I first bought this as an album back in 1976 when it first came out.  I loved it then and I still love it now. My 14 yr. old son discovered \\"Carry on Wayward Son\\" this past summer and loved it so I bought him the CD for Christmas.  He was estactic and told me how he loved \\"Kansas\\". He immediately downloaded the entire CD into in his IPOD so I get to use it in my car, as well. It's a classic at best so you can't go wrong with this CD.  It's a keeper!!!
B00004SVIK|5.0|I always love reading 1 star reviews.  They have NO idea how hard it was in 1979 to recreate what was done in the studio.  Using tape loops were incredibly difficult as well as the multitrack instruments.  The Floyd delivered the goods on this tour!!!!!  As for MLOR, Pulse, the Division Bell, and Delicate Sound of Thunder... They are good in their own right but the songs you really want to here were mostly written by Roger.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|I honestly bought this because I love Alexander Skarsgard in True Blood. I am not normally attracted to stories that revolve around war as the subject matter. I could not have been more surprised by my reaction to this series. I have watched it three times and know I will watch again many, many more times. I have so much respect and awe for the men and women that put themselves on the line in the military. This series makes me feel honored to have just a glimpse into what that looks and feels like. It only increases my admiration of their courage and selflessness. I love how Evan Wright made the story so realistic and relatable. I found myself caring for these men and wanting to know more. I can't turn my mind off for thinking about them and what they, and countless other military personal, went through and continue to experience. For me, this series was very emotional, funny, gritty, thought provoking, and human. One of the best things I have ever watched in my entire life. Thank you Alexander Skarsgard for making me interested enough to take a leap of faith and order the DVD. I though the entire cast did a wonderful job, but Alexander as Colbert was just exquisite. He said more with his eyes than many actors do with their entire body. He was a pleasure to watch, especially in his interactions with Stark Sands and James Ranscone. All three actors certainly did their real life counterparts proud.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Being a professional in the 3D animation and games industry, nothing interests me more than the next Pixar feature.  Even more than that, I think I get more excited about the animated shorts they show at before the feature.    Now, my review for this is going to be a little biased because this was the first film I ever saw in Blu - ray.  I popped the disc into my new Sony BD350 blu-ray player, eventually the menu comes around, and I am already sucked into the sharp, vibrant, and colorful HD picture on my 40\\" Samsung Plasma.  I couldn't wait any longer - I hit play, the Pixar logo animation plays (sharp as ever), the movie start playing...    The animation is incredible.  The rendering, texturing, lighting, color, complexity and completeness of the environments - all amazing!  I especially love Wall-E's little shack for a home, the huge piles of trash (must have been an interesting problem to solve on the animation/modeling technical side), and that massive \\"Axiom\\" space ship.    After being blown away by the movie, it's time to check out what's so great about this blu-ray technology as far as content and menus go.  First of all, navigating through all the menus may be intimidating for the average movie watcher, but once you get through it a bit, it's pretty awesome compared to the old DVD menu navigation.  Right away, I found the magician animated short (one of my favorite shorts ever), and the Burn-E short, a little extension of the engineering robot's story.    After those shorts, I worked my way to the content I always look for on an animated DVD - \\"fly-throughs\\" of the all the main digital sets and layouts.  It will fly you through Wall-E's home, the Trash area on the big ship, and everywhere else in the movie without characters.  This I absolutely love, because you get to enjoy the beautiful crafting jobs of the modelers and designers at Pixar without the distraction of story or characters.  This may sound weird to the norm, but as a 3D enthusiast, this is my favorite part - admiring the artwork of the extremely talented artists at Pixar.    There was a whole thing when this movie hit the theaters - you either loved it, or hated it.  Personally, I can't anyone disliking Wall-E.  Yes, there is no talking of any kind for a while, other than Wall-E and a cockroach, there isn't much character interaction.  But I think that is the brilliance behind this film.  If they can successfully tell a good story, siphon  emotions, and build credible character relationships with the lack of speaking, and just the interaction of the main character with it's environment, you've got incredible writers, animators, artists...    Wall-E is just another incredible story to add to the Pixar library of greats.  They have not failed in quality yet, and every year I wonder how can it possibly top what it did last year.  Now, we get to enjoy the digital greats in it's uncompressed HD glory.  I now look forward to their 2009 release, UP(also a preview on the blu-ray disc).    Buy Wall-E (on blu-ray if at all possible, it's even got a digital copy so you can watch it in high-def on your PC).  You will not regret it.
B001B1876G|1.0|When life is hardest and you don't think you can get farther behind, that is when a merchandiser will omit the detail that changes everything.  Extremely unhappy with what I feel was a bait and switch.  No where did it say this was not the movie but and animation.  My family opened to watch and then found out it was not what any of us thought even after receiving dvd.  Too late to return since it was opened but I won't order dvds again from them. 1 of 3 dvds I bought on Christmas sale.  It was the only present I bought my husband this year and it felt like my christmas gift was taken away from both of us.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|Took the kids to see on the big screen and they couldn't wait to get it on dvd.  You have to love Star Wars and cartoons, but our family sure does.  The fighting is spot on and even the banter is Star wars-esque.  It's a winner for us.
0307346617|3.0|This book was a decently entertaining read, but it just didn't bowl me over.  It is certainly possible that a fan of \\"zombie literature\\" (who knew such a thing existed?) might enjoy this work more than I did.<br /><br />To encapsulate, this book documents a human/zombie conflict through a collection of oral histories.  Some of these are very well thought out and presented.  Others are boring, while still others are simply silly.  A variety of very interesting scenarios are played out, many of which seem very realistic if you can get past the \\"zombie\\" aspect.<br /><br />I read one viewer declare this a masterpiece in the \\"zombie genre\\".  Zombie genre?  If there is such a thing, this may very well be a masterpiece.  In the overall genre of fiction or even horror, this falls somewhere in the middle of the road.<br /><br />Having read several other reviews on the audio version of this novel, I am of the opinion that the author's format would be especially well suited for audio.
B00005AR3G|5.0|When the trailers for this movie came out I had no interest at all. Then a friend I trust said it was pretty funny, so I rented it. I still thank my friend for that recommendation. This is the funniest movie Disney has ever made and it isn't even close. I don't even like David Spade but he works in this show. It is a shame this movie has not gotten the love it deserves. I would recommend this to anyone.
B001EO2UKO|2.0|Sounds like she just broke up with her life's love, similar to when Gwen and Tony broke up No Doubt released \\"Don't Speak,\\" et cetera. . .
B000N3ST8O|4.0|If you don't know what she's been doing you'll get a taste of it here. Some newer and underplayed songs will not disappoint your attraction to the one woman who can reach a man's heart both as a loving, motherly type and a lusting object. Stevie is the best!  As for singing, writing and uniqueness, she's the female version of Ronnie James Dio. I still love her!
B000UUM2E2|5.0|If you weren't in college in the 60's & 70's this may not mean much to you, but re-reading it as I approach 60 was a lot of fun and still a head trip.  All the conspiracy theories in the world, pretty much since the beginning of time, all wrapped up and packaged with a pretty bow!
B000GW8RX4|4.0|For purists the extra videos are great. For new fans this is rock...talented people who know their instruments.  It's wonderful on so many levels. For me, I believe one can pick up on how much Ronnie was sick and tired of Mr. Blackmore - I find it quite amusing! I also must agree with the complete Rainbow fans, where the hell is *Stagazer*? I know, it was tough on Cozy. They didn't always play it but was it on the set list only to be omitted from the German TV taping or this DVD?   Still, us fan's are fortunate for this product!    * I did see Ronnie & Jimmy Bain along with Simon Wright and D. Aldrich play \\"Stargazer\\" live on the KTD tour at Desert Sky outdoor venue in Phoenix, Arizona AT SUNSET and felt VERY BLESSED to say the least because that was half of Rainbow! HOLY CHRIST.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I have always enjoyed Jane Austin's Northanger Abby.  Up until recently I felt there was a lack of a good film adaptation of this classic.  After watching this movie, I have changed my opinion.  The cast of characters is excellent!

1594201927|3.0|The downfall of this book is it is not a financial history of the world but an abbreviated anecdotal review of the most recent bubbles mixed in with previous bubbles that have no relation to a historical review of world financial history.<br /><br />The first sentence epitomizes what you will read, a rehash of other more scholarly works that more accurately portray the current financial mess in relation to past financial history.<br /><br />The author has the credentials to make a much better volume of historical significance than this work that really seems more a parochial Scottish history of his past than the world history of financial markets.<br /><br />A good diversion while waiting for your wife in the local bookstore while she shops, not a serious scholarly volume you will want to put in your library.

0743270754|5.0|Whether this book is historically accurate or a wonderful fiction does not matter - it should be read by all politicians and potential leaders. The traits of the reported Lincoln are inspiring. Patient, humorous, humble and wise beyond mere intelligence Lincoln could have read all of the literature on performance management, emotional intelligence and systems management. He embodies the entire characteristic of Deming's \\"profound knowledge\\".  Lincoln, as described, was not without personal ego, his wish to be well regarded after his passing bears its witness.  His story is inspiring, he was serious but did not put himself first or take himself too seriously. A great story that with luck might be repeated in 2009.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|Gojira has turned things up a notch. First, the production value is astounding. The drums sound fantastic and the drummer is brilliant in his creativity. The album as a whole just leaves a very satisfying feeling. It's not easy for music this complex and frantic to sound this good.    The Songs. Holy Christ. The creativity and ability of today's metal musicians never cease to amaze me. Just when I think Opeth has taken it as far as it can go -- or Strapping Young Lad, or Lamb of God, or Meshuggah -- Gojira releases this monster. Imagine if Meshuggah, Strapping Young Lad, Lamb of God, Clutch, Mastodon, Opeth and Fear Factory put all of their creative ideas into one album and I think it may sound a lot like The Way of All Flesh.    Gojira takes a back seat to none of these bands and may have surpassed them all with this album. Fans of heavy music would be wise to pick this one up. It's devastating and unrelenting. It's like a more approachable Meshuggah album, without losing any of the power, creativity and originality that makes a band like Meshuggah so awe-inspiring.    Metal album of the year? Yes. Metal album of this decade so far? Quite possibly.

0446619078|5.0|very good read, it allows us to get to understand harry bosch's past, as he tries to find his Mothers' killer, while on suspension for a run in with another cop. The relationship he had with his Mother and the loss of it was very sad, but it helps in understanding who harry is today. Connelly is one of the best writers out there.

0956010903|5.0|no pun intended. the stories and images by JK Rowling are just incredible. the stories are lively and engaging, perfect for any Harry Potter fan. from babbity rabbity to the hairy heart, it is a collection that no reader should miss. if you are a Harry fan, you might recognize some of the tales told in the book, and it is fun to read them in their entirety.<br /><br />the book itself is small and bound in leather, and goes in a larger, tome-looking case along with the copies of the original illustrations. amazon and the designers have outdone themselves. bravo!
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This was great! Truly this was the best romance movie that I have watched in a very long time.

B00003CX9E|1.0|When all reviews of a move starts with words like groundbreaking, ahead of its time, or god forbit \\"a classic\\", one should proceed with extreme caution. If the AFI never put out a top 100 list, this film would have fallen into obscurity long ago, and it would have stayed where it belongs, a novelty for film school students...    First let me start by saying that although I appreciate Star Wars, I was not brought up on MTV.     I am a tremendous fan of movies in general, and a huge fan of black-and-white films..the greatest ever....Casablanca....also very good, almost anything by Frank Capra...and for those into action, go rent (or better buy) a copy of Gunga Din........     But Citizen Kane is simply....unwatchable....    It is sooooooo boring......    I give Orsen Wells a lot a credit for making a movie at 24, but if he was 44 and this was his 20th film would everyone still be so enamored with it??    If film people like it because it has \\"out of the ordinary\\" camera angles, and uses film tricks like \\"flashbacks\\", fine, but that does not make this a good movie...    By the way, one thing has always bothered me about the movie that nobody ever brings up. Everyone says that Wells was so \\"brave\\" in making a film belittling William Randolf Hearst (one of the most powerful men of his time). My question is, how shallow was Orsen Wells that he had to try to make a name for himself by attacking someone else. Now maybe Hearst was a creap, and deserved to be attacked, but if you made the same movie and had the lead character be an oil tycoon, or a bank president, Wells (and his movie) would not have had the buzz it did back in 1941 or even today for that matter. I wonder then if history would still speak so highly of this film..............    So in conclusion.....any film that helped make Steven Speilberg or Martin Scorsese want to be a film Director, yea........but that dosen't make it a good film....     My advice (sorry amazon), rent it, or watch it on late night television, and then decide if it is something that you want in your home film library.............it will never be in mine......................
B001F7MSFW|5.0|When the movie came out in theaters, the critics said that this film was not as good as HELLBOY (1), and the director Guillermo del Toro must have had too many creatures left over from the making of PAN'S LABYRINTH, and need a place to put them. I did not see the film in theaters, but purchased the 3 Disc Special Edition. HELLBOY! I think they were totally wrong! HELLBOY 2 The GOLDEN ARMY is better than the first, and there are not too many monsters and creatures in the movie.<br /><br />I found the movie a combination of THE NEVERENDING STORY and JIM HENSON's \\"STORYTELLER\\" series European folklore with John hurt. My criticism of the movie is that there could have been more of HELLBOY in the movie, and we could have done without the character of Johann Krauss voiced by Seth MacFariane. I felt that they should have lost the German or Nazi accent, and used another voice instead. I gew up with the understanding that, \\"The only good nazi is a dead nazi!\\"<br /><br />I hope that director Guillermo del Toro will consider making HELLBOY 3, and be able to slip it into his busy schedule of filming The HOBBIT, THE HOBBIT 2, FRANKENSTEIN, DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, and DROOD. Hey, I will volunteer to play the creature in FRANKENSTEIN. I have the body for it. I hope he makes the new FRANKENSTEIN more like the Universal's original FRANKENSTEIN,THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN. Mary Shelley's book FRANKENSTEIN; or THE MODERN PROMETHEUS is just down right depressing. There is a big difference between depressing and one being scary. The book version is just not what us horror fans grew up watching. The character name \\"Ygor,\\" which appeared in the second and third Universal fils was played masterfully by Bela Logosi.  This is his greatest film characterizations and movie voice of all time. He is not a hunchback or a lab assistant, but diabolically evil. Guillermo del Toro would do better to make a good color version of the GOLEM rather than making the book version of FRANKENSTEIN with a man with scars all over.<br /><br />HELLBOY 2 The GOLDEN ARMY reminds me of THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS, and what Hellboy found there. If Guillermo del Toro wants to remake a film, then I suggest that he does THE WIZARD OF OZ being more faithful to Baum's original book were Dorothy, a figure heavily influenced by the feminism of Matilda Joslyn Gage. There OZ is meant to be a real place where Dorothy can go back there as a refuge. Guillermo seemed to be inspired by this concept in the writing and filming of PAN'S LABYRINTH.<br /><br />The 3 Disc Special Edition has better special features than on HELLBOY and PAN'S LABYRINTH. Now the special features is really about too many creatures, but it gives a better understanding of the making and meaning of the film. I can't wait to see the next conception stage of HELLBOY 3. I need to freeze myself so I can awaken at various intervals when they remake some of my favorite movies, such as: LOGAN' RUN, FAHRENHEIT 451, and the sequel to the 1931 version of DRACULA. I already know that I could write a better story line than what the relative of Bram Stoker has planned. The book DRACULA is the first book that I read cover to cover. Bela Lugosi always wanted to do a film remake of DRACULA in color.<br /><br />The real question about Frankenstein's creature is did Doctor Frankenstein stitch in a soul? Does live automatically grant you a soul, or are they only passed out in heaven?  Which would mean any living thing could possibly said to have a living soul. We know at least HELLBOY has heart. He is red isn't he? HELLBOY has my kind of values: love all cats, eat lots of candy, and drink lots of soda. And that is good enough for me.version of FRANKENSTEIN with a man with scars all over.

0596009208|5.0|I picked up this book as a refresher and to learn the new features of Java 5.  I was familiar with some other books in the Head First series and was pleased with them.  This book didn't disappoint me.  Like the other Head First books, it takes a lighthearted, conversational approach to teaching the foundations of Java programming (and several tenets of object-oriented programming in general).  Like all Head First books, it presents the subject matter in several different ways with numerous graphics so the material doesn't get dull and is more easily absorbed.  And, of course, it is chock-full of humor so it is enjoyable to read.  But despite it's lighthearted approach, everything is absolutely correct and current: the humor doesn't get in the way of the teaching.<br /><br />The only small drawback to this book is that it assumes the reader has at least some exposure to programming is some language, and some idea of object-oriented programming.  But it doesn't purport to be a programming primer, just a Java language book.  And it is, a great one.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to get up to speed on Java or those familiar with it who want to investigate the new features of Java 5.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I saw this movie twice at the IMAX, and watching it on BluRay is almost as good.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|The makers of this must know their business, they've done a superb job of restoring this classic and have found an excellent bundle of short subjects to add to the experience.     After watching washed out copies of classic stuff on TV over the years, the restorers have created a whole new market for older stuff via Blu-ray.  I'm looking forward to adding to my collection in future.    There's nothing I really need to say about the movie, I'm sure most people have seen it many times but the quality of this restoration makes it seem a whole new experience.
0439023483|5.0|I am currently re-reading this book. It was an excellent, \\"I just can't put this book down\\" read for me.
0743564383|4.0|Note that this review is for the audio book version of this novel.  The narrator was Campell Scott.  The audio quality was excellent and the narrator did a good job; he spoke with a slight Spanish accent, which seemed to fit well with the narrative.  He did some characterizations with his voice, but not much compared to other narrators I've listened to.<br /><br />This is the second time that I have read this novel; the first time was over 30 years ago in high school.  It's amazing to me how differently I looked at this book this time around.  The first time I read it; I saw it as an adventure story with some interesting character development.  The second time around I read it as a fascinating look at how war brings out the best and worst in people.<br /><br />I feel that Hemingway accurately captured how certain people would act in a civil war; the cruelty by some and acts of courage by others.  In all cases, the characters were in a situation where there were no great options.  He also accurately showed that there are good people on both sides of a conflict; that soldiers do suffer by taking the lives of others.<br /><br />As a Spanish speaker; I enjoyed Hemingway's use of language.  Most of the unique use of English is actually a direct literal translation of Spanish.  I hadn't heard the phrases directly translated that way before, but immediately recognized them as common Spanish slang.<br /><br />This is a book worth reading; you will learn that life is not always black and white.
B000005JA8|5.0|Harry Partch meets Howlin Wolf. This album is amazing. Perhaps the most important rock record ever. Jimi Hendrix loved Beefheart, so did John Lennon. Is that endorsement enough? No? Well, consider this: all those avant-garde, math rock, experimental, no wave, art punk, etc. bands you probably worship nowadays all owe a debt to this masterpiece. Totally reconstructing and reconfiguring rock and showing the infinite possibilities of riffs, structure, lyricism, length, insanity, etc.  Though not my favorite Beefheart album (that'd be Ice Cream for Crow), this IS the most important.  How can anyone call this tuneless racket -- there is no noise on this record, there's only distortion on one track; this is probably the LEAST noisey, cleanest recording by a rock band ever. Yet it still rocks. There are melodies, riffs, etc. here. It's a lot to take in perhaps, but it's still an amazing achievement.  How did they even go about writing these songs? It's amazing.  Anyway, my favorite tracks on here the acappella ones, but \\"Steal Softly Thru Snow\\" needs to be heard by everyone ever at least once. Masterpiece.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I have heard miley cyrus cheetah girls and Demi is the best ! She can actually sing ! Yay! Her vocals are great and perfect for the rocking out songs that she sings unlike miley whos voice is too weak to do rocker and should stick to more country pop. I am in love with Taylor swift because of her song writitng and i love Demi's songs that she wrote ! Finally a Disney Star worth listening to
B000002BE9|5.0|Can't believe this album was her first. Undoubtedly wise beyond her years, Apple's rhythmic melodies and smooth velvety voice are a joy to behold. And her lyrics? Bold, brutal and honest to the core, but the jazzy overtones set for a more mature message than a rant. I'm a late bloomer to her music, but happy to say, better late than never.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|With Tidal being such a strong debut, it was hard to imagine what Apple would dish out next. When The Pawn... is everything Tidal was but more refined. Pretty much what one would anticipate but hardly expect. Her lyrics thankfully haven't softened, ie: Limp, and the album as a whole is a well-rounded production. Looking forward to hear what Ms Apple comes up with next...
B00005JLWN|2.0|I was shocked to see the high rating review this movie got from it's viewers. My overall feel of the movie is...it's boring. The plot had the potential to be good, I have seen almost all the utopian films out there and I had high hopes for this film. The acting is good, Christian Bale always gives a great performance but unfortunately the plot lacks.<br />Overall it was an Ok movie but nothing I would watch again.

Joss hits a home run again with his musical expertise, just like Once More With Feeling, and delivers 40 minutes of catchy songs & hilarity! I had no idea Neil Patrick Harris could sing... I swoon! And Nathan Fillion is simply brilliant. Get this for you, your friends, your mom... they'll thank you for it.

0679746323|3.0|When this book came out, both critics and fans missed the point completely. Critics complained that it was too negative (one reviewer even complained that they didn't give Mao enough credit as a poet).  Fans showered praise because it shows how evil and horrible Mao was.    Both positions are idiotic.  This is supposed to be the \\"unknown\\" story, not the \\"balanced\\" story.  The whole premise of the book is that Chang and Halliday have done interviews and archival research that show that Mao was even more of a monster than everyone knows already.  Add this to Chang's personal experiences, and expecting a \\"balanced\\" view is like asking Trotsky to be \\"balanced\\" about Stalin.  The fans equally ignore the originality and veracity of the content.      The merit of this book rests entirely on these two questions: 1. Are its claims original?  2. Are they true?    Even leaving aside the issue of Mao's personal character (a power hungry sadist and heartless womaniser who neglected his parents and his children, had no concern for the poor, and rose to the top of the CCP through lies and murder) Chang and Halliday make some startling claims about wider Chinese history: that Chiang deliberately let the Communists escape during the Long March, that a Communist sleeper agent in the Nationalist army deliberately provoked the Shanghai incident to draw Japan into China and away from Russia, and that other sleepers later lost the Civil War.      I just don't know enough about China in general or Mao in particular to tell if this book is a groundbreaking work of original scholarship or a crude pastiche of Cold War propaganda.  On the few issues that I know a little about, I find myself leaning to the propaganda side.  The claim that Mao was responsible for 70 million deaths seems rather flimsy - this is based on 38 million in the Great Leap famine (twice the consensus estimate) and 25 million in labour camps (based on extrapolating the death rate in one camp in a particularly bad yearon a guesstimate of the total camp population).  Similarly, the claim that Marshall lost China is a very old chestnut, although at least they do not claim it was deliberate (\\"a conspiracy so vast\\").    It is a disgrace that the dust jacket is adorned with praise from reviewers who are hardly better qualified than I to judge both questions, and that those who are qualified have not addressed them.  The biggest controversy was about whether a minor battle at some bridge was faked or not.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|I got this as a gift for my mother and she loved it. She has always been a fan and made me into one also. It was pretty cool sitting and watching with her on New Years Eve. You have gotta love the 60's British humor. If you got it when they had it for $20 like I did, you got one heck of a deal. With all the extra footage and the book and the script, you have hours of entertainment.

B000002P2V|5.0|My introduction to this album was probably a lot different than that of most reviewers here.  I first picked this up used on cassette at an indie record shack near my home in the early 90s (the height of the grunge and immediate post-grunge era).  I bought this along with a now out-of-print compilation called \\"Who's Better Who's Best\\" (probably the whole puchase cost me $5).  I was a big Pearl Jam fan and knew that Eddie Vedder loved The Who, so I wanted to hear more.  I had heard the odd single on classic rock radio but this was the first actual Who album I had ever owned, and I bought it not knowing where it fit within the history of their music and classic rock as a whole.  When I heard it, I enjoyed its energy and the cleverness of some of the songs.  Sonically it fit right in between two of my favorite bands at the time, Fugazi and Rush (much closer to Rush, but still with a bit of that punk energy).  For a lot of classic rock and punk fans of the 70s, the attempt to bring those two genres together may have been seen as a disaster.  However for me it was nothing new, since grunge was essentially just that - a merging of the punk energy and outlook with a classic rock sensibility.  I listened to this one until the tape inevitably warped or got mangled in the stereo of my old Honda Civic.<br /><br />So recently I've been feeling a bit nostalgic and picked up a copy of this on CD to see if it would still have an impact on me.  I have most of the other Who albums, and admit I waited on re-buying this one because of mixed reviews.  I can safely say that I had good taste in my late teens.  This album is catchy and energetic, the sound of a band reinventing its sound for a new era.  So what if it doesn't always work - this mixture of prog rock and punk energy is one hell of a fun listen.  My favorites are \\"Goodbye Sister Disco,\\" \\"905\\" and \\"Music Must Change\\" (the third being the emotional core of this album IMHO).  Some of the songs have an almost quasi-rock-operatic feel to them, showing the benefits of the band's prior musical explorations on Tommy and Quadrophenia.  Sonically it's not all that different than the band's masterpiece, Who's Next.  Just a little more synth here and a bit more polish.  Overall this is a great, underrated song cycle that IMHO ranks with the band's best work.<br /><br />Would I be so excited about this album if I had discovered it under different cicumstances?

0312383320|2.0|Janet seems to have lost her touch with the past two books.  I am not a big fan of the in between books but Plum Spooky was better than Fearless Fourteen.  I was attracted to the Stephanie Plum books for the humor which seems to have disappeared.  Can three goregous men really want Stephanie?  I doubt it.  Disappointing.
B0000046KM|5.0|This is the quintessential Shirley Horn album that was produced by the late Joel Siegel.  Horn was almost difficult to convince to have strings and orchestration added to her otherwise spare piano and voice recordings.  Luckily for all, she acquiesced.    The title song and first track sets the mood for the rest of the album.  This album arcs and it should be used as a guide by aspiring jazz singers who would like to have an album that not only tells a story, but one that takes the listener through a musical journey.  It is a textbook example of a personal belief of mine that an intelligent, heartfelt, well-phrased interpretation of a lyric propels a song much further than mere musicality.    Shirley Horn bookends the album with Joe Siegel's English-translated version of the Italian song, \\"Estate,\\" a love song that on the surface appears to be sung to a person, but surprisingly is a serenade to the warm Summer season.    It may sound as though I exaggerate, but Shirley's \\"Here's To Life\\" album is within easy reach of my CD player, is in heavy rotation and is also in my iPod.  Shirley is with me wherever I go.

0375826726|5.0|This is a great book. I purchased it for my son's collection but read it as well. It's wonderful, imaginative, and full of great detail. Can't wait for the next and final book in this series.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is one of the few shows I've fallen completely in love with.  Everyone I've ever introduced to it has been skeptical at first, but it only takes an episode or two for them to love it, too.    I've heard Firefly describes as \\"a western set in space,\\" and while that's quite true, it just doesn't capture what the show really is.  It's a western in the sense that most of the series takes place in the frontier region of space.  There are outlaws, limited technology, new struggling settlements... it's just a more brutal existence than in the core planets where everything is highly advanced. The weapons are also like you'd see in a western, pistols, shotguns, rifles, and of course, reliable knives.  There are other little western touches, so to speak, like dust, leather, long coats, bars.  And of course this is all mixed in with the ability to travel through space.      Anyway, the great thing about Firefly is its characters.  They do a great job of drawing you in and connecting you to the characters.  They're deep, they're believable, and while they all have their conflicts, they're a family.  You get the overwhelming feeling that for the actors, they aren't acting; it's natural, and they've actually developed strong bonds together.  (They even say so in the commentary.)      The dialog is witty, the action is great, the stories are exciting.  You think something stereotypical is going to happen and they completely play off of your expectations and throw something else in.  You're never bored watching this show.      It's such a shame the show didn't get the start it deserved.  Apparently the episodes were shown out of order, the pilot was skipped, and that would completely mess an audience up.  Just a word of warning:  the show was canceled and feels like it ends abruptly, but there's a movie they made that adds on perfectly and ties up a lot of the loose ends--Serenity.  (Serenity is the name of the pilot and the movie, but the two are completely different.  One isthe beginning, one is the end.)  You really need to buy Serenity to complete the collection.  Also, I'd recommend watching the episodes before the movie since the movie is essentially the end of the series.  They go out with a bang.    Get it, watch it, love it.  It'll be one you'll hold on to and watch over and over again.  Plus the Amazon price when I bought was the lowest I could find.  A steal compared to Best Buy or any other place.
0141439807|4.0|This is my favourite Jane Austen book which I first read in my early teen years. It may be my favourite because it was my first Austen book but after re-reading it after other Austen books, I continued to think the same.<br />Although this lacks some of the truly clever twists and plots of her other books, it excels at following the child Fanny through her childhood to adulthood and her changing emotions and development.<br />As always, Jane Austen excels at her characters and they are very believable as well as romantic, realistic, and hilarious!<br /><br />I do hope that this book is used more in schools and that children are encouraged to read this as well as the more popular and more popularised Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.<br />I would recommend this book for young teenagers and upwards. It probably favours girls rather than boys but is a fun and yet challenging read for all.

0312383320|2.0|I admit it.  I am a Ranger fan.  I look forward to each book hoping to learn more about him.  Some books have more Ranger in them than others, but I'm an addict and I'll take what I can get.  When it comes to literary heroes, I've never been as smitten as I am with Ranger.  He trumps even Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy.    But no matter how much I love Ranger, I am first and foremost a Stephanie fan.  She came onto the scene, armed with mascara and attitude, and I couldn't help but root for her.  I wanted Stephanie to succeed, to get everything she ever dared dream, and I wanted to be there to see it when she did.  Ranger may be my romantic fantasy, but Stephanie Plum is my hero.    Plum Spooky did not sit well with me.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it, either.  In a week's time, I doubt I'll remember anything about it.  (I can't remember much about it now.)  It wasn't romantic or funny or witty.  I didn't walk away feeling empowered or uplifted, like I used to do after a Plum book.  In fact, I didn't walk away feeling anything at all...except maybe a little sad.    Some people are angry about the money, $30 for a book they felt wasn't worth it.  Others are angry about the content, Diesel and fart jokes and monkeys.  Those are both valid and reasonable complaints regarding this book.  But what I was most disappointed with was Stephanie.  This is her story.  These books revolve around her.  They don't work without her.     So where was she?    I know there are a lot of people who either think Stephanie should get married already and pop out a few kids, or on the flip side, train to be an assassin.  I don't care for either of those scenarios.  Neither mesh with the spirited bounty hunter we've grown to love, and you know what?  I like Stephanie.  I don't want her to change.  I want her to grow and I want her to develop, but I don't want her to change.  At her core, she's a kind-hearted, loving, resilient person whose mistakes and flaws make her human.  What is there to fix?    The last several books have tampered with that, though.  Her character hasn't grown or developed.  It has withered under the weight of guilt and obligation.  This character who used to admit freely (to us, anyway) that she had feelings for two men, has suppressed that honesty in favor of a politically correct (and fanbase pacifying) beauty queen speech.  It isn't that she sincerely feels one way or another, but more accurately, that she thinks she should.   And that has allowed her character (and the series) to stagnate.        Part of the the problem is her relationship with Joe Morelli.  The difference between Morelli and Ranger is that Morelli is the person he will always be, both good and bad.  Ranger, on the other hand, may not be relationship material right now, but he's still evolving, a character trait he shares with Stephanie.  It doesn't take much to imagine what a life with Morelli would entail - messy house, messy kids, family dinner, Bob the Dog, and an SUV - but is that who Stephanie is, or is that who Morelli wants/needs her to be for their relationship to work?  Before she settles down with either guy, I want to see Stephanie learn to accept and love herself.  But for that to happen, Evanovich will have to take Stephanie out of her comfort zone and let her form her own shape before she tries to force her into some prefabricated mold of what a Burg wife \\"should\\" be.    When I close the last book in the series, I don't want to be plagued with nightmares of Stephanie ending up a stereotypical Burg wife like her mother, or worse, like Angie Morelli, Joe's sister in law.  I want the satisfaction of knowing that whatever she got, it was exactly what she wanted, and she worked hard to get it.  There may have been setbacks, but there were NO substitutions.      But when I read a book like this, the fourth book in a row that has made no progress whatsoever in the development of the three main characters, I can't help but wonder, what the hell happened?
031606792X|2.0|I read the first book of the series about a week ago, after watching the movie. I really loved both movie and book, (I actually liked the book more than the movie, because it emphasizes more in the relationship of Bella and Edward) and I know that this can't be done in a movie that lasts 90 minutes, but that's Ok.    I really liked the strange love relationship between the two characters. It was like Romeo and Juliet but their love was much more intense, much more insatiable, I have never read something like this before. I found my self reading the lines two or more times because I wanted to be sure, that I hadn't lost anything about the romance between them. It was thrilling and sent goosebumps all over my body!     I loved Bella's character, she was sweet, fragile, caring and totally smart but I loved Edward's character more. There was something about him, that can not be explained. He was like a dream figure to me, (maybe because he escaped from Steph. Meyers dream, according to her).     He was so civilized although he was a vampire. He was refining, much more refining than a human being can be. He knew how to treat a girl. Reading twilight I could say that he loved Bella so much that he could risk everything to just touch her, to be with her, maybe because he was waiting for her so many many years but also liked that he was fighting so terribly with his self to stay away from her because he was so much worried not to hurt her. He was romantic in a way that can not be found in nowadays and that is because he was born and raised in a different time than ours.He was intelligent and dazzling and all these romantic quotes could stop my heartbeat! Their story was a miracle, like they should exist only together. Like they were true soulmates, (although Edward was not a human). I admit that I fell in love with their story.    Then I began reading New Moon. I liked that too, not so much as Twilight, but quite enough to finish it, in just two days, although English is not my first language.     I was reading it all day long and almost all night long. I could not believe that Edward had left Bella and I was sure that he would be back. I really hated Jacob Black, because he was such an egocentric and selfish creature, although he was trying so much to hide it. He was also trying to get a profit of Bella's desperate mood,all the time, to be with her, because finally the field was clear from Edward. I hated that.     And I could feel reading the book, that Bella's attitude was so much different than in the first book. She was being so much selfish too. She was \\"saying\\" through the whole book that she didn't want to hurt Jacob's feelings but I believe that actually she was trying not to hurt HERSELF. But she was so miserable and unhappy that I felt sorry for her. Then they got together again with Edward and everything was just fine. That was quite of weird to me.    In Eclipse I couldn't understand what was wrong with her mind and also Edward's mind! Bella had totally lost it. I mean the only thing that mattered in her life until then was Edward. He was the only thing that she was so afraid of losing and her fear came true in the previous book but in Eclipse they were together again and she should have been happy about that. But she wasn't! She was thinking of Jacob all the time and she was crying 24/7 through the whole book for him.     She was stupid and silly and reckless and such a child!!! She was trying all the time to chose between Edward and Jacob! For God's sake that was totally ugh! She was so unsure about everything and that bothered me! The worst was when she kissed Jacob at the end of the book and liked it!!! And for God's sake again she had a clear though -while kissing him- to have children with him, (or puppies) totally disgusting! HELLO??? Edward was her life, her piece of heaven (at least that was what she was telling us through twilight and new moon) and she wanted to \\"have kids\\" with Jacob? The whole story turned tobe a soap opera! And what happened to Edward? When she told him that she kissed Jacob he was so NOT worried about that like it was the most natural thing in the world. He let her do whatever she wanted! It was like he had no will! He could at least talk about that, try to talk with her for her feelings, try to clear the whole thing out! But he didn't! He was so pathetic! His attitude and character was totally different than the first book! He was a different guy! He didn't try to win Bella's heart back, he was pathetic! Such a chicken!    And Bella's father was such a pain, a weirdo! When she came home and had her hand broken, of hitting Jacob, he was so cool about that! Like he was shouting out loud GO TIGER! He didn't even seem to care about his daughter's feelings! UGH!     Reading twilight, you were actually reading of Edward's and Bella's love story which came to be a LOVE TRIANGLE with Jacob as a guest star!    In Breaking Dawn all thins got totally messed up! I felt like reading the story of two totally strange to me characters! There was nothing about the glory of first love anymore, all the romance was gone and their relationship lost all of attractiveness, at least to me!     At first Bella and Edward are getting married, which was totally fine with me, I can say that I really liked that! After their marriage they had a party where Jacob came and again -how strange- Bella began to cry over his shoulder! It was like she hadn't make the right choice choosing Edward, like she was unsure again!      Then they went to Esme's Island, for their honeymoon, where they \\"made love\\". After that Bella was begging Edward to make love to her all the time and it felt like reading these small and thin stupid love-romance books which totally disgust me.(I don't know the exact word in English for them). Then Bella gets pregnant and all things get messed up.    It's like you are reading the story of Rosemary's baby, with Bella drinking and vomiting blood! Then she gaves birthto her super hybrid baby and becomes a super vampire woman!MERCYYYYYYY!     The worst is that their romance has been totally vanished! They are having sex all night long and it's like Edward doesn't love her so much anymore. I am sure he liked her more when she was human. At least that's how it felt to me! Then there's the whole imprinting thing which is totally weird and disgusting! Can you guess what happens? The wolf guy Jacob fells in love with the hybrid supernatural baby Renesmee and calls her Nessie like the monster of loch-ness. Actually they all call her like that! It's like a parody! I don't know what else to say! Maybe you should save your time and money and don't read the book! Doesn't worth it! If you read Twilight, keep the beautiful memory locked in your heart and stay with it!
B00006AW2M|3.0|\\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" by The Rolling Stones, universally panned as one of the weakest and most obnoxious albums the band ever released.  However it would be safe to say it has, like many albums shunned during this era, stood the test of time better than once envisioned.  Listening to it now, the record really does contain some brilliant songs and, of course, a few moments that are downright inexcusable.  The album's recording was interrupted by numerous distractions such as drug busts for Mick, Keith, AND Brian.  The band was not afforded the time or the complete concentration The Beatles were able to have in order to record \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  \\"Satanic Majesties\\" was started in February of 1967 and not released until December!  After it was released it was then criticized as The Stones trying to copy The Beatles.  The band had apparently done a foray into a musical territory they had no business being in, namely, psychedelia.  \\"Satanic Majesties\\" wasn't brilliant but it was fairly good and it's not an album to ignore in The Stones canon.  First let's talk about some of the album's stronger cuts.    CITADEL - Track two, side one.  One of The Stones most ferocious and highly overlooked rockers.  A deserved single from the album, much more so than Bill Wyman's \\"In Another Land.\\"  Its killer guitar riff that's repeated throughout has much more in common with \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" (the band's \\"comeback\\" single in May '68) than anything else on the album, and it shows even when The Stones were flirting with paisley and flower power, they still rocked!  If \\"We Love You\\" had been included on the album alongside this track, \\"Satanic Majesties\\" would've been much stronger.      IN ANOTHER LAND - One of the singles from the album and Bill Wyman's first composition recorded and released by the band.  This is one track that gets an unfair amount of bad rap!  The only aspect to it that I'll criticize is that it's lyrics are very cliched and lame, however it's production is quite brilliant.  A lot of fans don't like the sound effect employed on Wyman's lead vocal.  What you're hearing is a tremolo effect.  This happens when the tremolo control knob on the amp is turned all the way up into distortion and creates the \\"shaking\\" effect.  Here it makes Bill Wyman sound like he's underwater.  The spacey, distant, spook-carnival like organ and wind effects are fantastic and the song ends with a sample of Bill catching a nap in the studio and snoring!     2000 MAN - One of the most fully realized songs of \\"Satanic Majesties\\" and definitely my personal favorite.  This is another song that could have been chosen for a single.  The melody is fashioned in a slightly folk-rock Byrdsy jangle as Mick recounts the story of a being a man in the future who is \\"having an affair with a random computer.\\"  Mick couldn't have been more right on about the Melenium in 1967!  The song shifts into an upbeat, rocking middle eighth section before returning back to it's original jangle for it's coda.     SHE'S A RAINBOW - The most well known song of \\"Satanic Majesties\\" and the \\"hit\\" of the record.  Good production featured here, lovely slightly psychedelic string accompaniment arranged by John Paul Jones and great sing-song melody.  Not much more can be said.     GOMPER - A love it or hate it number but definitely one of The Stones most \\"exotic\\" sounding songs....EVER!  This song is basically Brian Jones gone wild, so you know what that means!  A plethora of eastern instruments are utilized beneath colorful, meditative lyrics that are hushed and quiet by Mick and Keith.  The song goes into an extended coda that contains tablas, a recorder, organ, and what sounds like a sarod.    2000 LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM HOME - Nothing but sheer brilliance here!  This song was actually regulated to being the B-side of \\"She's A Rainbow\\" pushing it to becoming a double A sided single.  This song was, by far, The Stones greatest production achievement in 1967.  Hypnotic, spacy, andheavy!  Brian Jones creative use of the Mellotron surpasses any other band's use of the instrument during that period.      And now for the album's NOT-S0-GREAT moments.    SING THIS ALL TOGETHER - \\"Satanic Majesties\\" opening number and probably one of the lamest songs The Stones ever recorded!  The song's lyrics are so cliched in the flower power ethos of the time they're laughable (\\"Pictures of us beating on our drum.  Never stop until the rain has come?!).  The sing along vocals will either remind you of a bunch of drunken sailors or The Muppetts, take your pick.     SING THIS ALL TOGETHER (SEE WHAT HAPPENS) - Side one's closing track and a sequel (of sorts) to the side's opening song.  This is nothing but an almost nine minute, annoying, free-form excursion that goes absolutely NOWHERE!  There are few moments of real interest here except:  1) Hearing Mick ask \\"Where's that joint?\\" during the intro of the song.  2) Mick's screaming tirade that he goes into during the middle of the song, joined by others in the studio.  3) The song's spacey coda which, if you own a copy on vinyl, will reveal it's hidden message when played at 45 RPM.  Needless to say, \\"We Love You\\" would've made a much better side closing cut that this!    THE LANTERN - While not a horrible song, it's not very interesting either.  It's tempo tends to drag a whole lot and it's lyrics are vague and abstract.  The song could have definitely benefited from a \\"Salt Of The Earth\\" or \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" styled arrangement.      ON WITH THE SHOW - Another attempt at a \\"silly\\" song by The Stones whose added sound effects don't really match up with the images the lyrics are trying to convey.  It seems the picture the song is trying to paint is that of wealthy, British folk having a \\"drunken good time.\\"  It'd be nice to actually be able to HEAR the conversation that takes place at the end of the song between Mick and an anonymous female who asks, \\"You're not recording any of this, are you?\\"Yes.  Yes he was.      So that's my take on \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request.\\"  I would suggest listening to it before you purchase it, simply because it's THAT kind of album.  But we all know, The Stones got out of their \\"purple haze\\" and started rocking again.  Next up, THE BAD BOY YEARS!
031606792X|5.0|Those who purchase this book will only do so if they have already read Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse. So, they will understand that this book is the finale to the Twilight Saga.    Most Twilight saga fans will be somewhat sad to hear that this is the last book in the series, or at least the book that ends the story. Maybe not the last book! (Fingers crossed!)    The book in itself is truly amazing. Those who are already familiar with the first 3 book will not need much of a review because \\"you\\" probably do not care that this is the end! You must read it!    It ends exactly the way that most Twilighters hope it will! (No spoilers, I promise!) But, everyone has such a different idea about Jacob and Edward! Regardless, it is a beautiful romantic story that truly finishes the wonderful story!    I'm in love with this saga and couldn't say anymore to encourage you to purchase it!
B000NVIGC0|4.0|\\"Sky Blue Sky\\" Wilco's seventh studio album, is less experimental and more easygoing then previous works. Cited as boring or dull by many, it's an album that needs to be listened to a few times. If you're thinking \\"are you serious I actually have to listen to It a few times to get joy out of it?\\" then save your money and don't buy it.<br /><br />Wilco are a group who have a major label, but depart themselves from any major styles fluctuating the market right now. They incorporate alternative and country melts. Twelve tracks and you'll find yourself listening to less then a handful over and over. While that sounds bad, I find this to be a great album to just have on in the background. Have it play through in its entirety. The music is definitely quality; the hooks are obvious but at least warm and tempting.<br /><br />The sound quality is clear, most notes are either twangy or sounding as if someone turned the tone all the way down. \\"Either Way\\" and \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" seem like the strongest most well known tracks. Musically it feels rather dated, not stale but dated. They aimed for a late sixties early seventies sound and achieved that. Brief moments (\\"Side with the Seeds\\") sound like something Bob Dylan could of crafted. It really is a full album, just nothing booming or grabbing, and will probably see lesser plays in comparison to their mega-hit album \\"Yankee hotel Foxtrot\\".<br /><br />So if you want an album that teeters warmly with charisma and soul this is a great buy. If you want an album that's going to entice your ears and interest strongly, sorry no this isn't it. It's just a great album that's not trying to prove superiority with any gimmicks, the music's there the end. (I'm having a really difficult time putting words to my madness here this is not an easy album for me to review, I just thought I'd throw in some brief opinions)
0316113506|5.0|I really liked this book because it helped me to see the science between the brain and exercise. Just another great reason to keep up your heart rate. I enjoyed this book a lot and look forward to any further books by Mr. Ratey.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|My Mom loved the movie and all the bonus features. No issues with this purchase.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|For those of us who never watched the series, it is hard to grasp the concept of the movie directly.  The relationships between the 4 GREATEST of FRIENDS, Mr. Big and the rest.    The movie brings very real life issue that many of us face in living in a big populated fast paced metropolitan city.  Where can you find true love? How many broken hearts? How many failed attempts, that makes the watcher skeptical, and they should wake up to reality.    All the cynics and critiques.. and one-siders have lots to say.. to much sex.. to much skin.. to much hyped up fashion.  People don't live this way in reality. Blah.. blah.. blah..    I watch the movie so many times.. and I can tell you one thing.  There are many things in this movie that we adults are missing from today's friendships and relationships.  - A friend in need.. what friendship is all about.. when one stays in alone.. on new years eve.. and what a friend would do.. in snow and sleep.. to be there for a friend..  - A marriage isn't over just because of one misjudgement. For the good times and the bad.. till death do you part.  - Believe in miracles..  - A marriage is between a man and a women.  Not between anyone else.  - Secrets are like poison pills.  They will kill you or get someone hurt seriously.  - Sex does play an important part in cementing a marriage.  - And yes.. millionaires do marry plain simple Janes.  I know a few. Not all millionaires are shallow.  They too are human, and want to be loved and to love genuinely.    Call me a romantic of a guy.  The sound track, the songs chosen, brings a great mood to the picture, that makes my eyes water - when heart-warming and when sad.    So, forget about all the sex, and skin and \\"unrealities\\", didn't we all have dreams, don't we all still have dreams.  Live the dream and not confine yourself to what people tell you is reality.  Enjoy the movie.    Adrian

I recommend it highly and hope everyone gets to see it. We plan to watch it again and again. Wonderful acting on the part of John Adams and his wife. Please get this movie. You won't be disappointed and you will be so glad you did. Bev Steiner
0439882826|5.0|This book is not just a simple pop-up book. It has pop-ups hidden in places I NEVER expected. I am not a Star Wars fan, but giving it as a gift I enjoyed it as much as the receiver. To make it even better the last page is pop-ups of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker (sorry if that's wrong!) holding light sabers that actually glow red and green! Very fun and worth all the money!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The movies are of course very good and the extra content definitely adds value to the collection.  If you are a fan of the Matrix then you will enjoy all the material provided here.
B00008EYA5|4.0|If you like colin Farell and Sameul l. Jackson than you will love this movie. There aren't a whole lot of complicated plots and angles. Basically what you see is what you get. But It the story of two partners in Swat who screw up. One goes his own way the other pays the price and gets back onto the team. International gangster appears and offers mucho dinero for anyone to get him out. There isn't a lot of Blow up and Bam, Boom Bang, but still enough to keep you on your toes and guessing
B000001FA4|5.0|U2 had a lot going for them in the early 1980's. With three solid albums under their belts including their U.S. breakthrough, `War', the lads of Dublin decided it was time to play with fire. In other words they were poised  to release something uniquely out of tune with the garbage piling up on the empty-headed pop scene. As it is said, where there is smoke there's fire and where there is U2 you have an album here so good it laid waste to everything else on the charts in the Autumn of `84, while refreshingly misrepresenting the band as Ireland's response to the last call of new wave. Okay, TUF didn't soar to the top of the charts, but its methodic ascent gave us plenty of time to relish a selection of songs that would brand the band as true architects of their craft. So where does one begin to train the water on a conflagration that burned off the long grass of a field under an `Indian Summer Sky' during  that certain Fall? Well, the phenomenal success of `Pride'{in The Name of Love}, one of their biggest singles ever, is a testament to the group's rallying cry for freedom and a blast heard `round the world, thanks to its radio- friendly composition. If this is their anthem song, then `Bad' is the LP's signature cut. All of the factors for a melodic equation merge here for a perfect U2 number; those powerful, unmistakable vocals, forceful, precision guitar playing, nimble drumming and a throbbing bass during the refrain. `Promenade' is a peaceful ride through the English countryside, but when the Edge plugs into `Wire' things really heat up. His tight and intense guitar work here, puts him in an elite class few other players occupy. `A Sort of Homecoming' is a lyrical gem forged not from a cauldron of gloom and doom, but rather from a warm safe seat by the fireplace. On this one, Bono and his mates wax positive singing of hope and salvation, as if an endearing phoenix has just risen from the ashes to bring its message of  revelation. However, in naked contrast to most of TUF's content is the absorbing title track. Its suggestive story aside, this song is simply outstanding, with a fluctuating  score, vital orchestration and adventurous vocals that puts the band's front man in a class also, few others deserve to be. There is, at the very tail end of the piece, a barely audible 4 or 5 note fade out. Brief, yet stirring, it is a conclusion that would give a cinematographer the closing shot of his dreams. This is the record that really brought U2 to the shores of America, where they would, only 4 albums into their recording career, blaze a trail through the musical wilderness of the 80's with nothing shy of the scope of the country in their sites. The Fire is still burning just as bright today, like a pilot light that's never had to be re-ignited...an eternal flame of a masterpiece.

0312383320|4.0|\\"Plum Spooky\\" is a magical delight for Stephanie Plum fans. I have not been a fan of her past novellas and Fearless 14, but I found myself laughing out loud for many parts. I was skeptical of a Halloween theme in mid January, but instead of focusing on Halloween, it focused around mysterious and \\"spooky\\" happenings during her Bond trailing. Diesel (for once) is charming and the monkey adds a little humor. Although, since this was a bigger novella than her other ones I would have liked more Morelli and Ranger. (go Ranger)    So why do I give it 4-Stars? This series has no growth and no character development. It continues to be a fun and interesting read but nothing ever changes, not even the plot developments. Different skips, same plot outline.   And 14+ books into the series and Stephanie is still nowhere closer to choosing a man. I know Janet is only contracted through 16 books and is considering more, but I say let a good thing go and stop at 16.

006135323X|5.0|The crux of Dan Ariely's book \\"Predictably Irrational\\" is that humans believe they are rational creatures, yet often base supposedly rational decision making on a host of unconscious, often irrational, criteria.  What makes this book riveting is the fact that Ariely then goes on to show you how he proves his arguments empirically - using experiments whose ingenious simplicity and perception will astound you.  The implications of Ariely's experiments are profound:  much of classical economics is wrong; public policy based on incorrect assumptions of human decision making are wrong; your own self perception that you are in full conscious control of yourself is wrong.  Ariely is aware of these implications and makes them explicit at the end of each chapter.  This makes \\"Predictably Irrational\\" function on a host of levels - individual psychology; group dynamics/sociology; public policy, and ultimately, culture and anthropology.<br /><br />Ariely specifically addresses 12 specific issues over the 12 chapters in \\"Predictably Irrational\\".  They constitute his work so far - and are meant to introduce you to a new science.  They are not meant to constitute a complete analysis of the phenomena in any way.  The 12 are:<br />1) price relativity - people subconsciously base their sense of price value on initial anchors formed irrationally - and then estimate relative values off that.  This flies in the face of classical economics' assumption of a sense of absolute value.<br />2) supply and demand is a fallacy - examples of how product pricing is initially emotionally created are provided - including the case of Tahitian black pearls<br />3) how the promise of \\"free\\" distorts our estimation of value.  This is the best chapter in the book and has a lovely section on how he tricks trick or treating kids into accepting less candy based on the allure of a \\"free\\" item in trade.<br />4) the difference between social and economic obligations and relationships (how you'll work harder for a friend than someone who is paying you - and how corporations try to be your friend but how the social aspect is fragile and easily lost when economics comes into things.<br />5) how arousal changes your decision making - and how it's impossible for individuals to predict how emotional heat will make them change their priorities.  This area has a ton of valuable implications for why people don't save money, use condoms, or diet successfully even though the goals seem so valuable.  The heat of the moment leads people to think differently.  The empirical experiments deployed here are fascinating and icky (they involve college boys answering Kinsey-type questions during arousal - very weird).<br />6) procrastination<br />7) how owning something leads to over valuing it.<br />8) how people hate reducing their options - even if failing to commit to a particular course costs them far more than losing some options.<br />9) expectation - you get what you expect (often no matter what the reality is).<br />10) how price affects how effective placebos are.<br />11) honesty and cheating - a fabulous investigation into the exact mechanics how how/why people cheat/steal.<br />12) how people feel freer to cheat/steal if the items in question are not cash (even if they are tokens only one step removed from cash).  Huge implications for business.<br /><br />Part of the fascination isn't just that Ariely has investigated and written about these cool topics; it's that he also explains his insight into these issues (it relates to his recovery from serious injuries) and liberally peppers the narrative with descriptions of the collaborative process of social science and with personal anecdotes.  Throughout the whole thing Ariely comes off as such a decent and perceptive human being.  What a great pleasure this book is on such a variety of levels.e who is paying you - and how corporations try to be your friend but how the social aspect is fragile and easily lost when economics comes into things.  5) how arousal changes your decision making - and how it's impossible for individuals to predict how emotional heat will make them change their priorities.  This area has a ton of valuable implications for why people don't save money, use condoms, or diet successfully even though the goals seem so valuable.  The heat of the moment leads people to think differently.  The empirical experiments deployed here are fascinating and icky (they involve college boys answering Kinsey-type questions during arousal - very weird).  6) procrastination  7) how owning something leads to over valuing it.  8) how people hate reducing their options - even if failing to commit to a particular course costs them far more than losing some options.  9) expectation - you get what you expect (often no matter what the reality is).  10) how price affects how effective placebos are.  11) honesty and cheating - a fabulous investigation into the exact mechanics how how/why people cheat/steal.  12) how people feel freer to cheat/steal if the items in question are not cash (even if they are tokens only one step removed from cash).  Huge implications for business.    Part of the fascination isn't just that Ariely has investigated and written about these cool topics; it's that he also explains his insight into these issues (it relates to his recovery from serious injuries) and liberally peppers the narrative with descriptions of the collaborative process of social science and with personal anecdotes.  Throughout the whole thing Ariely comes off as such a decent and perceptive human being.  What a great pleasure this book is on such a variety of levels.
031606792X|5.0|Highly recommended book.  Buying the complete series of these books is the only way to go. After you read one, you want to read the others.  One of those books you just can't put down.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|sure... the albums sound better.I think Tony Peter and Mike know \\"alittle\\" bit more on how they should sound.Each disc has a 40 minute interview with all bandmembers discussing each track, who wrote what, who contributed that. For that alone its worth buying.I was lucky enough to see the selling england show at the academy of music, the greatest concert I ever saw.Getting back to the music....get out the tresspass LP or CD...play stagnation....then listen to the new one.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Love it! Played at a friend's and enjoyed it so much , I bought it as a gift for my mother. Love that my 9 year old can play as well.
B000077VPU|5.0|If you LOVE Queen and miss Freddy Mercury, then this IS the DVD for you! Everyone in the tribute was there for Freddy. They performed to his fans as Freddy would have wanted. I never tire of Queen so this was the video for me.

B000P12LWY|5.0|I purchased these as gifts.  I watched John Adams previously and wanted my daughter, a teacher, to have it for her class.  I watched season II of the Tudors and enjoyed it, but have not seen season I, so I purchased it as a gift for one of my adult children; so now I can borrow it and catch up.
B0000X61VE|5.0|This workout video works for her and it works for me. I think it isnt  for obese or extremely overweight people, maybe they should ease into it and I think only healthy people should use this video. I have turned a few of my friends onto this video and they LOVE it as I do. I have shed my pregnancy weight twice with this video.Thank you Radu and thank you Cindy! I just bought another copy for a gift for one of my friends who is always borrowing mine. I love this video!!
0545128285|4.0|Written in the style of children's fairy tales, this book is not much like reading the Potter books. It gives a bit more of the taste of the wizarding world, but not a lot. Dumbledore's notes are cool and every purchase gives to a good cause.<br /><br />The avid Potter fan will want to own this but whether they'll like it or not depends on what they were looking for. Remember, this is a book from the magical world -- not a continuation of the Harry Potter books.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is the product. One of the best movies of the last year (if not the best) in 1920x1080 resolution. Espectacular sound, without giving out the drama or the intense action.    I'm really glad to have bought it.    And an important bonus is the Digital Copy. Now I can carry my DK wherever I go and show it to my friends who haven't watch the movie.
160459201X|5.0|I never give five star ratings.  So it is very rare to be this impressed by a fairly unknown book.  Joseph Murphy is very succinct and clear in the writing of this quick read. The reader is provided with simple anecdotes and then a practical method to apply the lesson.    Very helpful and motivating perspectives of how one might improve any aspect of their life with often just a slight shift in one's attitude. I was extremely pleased with this book and continue to reap the benefits to this day.    I wanted to add more:  What a remarkable book. Now I rarely give anything a five star rating but this book does give you interesting anecdotal evidence as well as a suggested application.  Some books will give you only the former, without any suggested course of action. This book is a quick read that gives you a better perspective on how one might alter the circumstances of their life.
B000OLGCI4|3.0|I remember this movie as being better than it really is. It's a classic to be sure, but it doesn't hold up well - technically. The pace is odd. The comic timing is terrible. This was the last feature personally supervised by Walt Disney and it kind of shows his older sensibilities. It felt a little 'phoned in'.     I will always have fond memories of this movie, but I may not watch it too frequently so I don't dilute those memories.    The DVD is top notch. Great quality, great sound, excellent extras.
B000WMA6FA|5.0|Watching this really opens your eyes to what real poverty in the US is all about. The people in this movie who made it to California, those who didn't die along the way, counted themselves very lucky to have the privelage to work enough to earn enough money to buy overpriced food to eat that day. Back home in Oklahoma, banks hired neighbors to plow their houses down. The fertile topsoil had long since blown away, leaving dust behind. Lured to California with phony promises of work, they live in tents out of the back of their truck, chasing rumors of work, being harrassed by crooked cops. Little did they know this depression would last over a decade, finally broken only by the steady work of World War II.<br />So anyone who thinks we are entering a \\"depression\\" today needs to watch this movie. What, is the price of gas going to force people out of their Lexus or Escalades and into a sensible car? Is their 401k dipping more than usual? They can't afford three Starbucks per day? Aw[...] poor babies.. Even those who lost their jobs are finding that there are other jobs available to replace them. No one's houses are being bulldozed to the ground. We don't have mass migrations. We don't have bread lines in every city. We DO have unemployment insurance. The characters in this movie, seeing how we live today, would die laughing at the suggestion that we are in any sort of depression.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|First, the DVD packaging is intriguing, very cool. The digital copy is a godsend - now I can play WALL-E on my iPhone, my iPod... EASILY! It's wonderful.  All of the extras I love, so does my 5&1/2 year old son.     The movie itself is in my top 3 favorite PIXAR features (the other 2 being \\"Ratatouille\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\").  Absolutely an outstanding movie from beginning to end. And the music is at turns oddly fun and heart-wrenchingly lovely. For a film that has so little dialogue the music is paramount and Thomas Newman NAILS IT.    Highly recommended!
B001EOQWFI|5.0|The first 1/3 of the movie (before Wall-E meets people on the ship) is perfect - a masterpiece. The second 1/3 is a very good movie. The last third is perfect as well.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies ever made. Meryl Streep never does anything bad anyway, but this one just can't be missed. Even gave this as a gift to daughter and family and she watched it 7 times....  We will watch this over and over, just as we do Out of Africa.
0312383320|1.0|I have been a Stephanie Plum fan from the very beginning. I have often counted down the days until the next book is released. This latest book was a complete and absolute disappointment.  The characters were stupid! The plot was stupid! Paying nearly $30 for this book was stupid! In my opinion Ms Evanovich has lost her touch. The once sharply written antics of Stephanie and the gang has turned into immature \\"bodily function tinged\\" nonsense. Count the number of times the word \\"fart\\" appears in this book and I'll bet it is far more than the word Ranger or Morelli.  From now on I think I'll wait and pick up future installments in this series at the used book store!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter...needless to say, she absolutely loved it! I absolutely loved the great price that I was able to get on Amazon, as usual! I searched for it everywhere and refused to pay $250 for it when Amazon saved me $150...I knew where I would make my purchase! Now whenever I am wanting to buy something, Amazon is the first place that I search.
B0000VD04M|4.0|edd wood was not the worst  all his movies lacked money not ideas and skill or acting ability. some of his ideas were copied later with big buck movie makers, any body thinks a good movie is if they have great expensive special effects, is a idiot.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|The film, which is somehow hailed by the majority of critics, is a humorless, gruesome mess, which is painful to watch. It is brimming with  pseudo-artistry of tricks and callow gadgetry. This is the problem with our Hyper-real reality - each new installation will be a copy of a copy - the further plagiarized original. Where is the humor of the original *Batman* (1989)? Where is the chemistry between Kim Basinger and Michael Keaton, the authenticity of Alfred?<br />Where, I ask you, is Jack Nicholson's perfect gravitas and Joker's playful script conceived and executed with such agile perfection? Where is the artistic imagery of Gotham and subtle quality of the tracking shots and music score? Compared to the original *Batman*, this is a blotted unimaginative mess, guaranteed to cause a mild indigestion because of its unripe ideas and the glorified violence, which the film itself was supposed to scrutinize.
1416562605|4.0|The events related illustrate and teach much about India that needs to be known by those who do not come from the area.  I can see whay many Indians are so upset by the work.  They do not claim that what it written is false, mind you, just that Mr. Adiga (a journalist and Native son) should not have told such truths to the world.  Much of what is told is truly heart breaking.  This is not going to make you feel good about the country--but is does give some insights that may be useful in evaluating some of the pressures and views of the people of the nation that will be the most populous in the world and one of the two world leaders (along with China) sometime in the 21st century.
0769273602|5.0|OK, so it doesn't have guitar tab.  Never mind.  Its got a helluva lotta songs in it with the guitar chords I need and the lyrics.  I'll just have to use my ears to get the actual guitar bits being played.  Having said that, some of the songs do have the music notation for the guitar part.  For example, the intro to Nebraska is scored.  Now, what I did was learn some rudimentary music reading.  Like, the key signature, and note values and where the notes sit on the stave.  That now means I can work out the guitar picking in Nebraska with the aid of the music notation from this book (and my ears).  Brill!    And no harp score for Nebraska!  Woe is me!  What shall I do?  I know!  I'll just have to work it out myself then won't I?    As for songs being in the correct keys, I'm not sure.  For instance, Open all Night is scored in G.  When I play along to that song, F# seems to be the key.  And Nebraska is scored in D, but Spring plays it in Db.   Whatever.  This book still aids me with the chord sequences used.    Now, I rated it a five because, with one mouse click, I was able to look at sample pages so I knew what I was purchasing.  It never claimed to be a guitar tab book.      I don't get people who don't research a product and then grizzle about it.    You won't find anything else better out there with this much material on Spring Brucesteen's music.
B001HN6972|4.0|A boy of 15 years is away from home when he becomes violently ill. But not for the kindness of a passing woman, he does not know how he would have made it home. To express his gratitude he goes back to her with flowers. His innocent act of thanks then leads to a torrid affair with this older woman. Their time together lasts only a few months before the woman disappears without saying goodbye, but the boy, Michael, will never be the same. Later, in law school, Michael's class goes to the courthouse to learn from courtroom experience. On trial is Hanna, the woman who changed Michael's life forever.     After a few days of soul searching I am finally ready to say if I liked this movie or not. And I did. I thought that there were a few things that detracted from the movie, but there are almost always things that detract from movies. I will try to be brief and discuss my main complaint with the movie first. It was in English. The movie bounces between different chapters of Michael's life, but except for a short scene at the end (that I would have left out if I had edited this film) the entire movie takes place in Germany. The movie, based on more than just the countless scenes of passion between Michael and Hanna, strives to become intimate with the audience. I found it strange that the movie was not in German with subtitles. I feel this would have given the movie a more authentic feel and bridged that final gap of intimacy.     With that out of the way, I may continue with what I enjoyed. Much early press suggests that Kate Winslet will take home an award or two for her role as Hanna. I have not seen every movie she is nominated, or might be nominated, against so I will not comment on that. I will say that in this movie alone her performance was second best. David Kross was young Michael. He is our protagonist. While it is hard to overlook Ralph Fiennes, who plays older Michael, most of the movie happens while Michael is young. David Kross, a young actor with very little experience, shows strong talent in The Reader.     I wanted to argue against the amount of nudity and \\"adult situations\\" that make up essentially the entire first half of the movie. I have gone so far as to jokingly call this movie pornography, but I think it was all necessary to lend credibility to the impact Michael and Hanna had on each other. Here were two people who yearned to be together and were physically intimate beyond all boundaries, yet secrets were kept. And the secrets drove them apart.     I cannot say that The Reader was any better or worse than the other movies I have seen where a boy has an affair with an older woman then sees her tried in a court of law. Shockingly, this is the only movie I have seen in that category. Since I cannot compare it to anything, I will say that I found the story to be deeply moving at times. I thought the characters were developed well and the things I didn't like did not make the movie unwatchable.
1416914293|5.0|I'm really obsessed with the twilight saga and I thought that there wouldn't be another book I would even get close to liking as much well I was wrong coa is awesome it captures your attention pretty quick then when you think you have it figured out your wrong its a book worth reading
B000AMJC2K|4.0|So far it's holding up my 22\\" LCD w/o problem.  I got it so I can rotate the screen and move it out of the way when not in use.  The rotated widescreen isn't as useful as the old 3:4 screen.  Moving it back and forth could be smoother/easier, but at this price, I am not complaining.  Beside, once it's set-up, the LCD doesn't really get move around that much.

0307388840|1.0|This could have been a very good book because is it shocking what the little girl does and consequences that result from it.  But there was too much boring detail to make the book longer that it needed to be.
0439813786|3.0|This book is based off a snippet from the life of an actual person, so while it seems like it's going to be amazing and fantastical from the outset, its really.... not. The pictures, some hand drawn, some reproduced from others' works are really cool, and the way in which the author tells the story through them is very inventive, it's really not enough to make up for a lackluster story. I think he was focusing most of his energies on the illustrations rather than worry about things like plot lines, character development, etc. still, for a kids book, it was entertaining. but i can certainly see why it won a caldecot and not a newberry.
B001B71NOI|5.0|I bought the five dollar download here on Amazon last spring.  I am still very impressed with this ten track album.  of the ten tracks, four of which are the slow tempo, 'still' like tunes...leaving the other six tracks to be hard, pumping, loud noisy rockers.  Discpline was recorded on a Monday and playing on radio's by Wednesday (the same week).<br />Key tracks to listen for: Discipline, Head Down, Corona Radiata and Demon Seed.  My favorite track is Head Down.  All the songs have awesome lyrics, as only trent reznor could compose and portray.  Very good music.  An awesome unexpected Halo.  I had no idea of its production around the time of the mp3 download.  It IS overwhelming to think NIN's has releasedthree albums, many singles and remixes and the ghosts project all withing the same decade!!!  Keep 'em comin' trent!!!
0316017922|5.0|This is a book that makes one reevaluate one's assumptions about personal success.The authors skill in pulling apparently extraneous examples into a powerful whole and a truly moving ending provides an extrordinary reading experience.Upon completing the reading of this book, I immediatly ordered the author's two other books.
B00003CXA6|5.0|My wife and I had previously seen this historical accounting some time ago. We visited the Battlefield in early November - the first for her and  the second time for me. Like most return visits to anywhere, one discovers additional knowledge. The movie became an almost necessity  following our visit of which I gave it to my wife as a Christmas  present. The movie is exceptional accounting of the battle and a must for  our library.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I loved the movie and pre-ordered the DVD that came on time, as Amazon has always been perfect on. The \\"making of\\" if very good, although I would have loved to know even more about the actors and how they prepared for the role, which is mostly what people care about.  Overall, really a great movie and great \\"making of\\".

B00006AW2J|5.0|This is a classic, from back when the Stones could make music. Sympathy for the Devil should be on everybody's iPod or MP3

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm always hesitant when I get a new workout dvd because I've had horrible experiences with some of them, but this workout is AWESOME.  I am slightly overweight and working on getting healthier and thinner.  I started doing Level 1 this week and have done it 4 days so far.  The morning after I used the dvd, I was SO SORE.  But it felt good.  I can tell my strength is progressing already after just 4 days of use.    Yesterday, I ate more sugar than normal and I could feel it when I was doing the workout.  I was more tired and had less strength.  This just proves that eating healthy and doing this workout will be the most effective!    I like this DVD because the moves and techqniues aren't complicated at all, they are very basic and effective moves that are very easy to follow.  The time always flies by so fast!      Best workout DVD I have bought in a VERY long time.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|In anticipation of re-watching Batman Returns for the umpteenth time, I popped in the bonus material disc and peered into the making-of featurettes. There are quite a few tasty tidbits worth sharing (which I'll get to later).<br /><br />I'd first like to point out that given the richness and scope of the film, I'll only be pointing out some of its highlights.<br /><br />Tim Burton was reluctant to make a second Batman film; not only for the obvious reasons but also due to how he proclaimed (rightfully so) that the first had several boring patches. The studio captured his interest by suggesting he make a \\"Tim Burton film\\" instead of just another sequel. He decided to go to extremes, not feeling beholden to the comics. This resulted in a visually stunning, thematically dark yet hilarious picture that is truly the black sheep of Tim Burton's oeuvre. All four original Batman movies fail as Batman movies but this is the only one of the lot that succeeds as a movie movie. Its terse script provides pitch-black, hysterical humor and psychologically dense principal characters.<br /><br />In particular are the Penguin and the Catwoman, played by two of my favorite actors: Danny DeVito (always brimming with energy and serving up heaps of laughter) and Michelle Pfeiffer (a captivating woman whose natural beauty seems immune to age).<br /><br />Being a moderate fan of the Batman comics, I've never found the Penguin or Catwoman very interesting or intimidating. One is an aristocratic buffoon, the other a glorified thief. Yawn.<br /><br />Tim Burton transforms both into ghoulish, frightening, stark and legendary figures who've stood the test of time. To this day they remain memorable cinematic adaptations of two very popular super villains. Danny is completely unrecognizable (and gives one of my personal favorite performances by any actor) and Michelle takes feminism to an absurdly funny level. For me, these are the definitive versions of both members of Batman's rogues gallery. Purist comic book fanboys (and girls) will scoff at this opinion but I'd rather have an entertaining, non-canonical take than a faithful, boring one. For this reason I hope neither villain is reintroduced in the next Batman movie (no matter who directs it).<br /><br />The proverbial fourth leg of the table is Max Shreck, played with unabashed scene-stealing creepiness by none other than Christopher Walken (whom Burton initially didn't want to cast because - in his own words - \\"he scares me\\"). I relish this ultimate Walken role, with his mad scientist hair and trademark cadence.<br /><br />I quote this movie all the time (especially the Penguin's lines), so to do so in this writeup would end up with over half the screenplay referenced. I strongly recommend taking a peek at IMDb's 'memorable quotes' page.<br /><br />Finally, some behind-the-scenes trivia. One of the crew members attended several theatrical exhibitions and sadistically enjoyed some of the audience's reactions: children crying; people feeling like they had been punched in the stomach or mugged; parents angry at what they had just seen. Despite the merchandising frenzy, this Batman entry was never truly intended for children. I share in his amusement. As a matter of fact, Burton attended a meeting with Warner Bros. execs to discuss ideas for the next installment of the franchise. After awhile he straight-up asked, \\"You don't really want me to make another one, do you?\\" The meeting ended soon after.l scoff at this opinion but I'd rather have an entertaining, non-canonical take than a faithful, boring one.

0393330435|4.0|While Steve Jobs continues to be quite visible in the press, not as much is known about his Apple co-founder.  This autobiography is a step in the right direction, as Steve Wozniak touches on his childhood, education, marriage(s) and even the evolution of his political views along with a detailed explanation of his work on the original Apple computer.    The book could have used some tighter editing, as it meanders a bit -- Wozniak discusses the same subjects or relates the same anecdotes in different sections of the book -- but it is written in a conversational style that makes you feel as if you are sitting across the table listening to him.  He also does a fairly good job explaining highly technical concepts for the non-engineers among us.     There weren't many \\"revelations\\" for those who already know about Apple's history, and indeed I finished the book hoping for a little more knowledge.  Still, despite the loose editing, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone unfamiliar with this \\"iCon\\" of the digital age.
B001LRJH0K|5.0|Truly one of those great westerns that appears to only come along every few years. I gave this a 5 star rating because Ed managed to put together a believable western onto a solid BD (from film stock) - all while showing how to do things at a low cost.<br /><br />Everyone shines through in their performances, even when nuanced to such a minimalist theme, that nothing detracts from the story. The locale was set prefect for what they were trying to accomplish, and choosing to use film instead of digital (especially with Semler at the helm) captured the needed feel in just the right way (colors, hues, etc.).<br /><br />The BD offers both TrueHD and 5.1 for sound, but admittedly the bass and outer channels only get heavily used when that beautiful 8-gauge goes off (especially indoors). The picture clarity was perfect and even in the night shots around fires or indoors, the color palettes still appeared adequately.<br /><br />The 4 BD docus total 30 minutes and provide plenty of great production background and historical information. The train and gun buffs will get the most out of it, as will some of the fashion interests. Dean Semler's (very prominent cinematographer) comment on knowing he is getting back to the old ways by stepping in horseh*t on the set instead of gum sums it up best. The deleted scenes should have been left in the film and would have added greatly to the urgency of what our main characters were doing, but you can't have it all (total about 10 minutes).<br /><br />A re-watchable film from beginning to end, and it has been captivating people of all ages that pass through the store with the scenery and popular cast.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This album is amazing! I skipped through the songs at first to get to my faves, but overall its really good! The first song by Muse is the song which plays in the baseball scene, so i absolutely loved that one.. its a hot track! Theres also the sweet song from the Prom scene and of course the best one is by Robert Pattinson who plays Edward in the movie (yes, he sings too!) Its a great album to get. If anything, get it for Robert Pattinson if you're a fan of the movie.    Otherwise, just get it for the three songs i named above, its definately an impressive soundtrack. I usually dont get soundtracks from movies i watch, but this one was hard to resist, its fantastic!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Excellent story written for big and little children.  Teaches to tell the  truth no matter what, the value of believing in yourself, the value of not giving in to pressure when you know you are right. The important message that all people no matter how small are important and should be protected.
0783230079|4.0|Heart & Souls is a beautiful story of a young boy who grows up in the company of four adult spirits who cant \\"pass over\\" till they accomplish their unfinished business on earth. The spirits stay with him as a child, and then disappear throughout his teen years, coming back to him when he is an adult. However, he spent his younger years in therapy convincing himself these spirits were a figment of his imagination so the spirits must convince him that they are indeed real -- and also win him over so he can help them with their \\"unfinished business.\\"    I watched it when i was a child and that was about ten years ago.. but i still love it just as much as i did then. Its a really nice family movie with a bit of romance. Oh and the kid who plays Robert Downey Jr as a child is SO adorable!
0312383320|3.0|I bought it, I read it, I wish I hadn't read it. It makes me sad and longing for the earlier Plum books. I loved those books. Where JE has taken this book is in to the silly, childish type of humor area. Farting and monkeys repeatedly do not make me laugh. Stephanie getting in trouble and having Ranger and Morelli in the mix are what I want. If you like Diesel and the \\"unmentionable\\" theme, then you might like this book. Personally, I am just saddened as I used to re-read these novels but have not enjoyed 13, 14 or plum spooky. Hopefully, JE will go back to what she had when she began the series or if not at least develop the characters and let Stephanie start making some decisions so that if JE is only going to write to #16, we can start getting some closure.
B001GZ6QBU|3.0|I wasnt planning on watching this movie but decided to last minute. I saw it on the huge screen at IMAX.. special effects and action was great.. heath ledger was fantastic in the role as the Joker.. i had only seen him in romance and drama roles before this, but he really suprised me with this one. He really went out leaving his mark.    If you're not a fan of his, or of the Batman series, you might not become a fan from watching this movie, but i do recommend giving it a chance at least. Its a pretty good storyline and even a bit scary towards the end.. i only bought the dvd for a friend, but i wouldnt mind watching it again.    Definately watch it if you're a Heath Ledger fan though.. he was awesome in his role and you will love him in this one.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I heard good things about this movie before I saw it and it still exceeded my expectations.  The story is fantastic, along with great attention for detail, and of course cutting edge animation this movie is hugely entertaining!  Not only is it a fantastic flick, but gives a disturbing portrayal of the Earth and it's civilizations future if changes aren't made.  I haven't seen an animated film as well thought out as this one!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is the most beautiful and visually stunning movie I have ever seen. And the story haunted me for days and weeks afterwards. You will want to own this movie as it becomes richer after every viewing.
B001C08RHA|5.0|My whole family loved this movie. It shipped fast to my home and was brand new as described.
B000JVSUS4|2.0|The two stars are for the Japanese approach into Pearl Harbor and the action torpedo sequence. The rest of the plot is worthless! On the Blu Ray version the images are not what I had expected, there is no DTS Sound, and what happened with all the extra features from the original dvd? Same dissapointing plots as Titanic, and Black Hawk Down. Hope the Patriot doesn't dissapoint me when I go see it in blu ray.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|If you enjoy the tv show, you'll love it. Basically ties up the first season and finishes where Josh wanted to take it.
B000002KKC|4.0|Fleetwood Mac's 'Tusk' is a bot of an enigma of 1979. How do you follow up on a record that brought you untold success, riches and nearly destroyed you as a band to do it? I guess you make 'Tusk' an album that sent the band in a spiral that resulted in solo careers and infrequent releases to follow.     For anyone familiar with 'Rumours' or 'Fleetwood Mac' this is certainly a departure. Double the length the material is less tight and accessible than a \\"Rhiannon\\" or \\"Don't Stop\\". Much of the material was done in Lindsey Buckingham's home studio and it shows. It feels like three solo projects by the band's singers instead of a strong, coherent disc like their prior two cds. There's certainly a lot of good material here but truly you notice the difference here with each of the singers (Christine's music is less catchy or memorable, Stevie's poetry is perhaps a bit less focused and Lindsey's somewhat erratic). A few years later the band made the far less risky 'Mirage', a better effort in many ways. What endures about this is the risk taking the band took NOT to remake 'Rumours'. 'Tusk' is bold, rough, brave, unfinished and in the end, admirable. Tracks to listen to: \\"Tusk\\", \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\", \\"Beautiful Child,\\" \\"Sisters of the Moon\\", \\"Brown Eyes\\", \\"Think About Me\\".
B0010X73ZG|5.0|There isn't much more to say that what I've stated in the heading of my review. Plus, what others have said in their \\"mini-dissertations.\\" Who says that all horror movies have to have a happy ending? This one certainly didn't. And it more than leaves you saddened and depressed (it'll wear off); but that is a good thing, because you'll never forget this movie if just for the ending. Wow!<br /><br />Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, William Sadler, Tobie Jones, Andre Braugher, Frances Sternhagen and the rest of the cast give tension-filled and sometimes maddening performances in this thriller (more so than the actual monsters). Those who think that Marcia Gay Harden as the wacked-out Bible-thumping Mrs. Carmody overdid it, have never been around religious zealots as she portrayed. Believe me, I've gone to churches where there are such self-righteous, \\"Fire and Brimstone\\" fanatics all but condemning you to Hell without warning. Which made her character all the more real and frightening.<br /><br />This movie is unforgettable. And Thomas Jane's final scene makes it so.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Well this was much better than Death Race 2000 from the 70s.  The plot was more solid, acting was way better and the action was so good I am sorry I missed it in the big screen.  I might have to bring it to work and watch it again on my projection system.  My biggest complaint was that there was no video game.  I would have loved a game where you could customize cars and race like they did in this movie.  Anyway I would like to thank all those who worked on this film.  You rock!
B0015OKWL2|3.0|Deniro & Pacino, the two exceptional actors that ignited my passion for cinema.  You know it's a sad day in showbiz when you pair these two up and still can't arouse much excitement.<br /><br />The premise is actually pretty cool.  Deniro is the cop serial killer, and Pacino is his partner that turns the other cheek.<br />Both these veteran actors deliver solid performances, but nothing special.  It's like they're on cruise control, nothing meaty in the script to pull the best out of them.<br /><br />Still it's scary to think of the power a police officer wields, and how in some regards they are exempt from the very laws they try to enforce.<br />It's hard to feel any contempt or discomfort for the cop that puts a bullet in the head of a rapist or pedaphile priest.  The line between evil and righteousness gets blurred, and few want to focus on sorting things out.<br /><br />The story progresses with some decent action scenes and interesting developments.  The biggest downside of this movie is without a doubt the ending.  Hollywood always deems it mandatory to throw in an absolutely shocking, retarded ending.  Yeah, they fooled us the first 2000 times.  So, for about the last hour you'll feel like a deer in headlights, as that H-wood vehicle comes barreling down the road of absurdity.<br /><br />Now a truly shocking ending would be a realistic one.  We'd never see that coming.

0595440096|5.0|I've spent the past day reading Still Alice. Couldn't put it down. I was utterly absorbed in the writing and the story. It's absolutely terrific -- so moving. My grandmother had dementia later in life so I recalled some of her symptoms. And I went to Harvard so it was fun recognizing all the buildings and Cambridge landmarks.<br /><br />I also recall that I was repelled by my grandmother's symptoms (I didn't see her a lot). And now wish I had understood better.<br /><br />Thank you for writing so well about a disease that is so important and that touches many of us.

B001GZ6QBU|5.0|WOW! This film is amazing with non-stop action. One person wrote, \\" The hero is only as good as his villain\\", and they were both great!. Heath Ledger as the Joker was remarkable! This is NOT a movie for small kids. Lots of violence. A must see....
B000YIGNKE|1.0|This version borders on the ridiculous, with all the running about.      The one with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is far superior, and who can resist the additional casting of Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister)?
B000K7VHQE|5.0|What a wonderful comedy ! An american coemedy, piece of a true culture, your culture. Exceptionnal. The words lack me to describe the truth of such a film. In such films, the American culture expresses its originality. I am looking forward to viewing other films of such quality and thank the persons who would give me advice.
B0017ZB8M6|2.0|There are three reasons to buy this album, \\"Hot & Cold,\\" \\"I Kissed a Girl,\\" and \\"U R So Gay.\\"  The rest is god awful.      This album recycles every stereotype there is to \\"empowered\\" girl music.  Most of the songs are overproduced, which would be fine if there was something of substance there (Phil Specter overproduced everything, but when the underlying band was good, the result was great).  I really wanted to like this album, but that just wasn't possible.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|This movie was one of the best Indiana Jones ones yet. I hope this isn't the last one.  I have all the movies and can watch them over and over without getting bored.
B00004XSUW|5.0|Is it just me, or is Leaving Trunk one of the grittiest, nastiest, lowest down, funkiest blues songs of all time.  Maybe its the rhythm, maybe its the way Taj plays with the phrasing, but I've probably heard it a thousand some times and STILL want to do god knows what when I hear it: move, groove, pillage, who knows, but it MOVES you!  Thats the magic of the blues for sure.
B001ED7C58|5.0|The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. I've ordered the Twilght Score now, & can't wait to hear it! The music from the movie had so much meaning & passion in it.
0887306667|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this short and simple book.<br /><br />It gives the marketing ideas in a clear and practical way with lots of real examples/mistakes which costed some companies millions of dollars. Although I do not work for a big consumer-goods company (on which this book is mainly focused), I gained an invaluable perspective.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|I loved the book POINT OF IMPACT and the character Bob Lee Swagger, so I approached this movie with a certain apprehension. A key component to this story is the guns, and if the guns are messed up then the whole movie fails as a cartoonish mess.    But they got the guns right!    That was one of the things I kept saying to myself as I watched the movie. In the extras I found they went to Front Sight in Nevada for technical assistance. I've been to Front Sight and those folks know their stuff.    Sure there were compromises with the original novel, but that happens in film. What was not compromised is the character Bob Lee Swagger, and to see him come to life on the screen was a big thrill.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is a very good move that is action packed. The computer generated special effects were down right impressive. I've never read an Iron Man comic. Now, I know what I've been missing.    This film has a little of everything for everyone. Robert Downy Jr. was a famous person to play Iron Man.
B00133KFGW|4.0|This is a different sort of movie for me.  I tend to prefer movies with great dialogue and watertight plots - and this movie, although it has some important dialogue, is also significant for the dialogue that it leaves out.  It also has a plot that is so surrealistic that it requires suspension of belief.  And the montages, as everyone is rushing towards the concert in Central Park, are beautiful but I can't help asking things like, \\"How did Mr. Jeffries get there in time?  Where was August's tuxedo?\\"<br /><br />It was also interesting to watch the scenes which were deleted.  They contained talk and exposition - but the movie is a fairytale which requires faith rather than logic.  Another missing scene (not one of the deleted) why didn't Lyla, Louis and August say anything to each other at the end?  The answer was that words were insufficient - music and video had to capture what could not be expressed in words.<br /><br />I recommend that watchers put aside their attachment to wit and logical consistency and pay attention to what works in the film. The film has the interesting premise that the universe is connected to each other through sound and music.  (I think it might be connected on other dimensions as well.)  We just need to listen, and we might become aware.<br /><br />And, if you watch the movie carefully, you will pick up certain gems.  For example, it is Wiz playing down below when Lyla and Louis spend their only night together.  The expressiveness of the faces of the actors who play Louis and August are absolutley fabulous.  The one real musician - the girl who plays Hope - makes our spirits soar when she sings.<br /><br />Appreciating this film requires a different approach.  It's like having to stand back when looking at paintings by Monet and Renoir.  It's not the same as appreciating the work of a photographer - but the film is beautiful and can give you a rewarding and illuminating experience.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|Women should be disgusted and insulted by the rash of \\"chick flicks\\" put out by Hollywood in recent years where women are concerned with little else than shopping and romance. This movie features some very good actresses, but the material is banal and completely lacking in depth.   Meg Ryan plays a rich woman who spends her time doing \\"fundraising,\\" and although she has only one child, somehow requires a full-time housekeeper (Cloris Leachman) and au pere girl to keep it all going.     Annette Bening, one of the greatest actresses ever, seems to be doing an exact impression of Samantha Jones from Sex and the City; someone should have reminded her that she's too old to play this sort of role. It's a fluff piece better suited to that nitwit Anne Hathaway.  The strangest thing about this movie is the complete absence of any men. All the extras are women; in street scenes, there is not a man to be seen anywhere. This gimmick would be affective if the film were not so utterly void of substance. It's as though a statement is trying to be made, but when the whole plot is about Meg's unfaithful husband and how she \\"wins\\" him back, it becomes all the more irrelevent. And how does she win him back? By becoming a fashion designer and presenting her rather unoriginal inspirations in a typical flashy New York gala. It happens effortlessly; and suddenly she's loveable again and worthy of her husband's attention.   Fashion is far more important than raising money for charities.    Debra Messing's part is so appalling it isn't even worth mentioning, but the worn-out child bearing scene was nauseating. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the ill-cast token lesbian who has to be freaked out by all things baby related. The acting is over-the-top, and the whole plot is silly. Hands down, the only good scenes belong to Canadace Bergen, and whoever wrote her lines should have taken over the whole script because hers are the only ones with any substance or authenticity.   Women in their late 40s and early 50s should not be in appalling films such as this. They should be portraying politicians, movers, shakers, thinkers - women who have lived, experienced, and are taken seriously outside the realm of men, money, and Gucci bags. In other words, women of substance who actually have something to offer other than shopping at Saks and getting their nails done.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|What a great production!  From the moment it starts in 18th century Boston with John Adams defending the soldiers of the Boston Massacre I was  mesmerized.  The acting, the costumes, the sets were so extremely well done I felt like a voyeur in a tremendously realistic history lesson. For me, it was a real step back into one of the most important and fascinating times of our nation.  I gave my copy to my mother who was equally intrigued and asked for a copy for Christmas.  I wound up buying six dvd sets and giving them for gifts.  Everyone that has seen them was as impressed as I.  What more can I say!?

1596912375|5.0|Cannot fathom the 4 stars reviews; especially the reviewer who states: \\"plot is hampered by a slightly overwrought literary device, the mother doling out her diaries at intervals, conveniently allowing the author to flip back and forth in time.\\"  The device is brilliant.  You want to read straight forward and mundane, well, stick to Ludlum or Silva or whomever.  The discerning reader will note the author's subtlety and craft.  His slight of hand if you will.  The slow way the substance of the tale is revealed.  It's like being lost in a forest.  You believe you know which path to take out.  The sun is shining.  You come upon a meadow here, a brook there.  No, wrong way.  It is only when all is revealed and you are safely out that you say, well, I knew where I was all the time.  But, you didn't.  Boyd never disappoints.  I stumbled upon him long ago when I read The Ice Cream War.  His novels are all dissimilar.  He's vastly underrated because he's so accessible.  I cannot wait to see what he gives us next.
B000063UR1|4.0|\\"Silent Running\\" depicts a future whereby Earth has become severely polluted and no longer able to sustain plant life.  The planet sends into orbit several spaceships housing forests with numerous types of trees, plants, and animals.  Tending the forest on one of these ships is Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), a highly dedicated astronaut who prays that the ships can one day return and re-green Earth.  His three crewmates who run the hip tease Lowell for his optimism; they don't care about the forest and are eager to return home.  The crew is also aided by three drones (later nicknames Huey, Louie, and Dewey); they are the cutest bots this side of Wall-E and their scenes with Lowell are fantastic.  One day, the crew receives orders to abandon the forests.  Lowell is devastated and takes matters into his own hands - becoming the ultimate eco-terrorist.<br /><br />Despite its cult status as a sci-fi near-classic, I hadn't actually heard of \\"Silent Running\\" until I read about its influence on several other sci-fi hits, including \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\\"  Fortunately, \\"Silent Running\\" more than lives up to its reputation by being a quirky, thought-provoking film.  The movie manages to convey important eco-messages that are more timely than ever, but it also is entertaining and avoids being preachy.  The script by Michael Cimino (The Deer Hunter) and Deric Washburn (The Border) is highly effective.  Although Lowell's actions are extreme at times, the script humanizes him through his love of the forest and his amusing interactions with the drones.<br /><br />\\"Silent Running\\" is the directing debut of Douglass Trumball, who was instrumental in developing the special effects of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and numerous later sci-fi classics (Close Encounters, Blade Runner).  Much of the special effects here rely on models; at times, the ship looks like a model, but most of it is still quite believable.  The drones also are highly realistic through the use of persons with double amputations.  The soundtrack features several Joan Baez songs which are a bit hippy-dippy, but they don't detract too much from the film's overall impact.  Some people might find the movie a bit dated and hippie-ish, but it still has many fine qualities and is first-class sci-fi.The soundtrack features several Joan Baez songs which are a bit hippy-dippy, but they don't detract too much from the film's overall impact.

B0017ZB8M6|3.0|I got this as a gift for a teen who wanted it and was aware of a couple of the songs (and some controversy around the songs).  I was unaware of some of the language involved however.  I would opt for an edited version if buying for a teen-ager.  I would definitely not buy this for children, the younger teen, or an immature teen.

B00177YEFM|4.0|I ordered this through Amazon and Target.com.  The price was right, the shipping was very fast (within a few days), and the lightsaber itself is pretty cool.  The glow is nice blue, easy to plug into your USB port.  The light remains lit for at least 10 min or so after the saber is remove from its cradle.  But after that it automatically shuts off and so you have to press the button or switch on the saber to light up again.  I used as a tree topper for my Star Wars theme Christmas Tree this year!  The only thing I wish it had were the sound effects like the larger FX sabers.  Overall, fun little toy and easy purchase from Amazon.

B000WC39SG|5.0|The film tells the story of Operation Market-Garden, and its ultimate failure, the Allied attempt to break through German lines and seize several bridges, with the main objective the bridge over the Lower Rhine (Neder Rijn) River, in the occupied Netherlands during World War II.     Very good audio and video quality, great actors and war scenes.
1439102813|5.0|I have to admit, I picked THIS BOOK because I wanted my mother in law to read it. I was going to suggest it if I liked it to her, as her mother is suffering Alzheimers.   So, I read it first, and LOVED IT. I guess what I was searching for was HOW does not only the patient, but how do loved ones cope with something as tragic, as the death of a person without their actual demise?  Alice is dying. Inside the death of her memories and WHO she is is a very real death. When the memories, and herself are gone, all that will remain is a blob if biological mass that will need to be tended to. If there is any grace, apparently temporary glimpses of the person will be seen, only to dissapear and be gone again, for who knows how long. Hours? Days? Forever? Very scary to think about, and OH, so real to others!!!  I REALLY liked this book, and really wanted to share it.  I did suggest this book to my mother in law, and was very taken aback when she outwardly refused to read it. I'm not sure her reasoning, but since I wanted to learn more I'm glad I read it.   If ever I am faced with Alzheimer's, I'll have better understanding. It isn't curable, treatments rarely work, and it is probably the worst death a person could have. So, education about it is the utmost importance I believe. That is why I'd recommend this book to EVERYONE. The main thing we ALL have in common is age, and with age some us might become Alice.  And, although Alice aged just like everyone, surprizingly she was NOT OLD.  This is a disease almost always associated with the elderly. I was educated in that regard, again, I'm very glad I read this book.
031606792X|5.0|I'm astounded at the people making negative comments at the conclusion to this saga.  I hadn't heard of the books til the movie hype.  I saw the movie and began to read.  The writer creates a wonderland of fantasy in the real world.  The final book has amazing moments.  Sacrifice?  Bella preparing for Nessie and Jacob to escape as they believe they would die?  Alice and Jas abandoning(?) them all in their greatest need. The clumsy and awkward beauty (Bella) surprising everyone by adapting to the power and grace of vamp life and so worried about her dad and mom?  Her new family (and allies) banding together because it's the right thing to do?  All of this is sacrifice.  Comments about werewolves being really \\"shape shifters\\"?  They already said their change was \\"different\\" and not \\"bitten\\"..no conflict.<br />Favorite line?  When the battle looks impossible to escape and Edward hugs Jacob (!) and says \\"good by my brother - my son\\"...Wow.<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Meyers for a wonderful literary romp.  I'm aware that the audience has been (a large part) young people and I'm 66 and a man but I love your books, love your characters and love you for concluding the saga in this wonderful \\"Breaking Dawn\\".
B0007P0LO8|5.0|I am very familiar with the music of this opera but had never seen it performed until receiving this DVD.  Instead of being performed on a stage, it is done as a movie which makes it even more realistic.  It is truly beautiful.  It was 'filmed' in 1974 and Freni & Domingo are young & their voices AND acting are wonderful.

B0018CMJSU|4.0|I didn't originally have the Godfather trilogy on DVD, so I decided I would finally go out and buy it. Unfortunately, the DVD set was re-released as the \\"Coppola Restoration\\" and I could not go out and find the original DVD set released in 2001 (which by now is far cheaper than the new set). Purchasing the new gift set, I went home and with great anticipation opened the box set and admired the new packaging and montage of photos from all three films aligning the front cover to the back in a blood-splattered animation. Included was new slim DVD cases for each individual film, and brand spanking new special features along with the previous special features from the first gift set encompassing 2 discs. Part II which originally was spanning 2 discs on the fist set is now compressed to 1 disc, which I find rather nice than having to switch discs in between the movie. However, the picture quality is sub-standard. Too grainy!!!! It looks like Coppola copied the films from the VHS versions of the movies and tried to sell it off as a restoration. I don't see any real problem with the tangerine colorization other reviewers are complaining about, but I do notice that some whites do get blurry when shown. But it does nothing really to effect the eyes. I'm keeping the Restoration as my copy of the films since I currently don't own a Blu-Ray player. I'd recommended this version of the trilogy for those who have Blu-Ray and recommend the first gift set for those who own DVD (I'm sure that some stores still carry it or you can buy it online, maybe from Amazon :-P). I can see that this is evident that sooner and sooner we are going to have to start using Blu-Ray. Sucks, but true.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like this workout DVD because it doesn't take very long but you still get a good workout. I feel like I'm working hard the entire time. I also like the 3 levels of workouts - I can use this DVD much longer because as I conquer the first workout then I can start doing the next level up.   The only complaint I have is that Jilian swears once during the DVD. Other than that, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to work out but doesn't have a lot of time.
0545128285|4.0|This book takes no time to read but for those who loved the Harry Potter series, it's fun and gives us a bit more of Ms. Rowling's creative talent for story telling.  A great gift to all Potter fans!

0316776963|2.0|The first chapter of this book is very good.The later chapters like the vicars egg are good in parts .I must admitt I laughed out loud at times but as the book went on I found it less and less likely to be accurate . Having learnt various foreign languages  in difficult circumstances I found this chapter particularly unlikely .I finished the book as it is on my book club list but I was sorely tempted to give up two thirds of the way through .  I will sadly not be reading any more books by this author .

B001L7TDQ8|5.0|I should start by saying I really like Daniel Barenboim. Besides the fact that he is one of the great musical interpreters of our time, I also enjoy his outspokenness about music, life and politics.<br /><br />I should also admit up front that I'm not a typical Vienna Philharmonic new year's concert fan. I have a hard time getting excited at the Strauss waltzes and polkas, as I generally like longer works with more development and maybe a slow depressing bit in the middle. Strauss often seems a bit like Sacher cake -- a great dessert, but not a meal. However, I would agree wholeheartedly that the new year's concert is a perfect opportunity to pay Strauss his due once a year, and recognize that these great compositions deserve a special niche in the repertoire.<br /><br />Barenboim follows the new year's formula here, and he pulls off Strauss II with the best of them. The Strauss II selections are relatively varied and satisfying, and I appreciate that Barenboim included a kind of \\"mini-suite\\" from Zigeunerbaron, consisting of a back-to-back overture, Einzugs-Marsch and Schatz-Walzer, and giving at least some semblance of larger scope and context.<br /><br />His selection of non-Strauss-II pieces was also great, including \\"Music of the Spheres\\" by Josef Strauss, which has been performed at the new year's concert before. From Hellmesberger, there is a great performance of \\"Valse espagnol\\" -- perhaps not surprising that the Argentinian-born Barenboim brings a Spanish flavor into the Viennese concert.<br /><br />The real star attraction, however, was surely Haydn's Symphony No. 45 -- I only wish we could have had the whole thing and not just the 4th movement. Haydn was brought in as 2009 marks the 200th anniversary of his death, and will be marked by a flurry of concerts and events across Austria and neighboring countries.<br /><br />The \\"Farewell\\" symphony injected not only variety, but also real humor into the new year concert. The symphony gets its name from the fact that the musicians walk off one by one, leaving just two violins at the end, before they also finally get up and leave. This was a message from Haydn to his Eszterhazy boss at the time that it was time to end an unexpectedly long stay at the Hungarian summer residence and head back home to Eisenstadt. Barenboim and the VPO pull off the piece with great playing and humor. Barenboim acts sufficiently surprised as the orchestra members start walking off.

This was a message from Haydn to his Eszterhazy boss at the time that it was time to end an unexpectedly long stay at the Hungarian summer residence and head back home to Eisenstadt. Barenboim and the VPO pull off the piece with great playing and humor. Barenboim acts sufficiently surprised as the orchestra members start walking off. At the end, Barenboim cuts up with one of the remaining violinists and then continues conducting after the last have left the stage.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|This was the first ever movie I have watched in Blu-Ray and it did not disappoint.  You won't find some technical review from me here, but I will tell you about my experience.    I invited a friend over, who was a little skeptical about the whole Blu-Ray thing.  He just felt that it could not really be any better than an upconverted DVD on an HDTV.  So, we popped in Casino Royale, which I had read was a pretty good Blu-Ray release.  Just to give something to compare to, we watched a few minutes of something on Discovery Channel HD.  I think it was Dirty Jobs.  Anyway, then I started Casino Royale.  I was impressed with the picture and sound, but what would my skeptical friend think?  After about 5 minutes, my friend weighed in on his experience, \\"Ok, this is better than I thought.  I looks so clear!  Fine, Blu-Ray is better.\\"  And there you have it.  I was open to the new format and was impressed.  My friend was a skeptic and he was impressed.  Casino Royale is an exceptional port to Blu-Ray, so if you have a Blu-Ray player and you are a Bond fan, this is a must have!
B001E1GXPA|3.0|Not sure where to start. The Crusade was (and is) one of THE best metal albums of the decade. It blew me away. (And I've been a dedicated metalhead since the early 80's) I wasn't expecting anything less with Shogun. I was wrong.<br /><br />Here's a plea to all the guys, especially the singer, in the band: STOP LOWERING YOUR STANDARDS BY USING DEATH METAL \\"VOCALS\\" IN YOUR MUSIC! It's bizarre. One minute, you have this great voice and the next it's 180 degrees in the other direction and I feel like I'm listening to one of those lame, extreme death or grindcore bands. The music on this album is PHENOMENAL. They deserve kudos for taking it up several notches here. But, again, those vocals ruin just about every song on this album. There's no need for it and it takes songs that I'd rate 5 stars and makes them a 2 or 3.<br /><br />I'd even suggest re-doing this album with 100% REAL singing. you can do it, guys. You did it on the last album and you have the talent! Use it!!<br /><br />Anyway, if you can get past the 40% bad singing, this album is simple outstanding. I guess I can still recommend it, but hesitant to do so. They were *this* close to creating a masterpiece.....
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I received this DVD lightning fast!  It packed well and was delivered in perfect shape.  The movie was a lot of fun to watch and the blu-ray quality was breathtaking! I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action flicks or comic book based heros. It is one of my favorites!
B000A7DVRC|5.0|This is actually Jason's fiance Krystal we have the same card and I got this for him for xmas.  He has watched it at least 3 times a week since xmas.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Very good product. Exactly as described except it doesnt come with a charging cable. Great buy for a good deal.
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|My wife got this movie for the kids on Blu-Ray since we were looking for a good Christmas Story for the kids.  I hadn't seen Polar Express before, but most everyone I spoke to loved the movie.  So, in short, I liked the story.  It was good, but in my opinion, it could have been a little better.  Maybe it is all because so many people talked up this movie, my expectations were too high.  Either way, the kids loved the movie and ask to watch it just about every day.  Mission accomplished!    The Blu-Ray version is excellent.  Picture is great and the sound is awesome too.
0066620996|5.0|I was actually 'told' to read this book by a Managing Director of a company I interviewed with. He said that it outlined what he felt was central to his leadership philosophy. I did not get the job in the end but I remembered his recommendation.    I like the book for its evidence (though I believe two of the Good to Great companies have now fallen from grace) and its simplicity and the clarity of its concepts.    It is now a highly-recommended read that I publicize to my colleagues.  I have also designed a program to develop my fellow managers, using the interview with Charlie Rose as well as the free diagnostic tool and discussion guide found on Jim Collin's website.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|If you're here, then you probably already know/belive that Kill Bill Volumes 1 & 2 are awesome movies. If not, then they're great if you like the pulp-fiction style of storytelling with lots of over-the-top action.     This bundle is great for those that want to add this pair of movies to thier blu-ray collection at an amazingly affordable price. I've seen these movies being sold each for more than this bundle is.     If you like these movies & have a blu-ray player, this should be a no-brainer. GET IT!
1439102813|5.0|It has taken me a long time to write a review for \\"Still Alice\\" because I found it to be such a frightening and haunting novel.  \\"Still Alice\\" is the fictionalized account of a neuropsychological professor at Harvard who is faced with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in her mid-40's; it describes how she copes with her increasing mental deficits and lingers on the emotional support and betrayals she faces from family members.  What is most frightening about the book is that Alice could be any one of us.<br /><br />Not to give away the plot, but at one point, Alice thinks that she is putting into place a fail-safe system that will alert her to when her mental faculties have failed beyond a point which she considers acceptable (so that she can commit suicide by taking medication she has squirreled away)--of course, by the time she reaches that point, she can no longer remember how to access the information she needs to find the medication.  I was extremely surprised by which of her family members ended up supporting her and which found her disease too difficult to deal with (I would speak more about this but it would give away too much of the book).  My only quibble with the novel is that Alice ends up living a fairly pleasant and relatively happy, if limited, existence--something that is probably not true of the majority of Alzheimer's patients.<br /><br />However, this is a book that you should not miss reading, no matter what your age!  It had great meaning for me because I am just beginning to care for my mother who was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and it gave me a greater understanding of what she is going through.  However, it also frightened me out of my wits to think that this might be my future someday...but I suppose by the time it happens, I will no longer notice or care.<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK!!!
159102594X|5.0|It has been a long time since I have written a review.  I was writing them with every book I had read for a while, but it ended up that I was reading them so fast, that I just didn't have the time anymore and could not keep up.  Since that time of my last review I have read probably in the hundreds of books.  I have read many excellent ones from In the Name of the Wind, to the Mistborn trilogy, to the Locke La Morra novels, to the entire catalog from Raymond Feist.  Many excellent novels indeed.  But after reading this, I had to put my two cents in.    The Blade Itself is the first book of the First Law Trilogy by Joe Ambercombie.  I won't summarize it here, since that has been done many times.  But I will say that Joe Abercrombie is one of the best writers to emerge in many years, in fact, I would predict that he will go down as one of the best Fantasy writers of alltime.  Much has been said about his excellent character development.  He is a master of creating a believable character and bringing them to life.  One thing that is hard for any writer is making characters that are clearly different from one another.  Read any novel and you will see that most characters talk the same, and think the same, and act the same except on maybe the most superficial level.  But in the First Law books, Joe has created a most eclectic and interesting set of characters as Fantasy has ever seen.  The convention used by most fantasy writers to create different characters is usually to simply make them different races, thus they are superficially different, and they may use some different syntax but they aren't all that different.  Not so here.  These characters are all humans, but all different, unique and utterly real.    Abercrombie also succeeds in descrbing battle scenes as no other author I have ever read.  In so many Fantasy novels, the battles are joined and the actions described.  Emotions are only eluded to.  One would think in reading these novels that Joe Abercrombie himself has been in combat, and not just any combat, but combat with swords axes, and hands.  He succeeds in putting the reader right into the nightmare that must be hand to hand combat and ever so poignantly describes the emotions and thoughts that are occuring during the violence.  Abercrombie has a strong grasp of the Human psyche, the Human Condition, and understanding of the soul, and what feeds the soul.  His characters are imperfect, even abhorrent, but they have a soul, and they are yearning.  Abercrombie knows what it takes to become a good person, the struggles to overcome narcissism and Moral decripitude, he knows what matters in life, and how for Good to triumph over Evil, sometimes difficult choices must be made, but for all of that there is a cost to be paid.    Whether intentionally or not, I see so many parallels in his book between \\"real life\\" and the setting of the book.  Society's grown fat and happy, rampant complacency, an inability to distinguish good from bad, right from wrong.   For in the world, as in his books, there is a very real struggle against evil, but those that are willing to sacrifice everything to overcome evil are few and often villainized, where people have become so spoiled, and so petty, and so morally confused, they can't recognize the enemy, they can't understand it, they don't have what it takes to fight it.  At any rate, these books are great because of Abercrombie's characterization, because of the easily recognizable characters, because of the epic scope and applicable themes, and because he pays such a great attention to detail not only to battle scenes, but emotions and thoughts, and most of all its very Human soul.    Joe Abercrombie makes videos and documentaries for music in his day job.. but he has found his true calling in writing Novels.  This is what he was born to do.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Extremely gorgeous sceneries, I loved the artistic & intricate hidden connection to the storyline. Very strong acting, especially the innocent little girl played her character unbelievably good. I loved the costume designs for each different characters. The story was very well developed, with an interesting cinematographic approach.   As an art movie I enjoyed every moment of it. Brava!!!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Just as much fun on your home screen as it was in the theater.  Continues to give enjoyment over and over again.  As good as the Broadway production with much better scenery!
B001F290E4|5.0|Wow...I'd never have thought of Seal singing old school music, but he's got the perfect voice for those songs! Smooth, yet a little raspy, and very sexy. I've happily added Soul to my collection of favorite Seal CDs. My other favorites are Seal (1991), Seal (1994).
0316017922|2.0|First, let me start by saying that I admire Malcolm Gladwell. He is a talented and engaging writer, and he has found a formula that works: He picks an interesting topic and creates a readable, anecdotal book around it. However, I was onto him when I read \\"Blink\\" (or TRIED  to read it; I couldn't finish it) after I had read \\"Sources of Power\\" by Gary Klein. Both books deal with the way we make decisions based on our instincts, which is another word for the knowledge we accumulate. Mr. Klein's book is academic, well researched, filled with good examples and ultimately instructive. \\"Blink\\" is mostly fun and interesting. The difference between them is the same difference between a fine gourmet meal with quality ingredients and drinks and ribs with your friends at Houlihan's. Both are good experiences, but they serve different purposes.<br />Many of Mr Gladwell's examples are fascinating, such as how star hockey players tend to be born on a certain date or how an entire generation of lawyers schooled in hostile takeovers came from similar ethnic and economic bacgrounds. And his final chapter on his family's history and how the luck of the draw combined with seizing an opportunity gave them good lives. In the right hands, that chapter alone would make a fine mini-series on TV.<br />But in the end, \\"Outliers\\" is about serendipity. It does not teach the readers how to rise above their circumstances. In fact, I would suggest that the book can be divisive, as it makes successful people seem only lucky.<br />If you want a fun and entertaining read, full of anecdotes that you can use at your next cocktail party, then I heartily recommend \\"Outliers.\\" In the meantime, I will soon be checking Geoff Colvin's new book, \\"Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else.\\" He has been writing on the topic of success for some time in Fortune magazine, and I suspect his book will be much more insightful and useful.
B000BZISP8|5.0|After reading the reviews its become painfully clear that people who have given bad reviews expected too much from the movie. If your a fan of the comic book, then your probably not going to like the movie because rarely does movies based on comic characters live up to expectations. However I would ask that you watch the movie with no expectations. Its entertaining, and the actors have done a wonderful job. Special effects are also pretty good. The story line is pretty much easy to follow unless while the movie was playing you decided to not pay attention for some reason.    Keanu Reeves has played the role well.He comes of with a I dont care attitude which is probably what you would expect if the Devil wanted you, God locked you out of Heaven, every demon from hell to earth wanted your head and your terminally ill with not much time left.    Rachel Weiz has also done a good job with her role. Another reason why people may not like the movie is the fallen angel theme but this is not the first time that this has been done.    Overall its a great movie to watch, extremely enjoyable and all I would advice is to watch it without any preconceived notion of what to expect.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This is unbelievably great.  Better and better on each viewing.  WALL-E should be the NEW ET.  Critics have been loving it but the populace needs to get more onboard with how great this movie is.  Well worth the price.  Get this now.
B00004YA66|5.0|This was a great movie. I recomend this to anyone who has not seen this movie yet. This quite easily one of Denis Quaid's best movies. It had a good combination of action, suspence, and Drama. Its starts off as kind of a Sci-fi thriller but it turns out to be so much more. It is a must see film.
B00000IZOR|5.0|My daughter has played with this phone for over two years!  Every time I try to give it away, she starts dragging it around the house again. For her, it is used mostly as a pull toy, but she has also made many calls to Grandma.  Yes the phone cord is short (for safety reasons) but she'll carry on five-minute conversations with the whole phone dangling from her ear. Countless toys have passed through this house, but this phone is still a favorite!
B000002MM8|5.0|Heard this music playing at a Bang and Olufsen store in Pasadena. It was unusual, but I was intrigued. I now love it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout.  I have been doing the same workout for 3 years.  I did this workout and was amazed about the number of muscles that my previous workout did not touch (ouch).
B000SFJWLU|1.0|this band is so un original and it just bugs me that they have become so huge like they are the answer to \\"pure metal\\"...I mean, the lyrics are too whiny and un intelligent for being so called \\"tough\\", and almost all the music is at least ripping some one off.  I don't like dissing other artists but, I'm basically trying to tell people that 5fdp is not the answer to metal, not at all.  Sorry guys, you lost the f*ckin' war! HAHA!
B00168OINK|5.0|I love this movie, its looks great in blu-ray. Very Fast Shipping to Puerto Rico!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|What may be most surprising about DEATH MAGNETIC is the fact that it didn't manage to garner an album of the year nomination when the 2008 Grammy nominees were announced. Maybe that was due in part to the overwrought dynamics that fans have been quick to chide.  Honestly, they didn't bother me, but I'll admit DEATH MAGNETIC is pretty loud. But then again, it's metal! Aside from The Mars Volta and maybe Slipknot, DEATH MAGNETIC is clearly the year's \\"summa cum laude\\" metal album. Loud or not, who cares when Metallica are shedding sick guitar riffs, strong vocals, and sheer awesomeness.  DEATH MAGNETIC is a bit lengthy at nearly 80 minutes, but at least it's a \\"good\\" lengthy with some of the sickest guitars solos heard in years. Who can complain?<br /><br />The album opens with the great five-star performance \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" in which Metallica nearly pulverizes their instruments with so much sheer energy (well depending on how much of that is that infamous dynamic compression...). Honestly, I think there is sheer passion being heard on \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", no matter how overwrought the dynamics/distortion is. Another five-star performance passes with the killer \\"The End of The Line\\" which finds Metallica sounding tighter than ever. The songwriting is \\"in the pocket\\", the guitar riffs are amazing, vocals are top-rate, and the solos are phenomenal. The breaks from the verse and vamps also add the the overall grand effect of \\"The End of The Line\\". The refrain may even been sicker than \\"That Was Just Your Life's\\", making it among the best of DEATH MAGNETIC. A+ in all facets.<br /><br />\\"Broken, Beaten & Scarred\\" again keeps up a hot streak for the band, this time a four-star performance (maybe four-and-a-half) as opposed to a five-star. Keeping in the same key, literally, the band continues to produce jagged metal riffs only authenticated by none other than Metallica themselves. If it seemed those five-star performances were finished for Hetfield, then came perhaps the definitive track from DEATH MAGNETIC, \\"The Day That Never Comes\\". It is still very much a hard-rock/metal number, but there is more of an overt musicianship to it that may not always be present through the most \\"abrasive\\", emotion-driven tracks of DEATH MAGNETIC. Honestly, I think it is a gem - people will remember this song, mark my words.<br /><br />\\"All Nightmare Long\\" plays as well as anything else, sitting pretty as a four-star performance from the metal-heads. Again, the standard jagged guitar riffs make you want to get up and \\"get your air guitar going\\" along with Metallica. Another extended introduction intact, \\"All Nightmare Long\\" must've been a 'nightmare' to have put together as tightly and as naturally as the band does. The vocals are covered by excessive guitar riffs, but who cares what's being said? IT'S METAL!!! It's supposed to be jagged, edgy, liberal, and well METAL!!!<br /><br />\\"Cyanide\\" embodies it's title with signature nasty sounding guitar work.  The bass would be well at home on any urban song as it is thick and provides ample foundation to the guitars.  The cymbal keeps the driving groove here on yet another track that seems like it should \\"damn you to hell\\".  It doesn't of course, but you know.  Again, a series of meter changes, tempo fluctuations, and overt metal machismo drive you (the listener) to rock out. I mean, how can you help it when one music's greatest bands are at their strongest with their first album in years?<br /><br />\\"The Unforgiven III\\" surprises us all by beginning with piano and strings. It is lush at the forefront as opposed to launching \\"arrows straight for the heart\\". Of course that changes once guitars and bass enter on what begins as an ostinato rhythm and evolves into more as drums enter and the duration of over a minute passes by.  Vocals enter once again, masked by the instruments, clearly the biggest, most overt flaw of DEATH MAGNETIC.  \\"The Unforgiven III\\" is another four-star performance, if ashade cooler in enjoyability than some of the best of DEATH MAGNETIC.<br /><br />\\"The Judas Kiss\\" makes up for any tameness given off from \\"The Unforgiven III\\".  Like most of the other tracks, it is another solid, consistent performance, even if it doesn't steal the thunder of the album's best. Clocking in at 8:01, it the second lengthiest number only to \\"Suicide & Redemption\\", which clocks in just shy of 10 minutes.  With tracks the length of the tracks from DEATH MAGNETIC, it is now surprise that there are only ten tracks.  If nothing else, \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" features one of the most alluring introductions of any of the tracks from DEATH MAGNETIC. The bass line is incredibly pronounced and a bright spot here, more so than many of the other tracks. After \\"Unforgiven III\\" and \\"Judas Kiss\\", the instrumental \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" with all of its musical twists is welcome listen. Not necessarily another five-star performance, maybe a strong candidate for four-and-a-half stars though!!!<br /><br />DEATH MAGNETIC comes to a close with \\"My Apocalypse\\", another 'drive it straight through the heart' sort of track.  Ending nearly as strong as the album began, DEATH MAGNETIC closes with a bang.  Again, vocals are almost always indecipherable, riffs are sick, cymbal is over abundant, and the only dynamic marking is fortississimo (yes, it's really a word, Italian for very, very loud).  With that ladies and gentlemen, we have one killer metal album. Great music, overwrought dynamics, indecipherable vocals, one really long instrumental track, the word \\"death\\", and there you have it.  If you want one sick ride, buy DEATH MAGNETIC if you haven't already. 4 stars!!!ome of the best of DEATH MAGNETIC.     \\"The Judas Kiss\\" makes up for any tameness given off from \\"The Unforgiven III\\".

B000Q67876|5.0|One of the few films that can be put in the \\"All Time Greats\\" category. An emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish and well worth watching again on blue-ray.
B000UJ24SC|5.0|I can't get enough of this album, even right now!  Everything about it is heavy! Call them metalcore, call them mellow death metal whatever! It's great effin' Metal to me! The guitarists Rip, Shannon's drums are intense and I love the vocals, and well written lyrics!  The album title fits , one dark and heavy album, so get on the horse and grab Nocturnal if you haven't yet!
B000Q66PXE|5.0|I always held back from buying these sets from BestBuy or Target because they were so expensive (over $60 each, sometimes even more !)So when I saw them both for $45 I couldn't put my order in fast enough!..Both very cool seasons from a show that ended too soon in my opinion,but I can always count on HBO to come with another great show-thanks Amazon !
B001F0VHEM|4.0|Propelled by the single of her career, \\"So What\\", FUNHOUSE was destined to complete the resurgence of one of pop/rock's savviest starlets, P!nk.  For years P!nk struggled to keep up with the other pop artists such as Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears. Now, the tables seemed to have turned.  When I'M NOT DEAD began as yet another brilliant, yet underrated Pink album, it seems like everyone but fans and objective critics had forgotten about Pink.  However even after a strong single like \\"Stupid Girls\\" failed to give Pink the momentum necessary for a gold/platinum album, one of the lesser, yet catchier tracks of I'M NOT DEAD resurrected Pink from music industry death (\\"U + Ur Hand\\").  After a lengthy stay on the album chart and a platinum I'M NOT DEAD as a result, FUNHOUSE, the less enjoyable album of the two builds upon the commercial and critical success of I'M NOT DEAD.<br /><br />The album opens with valedictory #1 hit \\"So What\\", which just may be the smartest move of FUNHOUSE.  Here Pink essentially copies the best qualities of \\"Stupid Girls\\" and \\"U + Ur Hand\\" and makes one sick, inescapable pop song. It's commercial yet a gem at the same time which makes for that sometimes once-in-a-lifetime song. It give Pink another Grammy-nominated performance under her belt, even if the competition is incredibly stiff (Adele's \\"Chasing Pavements\\", Leona Lewis's \\"Bleeding Love\\"...)<br /><br />Second track, also second single will be more a gem for those who are sick of \\"So What\\".  \\"Sober\\" is equally as good as \\"So What\\", if in a different sort of way.  It rejects the overt \\"poppy\\" leanings of its predecessor in favor of a darker, more rock-infused sound.  The production is darker and Pink's growl grows even more sour (in a good way of course). It is a personal favorite.  \\"I Don't Believe You\\" is good too, though the weakest between \\"So What\\" and \\"Sober\\".  It is a bit of a reliever after the manic, though great energy of both it's predecessors.  On the flipside, it is a bit more boring and flat compared to either \\"So What\\" or \\"Sober\\".  Again, it is solid and ultimately a strong listen with its acoustic guitar and strings.  It leans more towards the adult contemporary vein as opposed to hard rock. But, I think any country artists would feel at home covering this 'songwriter's track'.<br /><br />\\"One Foot Wrong\\" has a fine chord progression going in it's favor. Pink's voice during the first portion of the first verse is slightly out of tune (purposefully I believe), but it adds a certain endearing quality to this number.  Overall Pink sounds as good as ever and the production has enough rock, pop, and urban to have great crossover potential. Don't get me rock, Pink is STILL a rock star - but \\"One Foot Wrong\\" is a catchy pop tune, raspy vocals or not. And the synthesizer line and synthesized brass make it an urban producer's masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" has a lighter pop/rock feel, something that Pink is truly a pro at. It lays well as a track and keeps up the overall strong momentum of FUNHOUSE. \\"Bad Influence\\" continues to accentuate Pink's strengths, even if it doesn't capitalize perfectly on the strengths of monster track \\"So What\\". Pink sounds on fire and \\"Bad Influence\\" should please rockers as well as pop-tarts everywhere.<br /><br />\\"Funhouse\\" doesn't fall anywhere near title track symptom in which the title track \\"sucks\\" to be blunt, but it also isn't necessarily the best of FUNHOUSE. With that said, \\"Funhouse\\" is enjoyable, easy to listen to, and would make a good single. It is restrained compared to Pink's most overt performances (vocally), but it suits her and radio well.  It is pretty addictive; since I heard it on The Early Show I've been obsessed with it, even though both singles are much better.  But, of course Pink on the Early Show had to censor the part where she's \\"gonna burn this f**ker down\\"... Oh well.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Ball\\" is tame compared to the rowdiest numbers, though Pink sounds great. In the songwriting sense, \\"Crystal Ball\\" is among the valedictory songwriting performances of FUNHOUSE.  In the sense of sheer enjoyment, it ranks lower. \\"Mean\\" makes up for any losses garnered after \\"Crystal Ball\\" making for another engaging performance.  The production is great and the progression is too! Great hook, convincing vocal performance, fine songwriting.  Period.  \\"It's All Your Fault\\" feels second rate to the other high energy numbers, though it is still average at the least.  \\"Ave Mary A\\" features more great production work, as well as more vulgarity from Alecia Moore (aka Pink).  Again, second rate compared to the best, but average.  Concluding track \\"Glitter In The Air\\" lightens up after Pink pushes it to the limit on both \\"It's All Your Fault\\" and \\"Ave Mary A\\".  It is another singer-songwriter track and may not appeal as much as the high energy numbers.  The songwriting is strong here and with that being Pink's intention, it works well.  Modest maybe, but a nice way to close and overall good album.<br /><br />Essentially, FUNHOUSE does pale a bit in comparison to I'M NOT DEAD, but overall Pink is on her \\"A-game\\".  A few misses and flaws never broke down a good album - at least that is how I look at it! Not perfect, but every bit worth $10 to purchase, right? 3 ½ Stars, easily.rystal Ball\\" is among the valedictory songwriting performances of FUNHOUSE.

1592533868|5.0|I've been quilling for a few months and was totally bored with all the little cutsie patterns and projects and didn't want to get into quilling marriage documents or birth anouncements. Everything I saw was based on the idea that you were a beginner who wasn't really interested in this craft until I found this book. The author is amazing! She is without a doubt the finest quiller I have ever seen. Her work has inspired me to expand on my own with new ideas and techniques. Her projects take you step by step through each section in clear and easy to understand directions to a finished piece that you wouldn't mind giving as a gift or framing for your own wall. There is a gallery of quilling in the back of the book that shows pieces I would never have believed were made from paper except that now I know how to do them myself from reading her book. I am working on a project now that uses 6 new techniques that I have never found in any other quilling book. It's a three demensional flower arrangement of my own design and every time I look at it I am amazed that I am the one who created it. Quilling is fun again! This book showed me that I have only just scratched the surface of this amazing craft. Thank you Claire Sun-ok Choi for taking the time to share your knowledge.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I had to pre-order this movie plus it was a good price for blu-ray price.  It has so many features and a digital copy which is awesome too.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have not seen every WWII documentary, but I have seen none better. The only reasonable way to tackle a subject of such scope is by making several mini movies, which they have done. Olivier's superb naration ties them together, and the footage chosen is first rate, with minimal but worthwhile survivor interviews. The Pacific war gets its due, as do other minor theaters.     The German & Japanese stories are told from the inside. The evil is not glossed over, but there is a humility that the tragedies were human failings, not ethnic ones.    Battles, politics, everyday life--horror and hindsight, it's all here.
B0000630BT|3.0|1983's \\"Point of Entry\\" was the last ggreat album for Priest (and easliy their best), it was a slightly Eastern-tinged album but with the classic elements of Priest's early albums. However, after that it's just been downhill. And since then it's been Downhill. [[ASIN:B0000630DK Turbo]] was a train wreck. It was their attempt at going Hair Metal, and had so many embarassing songs like \\"Hot For Love\\" and \\"Turbo Lover\\". [[ASIN:B0000630BW Ram It Down]] was even worse, they replaced the world's most boring drummer (Dave Holland) with a drumming machine. YES! Drumming Machine!<br /><br />1990 was when Halford had demanded a heavier direction, and so they did with \\"Painkiller\\". Many fans have declared this a fantastic effort but I beg to differ- Musically it's a great album. There's lots of shredding solos, amazing riffs, and the new drummer POUNDS the living hell out of those drums! And Halford's vocals are spectacular here- his vocals usually are just good and nothing else (why do people say he's better than Dickinson? He's nowhere near as good as Dickinson!), but here he's fantastic.<br /><br />That said, as much as I like to praise this album- the lyrics are downright terrible. Honestly. What happened to their sense of humor like \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" off of Defenders of the Faith (which wasn't a good album but OK)? These guys' lyrics have declined. I would usually throw the album into the trash upon hearing \\"Faster than a laser bullet\\", but the music is really good, so it gets a bonus there. And \\"Night Crawler\\"- that song mae me want to bash my head in. I always laugh out loud when I hear the \\"WHILE IT FEASTS ON FLESH AND BLOOD!!!!!!!!!\\", and my friends laughed so hard when I showed them that bit.<br /><br />Look, this is a great album musically- if not their strongest effort musically. But it's a shame the lyrics are a real dud. I guess I expected too much, but whatever.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|This is a true classic, great drama, wonderful acting, incredible sets, locations and wardrobe.  The chemistry in this movie between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is great. This is a love story but with enough action and adventure to keep the guys watching too...a great date movie.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I thought having the CD was sufficient but like Madonna Confessions tour<br />I bought them both at the same time.<br />I was glad I did.<br />The choreography is wonderful.<br />The Farewell Tour DVD has plenty of other entertainment, too.<br />This will make you happy if you beware of the language.
B001GZ6QBU|3.0|I finally watched this video the other night. It starts out very slow but then takes off with a 'shot'.  It is a very 'dark' movie as all have said before me, but not it's too awfully dark emotionally as I had anticipated.  It is shot in a dark cinema mode for affect.  I liked the movie, though, I could not help thinking about the demise of Heath Ledger and was overcome with thoughts of his daughter who will never know him.  His perfomance was good! Christian Bale and Gary Oldman, who have been overlooked, also gave good perfomances for this genre,but due to the controversy surrounding Mr. Ledger's death they have been overlooked, but that's just my opinion.  I pray for Mr. Ledger'sfamily.  I also pray that in time his last performance as an actor will not be over shadowed by his death.   This is a definate See It!
B001GQACGO|5.0|Album was great. I am really enjoying it. My order came in a couple of days
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This is Great!! I can't add to the other reviews.  If you like the previous BATMAN movie, you have to buy this.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|I loved this movie so much!  I only wish it had more dinosaurs throughout the movie instead of just 2 times. Love the movie so much that I watched it 2 times in 2 days, and plan to watch it over and over.  Great story plot and keeps you watching throughout the whole movie. Highly recommend!!!
B001F12J0C|5.0|I knew that I wanted this movie series simply because I loved the movies when I initially viewed them. Well, I got 3 movies for a great price which adds to my viewing pleasure.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Rush just keep getting better. They can play circles around any other band out there.     Rush continue to set the standard.
B001F12J3Y|3.0|If you have never seen Polar Express in 3-D at an IMAX screen, you will probably enjoy the blu-ray 3-D version.  But if you have seen the IMAX 3-D version, then you will be disappointed in the blu-ray version as the technology for the 3-D effect is not nearly as well developed.  At times, you just see 2 separate pictures through each eye that do not blend together for a 3-D effect.  Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a terrible 3-D version.  It just does not come close to the IMAX 3-D version.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|I personally did not like this movie at all, but my boyfriend loved it and I know a ton of people love it so much, that it just won many awards at the People Choice Awards 2009, and one of them including \\"best movie\\".  I watched about an hour of it and couldn't watch it anymore cause I didn't like it and didn't seem interesting.  A lot of parts in it you can tell are super fake.  However, Heath Ledger did an amazing job in this movie.  That is the only thing I like about this movie.  Sorry.  From me to you, I would probably get it since most people love the movie, but I just didn't like it for some reason.  And I love most movies like this, yet I never have liked ANY batman movies ever.  You make the decision. If you like prior batmans, then you will like it, but if not, then dont waste your time, unless you want to see how Heath Ledger plays an absolutely crazy part in it.
B000001ZS8|4.0|One of the pioneering releases which introduced samplers to a wider public. I was only about 16 at the time and I remember at first hating and then growing to love this album. Interestingly it is the non-sampled elements of this music which sound the most dated today while many of the sampled sounds still sound quite fresh.  One thing I've noticed is that many children LOVE \\"Blah Blah Cafe\\" (2nd to last track). Put it on the stereo at a birthday party full of 5-year olds and watch them go wild!
B001FBIPF0|5.0|If you are a Fallout Boy fan, this CD is a must! My 13 year-old daughter is a Fallout Boy fanatic and she has not stopped listening to this CD from beginning to end since I got it for her. What more can I say? I am in my forties and although Fallout Boy is not a band that I would even know about, I really enjoy listening to it with my daughter and she is happy that her \\"out-dated\\" mother actually knows who Fallout Boy is.
0070511136|4.0|Being a Sales Executive with a Major Fortune 500 company, I have found the S-P-I-N selling methods promulgated by Neil Rackham to be invaluable. Prior to reading, I expected something different based on the title of the book alone.<br /><br />As Rackham explains: S stands for SITUATION, P is for PROBLEM, I is for IMPLICATION and N stands for NEEDS-PAYOFF. With that said, Neil outlines strategies, techniques and questions that will help an average sales person become more potent when it comes to outselling your competition.<br /><br />This book is a must read for those engaged in major (big ticket, multiple system) sales who want to WIN!
B00003652R|5.0|I'd known Marillion for years and I was very glad to be able to get hold of this cd.
0525950079|2.0|Having enjoyed other Follett books,especially Pillars of the Earth, I was eager to read World Without End.  I am disappointed.  Follett's character's seemed implausible, especially for the 14th century.  Caris, supposedly an intelligent, forward thinking woman, was unable to apply her intelligence in respect to Merthin.  She refused marriage, not wanting to become a slave to a husband, yet she recognized that Merthin was not the typical male and would be unlikely to condescend to his wife.  The situation resembled a soap opera where characters, in spite of contrary evidence, always make wrong decisions.  The characters were flat and uninspiring.    Follett, over using \\"cut and paste,\\" becomes tedious and repetitive.  Finding a description he likes he uses it over and over.  Similarly, he reminds the reader of what they have already read.  Did he think the reader would put the book down and return to it later having forgotten?  More likely, much time had passed between his writing sessions and he needed to remind himselp.      Follett seemed obsessed with sex: straight sex, homosexual sex, and rape.  I hoped to learn more about the time period but there was little of historical interest.  I really feel Follett wrote a 21st century novel.  He is feminist--there were few men of character but several strong women.  In fact, most men were stupid, weak, corrupt, or devious.  I don't doubt these characters existed during the period but I doubt it was so lopsided as to gender.  His heroes are open-minded in a modern way.  I hardly think such thought existed during this period.  Good characters are too pure and bad characters are too evil. What a waste of 900+ pages.

B00000D9TQ|5.0|One of the truly great hit albums - what can I say?  Excellent.      Tim
0545128285|5.0|I thought the book was a neat little follow up to Harry Potter. I purchased it for my grandson for Christmas as well. It arrived in plenty of time for me to send it to him.
0375826726|2.0|Thin on plot, thin on characterization, thin on imagination. It's one heck of a thick book, though.    Seriously, whoever talked him into adding another volume clearly was only thinking of the bux. If he does this again I'm dropping out.    Even my 9-year-old finds it boring.
B001KMB6YG|1.0|I know by know that I should not get to excited about a movie from the trailers. I like Vin Deisel when it comes to action. Complete dissapiontment. Action, she can fight? Ending, what ending? Ok, so if you think that this review is incoherent and disjointed you are right. I decided to write a review that reflects the movie (in my opinion) instead of pointing out its many flaws. My head hurt at the end.
B00168HARG|5.0|I suppose alot of people don't like this show because its kind of unnecessary. Frankly, I don't see it like that. I see it like this: This is probably one of the coolest stories ever written and the more we see of it, the better it gets. This is just a thought but in order for the idea to work, that is, the idea that John Connor will save hummanity, he would have to be really tough and understand not only how terminators think, but how they work, where they operate, and most importantly when they will strike. It makes sense to me that he have all of these experiences because it prepare him for what lies ahead.
0143038583|4.0|I've recommended this book to my friends, meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans, and those who are into the \\"organic\\" food craze. I'm a meat-eater myself, and the best thing I was able to relate to them was that, in most cases, \\"organic\\" still means processed and industrialized. Even \\"free-range\\" chickens aren't treated any better than other industrial chickens. And from what I've gathered, those who eat \\"meat/protein substitutes\\" are filling their bodies with more processed products than a good hearty steak.
B001GKYBXA|3.0|nice album for mccartney fans-some of the usual good McCartneylike songs, plus some harder-edged songs as well

B0015AARJI|5.0|This product is great and cheap when its only for $40.00 + free shipping.  Great product to buy from amazon. You can't go wrong!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I love this movie it remind me of my childhood, awsome movie to watch with your children.
B001HDYK6Y|5.0|Over the last 12+ years there has been a disturbing lack of music with any depth. Most albums released over this period either have a nagging sound of whinny dragged out lyrics or they sound like the same uninspired boring emo noise. This has been true across almost every genre of modern music. Luckily there are a small handful of exceptions but 90 percent of the albums released fit this mold.<br /><br />Perfect Symmetry by Keane is the perfect example of what an album in 2008/2009 should sound like. It has many of the elements of the sounds of the great 1980's while still sounding perfectly fresh and up to date. Great depth in their writing and song development with strong synth-pop elements. Unlike most albums of 2008/2009 that bore your ears after a few listens Perfect Symmetry seams to have additional depth each time I play it.<br /><br />Some have knocked this album because it differs from previous Keane releases but to my ear it simply sounds like they have found their full potential in Perfect Symmetry. There is much to be enjoyed in Keane's previous albums but this is their best album to date! Easily 5 stars.

0895260131|5.0|The bottom line is that muslims will never stop in their efforts to take over the world....to spread sharia and muslim rule. This book takes factual quotes directly from the Koran...and puts it in the face of all the self hating liberals who keep spreading the line about how islam is a peaceful religion, which it is NOT. \\"Jihad\\" is every muslims duty according to the koran. The koran says of non muslims--\\" if you meet them in battle--smite their necks and bind them tighly\\"...which they sure did in Iraq (daniel pearl and others)   Europe is being taken over from the inside, the united states will follow. the only way to stop them is to WAKE UP and stop taking it. we dont have to take it. This book also goes into why the crusades happened and says it was defensive , to stop the muslims from spreading all over europe and the byzantine empire.i wish the section on the crusades went a little deeper and was a bit longer. It seems to me the crusaders were heroes who saved the west from islam (at least temporarily)....just like the Spartans at thermopylae in ~490BC saved greece and europe from the persians. Unfortunately the Spartans and the Crusaders would be very dissapointed with the way the liberals and ignorant McDonald eating joe sixpacks are just GIVING away the world to the muslims.   also read \\"Gates of fire\\" by Steven Pressfield , \\"The Looming tower\\" by lawrence Wright, \\"Ghost wars\\" by steve Coll, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" by mark Bowden ----and  other books too... email me at paul1060@aol.com.  -----Remember Gary Gordon and Randy Shugart , Medal of Honor recipients------
B00005RHGL|5.0|I have to say that I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters back in the '90's and it was awesome!  I since have owned it on Laser Disc, and both DVD versions.  The Vista Series is so far the best and I can't wait to ad the Blu-Ray version to my other three.  Although I don't have the other DVD offering any longer I still have the Laser Disc.  I just can't seem to part with my LD collection.  They're so nostalgic!<br /><br />As noted by all others Val Kilmer steals the show, but Kurt Russell and Sam Elliot are all great in this movie.  Buy it!  If you've never seen this movie, you'll love all the great scenes and one liners.  Now that I've got myself all jazzed up on this movie I'll have to go take it off the shelf and watch it tonight!
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell is a genius!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This is the best movie in my opionion,of the Batman movies.  Heath Ledger's role as Joker was superb.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|This is the best remastered copy of the Sci-Fi classic that I have seen. The blue ray version is worth every penny, the details come through and have surprised me many times. The Five Disc are nicely done with multiple different versions of the film.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|My 8 year old son recently got into Star Wars.  I originally bought him the Trilogy, and his collection has grown since then.  He really likes this animated movie, even though he doesn't really watch any other animated movies.
B001CSS4V6|5.0|Great movie and beautiful picture. I would recommend this movie to every American family. This is a good movie to add to your movie collection.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Fortunately for Mel Gibson, he and McGoohan weren't in any scenes together.  Gibson is a good actor, but the reclusive Mr. McGoohan would have upstaged him easily without meaning to.  He was malevolence personified as Edward I.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|My husband and son have seen all of the Rocky movies more than once, and yet they still continue to watch them.  It's a great collection!
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I Purchased the Movie for my 7 year old daughter for christmas. She saw it at the theater when it came out and just fall in love with it. The movie is so well made, the whole Family loved it. It is very funny and filled with some fighting action (kid friendly). I recommend this Movie to every family with Kids or no Kids. My family gives that movie a A+++ rating.
0780628551|5.0|I am a Johnny fan, but not all his movies thrill me. This one left me guessing at first and I thought was a pretty decent sci fi movie. The ending could have been a tad better. The love scene was just plain hot and any Depp fan would be thrilled to watch the movie just for that.  I thought the acting was decent, but I can see where this movie is a love em or hate em type. I guess I am a love em, as I have watched it more than once.
B000WCDI64|5.0|This is another great gift for anyone who loves great singers and songwriters. Very original and fresh.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie -- I had never seen the musical...actually, I'm not a big fan of musicals as a rule (except for film version of \\"Grease\\")...so I was pleasantly surprised to find myself smiling and dancing in my seat throughout the entire film. Talk about a feel-good movie! I wanted to be a member of the cast dancing alongside Meryl -- oh  and Meryl, what a VOICE! Is there anything this woman can't do?! I have long admired her as an exceptional actress, but her choice to do this film raises my admiration even more, because it shows she knows how to have fun! And that's how I would sum up this movie: FUN! I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film to someone who doesn't like ABBA, but even if you only like a few of their songs you might be surprised to find yourself bopping along to ALL of the music!
B0018RWD1S|5.0|This cd was a Christmas present for my mother who is 68yrs old. I am in my 40's and love Amy Winehouse just as much as my mom. I found out about Amy from a co-worker who is also about my mothers age. I bring this up because Amy Winehouse who is in her early 20's is such a great talent. She is amazing...reaching all age groups. Great Buy.
0312383320|4.0|This one had me laughing from the first page. The between the numbers books usually have some magical element to them and Diesel is back in Stephanie's life with some paranormal mischief in the form of a vampire(?). Bob the dog doesn't really make an appearance here, but you do get Carl the Monkey. Idon't think you will be disappointed in this one.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I loved this movie, than again I have yet to see a PIXAR movie I have not loved.  From the first teaser images a year before the movie opened I was interested and bless their little digital souls PIXAR delivered a movie that was near perfect.    The film was so good I did not mind the heavy handed environmental message,the character of WALL- E was just so charming that the lefty message did not distract from a very enjoyable film.
0545128285|4.0|A must have for any Harry Potter fan, and a good addition to the series.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|OK, just in case you haven't seen this movie or heard anything about it, here's a quick intro to the storyline (no spoilers):<br /><br />Earth has become so polluted that people evacuated to luxurious space cruise liners.  In the meantime, back on earth, trash-compacting robots work to collect trash and stack it in an effort to clean up the mess left by the now gone overconsuming population of humans.  When the movie opens, Wall-E appears to be the last functioning robot.  He's been doing his job for a long, long time, and in that time he developed a personality as he watches a tape of the muscial \\"Hello Dolly\\" over and over again.<br /><br />Then, things get tense when a mysterious spaceship lands...<br /><br />Interestingly, the good folks at Pixar put together a storyline that includes character AND plot development without relying, for the most part, on dialog.<br /><br />By the way, my favorite parts of hte movie are the roach, and the scene when you hear music from \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (just watch, and you'll see).<br /><br />I believe that some people may find this movie to be too \\"Pollyanna\\", but let's face it, this is one of those rare high-quality movies produced mainly for children.  While it does have an appeal for more mature audiences, it's main target audience is children.  I appreaciate the fact that there are no wise-cracking or crude characters like those in movies like Shrek, etc. (animated movies that use animation, but are not really made for children).<br /><br />I appreciate the work of Pixar in applying their trade to a fun and engaging show that can be enjoyed without reservation by children and adults alike.<br /><br />Afterthought:<br />When I started writing this review I considered awarding this product 3 or perhaps 4 stars, but once I started writing, thinking about my experience and the experience of my family wtih this movie it wasn't long before I realized that it truly deserved 5 stars.  With that being said, I want you to know that I do not award 5 stars to everything...something has to be truly good (in my opinion) to warrant a 5-star rating.<br /><br />Thanks Pixar!  5-stars!as to be truly good (in my opinion) to warrant a 5-star rating.    Thanks Pixar!  5-stars!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD! The camera shots of the landscapes and wildlife are just unbelievable. My kids and wife loved it too! Planet Earth is a very educational and informative series. You will not be disappointed!
0312360266|5.0|A great book comes from the desire and hardcore drive of the writer. Marked is the first book in the House of Night series by P.C. and Kristen Cast and it had me captivated by the very first chapter.  I found myself with the un controllable urge to know what happens next.  Zoey is a 16 year old girl struggling with her relationship with her mother and \\"step loser\\" (step dad).  When Zoey becomes \\"marked\\", meaning she will have to enter the House Of Night as a fledgling or die, her world tumbles upside down. Her best friend all of sudden seems afraid of her and her mother thinks its Zoey's fault she has been marked.  Once Zoey enters the House of Night she learns new and amazing things about herself and the others around her. Marked will have you asking for more and is a definite must by. I would recommend this book for mature teens and older due to the sexual content. By far one of the best vampire novels I have read thus far.
B001A3EM8M|3.0|It's hard not be influenced by Dylan. Harrison, Petty and Lynne certainly have been. That's not necessarily a fault, but how many Bobs do we need in one band? The three have been vocally flexible over the length of their careers, but around  Bob, they become Bob. Orbison's death was a big loss for the TW's, both as the supreme singer that Roy was, and as the only member who obviously had no trace of Bob in his  sound. I've heard Lynne do a great Roy. Perhaps he felt it wasn't right to do here and perhaps he's right, but more vocal variety among these four would make this a much better performance.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Before Wall-E left the Earth for Eve, the movie is heavenly brilliant. The the deserted city, the lonely tone highlighted by the old VHS movie, the stuff that Wall-E kept (\\"He\\" threw away the diamond ring and kept the box), the orbit full of deserted satelites and simply all the nitty-gritties point to just one thing: The whole crew is so devoted to make it perfect. IMHO, they did it. However, the drastic change in style and mood afterwards is just too odd. Many people like the romance in space. I dont. The shift of focus from Wall-E to Eve, Auto and the Captain had made the movie much less interesting. The weak fight againt Auto for a return to Earth is far from thrilling. No matter what, a great try of Pixar to create something out of its box. Definitely Wall-E will be a classic character. The movie itself may not.
B001F12J48|3.0|The package comes with two disks, a regular widescreen version and the 3-D version.  The widescreen version worked very well and was enjoyable.  When viewing the 3-D version on a 46 inch HD TV it was very difficult to see from a distance of 9 feet.  When moving out of the room and at a distance of about 20 feet it became easier to view and looked correct, altho very dim.  Unless you have this kind of space to work with, I wouldn't recommend the product.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This was a great value. The price was great compared to stores that I shopped around in. Even as an online value I got a great deal. The movie is fantastic!
B000002UTY|5.0|This album is the epitome of the bay area sound to me. I never got to go to the Avalon or Fillmore, but i've seen many live bay area band acts and this is the best with maybe Live/ Dead being the exception.

031606792X|5.0|I personally don't know why everyone was freaking out about Renesmee. Honestly, it's not the first time a there has been a baby born to atleast one Vampire parent. In the the TV series Angel, Angel and Darla have a baby... who is human, and they are both Vamps. It's not that unusual/unique of a concept.    I loved Breaking Dawn, and thought it was a great addition, and hope there will be more!!!

031606792X|5.0|I read the reviews before I read the final book and was worried that I would be dissappointed.  I am happy to say that I was not.  I love the book and didn't feel at all that it was rushed.  In one review someone made a comment that Bella gets everything she wants.  Isn't that how a fictional love story should end??  I mean really, we all know real life doesn't always have a happy ending, so why can't we at least have that in the books we read.  I love all four books and was just sorry they had to end.
B001IF3LYS|1.0|With great sorrow, I have never received this item which I've purchased on 11/11/2008 till now. When I tried to trace it, Amazon.com gave me a link to contact the seller (Media King), I E-mailed them but I got no reply.<br />I advice everyone to keep away from these people, just only deal with Amazon's products, they never let you down like Media King.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|this said the dvd was new and its not ( yeah nice christmas present) I have emailed several times with no response..needless to say I HAD to go the NEW dvd so a 20.00 present ended up costing me 40.00 people like this should not be allowed to sell things..... crooks
B000J10EQU|2.0|It took me a while to get a clear focus on what this movie was about, and why the fans were so divided over it. Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull has helped me put things in perspective: either you grew up with the original movies and you dig old-timey nostalgia, or you don't.     The intolerable thing about Superman Returns, however, is its unjustified praise. Optimistic it may be, but that's a far cry from \\"inspirational\\". Superman saving a jumbo jet and then touching down in a BASEBALL FIELD? That's desperation, my friend. Talk about unadulterated Americana. Superman has always been representative of the United States and its ideals, but what I'm getting from this film is like high-fructose syrup.     As a standalone movie, its still not very good. I blame Margot Kidder for her abrasive, unattractive take on Lois Lane, because now there's nowhere else to go but up. And Kate Bosworth is definitely more attractive. Sadly, she looks barely twenty five and definitely miscast in the role of a sassy reporter. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is passable. I would prefer a bit more depth to his character, but who am I to fight city hall? In the silver age comics, Lex was always a nutty villain and his schemes made absolutely no sense. I guess I've been spoiled by the Smallville TV series and its unique portrayal of a dark genius.      I was hoping for a bit more of Singer's trademark \\"realism\\" (like in the X-Men movies), but there's none to be had here. I can't blame him though; few would be brave enough to smash apart the continuity from an age-old, beloved movie. Still, he could have afforded to take a few more risks here. Superman baely has any lines in the movie; he just parrots Christopher Reeves and Brando's lines from the original film! I kept waiting in vain for him to develop some kind of personality. Give me a break!
B0017YDPI2|5.0|This show is unbeatable! The chemistry between Sam and Dean is great. This is a show for anyone who enjoys a little scare, and a whole lot of fun. Only one big problem...season 1 and 2 are not blue ray yet!    Looking for season 4 soon.
0956010903|5.0|I ordered the special edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard for my husband and it arrived quickly and made a wonderful holiday gift.  The book is a nice quality, special edition.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is one of my favorites.  When I want a punishing workout, I pop in \\"30 Day Shred.\\"  The dvd includes three workouts of varying difficulty.  Jillian structures the workouts into three six minute sessions (with a brief warm-up in the beginning and a brief stretch session at the end).  The workouts are difficult but very doable if you are committed.  I don't have a lot of time, so a twenty-minute workout is perfect for me (by the way, this is one of my main problems with the original BL workout dvds--the warm-up and cool-down were too long!).  My favorite workout is the first one, which is supposed to be the easiest.  But I honestly don't feel like the second and third workouts are that much more difficult (just different).  If you are considering this dvd, you might also look at Jackie Warner's \\"Workout\\" dvd.  Jillian and Jackie (and also Bob Harper) really know how to put a killer workout together.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The older version of \\"the Band of Brothers\\" was great, but this new edition with Blu Ray is awesome. Check it out, I think anyone who purchases this cd set will really love it.
1594489505|5.0|Great, great follow-up to \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  I would say that \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" surpasses author Khaled Hosseini's first novel but that might tend to diminish \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  Both are extraordinary works that provide intimate insight into generations of Afghani culture.    Mariam and Laila are two women from different generations who are forced into marriage with a much older and abusive Rasheed.  Both women are trapped in a male-dominated society through a very tumultuous and violent period in Afghanistan.  For them, the price of survival is enormous self-sacrifice, humiliation, constant beatings and, ultimately, reliance on each other.     Like \\"The Kite Runner\\", Hosseini tells this story against the rich and violent backdrop of Afghani history - an insight very few Westerners see and understand.  Another true epic tale that hits the heart and leaves an everlasting impression.  A novel not to be missed.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|The movie is ok.  Great action scenes, but I wasn't impressed with the premise of the movie.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love, love, love this show!  I bought this episode for my husband who likes the show.  I started watching it with him, and now I am addicted!  The story line is great.  It is like a twisted-psychotic Grey's anatomy!

B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best Christmas movie of all time.  I was not completely impressed by the blu-ray version compared to the regular.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|For those of who you haven't seen Iron Man, I won't speak much about the movie itself; there are more than enough places for movie reviews.  What I will say is that this Blu-Ray edition does a good job of bringing the feeling of the big screen at home.  The video is very clear provided you are using high def, and the sound track is very cool for those who have multi-speaker systems.  Using the PCM stream, you can appreciate individual bullets in different areas and some more subtle sounds during the battle sequences that you may not have noticed.  This movie is probably one of my favorites to show off sound effects.  All in all a very nice way to enjoy your home theater and a fun movie to watch.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out about 4 years ago, I think.  Have not watched it since.  Bought this blu-ray version and watched it again and enjoyed it very much.  A good addition to your comedy collection.  A true \\"no-brainer\\" comedy.
B001FOPODS|5.0|A moody exquisitely animated interpretation of the classic story with the familiar musical score by Prokofiev, suitable for adults and older children.  The modern ending is a twist on the traditional finale.  Special Features highlight the laborious process of producing the short film over a 5 year period.
0099465655|5.0|the heroine is beautiful, innocent, but mature, smart and has a really strong character. the hero is a complete, dangerous rake with a scandalous past, too. but from the moment he falls in love, he is the most attentive lover, the tenderest friend, the most wonderful helper and advisor. i couldn't believe how much he loved her!!<br />one of my favourite lines is in this book, when he tells her: \\"o, where have you been all this time?\\"<br />a masterpiece.<br />romance will never taste the same after you read this book!!!!!
B001ECQ75A|4.0|Enjoyable at least for families with children over 8.  There's a lot of cartoon violence (of course, it is Kung Fu, so you need to expect fighting), but the story is basically a good one.

817224164X|4.0|If, like me, you enjoy history as a recreational hobby, this is the version of M.K. for you.  It is an unabridged version that has been streamlined and made digestible for 21st century English dilettante historians.  Further, it is the only version with an audio edition available, which is my preferred way of 'reading'.<br /><br />Stylistically the original German edition met with derision from contemporaries; who complained the book was boring, confused, poorly written, and in need of a competent editor.  Past translations did a good job at transposing those characteristics in their English editions.  So while other translations are probably more true to the source material in style, I have no desire to wade through aggravatingly obtuse prose to get an understanding of what Hitler was trying to communicate.  I want an edited, streamlined version, and that is what the Ford edition is.  Ford is not an academic, he is a bilingual entrepreneur who identified a hole in the Mein Kampf market and filled it.<br /><br />The actual ideas in Mein Kampf are beguiling.  George Orwell wrote:<br /><br />&#34;The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him. […] Hitler … knows that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life.&#34;<br /><br />People want to belong to something greater than themselves, to feel their are part of something transcendent, hence the popularity of religion.  Struggle and fighting likewise have appeal--that is why things like American football and the Ultimate Fighting Championship have millions upon millions of adherents.  A marriage of the two into a system of belief is very attractive.  Why do people become Jihadists or Nazis?  The above is probably why.<br /><br />Yet Orwell was certainly no fan of Hitler:<br /><br />&#34;What [Hitler] envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous state of 250 million Germans with plenty of “living room” (i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or there- abouts), a horrible brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens except the training of young men for war and the endless breeding of fresh cannon-fodder.&#34;<br /><br />What comes through in Mein Kampf is Hitler's appeal and repellency.  It will help you understand why he attracted adherents and what motivated him to start unwinnable wars and murder millions of Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and disabled people.hy.  Yet Orwell was certainly no fan of Hitler:  &#34;What [Hitler] envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous state of 250 million Germans with plenty of “living room” (i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or there- abouts), a horrible brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens except the training of young men for war and the endless breeding of fresh cannon-fodder.&#34;  What comes through in Mein Kampf is Hitler's appeal and repellency.  It will help you understand why he attracted adherents and what motivated him to start unwinnable wars and murder millions of Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and disabled people.messages out: furnish no proofs, keep repeating a simplistic message ad nausem, and concentrate on the stupid people.  I would imagine though that these insights were hardly original and mostly likely cribbed from someone else.    So how does a despised shunned doss house failure and stool pigeon rise to the status of supreme dictator?  Well it's not because of rational thought or an appeal to the noble side of humanity.  It is in an appeal to the base evil side of humanity and the application of force to back up every claim or demand.  Disagree or refuse to do what Hitler wants and suffer the consequences.  As he explains in Mein Kampf, right from the beginning when he took over the 7 member worker's party and became it's dictatorial boss, force was the key to his expansion of power.  And right from the beginning he demanded unconditional obedience and an oath of total submission to his will from those who followed him.  So another couple of themes that can be plucked out from the book is belief in the use of force and demand for total submission.  His talent seem to have lain in the use and exploitation of certain kinds of power thereby attaining more of the same, until he ruled Germany.     He serves no idea, people, or guiding principle except for himself.  The thrust of the book is extension of his personal power and revenge upon those he feels resentment to-wards, and providing proof that he is special.  In fact, resentment is one of the keys to Hitler's personality, he feels himself persecuted and treated poorly to an amazing degree and of course he seeks violent revenge of these imagined offenders.   Altruism, compassion, kindness, sympathy, fairness, and humour are all completely absent from this book, and I imagine from the man himself.  There is nothing that inspires love in his work, only fear and anger which I believe is what attracted his followers. There is no nobility in his words, only ugly baseness.      So here are some of the baguettes Hitler pinched off for this book:    1) Democracy is weak, stupid, and worse than useless.  2) Germans are the Greatest people in the world and have a natural right and duty to rule all other peoples.  3) Germany's woes and lack of empire and the loss of WWI are due to the Jews.  4) Violence is OK as a political tool, just like pamphlets and posters.  5) Elimination (murder) of political opposition is OK.  6) The destruction of a free press is good.  6) The power of the party boss is absolute and absolute submission and unquestioning allegiance is a must.  7) Certain elements of society must be removed.  8) Germany must go to war to secure land and glory.  9) Hitler is always right should never be contradicted.  Should you argue with him, you should be beaten and then put in a concentration camp to work until you die.  10) Hitler is special and better than everybody else.    Pretty much what happened during the years between the writing of the book and 1945 is stately literally, or is easily predicted from this book.  The book is so outrageous, the Frankfurter Zeitung (sp?) proclaimed it an act of political suicide.  You can't accuse him of false advertising at least.    If you can believe Hitler, and he was a liar through and through, there are a couple of surprises.  The main one being that Hitler wasn't raised a racist.  Apparently his family and school environment were tolerant of Jews, seeing them as just another religious group like protestants and catholics.  It was only when he was out in the big city when he was older and a failure that he started reading racist works and hanging out with racists that his views changed.  Another surprise was that Hitler's biggest fear was being ignored.    In conclusion, if this book is at all representative of what he actually thought and believed, it is no surprise his life ended in suicide with no joy or friends or love (Eva Braun was nuts and incapable of real love, and Hitler was a malignant narcissist and could only love himself); only fear, death, depression, and rage were his companions in that bunker.
B00151HZ3S|5.0|The difficulty of producing recordings of Wagner's Ring Cycle lies in the massive scope of the master's vision.  What it necessitates is about fifteen hours of dedication and focus not only from the musicians and conductors, but also from the engineering team, producers, and other technicians whose task it is to aid in immortalizing this music in a medium that will preserve Wagner's art for posterity.  Those fifteen hours also come in addition to all the other times spent on rigorous rehearsal, tape playbacks and cuts, editing, balancing, and so forth.  Recording a Ring is an enterprise of Herculean dimensions.  Such was the task of John Culshaw and Georg Solti fifty years ago, and as such does it remain for future generations of visionaries and wunderkinds who wish to associate their names with this monolithic milestone.  There have only been five official studio recordings produced in the last century--Solti's premier Vienna Cycle, Karajan's Berlin cycle, Janowski's Dresden Cycle, Levine's New York Ring, and this recording with Bernard Haitink leading the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.  Most other Rings were issued from recorded live performances taken from the Bayreuth Festival and other venues where productions of this tetralogy have been recorded (indeed, it has been proven to be a far more facile and undemanding assignment to document a Ring from an opera house).  To their credit, all five studio Rings have been recorded with the world's greatest orchestras, providing an ideal tapestry from which the vision of Wagner's magnificent score can be pristinely realized.  The only caveat: they lack the thrill and the pulse of a staged performance.  Another caveat (I lied): you lack the consistency in casting that is more easily had in a live cycle.<br /><br />Wagner's Ring is one of those artistic monuments that academics and musicians tend to debate about for its musical and philosophical ideas.  Are the very basis of the music and the plot derived from the theories of Freud or Jung?  Is it a socialist drama in the line of Marxist philosophy?  Or are the central themes closer to the subjects of Rousseau?  The list can go on, and such academic jargon need not be discussed here.  The musical arguments put forth, however, should be.  Conducting Wagner has always been an issue that each generation of Ringmasters tries to pose as a challenge for its listeners.  Should the tempi be pondering, slow, and mammoth-like as Knappertsbusch and Goodall had theirs?  Or, is it a brisk, dramatic, and chaotic world in motion in the line of Furtwangler, Bohm, Krauss, and Keilberth?  Or is it a lyrical chamber drama in the mould of Janowski, Karajan and Levine's Rings?  There are several ways to conduct the Ring, and the problem is, aside from the composer's recorded references and anecdotes, no one has really set any distinct and definitive rules to how his music should be presented to an audience.  Of all the Rings that I have heard, there are three which I believe to be absolutely bewitching.  The first is Barenboim's Bayreuth Ring on Warner Classics.  No other documentation of this music has been so convincing that it coalesces the ideas of the aforementioned Ring Masters histrionically and musically.  Barenboim, in fact surpasses all of these conductors in the sense that he has achieved a global and philosophical view of the Ring that favors above all others the ideal balance of dramatic vision and musical immediacy and traditional Germanic Romanticism.  His orchestra provides transparency, lyricism, and beauty without compromising the essentially massive scope of the score: leitmotifs, gargantuan chords, and all.  The second conductor whose Ring I find definitive is Clemens Krauss.  In spite of the less than ideal recorded sound, the balance of speed, elegance, tonal verisimilitude, and that ideal Wagnerian pulse (a gene that belongs only to the greatest of conductors) makes his conceptualization of this tetralogy an absolute necessity.The last of this triptych is Sir Georg Solti, but another strong contender tying with him is the Dutch conductor Bernard Haitink, a musician particularly known for his exemplary work in the symphonies of Gustav Mahler, Shostakovich, Beethoven, and Brahms.<br /><br />Bernard Haitink is a conductor of poise and elegance.  What he does best is to present without bias and a minimal intervention of personality the skeleton of the music with all its anatomy attached in the most symmetrically beautiful manner.  Absent are the distortion that other artists apply with their inflated egotism and inadvertently personal ideas about how the score should conducted.  Haitink's approach is different.  He deconstructs the music from its core and creates a sound world that defines the canvass of the music in such a way that you can hear every single orchestral color and voice clearly without removing from the panoramic view of the complete picture.  What he so successfully brings to his acclaimed performances of Mahler's symphonies he carries over to Wagner's four operas.  Contrary to Oscar Wilde's stipulation that the artist's personality is an essential component of the art, Haitink proves that his intellectual and emotionally involved yet elegant vision of the score works for Wagner.  I wouldn't call him the greatest Wagner conductor who ever lived (that title would go to Barenboim, Furtwangler, and Krauss), but he certainly is one of the most judicious and balanced musicians to arrange this most difficult of scores.  Listen to his Rheingold opening at how simply natural and beautifully played those opening bars are.  There is simply no other orchestra that brings so much riches to the score while at the same time portraying the ebb and flow of the River Rhine so gracefully.  Listen to the gods' march to Valhalla and how grandiose and regal that burnished tone is.  Listen to the opening of Walkure and the romantic, dolorous, and rapturous sequence of events in the first Act.  Or the heartbreaking Todesverkundigung and Wotan's Farewell.  Listen to the schizophrenically ominous, fun, epic, and mysterious environment created by the bars of Siegfried.  Listen to Gotterdammerung and the various scenes that depict the tragic fall of the gods.  Where else and who else has done such a magnificent job in setting every single musical value in place?  I can name only a few conductors who have done so, and Haitink is one of them.  It (the interpretation) can never be accused of being too lyrical despite its orchestral beauty, and it can never be labeled as bland as evidenced by the more dramatically injected sections of this Ring.  If any recording were to be chosen as one that could be easily followed with a score, this would be it.  Haitink's venture is aided too by the glorious Bavarian Radio Symphony, an orchestra that placed their definitive stamp on what is perhaps the finest Mahler Cycle on records (with Rafael Kubelik).  Contrary to popular belief, it is one of Europe's and even the world's greatest orchestras.  If you don't believe me, check the last edition of Gramophone.  It has voted this orchestra as the sixth best in the world, with top marks going to the Concertgebouw, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Vienna Philharmonic.  In the company of such legendary ensembles, this orchestra has proven itself to be one of the finest mediums of expression for any composer.  Its gossamer tone and its technical flexibility and refinement are outstanding and make it an ideal vehicle for Wagner's operas.<br /><br />Haitink can also be lauded for assembling one of the finest casts to sing the parts of the Ring since Solti's great cycle in the 50's.  The tiniest parts such as the Rhine maidens, Norns, and Valkyries to the leads who play Wotan, Siegfried, and Brunnhilde are all accounted for in such a way that they not only deliver the requisite vocal goods but also produce a humanly immediate conception of the character.  The Walsung twins in this recording are taken by Reiner Goldberg and Cheryl Studer.  Ms. Studer is outstanding as Sieglinde, singing one of the most mellifluously vocalized and heartfelt interpretations of the character since Leonie Rysanek. That she is vocally secure is an added bonus to this already sympathetic and perfect interpretation.  Goldberg, who sang a sometimes uninspired Siegfried for Levine, proves to be better in the part of Siegfried's father, Siegmund.  While James King will never be effaced in this role, Goldberg is fine enough of a singer to not detract from the overall quality of the performance.  James Morris is absolutely ravishing as Wotan.  From the proud and negotiating god in Rheingold to the weary Wanderer in Siegfried, there is simply no vocal trick that escapes his glorious bass baritone (perhaps the greatest to assume this part since Hans Hotter).  While his characterization for Levine is more delineated and thought out, this Wotan is still compelling and in a way much more vocally fresh and immediate.  Setting Hotter aside, Morris is peerless in his assumption of the role.  His farewell to Brunnhilde in the third act of Walkure is more than enough to bring tears to one's eyes.<br /><br />Siegfried Jerusalem is a discovery in the part of his namesake.  While his voice has not the heroic dimensions of Lauritz Melchior, he has everything else that Siegfried needs (the poetry, some heroism, sensitivity, a secure voice), not to mention the refulgent tone that Windgassen never had.  For once, Siegfried sounds like a callow youth who has no care for the world without ever looking like an amphora.  His Brunnhilde, Eva Marton is just as amazing.  Many years before this recording was made, Marton released a recital of Wagnerian gems in which her Immolation Scene sounded like it could eclipse the milestones that Nilsson and Varnay have likewise immortalized on tape.  She is found here in this Ring a few years later in slightly less than optimal vocal resources.  Some listeners have found this to be a problem, but I find her to be absolutely compelling in the part of everyone's favorite Valkyrie.  She generates the kind of chemistry with the other character's that often eludes Nilsson and other great Brunnhildes, and she is committed to the text and what she sings.  Especially in Gotterdammerung, Marton shows that she knows the character and her plights and is unwilling to part without offering a take on the character that can bring one to tears.  I remember seeing her as Fidelio and she like no one else (not even Ludwig or Gwyneth Jones) brought a tear to my eye as she sang Komm Hoffnung.  Setting her vocal inconsistencies aside, we would be much poorer without her awesome Brunnhilde.  Besides, she is the only person who has recently sung the character with the necessary vocal size.<br /><br />Theo Adam assumes the part of Alberich, Wotan's counterpart and the touted villain of the cycle.  While other singers have much firmer and secure voices, Adam is an intelligent singer who makes the most out of the character and in a way portrays an anti-Wotan, not the dumb dwarf that most people would much more easily portray him to be.  Neidlinger, Wlaschicha, and von Kannen still reign supreme among the echelon of vocally rich Alberichs, but Adam is in a class of his own.  This is not your cartoon villain, but rather a mastermind whose gears ticked and tocked in rhythm with his rivals.  Peter Haage sings his brother Mime without the exaggerated and acidic effects of Gerhard Stolze.  While he has neither the distinction and the control of Heinz Zednik's Mime, he makes a fine enough dwarf in these operas.  Heinz Zednik, speaking of the devil, is peerless as Loge.  Period.  The trio of gods in Rheingold are the best on records--Peter Seiffert as Froh, Andreas Schmidt as Donner, and Eva Johansson as Freia.  Fricka is eloquently sung by Marjana Lipovsek in Rheingold and devastatingly and impressively portrayed by the magnificent Waltraud Meier in Walkure.  Meier makes what is in my opinion the most complete portrait of Fricka on records.  Brava to her.  Jadwige Rappe understands intimately what little that Erda has to sing, even if her voice is not nearly has enormous and earthen as let's say Ewa Podles is.  Salminen is frightening as Hunding, and Kurt Rydl makes a dominating and frightful Fafner (his brother Fasolt is unfortunately sung by a clueless no-name).  In Gotterdammerung, Thomas Hampson sings the finest Gunther since Fischer-Dieskau and Lipovsek is brilliant if less impressive than Meier (in Barenboim's Ring) as Waltraute.  But perhaps the most impressive secondary character of them all is John Tomlinson's indispensable and malevolent Hagen.  He is rightly sinister and intelligent, two traits that don't always make up a whole in other singers' characterizations of this villain.  Along with Salminen, these two basses are without peer in the assumption of this character.  The rest of the cast--te Kanawa's Forest Bird), a starry bunch of Norns, lovely Rhinemaidens, and a well-tuned octet of Valkyries--are all taken by singers of sound technique and round up the most balanced and well-recorded studio Ring along with Solti's and Levine's.  It wouldn't be a first choice for many people, but I find this Ring absolutely convincing on a musical and dramatic scope.  I would recommend that you get this after Solti, Barenboim, and Krauss' cycles.ing are taken by Reiner Goldberg and Cheryl Studer.  Ms. Studer is outstanding as Sieglinde, singing one of the most mellifluously vocalized and heartfelt interpretations of the character since Leonie Rysanek. That she is vocally secure is an added bonus to this already sympathetic and perfect interpretation.

Setting Hotter aside, Morris is peerless in his assumption of the role.  His farewell to Brunnhilde in the third act of Walkure is more than enough to bring tears to one's eyes.<br /><br />Siegfried Jerusalem is a discovery in the part of his namesake.  While his voice has not the heroic dimensions of Lauritz Melchior, he has everything else that Siegfried needs (the poetry, some heroism, sensitivity, a secure voice), not to mention the refulgent tone that Windgassen never had.  For once, Siegfried sounds like a callow youth who has no care for the world without ever looking like an amphora.  His Brunnhilde, Eva Marton is just as amazing.  Many years before this recording was made, Marton released a recital of Wagnerian gems in which her Immolation Scene sounded like it could eclipse the milestones that Nilsson and Varnay have likewise immortalized on tape.  She is found here in this Ring a few years later in slightly less than optimal vocal resources.  Some listeners have found this to be a problem, but I find her to be absolutely compelling in the part of everyone's favorite Valkyrie.  She generates the kind of chemistry with the other character's that often eludes Nilsson and other great Brunnhildes, and she is committed to the text and what she sings.  Especially in Gotterdammerung, Marton shows that she knows the character and her plights and is unwilling to part without offering a take on the character that can bring one to tears.  I remember seeing her as Fidelio and she like no one else (not even Ludwig or Gwyneth Jones) brought a tear to my eye as she sang Komm Hoffnung.  Setting her vocal inconsistencies aside, we would be much poorer without her awesome Brunnhilde.  Besides, she is the only person who has recently sung the character with the necessary vocal size.<br /><br />Theo Adam assumes the part of Alberich, Wotan's counterpart and the touted villain of the cycle.  While other singers have much firmer and secure voices, Adam is an intelligent singer who makes the most out of the character and in a way portrays an anti-Wotan, not the dumb dwarf that most people would much more easily portray him to be.  Neidlinger, Wlaschicha, and von Kannen still reign supreme among the echelon of vocally rich Alberichs, but Adam is in a class of his own.  This is not your cartoon villain, but rather a mastermind whose gears ticked and tocked in rhythm with his rivals.  Peter Haage sings his brother Mime without the exaggerated and acidic effects of Gerhard Stolze.  While he has neither the distinction and the control of Heinz Zednik's Mime, he makes a fine enough dwarf in these operas.  Heinz Zednik, speaking of the devil, is peerless as Loge.  Period.  The trio of gods in Rheingold are the best on records--Peter Seiffert as Froh, Andreas Schmidt as Donner, and Eva Johansson as Freia.  Fricka is eloquently sung by Marjana Lipovsek in Rheingold and devastatingly and impressively portrayed by the magnificent Waltraud Meier in Walkure.  Meier makes what is in my opinion the most complete portrait of Fricka on records.  Brava to her.  Jadwige Rappe understands intimately what little that Erda has to sing, even if her voice is not nearly has enormous and earthen as let's say Ewa Podles is.  Salminen is frightening as Hunding, and Kurt Rydl makes a dominating and frightful Fafner (his brother Fasolt is unfortunately sung by a clueless no-name).  In Gotterdammerung, Thomas Hampson sings the finest Gunther since Fischer-Dieskau and Lipovsek is brilliant if less impressive than Meier (in Barenboim's Ring) as Waltraute.  But perhaps the most impressive secondary character of them all is John Tomlinson's indispensable and malevolent Hagen.  He is rightly sinister and intelligent, two traits that don't always make up a whole in other singers' characterizations of this villain.  Along with Salminen, these two basses are without peer in the assumption of this character.  The rest of the cast--te Kanawa's Forest Bird), a starry bunch of Norns, lovely Rhinemaidens, and a well-tuned octet of Valkyries--are all taken by singers of sound technique and round up the most balanced and well-recorded studio Ring along with Solti's and Levine's.  It wouldn't be a first choice for many people, but I find this Ring absolutely convincing on a musical and dramatic scope.  I would recommend that you get this after Solti, Barenboim, and Krauss' cycles.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|The mere fact that, finally, Barbra Streisand's vision quest, \\"Yentl\\", is being released on DVD confirms the whole theme of the movie and that is nothing's impossible.<br />Yentl set in Eastern Europe in a time where the female is not allowed to dive into learning, \\"picture books are for women\\", proclaims the local bookseller. So Yentl studies in secret with her father. After his death she literally runs for her life making the convincing transformation into a boy/man.  Where Yentl/Anshel her male counterpart's name makes friends very fast and is accepted into the Yeshiva where Yentl can study in the open.  Yet nothing is as simple as it seems.  This is the great conflict in the story for even as man she finds she can't deny the woman inside or march to the drum of her time.  Learning The Talmud Yentl grows more confident as a woman and knows she must be herself at any cost.<br />Director Streisand weaves the film into a rich tapestry almost like a series of visual paintings that are sewn together. The beautiful music by Michelle Legrand and the gracious lyrics by Alan and Marlin Bergman with Barbra Streisand's rich nasal voice illustrate the inner longings of this complex character.  A fine film that is timeless much like Ms. Streisand herself.<br />Author's Note: Now that I have the DVD it just leaves me breathless!  It sure was worth the wait. It looks almost like a brand new film.  Yentl, the film has aged so well.  I love the director's cut so much! Along with all the bonus features, such as the 8mm film, and the deleted song \\"Several Sins A Day\\", wow!!!  I would have paid a $100.00 for this DVD. Yentl is priceless and timeless!
6304936362|3.0|Mild Spoilers Follow    This is not a dreadful movie, but it is pretty average. What makes it interesting are the aerial sequences, and the flying B17 bombers, several of them real planes which are credited at the end of the film. Watching (and hearing) them fly is fascinating, and you do get a real idea from the film of what it was like inside one of those beasts. If you are interested in this sort of thing, then the movie is worth watching at least once for this alone.    Otherwise...I'm afraid it's cheesy. The fact that the B17 had such a large crew works against the film-makers, because it is hard to give all the crew members space and make the men individual characters. To compensate, they each end up with their own gimmick, whether it is the wireless op with his camera, the navigator with his drinking, or the waist gunner with his holy medal. (Harry Connick, as the tail gunner, naturally sings.) Despite this, they all remain as types, and it is hard to really empathise with or care for any of them as individuals. This is not the fault of the acting, but the fault of the script, and, to a lesser extent, the direction.    Naturally, everything goes wrong with the Memphis Belle's final mission to Bremen. Though ghastly things did routinely happen on bombing operations (one of the worst moments in the film shows a crippled German fighter slicing a B17 in half--you can see a photo of a real-life, similar incident in the recent book \\"Eighth Air Force\\", by Donald Miller) the way the crew surmount one disaster after another does rather stretch credulity. It's also highly doubtful that the plane could ever have dropped its bomb-load accurately on a factory instead of a neighbouring school, as that sort of accuracy just could not be guaranteed with the technology that was around at the time. About the only thing you can say is that the Eighth Air Force at least pretended they were trying to hit targets whereas the RAF just bombed everything indiscriminately: the results, unfortunately were much the same for those on the receiving end of the bombs. Which leads me to another cynical observation, that It's noticeable you don't see any bombs going off on the ground in this movie. In fact, while people get blown up, or sucked out of aeroplanes, this film is remarkably violence free--the most blood you see is from a tin of tomato soup.    It's long been my observation that people who went through the war are sometimes nostalgic, but seldom sentimental about it. It was an emotion that simply could not be afforded at the time, and after the event it became an ingrained habit. Old war movies, made soon afterwards by men who were often former combatants, reflect this attitude, but Memphis Belle was made long enough after the events it purports to depict that sentiment creeps in. Ultimately, this movie is a 90s version of events that happened 50 years previously. Despite the technological advantages the filmakers had, perhaps that is one of the reasons why in the end it doesn't quite convince.
B0002KPHXS|2.0|Given what great scores this flick gets in all the databases, I was shocked at how poor INTERMEZZO is.  Sure, Bergman is gorgeous, but that isn't enough to compensate for the trite plotting, two-dimensional characters, and laughable dialogue.  Want a strong romance from 1939? Try DARK VICTORY.  A 1939 pageant? GONE WITH THE WIND.  A 1939 comedy? NINOTCHKA.  1939 Family fare? THE WIZARD OF OZ. 1939 was a fantastic year for movies, so go buy/rent/watch something with a little creativity behind it, and stear clear of this time-waster.
055321263X|5.0|I read \\"The Woman in White\\" after reading the good reviews here and it did not disappoint. Immersing oneself in a country and time period not one's own is one of the chief magics of reading novels and was true of this book in particular. I sank into the erudite language of these English characters, the customs, the ambiance of a society more than 150 years removed from our own. Imagine yourself walking along a dark country dirt road with no electric lights anywhere. Suddenly, a hand touches your shoulder. You jump and then see a woman dressed all in white! Is she real? Why is she there, alone, on this dark, country road? There was no outside illumination at night. Indoor illumination was by candle. Local transportation was by walking, train or horse. Communicating with people not in your household was via handwritten letters and sometimes took days for the reply to arrive while you sat around sewing, or reading. (There didn't seem to be much for upper-class women to do with their days.) Along with the fascinating intrigue at the heart of this story is the depiction of legal inequities suffered by women back then. (Fortunately, at least for today's American women, society has progressed.)  The vivid characters and settings are richly drawn in a series of first-person accounts, as is Wilkie's \\"The Moonstone,\\" which is another wonderful story. Both, actually, are highly satisfying books, highly recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Filmed in 2000 and transmitted in 2001, Band of Brothers is a 10-part mini-series which remains the most expensive TV series ever made (at least until the budget for its new companion series, The Pacific, is revealed). The series was developed by Steven Spielberg as a continuation of the themes and ideas he explored in his hit 1998 movie, Saving Private Ryan. Whilst the film's running time meant that only a small portion of the Second World War could be depicted, the greater scope and length afforded to a series meant that more of the conflict could be shown and the characters' story arcs would be more satisfying. Also, it was decided that, unlike the purely fictitious Saving Private Ryan, the TV companion piece would be based on true events and real soldiers. The rights to the book Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose were purchased and Ambrose and the surviving soldiers portrayed in the book were brought in to consult on the project.    Band of Brothers opens in 1942, shortly after the formation of the 101st Airborne Division by the US Army. The first episode follows the training of Easy Company at Toccoa, Georgia, over the course of a year. They are placed in the care of Captain Herbert Sobel (Friends' David Schwimmer) who trains them far harder than the other men of the 101st, with the result that soon the company has a reputation as the best company in the division. However, Sobel's methods make him highly unpopular with the men, especially when it is revealed that his nerves fail him in field exercises. The unit is shipped to England to train and prepare for D-Day, but Sobel's limitations are eventually recognised and he is relieved of command. The second episode has the 101st parachute into Normandy just ahead of the beach landings. When Easy Company's commanding officer is killed during the drop, it falls to Lt. Richard Winters (Damien Lewis) to assume command and lead a daring attack on a German artillery position targeting the beaches. Winters becomes the closest thing to a central character and is one of only a few characters to appear in every episode.    What initially impresses about Band of Brothers is its authenticity. Its production values would be impressive for a movie, but for a TV series they are stunning. But where the series really works is its focus on the characters. Whilst some events are dramatised or compressed for timing reasons, pretty much everything that happens in the series is based on a true event and every one of the main characters is based on a real person. This makes the series unpredictable and strongly emotionally resonant: if a character is wounded or killed without warning, it is because his real-life counterpart was wounded or killed at that point of the war. This is also why every single actor brings his A-game to his role: when the person you are playing is actually going to be watching your performance, or if he has passed away and his friends are, then you definitely need to be on top form.    The producers seemed to realise early on that simply having ten episodes of non-stop carnage would get boring pretty quickly, so each episode is built around different characters and premises, and the individual episode directors are allowed to indulge their own artistic styles somewhat more than is normal on a television drama. A particular stand-out is the sixth episode, which focuses on Easy Company's medic during the Battle of the Bulge and follows him from unit to unit, seeing his friends get wounded and having to patch them up, or having to watch them die. It is an incredible piece of television drama. As is traditional with HBO, they don't make things too easy for the viewer. Easy Company is made up of several platoons, with some episodes focusing entirely on one group and others on all of them, meaning that characters appear, disappear and reappear from episode to episode. Characters are also promoted, demoted, wounded or killed off and the viewer is expected to work out who is who and what they are doing sometimes very quickly. This lack of spoon-feeding is as refreshing here as it is on other HBO productions such as The Wire, but casual viewers may find themselves swamped on first viewing.    The series employs an interestingly desaturised colour tone, which puts its feel somewhere between full colour and black and white. Whilst this adds immensely to atmosphere, it does make telling some of the characters apart difficult, again on first viewing, especially as most of the time they are wearing full combat gear and helmets. For these reasons the series rewards careful re-watching and is also better suited to the DVD format, with the viewer able to watch several episodes in a row and work out who is who and what their roles within the company are.    The series' action sequences rival some of the strongest war movies in their intensity and vividness, but it's in the quiet moments that it excels. The banter between the men is authentic and the importance of the bonds that form between soldiers in combat with regards to keeping them sane is strongly emphasised (more cliched, \\"I love you, Sarge!\\" moments are firmly absent, thankfully). In fact, one of the strongest moments in the series comes when one of the company's toughest, most effective lieutenants suddenly breaks down after seeing two of his men get their legs blown off in front of him. The mental pressures of the war are portrayed as being as dangerous and difficult to deal with as enemy action. Questions of morality in warfare are also intelligently raised: one soldier is rumoured as having brutally gunned down more than a dozen unarmed German PoWs on D-Day but later proves himself to be the bravest and most efficient officer in the unit whose actions repeatedly save the lives of his men.    Band of Brothers (*****) is a staggeringly impressive piece of work, not just for its incredible budget and impressive special effects, but for its intelligent and often powerful writing, phenomenal acting and the resonance provided by knowing that pretty much everything that happened in the series is based on a real event. It is available on DVD in the UK and USA, and also now on Blu-Ray in the UK and USA.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|The music is all the same as on Abba Gold, forego the Mamma Mia soundtrack and go straight to the original. The vocals are stronger from Abba. I bought both of these CDs for my wife for Christmas, we listened to both of them straight through and she hasn't put the Mamma Mia cd back in since the first listen. It just isn't as good.
0312370849|4.0|This is an interesting book. It concerns a part of the holocaust that I, for one, knew nothing about - the roundup and deportation of Jews by the French government. The style of writing is very easy to read, and every section is only a few pages long so it's easy to pick up for just a few minutes of time - like say during commercials while you watch the news (though I usually kept reading right on through the program as well) The first half of the book flashes between the past and present, but because each section is so short, you don't get confused or forget who people were. The sections concerning the past are also in a bolder font so you know you're going to a \\"flashback\\". Parts of the story I did find to be a bit predictable, but it was still a great story. Overall this is a great book that brings to light a different part of the holocaust that many people may not know about. Highly recommended.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|The Dark Knight is a crime drama better than Batman Begins. It is gripping and holds you to the very end. Cristian Bale is a very good actor who plays Batman in this movie and the Joker portrayed by Heath Ledger is mesmarizing. I liked the battle going on for the city and Batman's quest to rid the city of corruption. Joker was humanizing he portrayed the darkside in all of us. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to be entertained and left wanting more. Thank you.
0802136834|5.0|I wanted to know more about this time period and decided to \\"bite the bullet.\\"  I read this book expecting it to be a difficult read since there is so much history covered in this book.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|My child loved this movie in the theater and laughed just as hard the second time we watched it. There are also some deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and a cartoon short that she has to watch after we watch the movie.

It says the software is on the CD but it is not. :(      The annoying or I wish it were different:      There is not a built in AC power adapter, or USB cable holder. As this is portable you will need a second bag or something similar to carry your cables. This makes it easier to forget or misplace. If I could at least fit it in an empty battery compartment that would be something. :     I wish it had a lever for raising and lowering the needle :        Conclusion :   I really like it because it's functional and tech freindly.      All reviews seem to really like it.      People complain about stupid stuff but this is a great little player for a fair price.     (Identical to ION IPTUSB)

B001CTA1S4|4.0|Doubt centers on a single parish in the Bronx in the early 60s.  Sister Aloysius (Streep) is the principal at the local parish school and she is suspicious of the new parish priest (Hoffman).  Sister James (Adams) thinks she sees something, setting Sister Aloysius on a campaign to expose the wrongdoing of the priest.  But did something really happen--or is there room for doubt?<br /><br />Doubt features excellent performance from all three of its leads.  They are riveting, and their performances in this thinking movie really stick with you.  It's easy to see why this movie is generating such Oscar buzz because the performances are just so strong. The subject matter--potential child sexual abuse in a supposedly safe religious setting--is intense, and some of the scenes are very powerful.  The movie gives you a close look at human nature and the essence of right and wrong.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good serious movie with excellent acting--Doubt will not leave you disappointed.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I gave this Series to my son as a Christmas gift, and while visiting him over the holidays I was able to watch two of them with his family.  It's absolutely stupendous, and we were all, down to the youngest child, completely captivated by the incredible photography and the information presented.  And BBC did not dumb it down, like the American version.  Watch-learn-enjoy!!
0786838655|5.0|My son absolutely loved this book!  The whole series, actually, and is ANXIOUSLY awaiting the final book coming out next year.  Mr. Riordan hit the perfect notes for young boys in Percy Jackson - a young boy, super abilities and skills, magnificent adventure, danger, mythical beasts and monsters, sword fighting, quests, kids doing things adults never let them do (g) - you name it, this series has it.    I should say that my son is only in 2nd grade, but has a high-school reading and comprehension level.  I find it difficult to find reading material for him that is at his reading level, but is also age appropriate.  He absolutely loved these books, and now 3 of his friends have read them too.  So they are perfectly safe for younger readers who happen to read at this level.  It even made him so curious about Greek mythology that he read an entire collection of Greek myths over the summer.    Highly recommend Percey Jackson and the Olympians; I can't wait to see how it all ends!
0684803356|5.0|\\"War is not a life: it is a situation, one which may neither be ignored nor accepted.\\"<br />  T.S. Eliot<br /><br />First off, let me preface this review by stating that I have never been a big fan of war novels.  Secondly, I would definitely not classify myself as an ardent aficionado of Hemingway's work.  I highly respect, admire and appreciate his contributions to American Literature, yet he wouldn't quite make it into my top 10 list of favorite American authors.  So that being said, I had my reservations and trepidations about what I was getting myself into right from the get-go.  So many books... so little time...<br /><br />Published in 1940, this is a story about a young American man (Robert Jordan) who is in the International Brigades and attached to an anti-fascist unit during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).  Jordan is an expert w/ explosives, and his mission is to blow up a bridge during an attack of the city of Segovia.  Most of the novel is told to us from Jordan's perspective, which is obviously motivated by Hemingway's own experiences while living in Spain during this violent, chaotic era.  The story is essentially about the three days leading up to Jordan's mission and takes place in the mountains just north of the capital of Madrid.  It is here, that he meets a truly unforgettable, colorful cast of characters - Maria, Anselmo, Pablo, Pilar, Fernando, El Sordo, Agustin, Rafael, et al..., all fighting the good fight with our hero Senor Jordan.<br /><br />Jordan, like most of Hemingway's male protagonists, is full of testosterone, a bit aloof and apathetic, disillusioned, and of course, heroic.  Papa Ernie describes him further, early on in the novel: \\"He was serving in a war and he gave absolute loyalty and as complete a performance as he could give while he was serving.  But nobody owned his mind, nor his faculties for seeing and hearing, and if he were going to form judgments he would form them afterwards.\\"  Like Ernest himself, Robert is a rough and tough, cynical, macho man.  However on the flip-side of that coin, he is also a very sensitive and vulnerable soul, a flawed, complex character full of contradictions.  He is a realist and a dreamer.  He is a passionate lover and a fighter/soldier, a trusted, loyal friend and a bitter, vengeful enemy, etc...  In other words, one big ball of paradox!<br /><br />Many reviewers have criticized Hemingway's characters for being too simple and unsophisticated.  For example, the beautiful Maria, Jordan's love, especially takes a beating, for being so shallow and two-dimensional.  However, I don't agree with that assessment at all.  We have to remember that she is a simple, country girl who has been brutally treated by the enemy (I will not disclose how) and is caught up in trying to survive the savagery of a war.  What do expect her to be like - Isabel Archer?  Emma Bovary?  Yes, Maria is a bit too simple and submissive for most strong, modern-day women to relate with.  But Hemingway's creation of Pilar, well, there is a dame of different colors completely!  She is one of the most fascinating and also one of the funniest creations in all of literature - a truly singular and intriguing character indeed!<br /><br />This was quite a nice surprise for me.  I have only read five of Hemingway's pieces, yet this one is not only my favorite, but also has enticed me to pick up a few more of his classic works.  It is the type of book that you either are going to love or going to hate and you will know which side of the fence you will fall on right from the get-go.  Hemingway was a true minimalist, and spins this heart-pounding, intense yarn in a simple, straightforward manner.  He doesn't develop his characters a la Austen, Balzac, Tolstoy, James, et al... but yet, few authors can do so much with so little like old Ernie could.  And this classic is a prime example!  Fiercely and austerely told, it is one hec of an intense ride!<br /><br />Highly recommended, macho man.

0596101996|5.0|Both an excellent tutorial and an excellent reference. I've read this bulky volume almost from cover to cover - even the reference chapters - and enjoyed every word.    It covers both the JavaScript language and DOM scripting via JavaScript. It clarifies the differences between the various DOM APIs implemented by the major browsers.    The author is somewhat judgmental (and with good reason, in this reviewer's opinion) to Internet Explorer's  non-standards-compliant implementation, but nontheless, he does an excellent and thorough job describing this very popular API, as well as the W3C standard (implemented by FireFox and Opera, for instance).    The book also covers interoperability between JavaScript and Java, and between JavaScript and Flash (i've only skimmed through these chapters, though, so i won't vouch to their quality...).    I recommend complementing this book with Crawford's slim and exquisite \\"JavaScript: The Good Parts\\" (read Flanagan first).    Prerequisites for reading Flanagan: an aquaintance (really, a mere aquaintance is good enough) with HTML, CSS, Structured Programming and the Object Oriented paradigm. A knowledge of Java is assumed in a couple specialized chapters.

0060558121|3.0|This book has many characters but only one personality, afflicted to varying degrees with the same case of the blahs. The jacket promises uplift, but the novel's ideal of virtue is world-weary and emotionally blank.<br /><br />I admit, I was drawn through to the end. The imagined universe, though ultimately trivial, was full of clever ideas and interesting detail. So I'm grudgingly giving it 3 stars. But I wish I'd spent my time differently.

The show is filled with endearing, multi-dimensional characters whose interactions produce a fabulous viewing experience.  It's effects span the emotions and gives the viewer \\"that feeling\\" you get when a movie or show is emotionally satisfying and also somewhat profound.    ***Spoiler alert here for those who have only seen season 1*** As for those who are craving seasons 2-4, I say let it go.  The first season was amazing, and it was the show's peak.  Let's face it, the primary conflict is about Ephram and Amy who kind of want to get together but are conflicted by Colin's presence, or lack thereof.  Once Colin is no longer in a coma the whole dynamic of the show, and the characters' ability to interact changes.  The writers get desperate, the show goes downhill.  Be glad Season 1 is out.  It's AMAZING.  And just hold onto the good times.
B000LC55F2|3.0|A feud between between two magicians and the aid of the magician's assistants seem to light up to a Tesla spark.<br />If you like historical drama with an element of horror and drama,<br />you might like this film.<br />It has a sci fi twist involving Tesla's wireless power transmission scheme<br />that was passed on  at the beginning of the last century.<br />I enjoyed the movie, but think that it made too much of magic trick secrets.

B00005LMBK|5.0|I first heard this gorillaz self-titled album back in 2002.  This is by far one of the best cd's I've ever heard- what I love most is that every single track is solid. Each can stand on its own, and together it makes for quite a pleasant listening experience. My original copy slowly dwindled down to being a scratched, well worn and certainly well loved, but ultimately unlistenable piece of junk that I sadly had to throw away. I added it to my wish list and my bestest friend in the world got me a shiny new copy for christmas. I am overjoyed to finally be reunited with one of the best albums ever produced.   Now I can finally be prepared to \\"rock the house\\" once again.  Thank you, Amazon Wish List!
B00000IMTF|3.0|My 3 star rating is based on the over all product,including the sound quality of the cd, inserts, art work, and effort towards putting out a complete package.     The sound quality is great!  No one should be disappointed here. As we know, this is was high quality album upon release, and the 6 songs were great even on the standard recording.  However, the remastered cd really enhances the clarity of the music.  Great work!    What disappoints me is the lack of effort put forth towards the inserts, art work, lyrics, and stories behind the making of the cd. There is little of that. They give the lyrics to one song, Stargazer.  The art work we get is a center-fold of the 5 members of the band. Great, just what every Dude wants. Oh yeah, there's a small action shot of each member on the back. That wouldn't be bad if it was in addition to pages of other pics, art work, stories, etc. You think they'd know that this music is geared to guys and that we like cool concert and studio pics, stories about the music, and little known facts or events surrounding the making of this album. I am comparing this to many of the re-masters I've bought. Take Iron Maiden for example.  Their remasters have pages full of stories, pics, and lyrics. The inserts are so thick, it's hard to slide them back into the case! They, as well as so many other bands, give you much more than an enhanced recording, they gave a complete package.      This remastered cd is not worth buying unless you just need that enhanced sound. Most of us who buy remasters already have the old version cd and we buy the second disc to get the improved sound quality and all the extras.  This cd has no extras and buying a second copy wasn't worth it to me. It is very generic compared to what you receive from so many other bands.     I was really disappointed in their lack of effort to give us,their loyal fans, more for our money.    Scott
0312383320|3.0|I, too, have enjoyed the Plum series over the years. I only expect to be entertained and to chuckle once in a while. Plum Spooky really didn't do it for me, however.

B000IHY9UW|5.0|Wow, this is a very good movie.  Even if you consider yourself only somewhat of a Doors fan, you gotta admit this is one mighty fine movie.  The guy who plays the Jim Morrison character looks so much like him it's not even funny (and with the Doors, it's never a laughing matter).  You will learn so much about the band, and specifically Jim Morrison.  I like how he found his girlfriend in the beginning of the movie.    As for the Doors music, you will hear PLENTY of that throughout the movie.  A variety of songs throughout the first six studio albums, and even some surprising lesser known songs can be heard at times, such as \\"Love Street\\" and \\"Five to One\\".  I wasn't expecting to hear those songs.    The story of how \\"Light my Fire\\" was created is a really good one too.  The constant drugs and drinking that Morrison did is all mentioned and detailed here as well.  Also, the part where the Doors weren't allowed to say \\"girl you couldn't get much higher\\" from the famous Ed Sullivan bit is included.  I like how Ed wanted the band to be happier and not so gloomy when they were sitting around in their dressing rooms and waiting to go out there and perform, haha.  We can look back and see the Doors simply didn't WANT to be the happy cheery type.    I guess Jim Morrison was shy at first and didn't want to perform in front of big crowds, which explains why the first performance the Doors ever did, Jim had his back to the audience.  That was interesting.      My favorite part is when Jim Morrison actually thought he wasn't a very good singer, and then he starts singing to the band members and... WOW.  Are you kidding me?  The guy is a BRILLIANT singer!    Overall, this is great great stuff.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Being a new year we were discussing how things have changed on amazon as far as the reviews go. We have noticed quite the drop off of regular visitors and have decided to go with a little format change. Will we stop reviewing? Not a chance, but we are going to keep the reviews a bit more brief. So this is just a heads up for the length of the reviews. They will be shorter but will still deliver the Sid charm.<br /><br />Anyway, this weeks entry is a delightful Bronson gem known as Death Hunt. The stars of the show are Charles, Lee Marvin, and Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed) with a dose of Uncle Leo (Sienfeld) and Mr. Rittenhauer (Tommy Boy) to seal the deal. The film was based on the true story of a real 1930's wilderness man named Albert Johnson (Bronson) as he was hunted down by Sgt. Edgar Millen and his crew through the snowy woods of Canada. The real trouble occurs on the side of the law once they realize Albert is the real deal and can take an army down single handedly. As the hunt moves on the body count rises weighing in Bronson's favor. There are so many hilarious moments along the way ultimately leading to Bronson's escape over the Alaskan border.<br /><br />This film is a must for any Bronson fan. It's very much along the lines of Death Ring with a much higher budget and some actual known actors. The scenery was great and the action was everywhere you wanna be. After 5 Death Wish flicks this one proves that Charles Bronson sits right on top with the ultimate hard core action Icons. Yeah even in 1981 he looked like he was 98 but man can this guy tear sh** up. If you are a fan of action go and pick up Death Hunt if you can find it.

031606792X|5.0|I never thought I would get this wrapped up in a series of books. I picked them up and haven't put them down. I don't think that readers who are now ready for the final book will be dissappointed. I know I wasn't. Lots of major events happen in this book that readers have been waiting for since the beginning (I know I have been). I couldn't put it down.    I could not have been happier than the way this book ended the series. For Bella to be able to include her new and old family, and have Jacob in her life without complications is more than I could've hoped for.  A little weird at first but I think it worked out nice. I got my happily ever after with this book. The only thing I was disappointed about was that the story ended.  I could read these books forever.     I hope that Stephanie Meyer continues the books. She could write forever on these characters.

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|This is the picareque tale of Barry Lyndon set in Eighteenth century Europe. Filled with Kubrick trademarks - stunning imagery, superb use of music, meticulous attention to detail - and it all works brilliantly. Indeed this may well be Kubrick's greatest achievement on film. Ryan O'Neal is excellent as the eponymous Irish rogue, although interestingly, Lyndon fades into the background about three-quarters of the way through with the film shifting instead to focus on those around him. Barry Lyndon is exciting, one-of-a-kind film-making - riveting to watch despite it's three hour length.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers concerns this DVD is presented in the original aspect ratio of 1.66:1. The DVD has no extras.
B001F290E4|3.0|I was expecting a great deal more from Seal on this album, he certainly has not done for soul what Michael Buble did for standards.  The Seal 'edge' is just not as sharp.    However, the songs are well chosen and give a nostalgic peep into the artist's history and values.  I believe it is still a worthwhile buy.

0486211045|4.0|I love George Bridgman works, so I decided that I should get a book just so I can look at it all the time in physical time instead of elsewhere. I did not expect it to be so small, but I think it was because all the paper copies my instructors give me is a large piece of paper. None the less, I think this book is a helpful anatomy book, since it explains what the artist needs to know and is good for the basic review of muscles. Bridgman does a good job of breaking things down and making it easy to see the underlying structure. What I like about Bridgman is the use of exaggerated muscle, it helps to see better and it is not complicated.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|If you've read all 37 or 38 reviews to this point, you'll probably have worked out that 'State of Play' is really rather good. My wife and I got the DVD for Christmas and if it weren't for the fact we have two small kids, and therefore don't get much sleep, we would have watched all six episodes in one evening. Alas, we had to end the first night after just three, and could only manage two the following evening. That left one glorious, highly anticipated episode which we watched last night. Of course, this morning we feel rather sad it's all over.   Without a doubt, the most gripping TV drama I have ever seen.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|You won't find a better or more stunning account of the wonders of nature both flora and fauna anywhere... definitely get it on BD!  Absolutely amazing footage, and you'll learn a lot about the neat things around our planet.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I absolutely love this series! I got me the 1st episode out of curiosity and decided to give it a try, and minutes into it, I was literally breathless. I was so overwhelmed & intrigued that I sometimes forgot to breathe during scenes. True Blood is now one of my favorites! You've gotta see this series! I was hooked...episode after episode... I even had to stop myself from watching another one lol pacing myself 'cuz I know Season 2 is not out yet. I can't wait!
0446677450|5.0|A very good book, and very applicable.  Definitely recommend the follow-on books in the series as well as the game (they actually have a board game that teaches how to get rich).  The principles are amazingly simple -- understanding liabilities versus assets and recognizing that the truly rich often don't appear rich at all; and the truly poor sometimes seem to have everything -- until you look at their cash flow.  Educational for sure, highly recommend!
0439023483|5.0|This was a very fast paced book. Theres a lot of action and emotion. The characters are likable, even in such an awful situation. It really makes you wonder what the world will be like in the future..
031606792X|5.0|I do not normally write reviews on books that I read, but I looked over many of the other reviews for this book and was absolutely shocked at how vehemently so many people hated it!  I personally loved the book.  It was exactly what I would have wanted, which is a happy ending and I'm thrilled Meyer delivered.  I think people must be so upset, because they fell so in love with Edward, Bella, Jacob and the Cullens that they see them as real...and real life - for most people - doesn't always include a happy ending.      I think that Meyer has been writing toward this ending for the other three books and setting things up for it to end exactly as it did.  It seems \\"too perfect\\" for people, I think, because the ending Meyer has been striving toward has finally arrived and the story is finished.  People would be thrilled for it to go on and on, but, eventually, the constant fights, tension and increasingly predictable \\"damsel in distress\\" routine would have been too much for any reader to take.  Here is how I feel that Meyer set things up and why the books HAD to end this way:    Bella was NOT good at being human and should have died in the first few pages of the first book.  She had been living on borrowed time from the start and she was totally cut out to be a vampire.  In addition, she was so prepared for being a vampire and had so much support and assistance that the others really didn't have, of COURSE she was good at it!  The poor girl sucked at everything else in human life (to include merely walking down a street!) that she HAD to have SOMETHING coming to her in her vampire life!    Jacob was always meant to be in Bella's family and they were connected from the start.  The reason he fell so deeply in love with her was because there was absolutely NO WAY he would stick by a mere \\"friend\\" who was in love with a vampire!  It took him falling madly in love with Bella for him to make all the sacrifices he did in order to be with her and keep her safe.  If not for allthat, he would have never met his soul-mate, which was their daughter.      Edward and Bella's relationship only got BETTER once she became a vampire, not \\"watered down\\".  They could actually be a pair, instead of him making all the decisions for her and constantly having to endager his entire family to protect her.  If Edward had to drag all the Cullens into some death fight one more time to save her, Bella's character would have been remiss (and not well-written)if SHE had not been the one to leave HIM!  It was time for her to do the saving, for once!    Jacob needed some peace and happiness.  He had been miserable for nearly the entire series!  How in the world would people think he didn't deserve a happy ending?    I was beyond impressed at how Meyer wrote from the different perspectives in this book.  It was so different.  When I got to the section entitled \\"Jacob\\" and immediately realized it was written from his point of view, I was so upset!  I did NOT want to read from his agonized mind-set...I was really starting to get tired of him and was thrilled and relieved that Bella and Edward got married and away from him so quickly in this book!  I was totally ticked when we got back to him during that part, until I read the first sentence and I was hooked...all over again.  I have no idea how Meyer does that, but I thoroughly enjoyed what I was sure I couldn't!  (She's an excellent writer.)    In the end, this entire series has been more about life and love and happiness and wading through all the every-day messes to get to the thrill of enjoying living for life's sake.  Everyone has that \\"grounding point\\" in their life when - no matter what else happens - you know that everything is going to be okay....and I think that's what this series really symbolizes.  There was a very spiritual air to the entire thing and it was all wrapped up perfectly in the final book.  Everything else was written to end just exactly this way and I couldn't be more thrilled with it.  I will read the series over and over because it's so well-written...and I will love the fourth book more and more each time I do.     It's just sad that some people really dislike it so much.  I guess that's because they really can't stand happy endings.  SOMEONE is supposed to die...SOMEONE is supposed to end up miserable....and true love just CAN'T exist without tragedy. Not for me...give me a happy ending every time.
015206396X|5.0|This book was really really good! You should read this and the Hunger Games, they are two of the best books I've read in a while!

B001GZ6QDS|2.0|As a man of intellect who greatly values logic and reason , I enjoy complex films like Mulholland drive that foster long conversations after viewing. But I also enjoy indulging in mindless action films. Like Kevin Smith (in his latest talk, now out on DVD titled \\"Sold Out, A threevening with Kevin Smith\\"),  when I too was first faced with John McLain riding on the wing of a Harrier Jet in the lastest Die Hard film I also thought, why not, it's John McLain! The Dark Knight attempts to be both an action film and a thought provoking film and it is it's failure at the later that prevents me from indulging in the former. But how can I enjoy indulging in films like Die Hard, with their over the top violence and action scenes set up by ridiculous situations, and not enjoy a film like The Dark Knight? Die Hard With A Vengeance is far from an outright comedy, with fairly dark themes concerning a terrorist trying to take over the world, but it follows the typical good guy versus bad guy plot which, as outrageous as it may be, at least makes some logical sense once you buy into the premise and just as importantly does not take itself too seriously.    The Dark Knight on the other hand has quite an outrageous plot with holes that you could drive the Joker's school bus through. Worst of all, the majority of the plot hurdles that the writers arrived at are, rather than gracefully jumped, crudely chopped apart with... you guessed it, a simple cell phone. Perhaps examples are in order.    Batman's capture of the Asian money launderer is entirely over the top. Batman flies from a building, uses a cell phone to shut down an entire buiding's security system, parachutes out of a window and is caught by a passing airplane. It makes John McLain surfing on an airplane seem like mere child's play. The fighting is silly and overly choreographed, as if the individual actors are going through their motions without even recognizing the presence of their combatants. All the while, batman's comical baritone voice utters silly phrases.    The Joker uses his cell phone to set off his bombs, escape from police, while Batman somehow uses a tracking device in the cellphone of everyone in the entire city and then somehow manages to track everyone and intercept phone conversations.   At one point, someone dies, only to have faked their death, a feat which would require more orchestration than The Game Michael Douglas' character plays in that aptly named film. Need I mention that this ruse is entirely unnecessary for the plot?   The joker manages to discretely enter, presumably with the help of a neverending supply of mental minions, buildings, including a hospital, and boats, to plant vast amounts of explosive barrels.    Two Face is somehow turned from the most virtuous character in the film into an evil villain after only a five minute conversation with the Joker.    The Joker cannot hit an armored car from 10 feet away with several shots from a rocket launcher, yet he riddles passing cars full of bullet holes with a machine gun as he stomps down the middle of the street in the middle of Gotham City.    I could go on and on about the illogical silly aspects of this film, but you get the idea. However, I will focus on one last bit of sillyness. The end. Batman is forced to go on the run to take the blame for something that the Joker, two face, or perhaps a member of the million man mental patient march,  could have easily taken the blame for. It's supposed to be some great climax in the film, as it ends immediately after this scene, but for the life of me I can't figure out what I'm supposed to be feeling. Clearly I'm supposed to be feeling something emotionally powerful about this character at this point, but I'm not sure what. I'm simply glad that this two hour long bore fest is over and I no longer have to listen to Batman's deep computer processed voice.    The acting in this film is great, and the Imax shots are amazing, and the prologue is perfect, but these are the only good things about the film.    Perhaps the Nolans should stick to intelligent films like The Prestige (I thought Memento was absolutely awful and pretentious) and not attempt to make intelligent action films.  This films biggest folly is it's failed attempt to be intelligent and logical, which thereby prevents one from indulging in it's ridiculous action scenes, which in any other film that did not take itself so seriously, perhaps would be far more entertaining. Or perhaps it's simply impossible for me to enjoy a film that is inferior in plot to the masterpiece The Prestige, but still manages to invoke that same amazing feeling that I find in all of Nolan's films. I expected more great films from Nolan, but The Dark Knight is certainly not one of them.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Well I'd have to admit that I've loved the playstation design controller from the start, but it's nothing new. Sony should have just stuck to the Dualshock 3 design from the start (or maybe something new?) Either way this controller is very good, and for now it's way better than the original SIXAXIS. Rumble feature's good, and well I can't really complain about the controller itself.    I am a bit disappointed that Sony couldn't throw in a charging cable at least, and for the price (which is way better here on Amazon, then say if you went into Gamestop to get the exact same product) it could be better.    Overall, good solid controller, no problems with them at all, just fairly unoriginal, but it works good for what you need it for.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|I love this movie!  I think this is the best Riddick movie out there because it is uncompromising in its depressing style.  All of the horrible things that you don't want to happen do happen, but not always in the way you expect.  If you want a dark thriller featuring the best acting Vin Diesel has ever done, you should watch this movie.  I guarantee satisfaction from this DVD.
B001E75QGG|3.0|I recognize the hard work that went into the making of this movie, but can't help thinking that while watching it, that not everyone was on the same page. In a word, I was disappointed by this movie. That said, the Blu-Ray itself is good:<br /><br />Special Features: There are plenty of goodies for the Jones fans and for people who like to get an idea or what its like to make a movie.<br /><br />Video: The video transfer you would expect, with today's digital transfer techniques, to be flawless. And it is. So, why does it SEEM like it was filmed in the 80's? Because that was the style they wanted to replicate - that of the three Indiana Jones predecesors. The film used the same photography styles, lighting cues, etc. They even used film in its production, which is now the exception, not the norm.<br /><br />Verdict: Indiana Jones fan = buy it. You'll be slightly disappointed, but you'll have the collection.<br />Otherwise skip it.
006085880X|5.0|The Pact by Jodi Picoult was an amazing book. It was that kind of book that once you start reading it you can't out it down. The Pact is the story of the lifelong friendship between Chris Harte and Emily Gold and its tragic ending. They grew up together and were best friends.  Chris and Emily were born a few days apart and spent a lot of their childhood with one another. Both families hopped that eventually the two would fall in love. The story follows Chris and Emily through their teenage years and shows how the two get closer and closer. Then a phone call comes in the middle of the night that no parent wants to hear. Emily suffered a gunshot wound to the head and is no longer alive. While Chris, who was with her at the time, says that they had created a suicide pact. Since all the evidence leads to Chris he is put in jail under high security. His only way out is to be proven innocent. So, his parents higher the top lawyer and make sure he does anything to save their son. Most of the book is centered on the mystery of that tragic night and the events that lead up to it. The story is deeply emotional and at points can be alarming. Jodi Picoult weaves the present and the pass to give the reader a greater knowledge of the character's feelings and choices.  Overall, I would say that this is one of the best books that I have ever read. I would recommend it to any one interested in love stories but, this one defiantly has a twist.
B0017IYWEE|5.0|Okay, there are some who thinks that Herr Damrau does not have the ability to manage such a wide diversity of roles.<br />This impression, in my humble view, is much more apparent than real.<br />Damrau is a wonderful musician; not just a good soprano. Mozart requires greatness to muster - instrumental or vocal alike. Compare Damrau's Mozart album here with her other wonderful compatriot Annette Dasch, and you'll see what I mean.<br />Dasch has it all - a wonderfully full voice (which Damrau does NOT have; at least no longer these days). Yet, and yet, in terms of intonation and expression, not really up to Damrau's finesse.<br />If there are any problem at all with this album, it lies in the accompaniment.  The period ensemble is not giving the singer the full-bodied support as do by other full orchestras.  So, the reviewer who have heard numerous 'modern' versions (full operatic versions) of Mozart's well-known tracks would feel 'what a watered down performance'. Nor is the conducter really on par with Damrau in some interpretations.<br />That said, as for Herr Damrau herself, the voice isn't as full as it 'used' to be in the early 2000s when she first stunned the world with her Queen of the Night.  The effect of 15 productions of Die Zauberflote does has its mark on the voice. However, it would be going too far to claim that it has robbed the singer of her ability to express.<br />True, of all tracks here, the Don Giovanni arias offer the least attractive package. It used to be said that a soprano who can both tackle Donna Anna and Donna Elvira would be none other than a great soprano. Damrau's voice does not sit comfortably in either of these. BUT hers is not a dramatic or spinto soprano. Neither Anna nor Elvira would give a lirico coloratura leggiero any comfort.<br />As for the rest, there is well-nigh no fault to be found with Damrau's impeccable renditions.
B001794FOK|2.0|I caught this film last night on satellite, and here is the short of it:    Nice effects, some nice editing, cool visuals...everything else leaves much to be desired.  Hayden Christensen is adequate for the role, but not the most gripping and charismatic fellow.  Sam Jackson does the best with his material and is his usual intense self while delivering the goods as a baddie.  However, the film-makers seem to have been so worried about keeping the pace of the film tight (barely a 90 minute film) that some scenes that may explain stuff further are just missing.  Who the hell are the bad guys really? How are jumpers born? The director seems to have wanted to leave some mysteries for the sequel (questionable if there will be one), but there just isn't enough to entice with the first film.

B000JLSLZQ|3.0|The movie is well done and follows the classic essence of the Phantom of the Opera.    The picture is amazing on my Samsung 52\\" LCD.    The major shortcoming is the lack of Dolby True HD audio option in the menu setup. (Or DTS Master) It appears that all I could manage was normal DD 5.1. So compared to the other Blu-ray movies I've watched with True HD the sound wasn't as clear/crisp or LOUD as I wanted. (especially for a movie where audio should be the big factor)    Just have a good look at the label and check for the Audio specs you expect.    It wasn't that the sound was bad, just, compared to V for Vendetta or Transformers that give you goosebumps... this disc fell short.

(I accidentally started watching in normal Dolby Digital 5.1 and sensed something wrong) After switching the audio I was wowed.     The image is top rate as well.    The story line is enjoyably complex and makes you think hard about political and moral implications of decisions of government and how the general populous might be manipulated. It's a movie I can watch over and over.

I love every single song in this movie... i didnt purchase the cd only because there are a few songs that aren't on there that i love... so i guess i'll just have to watch the movie even more :) WOOHOO... they all sound great but my FAVE song is \\"Lay all your love on me\\" man that scene is great!!!!
B001DDCVCI|5.0|I can say in one word how I feel about this.AWSOME...Johnny Cash is truely one of our nations masterpieces.He appealed to young and old, free and imprisoned and everyone inbetween.I really thought that the video was lost to time.I have all the Video of him now thanks to this website...Thank you..<br />  Craig..........
B0013FBS20|5.0|I recently purchased a HDTV and a Blu-Ray DVD player. Watching a movie with a good High Definition TV is an experience in itself but watching it with a Blu-Ray DVD is unbelievable. I actually felt I was there as opposed to watching it. It is definitely worth purchasing.
B001GQACGO|5.0|get ready to feel her thunder.. The Queen Bee is back.. Diva and Video Phone are my top songs.. But the whole cd is loaded with #1's....
0300108834|5.0|If you enjoy clear prose, buy this book. If dry textbooks make you yearn for some time with a great humanist pondering the big questions of where we come from and why violence and ignorance so often seem to eclipse everything worthwhile, buy this book. This book is good company, and not just for the young readers it was originally intended for. Also, the slim paragraph on Joan of Arc alone is worth the price of admission... And for a visual person like myself, the crisp woodcut-style illustrations and clean typography complement the keen prose to make the volume irresistible.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|I was there and watching it come to life on Blu-ray is beyond words.. A must for all Beyonce fans.. Miss Bee puts on a life  altering show..
B0002OXVDW|5.0|An amazing compilation of the best musicals produced by the american studio system. Certainly the best collection for musical lovers, students or people who want to dive into this magical world as we can't find it anymore.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Fantastic actors, gorgeous cinematography and a hauntingly elegant score.  One of the most touching scenes (and one of my favorites) is where Robert Deniro's character goes through penance.  This is a truly remarkable film.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I have enjoyed this collector's edition very much.  I like the fact that it contains all versions of the movie.  After viewing all of the versions I have decided that I still like the original version best.  I know that it may sound silly but I like the original narration.  I think that some of the narration, especially at the end was quite good.  Makes a person think about his/her own mortallity.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The flash really makes your indoor pics come out better when you tilt it up and bounce it off the ceiling. I didn't think it would help that much, but it really does. Works perfectly on my D40.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I love the easy checkout with Amazon.com. I ordered this for my son for Christmas. I got a great price and really fast shipping. He was very happy with the set. It came in a great box to keep all the discs together. Overall extremely happy with the purchase...and more importantly so was my son!!!
0486237664|5.0|This book is perfect if you are interested in Ink Art. I have not seen a book that had so many ink drawings and so fine in detail. It's a must for anyone that loves art or is an artist. The price is ridiculously too low, this book is a bargain no doubt about that. Buy it worth it worth it and you wont regret it. There are some many animals from land, air, and water. The way these artist make everything look so realistic is amazing.
031606792X|5.0|I got the last three Twilight books bundled together. They arrived when they were supposed to and all of the books where in awesome condition.
B00140PK6O|5.0|If you love 19th century bbc films then you will love this one.  I loved it so much, I had to stay up late and watch the whole thing.  Acting is superb and story line is great.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is by far the darkest Batman movie and that's a good thing because it delivers plenty of action, violence, and an extremely intriguing plot.<br /><br />The plot follows the events of \\"Batman Begins\\" where Gotham City is now taken by dangerous criminals and corruption. Batman is an urban sort of myth that fights crime and injustice but now he will have to face Gotham's most dangerous and deadly criminal, The Joker.<br /><br />The movie contains plenty of political sub-plots that are very interesting and add something special because it adds a dark feeling to the viewing experience. Also, the action sequences are extremely well done and make the movie spectacular.ar The acting is simply great. Christian Bale delivers a more humanistic but aggressive Batman. He gives emotions to the character and that's why he's likable. But Heath Ledger steals the show with his wicked and deep performance as the devilish and disturbed Joker. This performance is now a classic and will never be forgotten in Pop Culture.<br /><br />The action is just excellent, a delight for everyone. Since the first shooting at the bank scene you know what to expect. I just love it. All the action sequences involving the Joker are stuff for legend. Plus, the ending will leave you disturbed, dirty, but satisfied.<br /><br />The pace is extremely well done and you don't feel the movie is almost three hours long.<br /><br />Please watch this masterpiece of modern action supported by an interesting plot that deals with fictional politics and deep character development. A new classic and the best Batman movie to date.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This product was in great condition! Was like new! Would buy from this seller again.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Thanks for the great CD.  Sound is great, love the album!  Fast shipper!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I would suggest buying this albumn if you are thinking about purchasing more than 2 of the songs from iTunes.  They are all amazing.
B001F1YBP8|5.0|This is an excellent DVD from start to finish.  Its all well played, filmed, and recorded.  With the Blu-ray version you can read the time on the first horn's wrist watch, in Roman Numerals!  There are a couple of places where the sound is not quite in sync with the video.  This is very minor, not distracting, and was probably due to some editing or patch work that needed to be done.  You have to be watching very closely to spot it.    The best players are used throughout and are well guided by Maestro Abbado.  Be sure to watch the last movement of the #2 concerto played a second time as an encore.  Piccolo trumpet Reinhold Friedrich nails it both times taking the last note up to a high F during the encore!    This is a very exciting DVD.  You will be as glad to own it as I am.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I was going to buy the cheaper one disc version of this movie until I saw the great price that Amazon had.  My boyfriend loves watching movie extras and the extras on this movie are amazing.  Great movie. Instant Classic.
B001GJ1QQG|4.0|I'm a long time fan of the international diva Anastacia. Heavy Rotation is long over due. It still sounds just a soulful as previous records, but the album itself has a different feel. I love it and I'm sure you will too.
B000N6TX22|1.0|This movie is so bad i can't begin to tell people.It made no sense at all.Some poor girl in England is the only women left in the world that can have a baby and her water breaks while everyone is trying to kill her.People all over the world are at war for some reason and England is the last safe place on earth yet there still after her.Do yourself a favor and don't spend the 7.99 for this so called movie.It is on my top five movies of the worst i have ever seen.
0345350499|5.0|Mists of Avalon is my favorite book hands down.  I have read it about 10 or so times and every time I read it, it is just as interesting and ensnaring as the first time I picked it up.  I like to think of it as Lord of The Rings meets Harry Potter.  I find this book has just the right level of language so that it is not overbearing but it also satisfies an adult.  The book is easy to read and there is plenty of it.  My favorite part is the constant conflict between man and woman, god and goddess and the different people in the kingdom.
0786838655|5.0|This book is great! I would recommend this whole series, it's awesome. My cousin read some to me and I never knew I would like this kind of book.
B0010ZR160|3.0|The film has many wonderful moments and some solid performances; it's a worthy first effort from Ben Affleck as a director, though he would have been better-served to either work out the fractured structure of the script beforehand, and/or hire a better editor.  A lot of tension is lost in the choppiness; it's not fluid, and the constant fade outs and ins only dilute the tension and make the key moments seem ham-fisted and melodramatic. The lensing is capable and evocative, but even some set-ups look beyond 'intentionally casual' and don't serve the high aspirations of the film. It's  a gritty memorable tale, and a cut above most fare, for sure.   I'd recommend despite it's faults.
B000V63B5E|5.0|I was never really a huge fan back in the 1980s (the greatest decade in music).  I think the whole skin-tight leather pants / Aqua Net hairspray motif was a real turnoff.  But with age comes wisdom and Bon Jovi has made their mark in the music world.  Even Jon Bon Jovi admits that the big hair was ridiculous.  There are some great timeless songs on this compilation.  \\"Livin' On a Prayer\\" is probably the greatest 1980s song.  It's still played on the radio and I've noticed that it also gets airtime at almost every wedding I've attended, regardless of race or culture.  \\"I'll Be There For You\\" is another great song.      Of course, with most compilations, there are a few duds.  Bon Jovi is a rock band yet they've included a country song - \\"Someday I'll Be Saturday Night.\\"  Why?  I know it was made during the 90s when Bon Jovi was trying to leave behind the hairspray days but this song stinks.  Another dud is \\"Prayer 94\\" which is a remix of \\"Livin' On a Prayer.\\"  It's a slow drawn-out mess.  The song doesn't really go anywhere.  It sounds like it was recorded with a drunken Jon Bon Jovi.    I'm giving this album 5 stars despite the two duds because the entire album download was sold for a whopping $1.99!
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This is a clever, funny, and well-done movie for kids and adults, several notches above earlier Dreamworks Animation features.  Highly recommended.
1582701709|5.0|The secret changed my West Philadelphila life,   My life was in tatters, I was fighting outside school,  I fought random people in basketball courts  I started making trouble all over my neighbourhood     You could even say my life got flipped, even turned upside down,  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared  And said you're moving with your auntie and uncle in bel-air        Best summer evar.
0810979772|5.0|My 9 yo loves this series!  As others have said, it shows lots have kids have similiar problems with siblings and school.  These books make him laugh and learn.  He loves to write and draw in this do-it-yourself book.  It's almost filled and he's anxious to write some more!  This creativity comes out in his school work and good grades as well.
0545128285|1.0|Like most others have said, this is no Harry Potter, but then again it's a must have for Harry Potter fans.  The book itself is dull and pointless.  The only redeeming aspect of this book is that the proceeds go to charity.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Out of nowhere comes MGMT, and they are GOOD. Every song on this album has a melody that sounds like it must have came from somewhere else, but no, it's new. They are very original... kind of a blend of 60's rock and 80's pop with modern layers of sound. I'm antsy to hear more from this band.
B001663RE8|4.0|As the title says, this is a fine album for those of you who like Nickelback; in fact, Chad Kroeger apparently helped them early in their careers, and their sound reflects it. Lots of good heavy guitar work, catchy riffs, plenty of slower, more soulful stuff mixed in, and overall a pleasant listen. The title is appropriate - the album seems focused on the \\"scars and souvenirs\\" of relationships (mostly failed). \\"Bad Girlfriend\\" has gotten plenty of airplay (edited), but my personal favorites are the tongue-in-cheek \\"Hate My Life\\" and the revenge tune \\"Little Smirk.\\" This is an album where the vast majority of tunes are good listens - very little schlock here, which I appreciate. Required listening for Nickelback devotees...
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My son loves to watch this movie over and over and I don't mind letting him. Does contain a small amount of violence that may be scary for very young children. Has some good talking points for older children about taking care of the Earth.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|This was easily one of the best purchases I've had in years.  The sound and picture quality are amazing.      I am a fan of live performances, where I can hear everything, and nothing is drowned out.  You can't even ask for that when your there at a show in person most times.    There are so many great songs, from a 2 day festival that the band put on themselves.  So there are two live sets pushed back to back.  Altogether it makes for a 2hour long concert video.  But wait theres still more.  Because there is a second disk that comes with a great interview with the band, the making of the festival, and like another 5 or so songs performed live.  I was already a fan, but after this dvd, I recently have purchased all of their albums.
0375826726|1.0|That has to be the single most convoluted and boringly stretched novel I've read to date (and I've read every single Wheel of Time book)! The plot is going exactly nowhere, and instead of being to the point, Paolini tries to make the book longer by filling it with inconsequential trivialities that constantly wander off-track, pre-teen angsty broodings about the meaning of morals that a twelve-year-old would be embarrassed to read, and characters so out of proportion with the world around them, that at some point I was afraid I'd puke all over the pages if someone did ANOTHER \\"first of its kind\\" or \\"best ever in the history of the world\\" deed. And let's not forget that Mr. Paolini has found himself a Thesaurus! Thus we are treated to the most ridiculous out-of-place words in the most absurd places, supposedly to make us think his style has vastly improved because he can switch from \\"acolytes\\" to \\"servile novitiates\\" for no apparent reason.    Yes, I am appalled. I'd recommend this book (and the \\"Eragon\\" series as a whole) only to people who are in their early teens and/or have never read a single fantasy novel in their life. Being mentally twelve would also help.
B000P0J0G0|4.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. We are big fans of Jeeves and Wooster. This is quite different but we have been enjoying these a lot. We were fortunate to have lived in UK and I think for that reason we enjoy the British humor more than some who have not been exposed to some of their unique takes on things. It is similar to Monty Python humor.
B001J53X9U|4.0|Pro: the blue ray and all the features for the movies and the quality is high and the bike is highly detailed    Cons: my only complaint is that the batpod does not com off
B00168OINK|5.0|This movie has humor for both kids and adults.  I am not a Jack Black fan, but his character in this movie is perfect for his style of humor.  Amazon's price for this movie is great too!!  c.clark
0793573742|5.0|I'm not sure there's much else that can be said about this book. It chronicles the Les Paul from roughly '58-'60 and a few others from the era. There's also some great technical info in the back of the book as well. Great pictures and the simple layout works to showcase the guitars.<br /><br />If you're into guitars, Gibson's or the Les Paul, this is a must have in my opinion.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Disney has created another classic!  This is a story that has humor with a message, as in all Disney films.  My kids are adults now, but I am still able to enjoy Disney films because of their appeal to all ages.  I cannot wait to share my library of Disney films with my grandchildren someday!
B00168OINK|5.0|Hi-def and surround sound just make it that much better.  I laughed so many times in this movie.  I enjoyed it as much or more than the kids!!
B000J103WA|4.0|This video documents the reunion of Cream and it doesn't disapoint. Yes they are older and Crossroads is reimagined, but the band is in fine form. Audio on this disc is top notch. Video quality is okay, not exactly a demo disc in that regard, but that is a minor complaint. I got this disc more for the sound than the picture. The only drawback is that it will only play in a HD-DVD player.
0670020478|5.0|This book is beautiful.  It's witty and intelligent and much like Sir Ken Robinson's TED Talk will make you laugh out loud.  However, I also found it incredibly moving, a manual on how to be truly happy with who and what you are.   Above all, it gave me a sense of possibility and hope.  Quite simply, this is a book for everyone.
0930289234|5.0|As a fan of comics that are actually relatable I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys smart, down to earth and realistic literature.  While it takes some context education to really identify with the atmosphere in the story (the Cold War, for those who weren't around during those days) but this eloquent story is amazing.  Questions are posed to the reader about right and wrong, what it means to be a hero, and really what real life \\"superheroes\\" would be like.<br /><br />In summary, if you enjoy intelligent literature, deep stories, or just comics in general, this book is a must have.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Its Batman and there's no neon (the Schumacher Batman), or baby stealing parades (Batman Returns). Gritty realism make this movie.
B000MV9026|5.0|This product was received in excellent condition very quickly ... helps mom keep within budget & stay popular!    THANK YOU!

031236198X|2.0|...and you get what you pay for.  The parable was really cute, but I kept waiting for the lessons and applications.  Part of my job is acting as a change agent and convincing people to change, so I am always on the lookout for good books on simplifying the change process.  This was not one of them.  Cute story, clear concepts, but no lessons for real-life application.
B000PC6A3E|2.0|The movie is great, that´s why i bought the movie, but i also wanted to see all the special features, that´s the reason i bought it a blue-ray dvd for this movie.    Unfortunately a lot of these special features are not working. They appear in the special features menu screen, but when i press their link, the dvd tries to load the segment, but then it returns to the disc menu screen with out showing the short.  It happens with the following special features: Batman-The Journey Begins, Shaping Mind and Body, Gotham City Rises, Cape and Cowl, Batman-The Tumbler, Path to Discovery, Saving Gotham City.  Other features such as The Dark Knight IMAX Prologue, Digital Batman work fine.    It is a shame that most of the special features do not work, i am dissappointed with the quality of this product.
1582882339|5.0|Richard Matheson is one of the greatest writers ever. Every single story in this book is haunting. \\"I am legend\\" is a terrific view into a post-apocalyptic survivors life from day to day and his struggles to survive and find companionship. \\"Hell House\\" is one of the best haunted house stories that will have you turning pages long into the night. Mathenson is wonderful!
0385338732|5.0|I have read many Shopaholic books, Can You Keep a Secret?, Undomestic Goddess, and a few of her books written under \\"Madeleine Wickham.\\"  Remember Me? is my favorite so far!      At first, I thought the plot would be the same as many chick lit novels-- business woman must find her way to work to the top, fall in love and restore her life.  All of these things happen, but it is told in such an unusual, insightful way.  Throughout the book, the main character, Lexi, is trying to piece together her life through clues from her friends and family members.  However, these friends and family members are not always truthful and often leave out important details.  It was so much fun to read a novel where you are figuring out the plot just like the main character is.  You feel completely lost, just like Lexi does when she wakes up in the hospital with amnesia.      I read this book in just one day.  It was so much fun!  I often get tired of chick-lit, but this one was different and a great read!
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Disney/Pixar have done it once again with the story of Wall-E.  The movie is great entertaining for the whole family.  You'll want to watch it again and again.  The Blu-Ray version provides outstanding quality for your home viewing experience.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This came in the mail very quickly, even during the holidays. It was a gift and a surprise, she loved it! Thank you for telling me that it was in the original packaging, that was my selling point, since it was a gift!
6304806418|5.0|Esta pelicula mereció ganar varios Oscar, incluyendo el de mejor actriz. Es una gran historia relatada de una manera excepcional, cuidaron muchos detalles historicos, que es lo importante. Aunque el argumento principal de la obra es la ambición desmedida de Eva Perón y todo lo que hizo para alcanzar el poder, Madonna supo desligarse muy bien de su rol de estrella-idolo del pop y asumir a la perfección cada actitud de quienes conocemos la verdadera historia de Evita.
B000W4D94I|5.0|This was purchased for delivery as a Christmas gift and according to my recipient, it was received in good time and is being enjoyed by the whole family. Your service and product were without fault and made for much less holiday stress. Thank you.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran is the best band ever!! Simon Le Bonn is the best male vocalist I have ever heard! This collection of their greatest hits does not dissapoint. Each song is unique. Nick Rhodes is a musical genious. The synthesizer linear notes are atmospheric yet enjoyable.    This is a five star product-
B000O176Q6|5.0|The image and sound quality was, and is, by far, superior to any previous version on video,broadcast,cable,satellite.Extras and bonus features include documentaries,trailers,T.V.spots,and more.This is Martial Arts Legend/Icon Bruce Lee's final,last,completed,major film,and his best.It's the film by which all other martial arts films are measured.This version of the movie[102 minutes],includes 2 scenes missing from the previous 99 minute home video release version.I only wish for,and dream,that it could be the original,never released,2 hours,or longer,version seen only by Warner Brothers Studios executives.If you love martial arts action adventure,I highly recommend this film classic!
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This in one of my all time favorites! Classic Duran Duran. Simon LeBonn's powerful vocals. John Taylor's soulful bass lines. Nick Rhode's atmospheric synthesizer notes. Roger and Andy Taylor's perfect drum and guitar parts blend together to create the most intelligent and heartfelt music ever created!    this is a five star product-
6300273199|5.0|The opening is cheesey, but I guess it looked better on the big screen when I first saw it at a midnight movie (in 1980/81). The opening audio is also not so good, but it improves once the concert gets going. The real prize is being able to watch Bon Scott perform and seeing the rest of the band when they were still in their 20's. Angus is a dynamo! The man never stops moving. His bluesy solos later in the film are fantastic. Having seen AC/DC in concert with Brain Johnson in 1982, I'm happy to say that Angus's antics were the same as what I saw in the movie, complete with mooning the audience. They really are a great, and fun to watch, Rock 'n Roll band.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|This comes with the 3-d glasses but i liked to watch it normally for the 3-d color was off to me.
0060935464|5.0|I decided to revisit this timeless classic since I hadn't read it since high school and hardly remembered it, which made me feel like I was missing out on something.  The whole novel was entirely fresh to me and I was swept away once I got into it (and got past some of the southern language, accented speech and Ebonics).  Mostly, I was enamored with Atticus Finch.  His demeanor and sensibilities were remarkable under the circumstances and I admired the way he handled his relationships with his children.  I also enjoyed watching Scout and Jem mature over the course of the years.  It is no wonder the themes and characters have remained a staple in American literature for the last 50 years.  The courtroom scene is riveting, the racial commentary poignant, the perspective priceless.  Everyone should read this at least once in their lives if only to savor the richness and depth of Harper Lee's brilliance.
0446605409|4.0|The negative reviews I read talked about how obnoxious the lead character is, but I thought he was funny. What can I say, that uber-male banter always cracks me up. Here's an example: Corey has knocked a guy out, the guy rouses and pulls his gun on Corey. Corey goes along with the gunman, putting his hands on his head, kneeling, taking off his jacket etc. Finally he gets sick of it. The book goes, \\"I was sort of getting cramped in the kneeling position, so I stood. He screamed, 'Kneel! Kneel!' I walked over to him, and he pointed the Beretta right at my ding-dong and pulled the trigger. I winced even though the gun was empty...\\"  Why does that crack me up? Well, frankly, I don't know, but it works for me. And it's pretty good writing, with a little surprise for the reader, so that we feel like insiders in on the joke, well, almost.     Plenty of suspense, and decent, original character portrayals, and an interesting, original plot with tidbits about animal disease and buried treasure.     It's a mystery romp, no doubt about it, but don't mistake Corey's badboy attitude with a casualness about writing on the part of DeMille. No misplaced modifiers or dangling participles, though I am sure Corey would make a joke about a dangling participle. A grammar sleuth, I take my clues from things like \\"dived\\" versus \\"dove.\\" Which verb form does DeMille use? He uses the correct form: Dived. Thank you very much. To me, grammar symbolizes attention to detail. No gritting your teeth through this book on any level, and after a certain suspension of disbelief, it's light and humorous, engaging and suspenseful. A guilty pleasure, perhaps, but like Corey, I won't apologize for doing what I feel like doing, and that's liking this book.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Product arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and was in perfect condition. No problems.
1582701709|5.0|I was thrilled about the condition of the book. It was like brand new,.I was also thrilled in the way that it was delivered. It was fast and here within a few days. I had been wanting this book for a Christmas gift and was able to give the person the book for Christmas. Anytime I need something I will becoming here frist to find it.
0743201140|1.0|I purchased this book a couple of weeks ago after hearing glowing reviews from a friend. I also checked out what amazon reviewers had to say before purchasing and was anticipating a valuable learning experience. I skimmed through the book, then decided to take the online survey. But when I entered the code, I was informed that it was no longer valid--had already been used. Now since I bought a new copy from Amazon, I can only assume that somewhere along the line another person knew what to look for and registered that code. Although I will still read the book and probably gain some insight, I was particularly interested in incorporating what I would have learned from the survey. I'm very dissatisfied for the first time in my long association with Amazon.
0307346617|1.0|I love talking about, reading about and watching movies about zombies, but this book was too painfully tedious to finish. This book was clearly not thought through, the personalities are awkward and the projection of Brooks' political views were trite and juvenile.    If your desperate for Zombie fiction you'd be better off trolling the MySpace pages of bored goth teenagers than reading this book.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|What can you say about the complete Sex and the City series except that it is very entertaining and leaves you looking forward to the next episode. The friendship bond that these women share is the most impotant theme, no matter what is happening in the rest of their lives they are always there for eachother. Nothing beats a good girl friend.
B000FP2OPY|1.0|The show is great. However, half of one episode skipped so bad we could not watch it. This was a new copy.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I had no idea this video would not play on a regular DVD player. Yes, I can read English, but I am technically challenged and didn't know the limitations. I have an HD TV, so I had no idea my regular DVD player would not work. I don't even know anyone with an HD DVD player, so this was a big waste of a lot of money, and I already opened the package so I'm stuck with it.
0790731002|2.0|I watched this picture last night on the Family Channel. BF is embarrassingly bad. Compared with the latest two releases (Hollywood's apology for the first four), Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, Forever doesn't hold a candle of any size. It's so over the top stupid and colorful that it resembles the campy Batman TV series of the late 60's. Jones' Two-Face/Dent has little substsnce; Carrey's Riddler is total Carrey, which may annoy viewers; Kilmer's Batman/Wayne is quiet and pretty much Kilmer playing himself. Often the viewer can't suspend disbelief because Batman's stunts are ridiculous. He drives the Batmobile up the side of an apartment building, for instance. I don't know what happened since the first, semi-serious, semi-goofy Batman picture (directed by weirdo elite Burton), but the Forever's director turned the series into something too campy to be believed in. Anyone who's seen Batman Begins and Dark Knight will appreciate my words here, because they ditched all the glitz and camp for a real Batman picture, filled with an oppressively dark atmosphere, sadistically vile enemies, and an actual story that threads its way from Begins to Knight and beyond. I'd skip this flick (and don't even start on Batman and Robin) in exchange for the awesome job done on the series reboot.

0553278223|5.0|In August of 1945 the power of the atom was unleashed on the world.  In a horrific display of power and energy a single bomb did more damage to a city than months of non-stop bombing to other cities.  A Few kilo's of matter released the energy in 12 thousand tons of TNT. The fossil fuel equivalent is equally staggering.  America and the allies had won the war and discovered a new source of energy that was thought to be boundless and cheap.   The late 19th century and up until this time there was incredible amounts of innovation and improvements in life. Radio, television, the automobile, flight, refrigeration, air conditioning, the diode and transistor, early computers.. Technology was expanding at an exponential rate.  Things that were pipe dreams less than 100 years before. like heavier than air flight, were everyday realities. The Earth was well mapped and it was obvious that there would be no more land discoveries on the Earth and people looked to the sky.  With technology increasing at a dizzying pace and a new form of energy that was seemingly limitless, many people thought that the colonization of space was right around the corner.  If we were running out of room on the earth, no big deal, just open a colony on another world.  However, despite all the good things, America and indeed the world, lived under the constant fear of nuclear war.      It's against this backdrop that an explosion of space exploration and colonization books were written.  The Martian Chronicles is a series of mini stories all interconnected  The book begins around the turn of the century with a manned mission to mars. The rocket reaches mars but is never heard from again.  It is just a single man and he is killed by a jelous martian husband.  The first few trips all fail in interesting various ways, but eventually success is reached and mars is colonized, much to the regret of the Martians. Ultimately, the book is more about humans and human behavior than it is about mars. The book covers everything from racism to mental illness to loneliness to nuclear war and it's aftermath. It shows us at our best and at our worst and disguises it as a book about mars exploration.  The stories are all very good and very well written and loosely connected, but connected enough to tell a bigger story.  I had a hard time putting this book down and I've read it three times so far and plan on reading it again.  Some parts are funny, some parts are scary and some are kinda weird, but it works great.  Get this book, you won't be sorry. It's one of the best science fiction has to offer. The only thing near a negative about this book is that it is not \\"hard\\" science fiction. But it doesn't really matter, because the science of space exploration is not really even discussed in the book. It does present a very different planet than the real Mars. But like I said, it's not really about Mars anyway.  A definite 5 stars!

B001EN71CW|4.0|There is definitely an improvement in the picture quality in this version.  The new special features are also cool and definitely nice to have new items.  The sound quality is better, but DTS HD Master Audio can sometimes have strange emphasis.  It can affect the voice tracks sometimes.  There's also a strange error that can occur after watching a couple special features.  On my player the screen would turn Green while I would hear the main menu soundtrack.  My IC's whent caput about a month after I watched this, so it's possible it was a TV issue and not an issue with the disks.  I have a Samsung BP-5000 with latest firmware, so I'm not thinking it was the player.      UPDATE: Still could be the player.  Replaced my Panasonic CRT HDTV (1080i) with a Samsung HL61A750 and will get this occasionaly.  Looks even better in 1080p.

B00197POXG|5.0|No doubt about it, the complete series of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman provides a wallop in good clean entertainment.  In all this series has forty-two discs and if you factor in the cost of the entire series you are looking at a tad over a dollar per episode.  Keep in mind there are three or four episodes on each disc, episodes you can watch time and time again if you so choose. The movies are also included.  I've read all the other reviews, agree with some points and beg to differ on others.  I'm giving this series five stars, not for its minor glitches, but for the series itself.  It's just plain old wonderful!<br /><br />The packaging was well thought out.  Each disc is firmly tucked in its respective pocket, each page is glued back to back with the next and therefore the discs seem tight.  I simply tuck a finger under the paper in the front, reach in with my spare hand and carefully remove the disc.  The ring bound book can be tucked inside an accompanying hard cover sleeve to really keep the dust and grime out.<br /><br />I like the fact that there is a good table of contents, index and brief summaries under each disc in the book.  If anyone can recall a favorite episode, it's easy to find!  Not being as familiar with the series as I'd only seen a few, I find that when I put a disc in and click for an episode there is a more in depth recap of each story.  They're all so good I haven't skipped one over yet.<br /><br />Glitches?  Well, I suppose you can find a glitch in anything if you look hard enough.  The only one that irks me can be easily remedied.  The voices are not in sync on many of the discs.  I opted not to return the series as it was a great buy.  I either rewind slightly or open my DVD player and put the disc back in.  That little move is an easy, quick fix and voila!  The voices are right back on track giving me my entertainment fix for the evening.  If you are an easy going person this \\"fixable\\" glitch won't bother you, but if you are a perfectionist it might drive you batty.batty.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|We have watched this movie over and over and over again.  My 3-year old and 1-year old both sit through the whole movie with wide eyes and smiles.  My 3-year old sings along with the songs and the little one is just amazed at the images.  They will sit through it twice in a row! A must-have family movie that you can watch all year round.

B001ECQ75A|3.0|Cute, entertaining DVD for child under twelve...Kung Fu Panda was a prized item under the Christmas tree...
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Unfortunately I wasted money on this movie in the theater against my better judegement.  I could have dealt with the hand-held camera perspective if you actually got to see something.  You never really got a good look at much worthwhile.  And you never found out what the monster really was which leads me to think that a part 2 is waiting which has no chance in my opinion.  The story was just awful, there was none.  If you want to watch a freaky movie check out The Happening.  Cloverfield has nothing to offer.
9056912445|5.0|The book is well written and has endings that you are most likely to see in a real game.Also,the explanations of each endgame are easy to understand and it really is a book that should be on any beginner,intermediate,and experts shelf.
1416562605|4.0|I have been waiting to read this book ever since I heard the Booker buzz and I was not disappointed. Although there are many books written by Indian authors showcasing the great divide that is India, this novel struck a cord like no other. Maybe it was the dark humor or the simplicity of the narration or the undeniable audience the protagonist commands. The chasm in the lives of the rich and the poor not just intrigues and captivates readers of the west but unsettles the heart of those who are from the subcontinent. This is evident in the number of critical reviews this book has received from many Indian readers.
0316017922|4.0|This book is an excellent read if you've ever posed the questions about success and upbringing that the author has on his mind. It's entertaining in this way, and makes some truly excellent points.     I'd like to make a couple of points about the presumptions of the book, though:    First, the importance of success in our culture is obvious, and of course, Gladwell never questions it. Success in career, and to a lesser extent money, is simply treated as everyone's ultimate goal. Obviously people want this for their kids, and the books best audience is the huge number of parents who want to raise their children in such a way as to grant them success. It's not exactly a secret to me that pure analytical intelligence isn't the only key to success, and Gladwell illustrates this extremely well.  Because success is so crucial to the material, the author could've spent a chapter or so really getting into the price of it. Many successful people simply aren't happy in my experience. They may feel that they are more important than others because of their value to the communities they inhabit, but whether or not that attitude is really beneficial to society isn't discussed. I love the opening story of the town of Roseta, and what it says about community involvement and health. Does it ever occur to Gladwell that, in a town made up mostly of slate mine workers and textile people, that the importance he places on success is irrelevant there, and probably better off for it?  This is America, and we truly live to work here. 'Community' in the sense of a place where we all can belong is an outdated concept, unfortunately. The desire for success that Gladwell exhorts so strongly is responsible for lots of great advances, and fulfillment to those who have greatly contributed to it, but it can also be seen as a blight on neighborly behavior, a personality defect for some that discourages modesty, self-sacrifice, and balance. Families of successful people fail at about the same rate as other families, if not greater, depending on what profession we're discussing. Raising children to be self-interested success machines isn't necessarily in the interest of our communities at large, and Gladwell completely disregards that concept with his glowing praise for KIPP schools. I understand why, but I can't agree. In this light, the book is geared at the type of family that already is, or is trying very hard, to raise their children in the manner of \\"concerted cultivation\\".     Second, and this is arguable I know: Chris Langan's views on authority and institutional policy are basically treated as the ravings of a depressed lunatic who doesn't understand the system he failed to manipulate in his favor. I know Gladwell thinks more highly of Langan than that, but Gladwell was treated better by the system, and so he naturally thinks that Langan is simply wrong.   He's not, as least not like Gladwell implies.  The higher education system has it's problems, and some people who've been deeply involved in it's inner workings know it. Gladwell, as a positive product of that system, should be a bit more balanced when he writes about it.   The problem isn't simply that Chris Langan was a failure in a fair system due to his people skills. Why should a student have to be such a charmer simply to do something as basic as switching a class or getting the forms for his scholarship reviewed? Why would any professor tell a student that some people \\"just don't have the intellectual firepower\\" to succeed at their subject? These types of behaviors on the part of teachers are disciplinary problems for them more than Langan. That great freedom and love of knowledge the author appreciates so much about universities is certainly lacking in some places and with some teachers, and it is completely beyond the control of most students. The system isn't fair to everyone, and not schmoozing properly shouldn't decide one's educational future.  In a way, Langan is right. Manipulating, Oppenheimer-style, the system in your favor guarantees that someone operating in that system will be in favor of preserving it, because it works for them. Truly rebellious types, those who have a real problem with authority, ARE frequently dismissed by that system, or are told to change their attitude. This is a natural way of preserving order. I just wonder how many insightful (but rude) rebels who would have made some real and necessary changes to the system at large have been dismissed due to that mindset in education.     On that note, lets remember something else about all of this: Genius shouldn't necessarily be exalted above everything else anyway. Smart people are just as screwed up as the rest of us, and they shouldn't necessarily have all of the opportunities and advantages we can possibly bestow on them. This is especially true anywhere that morality comes into play. Gladwell did say, when discussing the two prominent methods of raising kids, that neither was morally superior to the other, and what I'm trying to say is that our society's way of bestowing rewards on the different types of people those methods create has some inherent flaws that will eventually demand our attention.     There's only room for a certain number of true outliers in society, by definition. Someone needs to start a discussion on finding ways for the rest of us to live better lives. If Gladwell writes THAT, then I'll read it, and I'd love it if he started with the town of Rosetta.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I never heard of this band until I took a Continental flight last December.  They had a one minute \\"What's Hot\\" review.  They played Sex On Fire in the background and I knew I had to find this album.  I am so glad I did.  I love it start to finish.

B000X5SPBI|4.0|This was a short season due to the writers strike, 18 episodes I think. Some hated the new character Bela, I disagree. At least we got her for one season and the Bela haters got the satisfaction that she was killed off. I liked the extra humor that was obvious during some of this season's episodes. It is actually my favorite season of the 4 seasons, granted the current 4th season is only about half way through. The humor is mostly situational thank goodness and not dumb jokes [Dean normally has a pun or two anyway in all the seasons]- also Dean's time is up and its time to go to Hell, he made a deal with a demon, remember? Anyway its good stuff and there have been some great sale prices on this season. You don't need to see previous seasons to understand what's going on, in my opinon. Recommended - Steve

0956010903|2.0|The content of the book itself was wonderful, and as a Harry Potter fan I was really excited to see that J.K. had done it.  However I was completely disapointed with the quality of the \\"Collector's Edition.\\"  I realize that some of the proceeds would go to charity, but the faux jewels were missplaced, making the cover hard to close.  And the book smelled really funny...kind of like gasoline.  The regular Hard Cover is a much better value and still cute.

B000QB36LS|5.0|In The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath,    Esther Greenwood shares her most significant years of adulthood with thereader and gives an insightful perspective on life as she descends into madness  and finds her life put on hold for a mental illness that won't let her return  to her old life of academic excellence and writing. She didn't find herself  stimulated by the high-end parties of New York City's glamorous culture and  the idolized lifestyle that other girls her age strove to achieve, but her  experiences frightened and disoriented her. Esther becomes increasingly  depressed, and finds herself unable to sleep, write, eat or behave normally. She  checks into different institutions to help her   overcome her illness and she  progressively (with highs and lows) tries to return to sanity.    Plath's distinctive writing is a verbal feast with vivid imagery, accurate  diction, and original comparisons. Overall an enjoyable read, regardless of some  of the grim circumstances that Esther finds herself in (The Bell Jar is really   a thinly veiled autobiography of Sylvia Plath). It's unforgettable dark   and cynical humor as well as the thought provoking themes makes it well worth   the read.(Anna Kogan)
B001DTPZNY|1.0|A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, George Lucas was given a spark of genius which empowered him to write and direct such inspired classics as \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". Then, for whatever reason, the charism was taken away in the mid 80s and the man has spent the ensuing decades churning out mostly rubbish. Not only has he embarrassed himself with horrific new conceptions like \\"Howard the Duck\\", but he has debased the quality of his successful franchises with sequels and \\"prequels\\" of positively shameful inferiority. \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is the nadir of Lucas' artistic degeneration.<br /><br />Unbelievably stupid, boring and utterly without charm or suspense, this movie disgusts as well as insults the viewer. Figuring (correctly) that the public will pay to watch Harrison Ford pick his nose so long as the film has the \\"Indiana Jones\\" title attached to it, Lucas tied half his brain behind his back and produced something of truly historic worthlessness.<br /><br />Firstly, the inane storyline insults the viewer's intelligence. The \\"pre-Columbian\\" crystal skulls at the center of the plot are well known to be, in reality, 19th century European forgeries that were made to swindle gullible academics. That knowledge takes something away from the informed viewer's ability to suspend disbelief. What will be Indy's next adventure? Unlocking the secret powers of Barnum's Cardiff Giant? These action heroes like Ford and Bruce Willis also seem to get more ridiculously superhuman as they get older. I'm glad to find out that the phrase \\"nuke the fridge\\", referring to Indy's use of a refrigerator to survive a nuclear blast, has now replaced \\"jump the shark\\" to refer to TV shows and movie series that are so creatively depleted that they resort to the most moronic and implausible gimmicks to move their story along. Swinging from vines at the pace of a speeding automobile, riding rocket sleds and having anthropomorphic animals help the good guys are also great examples of the disrespect Lucas has for his audience.<br /><br />Whatever remnant of possible enjoyment that could have been taken from the movie was ruined by the insipid, cartoonish and completely convoluted script, the groan-inducing clich&eacute;s of 1950s culture, the smug, self-referential allusions, the irritating Shia LeBoeuf as Indy's love child, and the whole dopey idea of space (sorry- interspace) aliens sitting dormant in the middle of South America until someone returns their leader's head.<br /><br />I really shouldn't have written this much about this horrible film, but I am seriously outraged at how a great movie franchise was ruined by its own creator. Someone should just give George Lucas some crayons to play with in his early dotage and keep him away from Hollywood.s are also great examples of the disrespect Lucas has for his audience.

B001DTUU7A|4.0|There is a stunning difference in watching this animated feature on regular DVD and viewing it on Blu-Ray.  The latter dramatically elevates my rating of this movie, because the story is just so-so.  It's a nice story, but nothing that will leave you laughing like in \\"Cars,\\" or \\"Madagascar\\" or a bunch of other recently-made animated features.  However, on Blu-Ray, this is so flat-out awesome to look at, that's is well worth seeing and adding to your movie collection. The brilliant colors and razor-sharp images are just amazing and totally stunning!    Jim Carrey does a nice job as \\"Horton.\\" You might not even recognize his voice.  He plays a character who hears a voice nobody else hears; the voice of a little person on top of town which is on top of a little flower.  Hey, \\"size matters,\\" but far more important is the value of living beings regardless of their size.    The story is the typical frustrating one in which nobody believes the one who is telling the truth, until near the end, and then all of them do the right thing.  It's a good message, presented in a so-so story but a gorgeous one to watch on Blu-Ray.
B00005MP58|5.0|Both my husband and I love this movie and have viewed it many times.  We never get tired of watching it.  The actors/actresses are excellent and the character development is superb.  Great casting and location.  We would recommend this movie to just about any adult.
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet is not David Lynch's signature film; his signature film is Mulholland Drive. In descending order, my favorite Lynch films are Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, The Elephant Man,Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks: fire walk with me, Wild at Heart, Eraser Head, and Inland Empire.  Of his films, Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man have had the most access into the mainstream. Blue velvet lacks the hallucinatory structure of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or Inland Empire<br /><br />What makes Blue Velvet striking are the film's central characters--the setting's soft, virgin, and bright middle-class neighborhood juxtaposed against the hot, vulgar, and explosive psychopath named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). There is violence in Blue Velvet, but the film's violence is logical to the circumstances of the film's plot. In this sense, Blue Velvet reminds me of Cronenberg's History Of Violence: both directors--Lynch and Cronenberg-- are known for drowning their storylines in surreal--and often perverse--allegories. However, Blue Velvet--and History of Violence--is surprisingly conventional for Lynch.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't seen a Lynch film, Blue Velvet or The Elephant Man are good primer films. I can't recommend any of his other  films  to the uninitiated, especially to  someone who isn't into art films.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0982230702 BONDAGE AND DISCIPLINE, SADISM AND MASOCHISM: Zack's Odyssey Part 1]]

0060899220|5.0|I like Bourdain on his tv shows.  He has a bit of arrogance and holier than thou attitude, but if you watch aot of it is persona more than actuality, and he really is insightful, humorous and entertaining.    This book is just the same with the same qualities.  Yes, to some degree he can vcome acroos a bit roguh but ultimately this book is humorous, entertaining and eye opening.  Have there been other, probably better, expose on thee business?  Of course but that does not mean this book is not good in its own right.    Some of the things are dsiturbing, but most things about restaurants can be.  I know I ejoyed this and my cousin, who has sepnt many years in the restaurant business, enjoed it as well when we were discussing books.

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I have to admit I was a skeptic.  I was not a huge fan of ABBA growing up but after the broadway show came out, which I did not see, I started to think maybe I will give it a shot and see what it is about.  I like musicals.  I sat down on a cold January 4th and watched it.  I love it!  I think my favorite part of the movie is Dancing Queen.  I loved how the older woman carrying sticks on her back just threw them down and joined in the fun.  By the way, the other reason I wanted to watch it is because it has Colin Firth in it.  Not bad on the vocals.  As for Pierce, back off people I have heard a lot worse.  I think it catches you off guard more than anything.  I have watched it twice now and even the second time, I really don't think he sounds that bad.  It says a lot throwing yourself into a role that is completely different from what you normally do.  He took a chance and had some fun.  I like this movie.  Guess I need to check out the Broadway production sometime.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|2 1/2    One of the dreaded \\"rocking comeback\\" discs you hear about your old favorite bands producing, only to witness its faded out, rather limited glory and realize how comparatively tame expectations had become over time. I try to keep an ear on these old chums, but gloating reviews of course thrust higher expectations then logical. The release is a perfect encapsulation of the musty, distort-chord rock they are doing functionally well these years- perhaps even to the extent that there are no great songs but all decent ones. To expect any real hard hitting melodic power of yore would be a mistake.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Purchased as a gift. Arrived before Christmas,  Person receiving gift is very much into Lost, very interesting series, always makes you want to know what is going to happen next.  Has been hard to wait for new season to begin.

B000003TAW|5.0|I recall \\"Buddy Holly\\" as the first Weezer song I heard.  I was unsure as to whether I like it or not.  It was too catchy and poppy.   But then I realized it was fun and I found myself humming it.  As I heard the other songs on the radio I decided I actually like Weezer and bought the recond.    The album is pop ear candy with catchy melodies and music - the  chorus of the then overplayed Buddy Holly is a good example.  But this makes the record one that is just a great one to put on.  But there is more to the record than just pop and the lyrics are very good and are not pure pop candy and delves into stories.    The record an interesting mix and is just not another pop album or Buddy Holly.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|OK, so Pierce Brosnan doesn't have a great voice but I admire him for putting himself out there for a couple songs and he did a decent job.  Far better than I could have done :) I like the CD because it has most of the songs from the movie and it captures the happy, intoxicating sheer joy of the film.  It makes me feel good when listening to it.<br /><br />At my sister's suggestion I bought the Best of Abba album first and I did enjoy that.  Their voices are better, but it just didn't capture the spontaneity of the movie.  I've been playing this music all day.  My favorite tracks are:  Honey Honey and I Have a Dream, sung by Amanda Seyfried, Mamma Mia and Dancing Queen by Meryl Streep and Take a Chance on Me with Julie Walters.<br /><br />It's an album that'll make you want to get up and dance!

0765360969|4.0|This is the first book I have read by Brandon Sanderson. I was expecting a routine fantasy novel, but this is story has some unique features and some well done characters. Sanderson creates a bleak world devastated by falling ash (though the source of this ash is never explained, perhaps it has something to do with the defeat of the Deepness). At night, the ash-blanketed world is covered by swirling mists which hide strange and dangerous creatures. The world is dominated by an immortal, all power Lord Ruler. Unfortunately, Lord Ruler is completely ruthless and his empire oppresses all the common people, who are called skaa. Opposing the Lord Ruler is a Mistborn named Kelsier, who is half ska, half aristocrat. (This is a bit murky - to imply that someone is halfbreed implies that ska and aristocrat are different species, but clearly it is only their political standing that separates the two classes.) Kelsier has a secret plan for overthrowing the Lord Ruler and liberating the ska.    Enlisted into Kelsier's crew is Vin, a teenage girl who possesses undeveloped magical powers. The magic system in this book is called \\"Allomancy\\"; certain people can ingest metals which they then \\"burn\\" in their bellies. As long as there is enough metal to burn, the Allomancer can display such powers as super powerful senses (enhanced hearing, sight), super strength, the ability to control metal at a distance (just like Magneto, the X-Men supervillan).     The Allomancy magic system appears to have a lot of thought put into it. Given the established constraints of his magic system, Sanderson sticks to the rules and has thought out some unique ways of using the powers. (I especially liked Vin's novel uses of Allomancy in her attack on the Lord Ruler's castle).     In addition to Allomancy, Sanderson describes a parallel magic system called Feruchemy. The practioners of Feruchemy use metals inside the body as batteries for storing up abilities such as strength. (A Feruchemist will spend days of lying around weakly, while charging his strength battery. This will allow the Feruchemist to use that stored strength at a later date in a time of great need.)    Besides his unique magic system, Sanderson also describes some wonderful intimidating villains in the form of Steel Inquistors. These fearsome servants of the Lord Ruler are powerful Allomancers who somehow survive despite having giant metal tusks driven through their eyes and out the back of their heads. It doesn't make any sense, but it is a nice image that would look good in a movie or graphic novel adaptation of this story.    Other neat creations are the mistwraiths, which seem to be a lot like the gelatinous cube monster from Dungeons and Dragons. Mistwraiths shamble along through the city, absorbing the bodies and bones of corpses; reusing some of the absorbed limbs and faces for its own body.    Although this is apparently the first novel in a trilogy, it works as a stand alone story. Rather than leaving the reader with a cliff hanger ending, Mistborn works well as a complete stand alone tale. Nice of an author to give you a whole story without trying to get you to buy 3 books. Mistborn was good enough that I will now look for the second one in the series.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight will be talked about for years to come. This Batman movie was a hit. Heath Ledger was absolutely amazing. Loved this movie.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I loved this soundtrack because I loved the movie \\"Twilight\\". The music just reminds me of parts of the movie....guess I am a \\"Twilight\\" lover.
B000N3SSBM|4.0|I bought this movie on a whim, it was a good movie and the picture was clear as well.
B001KMB6YG|3.0|This actually isnt a bad movie at all. I thought as an action movie it did what it was supposed to do, and the story was actually kinda intresting. It was enough to keep me wanting to see more then Vin Deisel beat up, which is more then I expected from this.<br /><br />Acting wise, I've seen better, and Vin Deisel is not the greatest actor in the world, but it still tolerable enough that you eventually completely forget about it, with the exception of a few scenes where it was just down right bad.<br /><br />Like I said, the story was good, right up until the end! I cant believe the ending of this movie. It looked like it was gonna be this great climax full of car chases, explosions, betrayals, and all that good stuff, and then we end up with credits right at the peak of the final act. I mean seriously, what happened here? Its like that writers just got so worn out figuring out the story that they just said screw it and called it a wrap. I wont spoil it if you intend on watching it, but there are a lot of things unanswered and undone that take this from a 4 star movie to a 3 star. A good rental, but its more of a discretion thing if you want to own it.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|Righteous Kill is like watching a rock band's reunion tour. Initial excitement to see them perform again washes away from the realization that their best years slipped away.<br /><br />Stunningly, 13 years appears to have made all the difference because it was Michael Mann's 1995 [[ASIN:B0006J28KU Heat]] that left film fans hungry for more. Heat marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, albeit briefly during the nearly three-hour film.<br /><br />Here De Niro and Pacino spend the entire film side by side and while the run time is about 100 minutes shorter than Heat, the effects are quite the opposite. They are weary. So are we. They are tired. And so on... The been-there-done-that-before story and leaden pacing are simply too much for two Academy Award-winning actors to save.<br /><br />Righteous Kill is a much larger disappointment to fans of the genre because it comes on the heels of two recent crime dramas that each won Best Picture - [[ASIN:B00118T63C No Country for Old Men]] and [[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed]]. Unable or unwilling to rise to the challenge, screenwriter Russell Gurwitz seemingly mined for gritty dialogue and rough sex in [[ASIN:6305245487 Death Wish]] sequels.<br /><br />My advice is that you skip the De Niro-Pacino reunion tour and re-watch one of their better works:<br /><br />De Niro and Pacino - the aforementioned Heat and [[ASIN:B0018CMJSU The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset]]<br /><br />Pacino - [[ASIN:B00004XPPB Donnie Brasco (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0000AM6JI Carlito's Way (Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />De Niro - [[ASIN:0790729725 GoodFellas]] and [[ASIN:B000C20VPA Casino]].

B000777J2S|5.0|I think this album is amazing. You feel how the artist is just letting his audience into his world, might be painful, might be sad, sometimes lonely, but definitely beautiful. I have listened to Cohen, am a fan of Nick Cave and Tom Waits (not to mention Metallica, Sigur Ros, Radiohead, etc. -so I am not only into singer-songwriter stuff I generally like good music), however I recognize they don't let you peek into their world as much as Antony does. I shared the song \\"You are my sister\\" with a younger sister that I have been trying to re-connect with and this beautiful song has had the power to get us closer. All songs are superb. I recommend \\"fistful of love\\", which spoke to me about physical abuse during childhood and how love has the power to heal old wounds, the introduction by one of my heroes (Lou Reed) is a definite plus. I did not know you before \\"I am a bird\\", Antony, but I am glad now I do. You speak from your heart with your lyrics and music and that is definitely the gift of a genuine artist.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I originally bought this on DVD, not Blu-Ray.    I usually don't like watching a series because I don't want to be constantly glued to the tube.    To say I was mesmerized with this production would be an understatement. I have never watched TV this long in one day before but I watched the entire series (I believe it is 11 1/2 hours long) on ONE SUNDAY. Went to work tired the next day because I didn't finish until midnight.    When you see the actual men that were portrayed in the movie at the end it really strikes home.    I asked my son who has his own place if he wanted to watch it after I described it to him. He had already heard a great deal about it. After a month I asked him why he hadn't watched it yet. He and his friends are waiting until they also can devote an entire day to it - not my idea - their own.    I decided to let him keep it and get myself another copy. When I saw that Amazon had the Blu-Ray version for the same price that I paid for the DVD copy I ordered it right away.     Hmmm.... Maybe this Sunday. And this time in Blu-Ray!
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|I first saw this film on an overseas flight and loved it. I watched it twice. The cinematography is stunning, the story sweet, light & at times emotional.

This beautiful, stylized film has great imagination, visual beauty and heart!

I truly recommend this video to ANYONE that wants to give it a try!!  Who doesn't have 25 mins to devote to their self?  I didn't think I did, and here I am now...after the first week I lost 2 lbs..I got sick so I haven't been able to work out like I was at first, but now I am getting back on pain train!

1433502410|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is the best I have used so far. I highly recommend it, but advise that if you want to understand the Bible, that you firstly read it without notes and guides.<br /><br />If you read it prayerfully, as if it is the Word of God, I believe you will find that it seems to be, clearly claims to be and ultimately proves to be indeed from God himself, though written by men.<br /><br />Over the past 3 years or so I have read through the Bible seven times in seven different versions, including the TNIV [updated NIV Bible], a special presentation of the TNIV called \\"The Books of the Bible\\", The New Living Translation, 2nd edition and the Good News Bible, Australian edition. Each of these is well worth reading, and better if you read it alongside other Bibles.<br /><br />I have also read the ESV Reformation Study Bible, the NIV Archaeological Study Bible and the New Jerusalem Study Bible and have found each of them worth reading. The Reformation Study Bible is useful for coming to grips with Reformed Theology and some Bible background. Zondervan's Archaeological Study Bible is a great help in digging into the Bible's background [whoops!], but fairly light on theology. I like the way The New Jerusalem Study Bible uses the Hebrew words for God, such as Yahweh, Shaddai and El Elyon, though mercifully it does not use Elohim, but renders it as \\"God.\\" It also has many interesting renderings of words that you have become familiar with in the many Bible versions which seek to follow in the Wyclif-Tyndale-KJV tradition. But its study notes are written from a critical position which assumes that the Bible is fallible and not God's inerrant Word, and these notes did not help me to get to know the divine author any better.<br /><br />The ESV Study Bible has 2 million words, 750,000 of which is the biblical text itself. It has a wealth of useful articles, resources, many terrific maps, introductions to each section of the Bible and each Bible book and extensive study notes on the ESV text.<br /><br />It has taken me from 3 to 6 months to read through each of the other seven versions, but be warned: if you really want to read this whole Bible through [which I enthusiastically urge you to do AFTER you've read the Bible without study note help], it may take you about three years, based on my experience so far. This would be well worth doing, but you will need to plan it. There are excellent charts available from the producers of the Bible on their website, which also contains the compelte text of the Study Bible and makes ploughing through the many Bible references in the articles much easier to do.<br /><br />What are you waiting for?aken me from 3 to 6 months to read through each of the other seven versions, but be warned: if you really want to read this whole Bible through [which I enthusiastically urge you to do AFTER you've read the Bible without study note help], it may take you about three years, based on my experience so far.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Lee Pace is brilliant. You will want to watch this over and over again. A visual delight.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Everything Is Illuminated tells the highly interesting story of a young Jewish man, Jonathan Safran Foer (played well by Elijah Wood), who travels to Ukraine from America to find the woman who rescued his grandfather during World War II. The acting is rather convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace; I was never once bored and I enjoyed the humor which comes mostly at the beginning of the film. The cinematography is excellent and they did a fairly good job, although not a perfect one, of adapting the real life Jonathan Foer's book into a movie.<br /><br />When the action starts, Jonathan, who loves to collect things so he won't forget his past, comes to Ukraine and meets his \\"guides,\\" a rather crabby old man (Boris Leskin) and his grandson Alex (played brilliantly by Eugene Hutz). Boris and Alex also have with them the grandfather's \\"seeing eye b*tch;\\" the grandfather claims he is blind but of course he's really not sight impaired at all.<br /><br />It isn't long before they start heir journey to the small village named Trachimbrod where Jonathan's grandfather was rescued by Augustine, the villager Jonathan hopes very much to find. They get lost along the way and get hit up by a small kid demanding chewing gum before he'll clear the way for the car; and the scenes in which Jonathan has to sit in the rear of the car with a dog he's afraid of are very funny indeed. I also agree with the reviewer who writes that as time goes along Jonathan and Alex's two personalities balance each other out very well and in some sense Alex does become an older brother for Jonathan.<br /><br />Eventually they get started in the right direction after all. Of course, questions arise. Will Trachimbrod be built up again after the Germans wiped it off the map during the war? Will they find Augustine and be able to thank her; or will they find a relative of Augustine's instead? What happens when a very deep secret of the grandfather's is finally revealed toward the end of the film? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras but not as many as I would have liked. The film's soundtrack has some pretty good musical numbers by Gogol Bordello.<br /><br />Overall, Everything Is Illuminated is an outstanding motion picture that I highly recommend. It will have special significance for the Jewish community and persons studying the era of World War II. Great job, everyone!folks--watch the movie and find out!

B001KW0C96|2.0|I rented this movie to watch Deniro and Pacino.  Carla Gugino played an interesting, if limited, role as Deniro's twisted girlfriend.  Her predilictions make the age difference work.  John Leguizamo (sp) and Donnie Wahlberg are completely wasted talent in this poorly written piece of absolute crap.
0553382152|5.0|This is an excellent book which gives you a glimpse of heaven as seen by Betty Edie who lived a near death experience.  It gives you faith if you had none and increases your faith and hope in this world and eternity if you already had faith.  Easy reading  I hightly  recommend this to anyone who has lost a loved one or has fear of their own death.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|From the opening credits to \\"The End\\", this is one of the creepiest films ever created. It's a stunning achievement from film master, Alfred Hitchcock. It's all so picture perfect: the silence, the music, the paranoia, everything. Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh give outstanding performances, and the plot twist at the end is absolutely horrifying. This is a horror classic that should never have been remade.<br /><br />A+
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I was afraid I might be disappointed in this movie, but it turned out to be really worthwhile.  I have no children, but as an adult I enjoyed this very much.  It doesn't have quite as many \\"side jokes\\" for adults as something like Shrek, but there are still a few very funny moments.  The animation is very good.  I watched in on computer screen and the picture was extremely clear.  Animation has come a long way through the years and this is just about as good as it gets.  The soundtrack is nice, the choice of voices is excellent.  I got a real hoot out of Carol Burnett as the voice of the cranky kangaroo.  Of course it helps if you know her work. Jim Carey was outstanding as the voice of Horton.  Not a boring moment in the movie and something that an entire family can enjoy. Even the teens will probably like this one.  Reluctantly give it 5 stars, as it is more like a 4 1/2 star, but wanted to offset some of the lower reviews.
B000003N7K|5.0|Sometimes the stars and planets just come into alignment. This is one such time. Hartman owns these classic songs. As for Coltrane, you have to be kidding me.

B000TSIK14|5.0|The Scorpions released yet another awesome album. Klaus Mein's voice continues to reach hieghts no one can cover while Mathias and Rudolph blaze the spectrums with their powerful guitars yet bring tranquility to the smooth balads giving the band that perfect balance. Kotak maintains his percussion perfection while Palo's bass proves him worthy of a second album. I feel blessed to have followed the band for over 25 years and get just as excited each and every tour to California.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|PLOT   A tired and sore Batman contemplates his ability to continue protecting the city. Is there a suitable replacement patriarch of law enforcement? Are there others that care for Gotham as he does? Or are there only two-faced lawyers and psychotic jokers?    REVIEW   \\"The Dark Knight\\"...a bright day for cinema in the 21st century. If your friends haven't convinced you already, allow me...    First class writing, directing, cinematography, special effects, sound, editing, music and overall production...and a seemingly endless pool of acting talent...drag the comic adaptation genre further into the limelight. Perhaps you thought the recent \\"Superman Returns\\" failed in this regard...perhaps you even thought \\"Ironman\\" failed...    \\"The Dark Knight\\" triumphs.    Not just for an action film could the plot be considered dense and intricate, but for any film. The characters are carefully drawn and their interraction with each other is gripping. At a deeper level, the film makes several daunting but ultimately uplifting comments on social reality. A scene involving the fate of two ferries, one full of citizens and one full of prisoners, is especially memorable.    I can't praise the directing of this film enough. Christopher Nolan is Hollywood's prodigal son. He hasn't suffered the same false starts that have befallen other promising young directors such as Paul Thomas Anderson and Sam Mendes. Ever since \\"Memento\\" (2000), he's kept our eyes glued to the screen.    SPECIAL MENTIONS  Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan for Writing.  Christopher Nolan for Directing.  Christian Bale for Acting.  Heath Ledger for Acting.  Aaron Eckhart for Acting.

B00005QGAV|4.0|Dangerous by Michael Jackson could easily be his best album, better than Thriller. Michael sings his heart out and this album contains some of the best guitar riffs I have ever heard thanks to Slash from Guns N Roses. Songs that still have me hooked are: Give Into Me, Who Is It, Will You Be There, Gone Too Soon, In the Closet, Black or White, and Jam. After the release of this album, Michael's career was never the same but at least this album has stood the test of time. Enjoy!
B000000XCH|5.0|Simply put - this is an excellent album.  The best version of \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" that was ever made.
0375826726|2.0|I finished this book wondering who did the horrible job of editing it.  I had problems with the pacing, the blatant over explanation of character motivations, and violence in a young adult market as well.  The stunning lack of logic and grasp on how people interact with each other was evident throughout the book.  The characters of course aren't always human and shouldn't necessarily use human reasoning, but they weren't even consistent within their own personas.  I got the impressions the other characters existed only to worship the two main characters.  This book should be a big hit among the none too bright, self absorbed teen boy crowd.    One of the opening scenes set the tone for much of the book.  I'll paraphrase for brevity:    Boy: I want to do something stupid and selfish that only I can understand the reasoning for.  Girl: But we need you because you are uber! Have you no honor?  Dragon: Boy is explaining poorly, let me rephrase his lame motivation in my dragonly amazing way.  Girl: K.  Your astoundingly stupid reasoning has swayed me.    Characters consistently flip flop on their ideals and motivations just so Eragon can continue through his sociopathic adventures with constant adoration.  I suspect Paolini has fallen into the trap of viewing his world, only through the eyes of his protagonist.      The books are getting worse instead of better.  If you're going to have this level of violence, then there's no reason to put up with such simplistic character development and flimsy plot devices.  Move up to George R.R. Martin or Steven Erikson and get intelligent gory books.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|I purchased this dvd for my 17yr. old son for Christmas.  He loves the movie and so does everyone else in the family. It arrived in plenty of time and in perfect condition.  It included the bonus disk also.  Very happy with this purchase!
B000QQH4YS|5.0|Yes, on the surface, it may seem like just another sci-fi/action movie. But this is one thats a lot smarter than it seems at first glance. exploring themes of humanity, violence, media, and corporate greed, its just as relevent now (if not more so) than it was at the time it was made.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I do not understand many of the other reviewers. How can they be so cruel in their reviews. Anyone who expected \\"Raiders of The Lost Ark\\" here was going to be disappointed. This is a sequel not a remake. Many years have passed, so there will be major differences. However, we all came to see Indiana Jones, and we did. He has not changed at all. He is older, perhaps a little grayer, but still Indiana Jones. He gave us what we paid for, mindless entertainment. Personally, I found this movie better then second movie (Temple of Doom), and on par with the third (Last Crusade). I do not feel disappointed in any way shape or form. Were there creative liberties taken, of course there were, just as there were in the first, second, and third movie. Anyone who expected to come to an Indiana Jones movie and not see the absurd is certainly living on another planet. This is a wonderful franchise, but, it's not real. This franchise takes place in an imaginary world, universe for that matter. I read where someone questioned the aliens. I am shocked that anyone might react that way. This movie is great. I am sooo happy they made a 4th one, and I hope they make a 5th and a 6th, so on and so fourth. It's just like Rocky, everyone    wanted to hate Rocky 6, but the story was Rocky, and people loved it anyway. This is the same with \\"Crystal Skull\\" It's Indy all the way, get on board folks, let down the blinders, take a look at the forest and not just the tree's, you might realize this is a great movie.     Rod.
B000XG5J0M|5.0|The story is great.  Yes, some may call it a bit obvious at times, or even predictable, but I found it to be a great story for a long daily commute.<br /><br />Plenty has been written about the story itself, so I'll mention the things I found important with the audio CDs.<br /><br />One of the things I have come to love about certain mastering processes with these audio books is when they let you know the disc is over.  And not only that, tell you which disc to put in next.  I know, I know; I should simple put the next disc in, ha ha.  But when you are driving 70 MPH on the freeway and the coffee hasn't kicked in yet, this little note of the next disc's number is very helpful, especially when I have 4-5 discs scattered about the passenger seat.<br /><br />The narrator did an amazing job of being consistent throughout the book.  Good numbers of narrators experience character inertia (where the character's voice trails into non-dialog), but that doesn't happen here.  No long pauses to get out of character.  No mispronounced words.  No forgetting the characters' voices (like I have experienced from others.)  Just a good story with good characterization and the right amount of inflection at the right time.<br /><br />The reading was passionate, without being overacted or cheesy.  The characters' voices were pleasant to listen too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for long drives, short summers, or even while you work.

031606792X|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this series to me, and I decided to read the first one - reluctant because of all the hype surrounding the series, but willing to give it a try. (I am a huge fan of the early Anne Rice vampire chronicles, and couldn't imagine teenage vampires who sparkled).  However, I read the first three books in three days, entranced by the world Stephanie Meyer created in spite of my early reluctance.  Not having the fourth book on hand, I came to Amazon to order it, and attempted to read some reviews without spoilers, which proved impossible.  I am going to attempt to write one now for those of you in my shoes.<br /><br />In this book, Stephanie Meyer continues the adventures of Bella Swan, picking up where the third book left off.  The romance of Bella and Edward continues in the thread that Meyer set up in the previous three books.  There are some unexpected twists, just as Meyer has taken in the earlier books, which in my opinion keep the series interesting.  Meyer creates some new conflicts to be resolved as well as revisiting unresolved conflicts from the established mythology.  The journey introduces several new characters many of whom could have their own book. Of course there is danger, mystery and more reasons to be on the edge of your seat - unsure how the author is going to get her characters through and unsure if you should hope or despair.<br /><br />In my opinion, the series begins with Twilight being serviceable and interesting enough to make you want to keep reading.  The second and third books get increasingly better and remain intriguing, romantic and unpredictable. This fourth book is the best of the series and worth every minute, every penny and every page.
B001F12J48|1.0|I own this movie in 3 versions: HD-DVD, DVD, and now the 3-D DVD. That is how much my family enjoys the Polar Express. The 3-D effects on this are UNWATCHABLE, double vision, bad color, etc. It literaly gave me a headache. I tried to watch it on 5 different dvd players and 3 diff. TVs and no change. I am very disapointed and wish I could return it. Get the regular DVD or BluRay (or even HD-DVD if you still have a player) instead.
0452289963|5.0|Tolle's book A New Earth is an advanced read.  It is not for intellectually challenged people.  Read it and you will see what I mean.  It really strengthened my Christianity.  This is not at all an attack on Christian values.  It is an awesome book that when read with an open mind, will enhance your life.  A quick warning though, stick with the book through the first 100 pages at least, after that the reading becomes easier.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|Spielberg could have left well enough alone (and he would have if he had stood his ground), but no, greed prevails, and the result is this lame ending to the Indiana Jones quadlogy (is that a word?) Mr. Spielberg confesses in the bonus features interview that he was somewhat coerced into making this movie, and aside from  enjoying the money he made from it, I'll bet that he regrets making it. It's DUMB. The villain is played by...Cate Blanchett. What??? I'm not a male chauvinist pig, but sorry, Blanchett just doesn't cut it as a classic villain, which is what the Indiana Jones legacy calls for. And she has BAD HAIR. And, you know, I wish I could look as good as Harrison Ford when I'm his age, but he's just too old to be reprising his famous role. And then, the end...spaceships. SPACESHIPS...in Indiana Jones??? Ridiculous!! What's the next movie going to be that Spielberg is forced to make at gunpoint? \\"Indiana Jones vs. Alien and Predator?\\"     Mixing classic archeology/religious history with outer space sci-fi is like mixing oil and water! Doesn't work--sorry.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Emily Perkins is positively captivating as the quirky pregnant teen, Juno (or \\"June Bug\\"), in this off-beat and somewhat tragic comedy. I enjoyed watching her screen tests in the special features almost as much as seeing the same scenes in this delightful movie.<br /><br />The simple music, mostly singers accompanied by one or two adequate guitars, has an edge that makes perfect sense once you've seen the movie all the way to the end.<br /><br />There's a lot of subtle social commentary among the laughs of this film that I'm sure I'll see several more times.
0385338600|4.0|I am not sure if this thought is elsewhere, but I believe that the title of John Grisham' book, \\"A Time to Kill,\\" is inspried by another titled \\"A Time to Speak,\\" by civil rights lawyer Charles Morgan, who passed away on January 8, 2008. His book was published in 1964. Maybe Grisham can confirm?
1439102813|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" by Lisa Genova is a unique book, one that offers readers an inside look at living with Alzheimer's.  It is a beautifully written book, at times poetic in its images of what is happening in the main character's brain.  It is fast-paced and hard to put down, but due to its subject matter, it is a difficult book to read; a heartbreaking account for anyone who has a loved one who suffers from this bewildering and devastating disease.<br /><br />Alice Howland is a cognitive psychology professor at Harvard University, a popular professor and speaker, an expert in linguistics who relies heavily on language not only to teach but to know who she is as a person.  When she begins forgetting things, like a word she needs in the middle of a presentation, or where she lives when she's out on a run less than a mile from her house, she knows something must be wrong with her.  She fears the worst would be a brain tumor, but is not prepared to learn that she has early onset Alzheimer's.  At first she keeps her diagnosis a secret from her family and colleagues, but the day comes all too quickly when she must tell them the truth.<br /><br />Her revelation is devastating for her family, but in many ways it brings them closer together, even while Alice's mind causes her to drift further away.  Those who are familiar with the disease will recognize and understand the changes in Alice, her inability to retain storylines or even remember who her children are.  It is a sad story, but one that is beautiful and unique in its depiction of what Alice feels watching all that she has known and loved slip away until she will no longer recognize it as having been a part of her life.  \\"Still Alice\\" is poignant, heart-breaking book that is hard to put down and even harder to forget.

B000BYA5GO|5.0|Great movie. If you like Nicolas Cage this is a keeper. Other cast is great too. Exciting movie plus lots of drama, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Cage is an arms dealer and goes all over the world selling weapons to people in war zones, getting in & out of situations you wouldn't believe. And meanwhile he has to try to keep his family life together. I definitely recommend this movie, a thriller you will want to watch more than once.
B001EN71DQ|1.0|I grew up with the first (last?) three installments but these three newer efforts are not worth the time or money.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Before I watched Wall-E I thought it was going to be just another silly children's movie. Well, it is a children's movie, but it is an adult's movie, too. There are so many adult issues touched on in this movie, I was pretty surprised. There is no nudity, no language not suitable for young children; no situations not suitable for young children. Wall-E is a blast to watch, it is fun, it is sad, it is 'boy meets girl, boy falls in love, boys loses girl,' etc. It is so fun to watch you are sorry when the movie is over, and you wish there is more. I highly recommend this movie for everyone. I am so glad I made this purchase!
0312360266|5.0|I started reading this book right after i finished the twilight saga, so I didn't Think i would even be into it...little did i know that it was such a great book!  Lemmi break it down for you...its basically about this girl named zoey who gets marked as a vampire..and has to change schools and goes to the house of night school to live and complete the change there...she basically goes throught a lot of exciting things. And i reccommend this book and the whole series for that matter to anyone who likes vampire books. Zoey has a very juicy life and its very intersting to read...so give it a try...i cant wait for the 5th book! :D
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie is a classic. Jim Henson had a hand in it, and it is about a small looks like a teenager-type male who has to take a crystal shard to heal a larger crystal that is being controlled by these evil and UGLY larger characters (and I DO MEAN UGLY) called Skeksis. If he doesn't get the shard to the main crystal in time the world will blow up. Although this movie could be watched by children, and enjoyed by them, I think it was mostly made for adult entertainment. There are a lot of adult concepts. No nudity, no language, no situations unsuitable for children. This movie is a lot of fun, and the Henson characters are amazing, they are so beautifully done. Great movie, a great addition to any library.
B0000844M8|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a child and just fell in love with Elsa the lion. When I found it was on DVD I had to purchase it. It is a classic and if you love animals you will love this movie.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|This is a movie with a great surprise ending. It is very different all throughout. Surprising things happen all through the movie, it just keeps you going and going. It is a violent movie; if you don't like violence you won't like this movie. Great performances by the actors, incredible and believable. But you have to watch it more than once to catch everything, there is so much to SEE. Fast moving, oh and did I mention the great ending? hahahah This is one for your library FOR SURE.

B000BCE918|5.0|All 3 Jurassic Park movies are so exciting! All 3 have basically the same theme: dinosaurs are trying to eat people. Ha! The first one is mostly about a T-Rex & Raptors trying to eat people; the second one is T-Rex & Raptors again but this time they try to bring a male T-Rex & a baby one back to San Diego on a ship; and the third one is about a kid who is parasailing over one of the islands with dinosaurs on it, and gets marooned there and his parents and some others go there to try to save him. Needless to say it is ALL the people who need saving, and from all kinds of dinosaurs. Even the flying kinds! All three movies are GREAT!!! Excitement all the time, not for weak stomachs! Lots of fun! Good stuff!
B000002LIR|4.0|This four CD box set covers Rod Stewart's career up to 1989.  It features most of his hits, with the biggest exception being \\"Ain't Love a Bitch\\", which was a #22 hit in 1978.  There are also many notable non-hit songs from throughout his recording career.  The collection does a good job of covering all aspects of Rod's musical history.  Most of the songs are good, but there are a few I don't care for.  Still, the good songs far outnumber the bad songs.  Very good collection.
0312383320|5.0|PLUM SPOOKY !!!   According to the Oxford English Dictionary,  \\"One monkey arouses a great deal of amusement.  Two or more then double the...amusement.  If one were to release a barrelful...of monkeys, we must suppose that their antics would become hilariously comical.\\"  And that's exactly what Janet Evanovich delivers ... the hilarious laugh-out-loud moments that we've come to expect in the Stephanie Plum series.  Janet's ability to endow pets (Rex, Bob and now Carl) with those seemingly human characteristics that we all know our own pets have is just one of Janet's remarkable talents that endear this series to her fans.    The Jersey Pine Barrens provide an exceptionally spooky setting.  The Piney's and Diesel's \\"unmentionable\\" cousin combine to give us one of the scariest Plums we've seen in awhile.  But have no fear, at long last, we see how much Stephanie has grown professionally since her initial escapade as a Bounty Hunter and, finally, she saves herself while at the same time exhibiting the warmth and concern for both her loved ones and her FTA's that we grew accustomed to in the earlier books.  Steph is genuinely fearful for the missing woman and the barrel of monkeys.  She goes right to Lula after a middle of the night call for help and goes above and beyond a girlfriend's call of duty when her hot and sexy Italian boyfriend, Morelli, is stuck in one of those family-moves-in situations we all dread.  Stephanie and Morelli continue to grow closer as the love they express to each other matures and Ranger's dry, sarcastic wit and concern bring back warm memories of the first book in the series, \\"One for the Money,\\" and Professor Higgins.    If you haven't yet experienced the magic of the Stephanie Plum series, join the fun and start here.  A perfect read for a cold and snowy weekend or a get-a-way vacation to a Caribbean beach.

0618918248|5.0|There appears to be a discord between who Mr. Dawkins wrote this book for, and the manner in which he conveyed his thoughts.  In the preface, Mr. Dawkins asserted that his goal in writing this book was to raise consciousness, especially of those \\"people who feel vague yearnings to leave their parents' religion and wish they could, but just don't realize that leaving is an option.\\"  Mr. Dawkins also repeatedly asserted that as the consciousness is raised, which is particularly the case in the highly educated and intellectuals, the need to solicit religion for answers to life's basic inquiries subsides significantly.  Therefore, it wouldn't be a stretch to assume Mr. Dawkins believes at least a majority of religious people are neither intellectuals, nor highly educated.  Mr. Dawkin's further asserted, \\"the religiousity of today's America is something truly remarkable.\\"  From that statement we can surmise one group of his target audience is Americans, one in four of whom didn't read a single book in 2006 (Associated Press/Ipsol poll of Americans' reading habits).  This group also has an average reading level of 8th to 9th grade (University of Utah Health Sciences Center).  All of this begs the question why Mr. Dawkins refused to \\"dumb down\\" his rhetoric.  Afterall, many of the people he hopes to influence are neither highly educated nor avid or very skillful readers.  Yet, he stubbornly retained his professional prose in presenting his ideas, as effective and eloquent as they were.     Mr. Dawkins also failed to present a conclusive explanation of why humans appear to be \\"psychology primed for religion\\" (religion chip in the brain).  Mr. Dawkins proposes that as children we are programmed to defer to, and accept direction from adults.  Rather than experience how dangerous it is to venture near a cliff or swim in crocodile infested waters, we can avoid them altogether by accepting the consequences of such potentially harmful acts from adults.  The propensity to accept religion, therefore, is a misfiring of such a tendency, or a byproduct of such a phenomenon; accept instructions of a higher power because it benefits you.  Reject them and suffer the dire consequences.  While on the face of it, this seems like a strong hypothesis to explain why the human psyche is so receptive to deity, further examination of Mr. Dawkins' idea brings to light issues that may have been overlooked.  For starters, the idea that children act in deference to adults is a stretch.  From a very young age, e.g. 1-2 years old, children often act in defiance of their parents, primarily to establish their own identity.  There is even a term for this stage that most parents are all too aware of:  Terrible twos. This defiance magnifies in the teenage years.  It is not until well into adulthood when descendants finally realize their parents have some useful advice worthy of serious consideration.  Most protections afforded to children are, therefore, not a consequence of children accepting and following directions from parents.  Rather, they're the result of parents facilitating and steering children, often forcefully into situations that helps them avoid danger, e.g. young children can rarely spend time without adult supervision.  They are not allowed to consume alcohol (a rule that is commonly ignored), and they must be put into car seats before being transported in a vehicle.  Try advising a child of the consequences of not using a car seat, and see how accepting he or she will be of your very useful advice.    According to German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, all humans possess \\"the will-to-life\\", defined as an inherent drive within us to stay alive and reproduce.  The will to life has at its core the principle of immortality, and at its root the \\"selfish gene\\".  From ape to human, we took a giant leap forward in developing consciousness and suddenly became keenly aware of our vulnerability and mortality.  The idea that death spells the end of us was swiftly rejected and replaced with (apparently, we developed a healthy imagination early on as well) idea of an imaginary friend(s) who would guide us to immortality through the afterlife.  In essence, we created God(s) because we rejected death as an end, and also as a means to cope with all the random and undesirable sh*t in our nasty, brutish and short lives (Thomas Hobbs), especially during an era without Dulce De Leche Hagen Daaz (anyone who's tried it knows what I'm referring to).    Once consciousness developed, no longer would the immortality of the selfish gene suffice.  Death is a state that is neither consciously, nor subconsciously desirable to a conscious being.  Humans are social animals.  Without the afterlife, death is perceived to offer a state of eternal solitaire.  Most humans free of serious mental and/or physical pain also find joy in living life.  Death deprives us of all of the joyful events, such as love and watching our kids grow up.  Religion nicely reconciled the immortality need of the consciousness with that of the selfish gene, and religious ideas a few thousand years ago didn't seem as preposterous as now, e.g. earth is 6,000 years old.  Consequently religious ideas took root early on and their influence has continued to persist, although we can argue with all of the scientific discoveries about the origins of the universe etc., the influence of religion is on the decline.  How receptive would our minds be to religion if we'd transformed from ape to Homo sapien accompanied by the knowledge and technology available today?    Despite these flaws, there is no denying that Mr. Dawkins succeeded in presenting arguments that raise the consciousness regardless of whether the reader agrees with his arguments or not.
B0011Z3334|5.0|Wow fantastic album all around! I so enjoy this album mostly the great female vocals and the solid basslines
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is a great mini-series.  I have the original and now the Blu Ray version.  The Blu Ray enhances what is already a great DVD set.  The picture and the audio are a lot clearer and much more crisp.  Also, this was by far the best price on the market.  If you are a fan of Blu Ray then this DVD series is a must for your collection.
B00111YM5G|4.0|This is a dark tale of loyalty, truth and heartache. Gabriel is sure to be a cult classic. The film's style is similar to sin city, but the plot is not lost in the action. A great film.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I have always quite liked Abba songs though not such a big fan that I know all the words! My mother in law made me watch this movie and I have to say at first viewing I was struck mostly by the fact that everyone seemed to run everywhere and they were all hyperactive! I didn't expect much singing ability because lets face it...they are actors not singers. I did enjoy it the first time but never thought I'd see it again.   Well, 2 days later after finding that the music would not leave my head I decided I must watch it again to get it out!!! Well, I have to say I loved this movie on the second watching! If you just let yourself go with it it is great fun. Pierce Brosnan seems a better singer..maybe because you're expecting it this time. They all seemed better. I found myself laughing with the movie rather than at it. I think once the surprise of seeing such well known dramatic actors singing abba has passed you can look at the movie for what it is...a fun bit of entertainment!  It will never be considered the best movie ever made but it is the most enjoyable one around at the moment. I highly recommend watching! Many times!
B0012Q732O|3.0|I was a litle disappointed in this movie. The trailers made it look like it was going to be an exciting movie to watch, but I found it a bit boring. I wouldn't call it a \\"B\\" rated movie, but it isn't an \\"A\\" either. The story was good, the acting OK. Would have liked it better if there had been more interaction with the creatures.
B001E1GXPA|5.0|Trivium is a killer band. they play the most complex metal that would have wannabes fleeing in terror. one thing I did not like about the DVD is that it was a spoiler to the music on the CD. people compare this band to Metallica, but it does not sound like Metallica. Trivium's music is more heavier and complex. Matt Heafy has a variety of vocal styles on this album, rather than one vocal style. they should have put the lyrics in the booklet rather than on the website. minor complaints aside, these guys know how to ROCK!
B000Q67876|5.0|I have 3 versions of the Shawshank Redemption; the DVD, the Special Edition DVD and now the BluRay version.<br /><br />This movie is my all time favorite movie - with a few others following closely behind it (like Blade Runner). I absolutely love the story; basically it's the innocent man put through so much peril only to succeed in the end, but in this case, it's so much more..  the story has so many aspects to it, showing the various personalities and more importantly, showing us how people change as they grow older and (hopefully) wiser.<br /><br />Technically it's a good movie, nothing to blow your skirts up, but most definitely worthwhile.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed \\"Mamma Mia.\\" I don't like to watch movies much these days because I am really hard of hearing. My youngest son bought me earphones to use to watch and listen to the news and my favorite programs. So when he brought home \\"Mamma Mia,\\" he insisted I could watch the movie with the family. He even played the words to the song at the bottom of the screen. What fun we had!    After he played the movie one time, all the great-grandkids (we are a multi-generational family in this house) clamored for him to play it again. So he did. I think we had more fun the second time watching the movie and singing along. I never watch a movie a second time, so this was probably a first for me but I did it because we were having such a great time. Can you imagine one movie bringing such joy?     My great-grand-daughter is an American Idol fan and plans to sing on the show one day. She showed me how she will perform with the song \\"Mamma Mia.\\" She might win.    Anyway, the story. I didn't like that the children had to hear about how Meryl Streep slept with three men in one summer and didn't know the father of her child. The rest of the story was entertaining in showing us how the daughter \\"found\\" her father. After the movie, we all talked about our favorite song. Mine was the women throwing down their laundry and other work and joining the women's right-to-have-fun song (that's what it looked like to me). It was fun watching them all dance the same movements. I loved it!    We all loved the singing and dancing. It was a really happy movie. I'm glad my son made me watch it!
B000P1KTW8|5.0|Being a long time fan of the Boss, I had to get this BluRay for my collection.<br /><br />The songlist leaves a little to wish for, but it's definitely acceptable. The technical quality of the disk is amazing, it absolutely blew me away with awesome audio and great video - a must have for any Boss fan.<br /><br />Of course it's not like being at the real deal (only been to 4 of his concerts, although none in the US), but it provides a nice dose of a near-concert feeling.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|An actress named Nikki (Laura Dern) is plunged into a nightmare universe of alternate identities, time-warps, and inside-out reality after she takes a part in a cursed movie. At least, that's what I get out of it. Dern is incredible in this nearly one-person show. All others, including Jeremy Irons and Jason Theroux, are incidental at best. Ms. Dern carries this 3 hour (4 hrs and 15 min. when  bonus \\"more things that happened\\" is included) trip through wonder-hell. David Lynch has fashioned his best dreamscape yet! The logical trappings give way early, leaving us disoriented and confused. Add in a deep sense of dread for an utterly insane experience. If you happen to be a Lynch-virgin, I would recommend starting w/ ERASERHEAD and working your way through DL's catalogue before jumping into INLAND EMPIRE...
B00168OINK|5.0|I take it you like cartoons - otherwise you wouldn't even consider buying this movie. This is on of the funniest cartoons around, packaged with the old recipe of an underdog having to perform greatness in order to succeed.<br /><br />Panda/Black has to excel in the art of kung-fu in order to save the \\"world\\" (see the resemblance to Star Wars and Luke having to learn the ways of the Force to defeat Darth Wader).<br /><br />OK, back to reality.. the storyline is great fun with multiple elements, making it worthwhile for the adult audience, but also easy enough for even toddlers to enjoy. (On a side note: I do find it amusing, how many cartoons try and inject us with a bit of morality, although here it doesn't ruin the movie.)<br /><br />The graphics is at an amazing level of quality, as is the sound scheme.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this movie to the cartoon lover of all ages.
B0017HRCQU|4.0|I was happy with my purchase...the rating of the quality was right because the only part of the product that was damaged was the box but contain everything inside and the movie was factory sealed.  Only flaw was I wasn't able to locate my shipping and wasn't sure when I'd receive it, but I eventually got it 3 weeks later
6305313687|5.0|First off: this movie is brutal.. VERY VERY brutal. Normally I don't like brutality in movies unless they add to the storyline, and in this case, it absolutely does. It's not brutality for the sake of brutality, but it's brutality for the sake of enhancing the story - and it shows.<br /><br />OK here goes.. This movie is such a masterpiece about racism that it should be mandatory viewing in high schools. It shows both sides of racism, why some people become racists (I don't believe you're born a racist, but that you become one) and why racism is so wrong. Yes, at one point you almost find yourself sympathizing with mr Nortons character, but then you realize what he's doing and you feel disgusted and are glad when he changes and once again becomes human.<br /><br />The most scary part of the movie is, when you realize that these kind of people are really out there, amongst all of us...<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece - a true \\"must see\\" movie.
006112429X|2.0|With such an interesting topic and some parts of this book being as gripping as they were, I don't know how Shriver managed to put forth such an otherwise boring book.<br /><br />I thought a book centered around a tragic school shooting told from the perspective of the mother of the shooter would be an extremely interesting and thought provoking book.  However, most of the book was centered around the mothers life before Kevin or when Kevin was very young.<br /><br />Even this may not have been an issue had his mother not been such a self -centered bore.  I do understand that Shriver was trying to show how her self absorption  may have been a cause for Kevin's psychological issues but in my opinion the chapters dragged  leaving the reader not to care as much as they maybe, should have.<br /><br />The book only started getting interesting when Kevin was a little older and the reader was finally able to see some of the psychological issues he had.  The end was enthralling and the areas where Shriver wrote in present day with Kevin and his mothers visits were engrossing, however the rest of the book fell flat.  So flat, in fact that I found myself skipping around trying to get to the interesting parts. I don't know if I will be reading anymore of Shriver's work.
B000VS6R26|2.0|Wow, 3+ of the longest hours of my life.  Got dragged into seeing it with an \\"ex\\" and the family.  It's everything the detractors say: maudlin, syrupy, manipulative, poorly written, cliché and contrived.  We all know the damn thing is going to sink at the end.  Titanic, the ship, took what--45 minutes or an hour?  Titanic, the movie, took over three hours.  A lot of talent wasted.  Two stars for the beautiful recreation of the doomed ship's probable appearance.     When this film was released, I worked in the public schools.  For a year had to endure 3rd  grade girls singing, in all earnestness, \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" at cheesy school talent shows. And being played on every classroom boom box.  Like gagging on a bottle of Splenda.  Avoid at all costs.
031606792X|3.0|Why have I been dreading this review you ask?  Because although I read this book back in August when it first came out I still do not know how I feel about it.  It seems as though all die hard fans of the Twilight saga either loved 'BREAKING DAWN' or hated it.<br /><br /> I am somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />From the beginning I knew that this final installment was going to be nothing like what I expected, and because of that I found it, on the one hand impossible to put down, but on the other hand emotionally draining causing me to do just what I didn't want to and put it down. Everything from the tone of this novel to the subject matter was a far cry from what we have come to expect from this amazing series which, I guess, is why so many readers were turned off by it. The second half of the book, however, seemed to bring the reader back to the basics of the series and definitely picked up from there.<br /><br />Stephenie Meyer said that this is the story she wanted to tell from the very beginning. Which leads me to believe that 'NEW MOON' and 'ECLIPSE' were no more than an incredible after thought thrown in because the book deal.  Unfortunately those two books set a tone for the series that 'BREAKING DAWN' didn't quite fit with. This is why I give 'BREAKING DAWN' 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br /> This was an amazing series and made the summer of '08 my \\"Twilight\\" summer and for that I am grateful.
0375842209|5.0|I read this book in my book club and was so impressed by the story that I bought copies as family gifts for my children. I believe it has the potential to become a classic.

B000V86OKG|5.0|I absolutely love this show!  For anyone already into Dexter, this season was great!  Can't wait for the third one to come out on dvd!  For anyone interested in crime-type shows, this one is a great one!  Highly recommend this product.
B001ED7C58|2.0|I borrowed this CD from the local library (which I usually do before I purchase an album), and I'm glad I didn't buy it.  With only one or two good songs, this CD wasn't worth buying or listening to more than once.  It's not horrible, but it's not good either.
0743497465|3.0|As a fan of Dan Brown's later works, I looked forward to reading this book. But, in order to fully enjoy it, I found myself forced to suspend all sense of reality and just go along for the fast and sometimes impossible journey that the two main characters of the story must endure. I love a good conspiracy, and this book is created around the premise that NASA, faced with an onslaught of criticism for its failures, is forced to create a major success for itself in order to continue to be funded. The conspiracy is created, it is assumed, by the head of NASA and other senior government leaders (including possibly the President) when they announce that they have found proof of extraterrestrial life embedded in a meteor that crashed into the Arctic several hundered years ago. However, the flaws in the plot become rapidly exposed and the two main characters have to overcome unbelievable odds to alert the President to the truth. But the conspirators take a number of actions to prevent this message from getting to the President. This is where it becomes ridiculous. The two heroes survive a variety of attacks that should have been fatal including falling off a glacier into the icy cold ocean, being shot at by sharpshooting secret agents, nearly drowning in a deep sea underwater exploration vehicle, as well as surving multiple attacks by a heavily armed attack helicopter. But, I couldn't put the book down because I simply had to find out how the story ended. It's a fast read, with just enough technical accuracy to make most of it seem somewhat possible, and, as with Brown's other books, well written with characters that have a little bit of depth. It's bubble gum for the brain...tastes good, but has no nutritional value.
B000068OCS|5.0|This is a solid, very well made artistic film about modern life being out of balance.  It is similar to Baraka... yet it somehow has a clearer impact.  Noticeable are the VERY impressive transitions from each shot to the next.  Very well thought out and brilliant editing of the various shots.<br /><br />It is so refreshing to watch a real movie after years of Hollywood tripe and drivel.  This is that rare thing to find - a real movie, with really brilliant editing, a clear message and awesome execution.  You will not find silly, pointless plots here or immature sitcom pratfalls.  This movie tells the story through the use of powerful visual images set to stimulating yet minimalist music.  This is not simply eye candy - there is a deep, well thought out theme going on throughout.<br /><br />It is pretty clear after watching this that humans, though they have advanced... have also created a strange nightmare land that enslaves every person caught up in it.  The wonder and awe of technology is there... and yet it becomes clear that, in many ways, it has gone much too far.  Overpopulated, caged, frantic, nightmarish, absurd.  There seems to be a kind of \\"middle path\\" possible where technology and the planet can be in balance... things are currently \\"out of balance.\\"  I won't spoil it for you... however the final transition where the stock market floor turns into the NASA rocket is epic.<br /><br />One of the best films I've ever seen, on par with RAN or original Solaris.
0345495004|4.0|Like the hidden image on the cover design, this book was more than what it initially appeared to be. The story centers around the famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright and the long affair he had with the wife of one of his clients. I initially read the book thinking it was a historical novel based upon the architect and a fictional character. Her actions and disregard for her own family angered me the more I read, and the ending of the story enraged me for what I thought was a stereotype for the arsonist who destroyed one of Wright's houses and killed one of the main characters. But, after reading it, I did a little research and learned that the events described in the book, particularly the conclusion, were all factual and really did occur. This changed my perspective from one of anger to one of appreciation for a well written and engaging true story about two people who were not particularly nice to those around them, but enjoyed a long and mutually beneficial affair of the mind and body.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These things are surprisingly lightweight, they dont color the sound or distort at high volume, nor do they distort at high frequencies.<br /><br />They look extremely delicate but usually last over a decade.<br /><br />If someone were to ask me \\"whats up?\\"<br /><br />Id reply \\"sony mdr-v7506's are up.\\"
B001KMB6VE|2.0|I normally like Vin Diesel and I'm a big fan of sci-fi but this one just didn't work for me.  The story line <no spoilers> is set sometime in the future against a series of backdrops that mix high tech and grunge.  Something like Blade Runner, just not as well done.  A mercenary, named Toorop (Diesel) is supposed to transport two females from some kind of convent in Russia to New York City.  The younger of the two females is the package, the older one is her handler.  As the journey unfolds you discover that the younger woman possesses some kind of mysterious traits (no spoilers).<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that you spend so long in those dark, depressing scenes that it really takes a toll on the pace; worse yet, you never really get an engaging story line.  It's plotted more like a video game.  The group gets attacked, Toorop fights.  The group gets attacked, Toorop fights.  And though the human interest part could have made the movie tolerable, it too falls victim to all the dreary grunge scenes.  In the end you feel like you spent two hours watching a gun fight in a junk yard.  Just not my cup of tea.
B000268QB2|4.0|very decent cd.  You can almost feel the emotion of the singer spill out your speakers
032147404X|4.0|worth it if your are interested in learning a bit more. i would suggest buying a couple/few photo books to get different opinions and ideas- different people learn from different sources. but great book...
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|this is a awsome product once again you get hilarious comentary from linkin park, get to see their beautiful house for recording this cd how they put together the cd.  If you have the cd then I probably wouldn't buy this for the comentary.  If you dont have the cd buy this .....right now!!!

B001CSS4V6|4.0|Incredible and delightful. This was a perfect movie to watch on blu-ray. The adaptation was a spectacular rendition of the childhood story that captivated the entire family. It was dazzling and fun to watch. I recommend it to everyone.
1439102813|5.0|I ordered \\"Still Alice\\" because of the subject matter, because my mom has Alzheimer's and though not the early Alzheimer's that Alice has, my mom was in that story as an older Alice.  She is in Stage 7 of this debilitating disease and now in Assisted Living.  To be able to read and more clearly understand Alzheimer's from inside the victim rather than from a professional's viewpoint or as a previous caregiver was very emotional for me.  I do not know how long my mom went undiagnosed but I do know the struggles, fears, confusion, and trauma she experienced before diagnosis.  After reading this book, I understand better how scary this must have been for her.  How hard she tried to maintain control over 'hiding' what was happening to her and she learned to do that very well, and the affects this has had on her family as we watch our mom who isn't our mom but still is our mom slowly taken over by Alzheimer's.  I recommend this book to anyone who may have a family member, friend, who is diagnosed with this disease.  Because Alice is a professional person, very educated, Alzheimer's is better understood by the reader.  I commend Lisa Genova for authoring this book, for what I believe to be an accurate accounting from inside an Alzheimer's victim.
0312383320|5.0|I don't know what some other readers were expecting from this book but I thought that it was extremely funny. I laughed so hard that I cried. I have been reading Janet Evanovich's books for 20 years and some are really good and some are not too good but this one is very funny! Just because a book is in hardcover and costs almost $29.00 should not decide how much you like the book. Wait until after it comes out then buy it from a used dealer if the price is so important to you.
0307269752|4.0|Finally got around to this book after hearing much buzz about it for a while. I grabbed it from the library's speed read shelf before the holiday and read in a few days. It's not too simple but not terribly complicated either. Stieg Larsson was a talented writer and knowledgeable about his material. He details Nazi associations, investigative journalism, private investigation and security firms. It delves into the financial media, a wealthy Swedish family and and forty year-old unsolved mystery. A sixteen-year-old family member disappeared and the patriarch enlists a journalist to look into the case.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist has become entangled in a libel suit and his professional future is bleak. He's contacted by Mr. Vanger regarding this family case. There's more to it than that as Vanger knows something about Blomkvist and everyone feels they can help each other monetarily and otherwise. There's also an intriguing young woman who has tattoos and is the best private investigator in the country and get can information about anyone at anytime. Lisbeth Salander is also damaged and barely trusts anyone and this case will be way more personal than she may be able to every handle but will also bring her and Blokvist very close. While the crimes are cold, chilling, creepy and frightening, Larsson deftly writes the story and keeps you turning the book's pages.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I don't normally care for country, but I have friends who rave about Taylor Swift, so I thought i'd give it a shot. I can't stop listening to it! Great CD! It's been so long since i've found a CD that I enjoy completely. Definitely recommend this album.
0307265730|4.0|Loved this despite not particularly liking to read short story collections that much. I just never have really appreciated them. This is the first that I have really liked in a long while. She's such a colorful, thoughtful writer and I like that all the stories tie in to one another and come back around in some way. They also all relate to Massachusetts in some way. And I kind of dated an Indian guy (ten years younger than me) and I have very fond memories of him and think of him from time to time-- he was very sweet and an excellent kisser plus tall and thin.
B00168OINK|5.0|Great movie. I bought it so that when we have parties over the holidays, the kids would have things to do. They absolutely love it. Even I like it. The Blu-Ray visuals are simply amazing and the story conveys simple lessons that kids can understand, although they'll probably forget it the next day anyway (*sigh*, kids). The only disappointment was the lack of special features. Those are all for kids to watch, so there are videos that show you how to use a chopstick and  the cultural reasons why these particular animals were chosen.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|Coldplay gives us more tracks from the recording of \\"Viva La Vida\\". The beginning is a continuation of \\"Life In Tecnicolor\\", this time with lyrics. The captivating sound is further explored with great lyrics. The album continues with 4 new songs not included on the album, along with a remastered version of \\"Lovers In Japan\\" and possibly their best song \\"Lost\\", this time with an added verse from Jay-Z. Its a great album, with some new songs, at a really good price.
1416595546|3.0|I ordered this book really looking forward to it. After all, it had a lot going for it that promised a good read -- Russian history, a young adult diving into political conspiracy, love stories, etc.  Reading the cover flap had me all excited.      Reading the actual book, though, was a let down. The beginning of the book jumps every few pages to a different set of characters, almost all dialogue with very little description or action, not spending enough time with any of characters for me to really feel engaged. Each jump just left me feeling progressively more detached from the people and the story. Moving forward in the book, there just wasn't anything that grabbed me strongly enough to rectify this.     The actual plot of the book is incredibly interesting, and the historical backdrop add an excellent context -- but the execution just didn't work for me as a reader.
B001IAH9X2|4.0|This was another case in which the book and the movie (which I saw first) both met expectations, which is quite a compliment.  The movie is stunning in its cinematography and simplicity but the book was just as good, if not better.    Tracy Chevalier \\"paints\\" a picture with her prose as eloquently as the photographers did in the subsequent movie.  It might sound like a reviewer's cliche, but you do feel \\"like you are there.\\" In this case, \\"there\\" is 17th century Holland, and in the home of famous painter Johannes Vermeer.    It's one of those rare cases where I would recommend seeing the film first.  You then have a  portrait in your mind of the main figures and the picturesque area. Since, admittedly, the film was slow-moving, I was worried the book might be dry....but it wasn't.  It was fascinating.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just bought this DVD a couple days ago and have only done the level 1 workout once because my calves were so tight it hurt to walk afterward. But let me tell you this is one awesome workout!! By the end of the 20 minutes my arms hurt (I like pain when working out, it makes me feel like I'm really working hard). But when I woke up the next morning my entire body was sore; I'm talking EVERYTHING: Abs, arms, legs, shoulders, butt, etc. It was a wonderful feeling to know that this quick 20 minute video worked out my entire body. It's been 3 days since I first did the video, but my calves are back to normal today so off I go for round 2. I just have to remember to massage my calves afterwards.<br /><br />I can't wait to see how firm I am in a couple weeks!!!
B0015OKWL2|3.0|The movie is worth a watch or rental if you haven't seen it.  But if you love it and want to buy it, you might want to spring for the target version as that comes with a free digital copy of the film as well as a trial version of RIGHTEOUS KILL: THE GAME on a bonus disc.  i have not tried either as of yet.<br /><br />As for the film, it's pretty good, but nothing great considering the two lead actors and a very good supporting cast.  This crime thriller has one of those 'twist' endings, but the problem with the twist is that it is rather obvious as to WHO the serial killer is.  While that disappointed me, i still enjoyed finding out the WHY or WHAT it was that motivated the person to do what they did.  Besides the great cast, that part of the story kept me interested and entertained(for the most part) to the very end.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i found the extras on the dvd to be just average at best.  There's a standard documentary on the making of the film, a feature on cops and corruption, some trailers, and a commentary with the director.  All worth a watch probably once, but i actually had trouble sitting through them.  Others might find them fascinating though.<br /><br />Overall, i bought the dvd(without seeing the film first) cause i'm a fan of DeNiro and Pacino but i was a bit let down with the final results.  I liked it and will hang on to my copy, but can't help but agree with most that this could/should've been a lot better than what it was.  3 1/2 stars for the film, rounded down to 3 on amazon cause the extras are so average to me that it hurts the dvd.  In other words, i can easily recommend a rental, but not a purchase.  But like i said, if you've seen it and love the film, then go with the target version for extra value.

B000UBMWG4|1.0|You can pretty much see HUNDREDS of reviews regarding Blade Runner on Amazon.    What I'm adding (as are others) is to currently NOT BUY the 5 Disc Blu Ray from Amazon.com. There _are_ production issues where the 1st disc is actually the 5th disc. It is labelled as the 1st... but its not. It is the workprint.    So... as much as the price is enticing, I'd consider long and hard before attempting a purchase before these issues are resolved.     BTW... the movie is 5 stars, easy. My 1 star is for the actual PRODUCT.
1416509798|5.0|[[ASIN:0141439610 The Woman in White (Penguin Classics)]]    Murky figures emerging from the darkness, confused identities, heroic heros and multi-dimensional villains--this novel has them all.  With a plot twisting and turning like a snake, Collins' novel is a compulsive read and a fully satisfying one.
B00005221M|5.0|The only bad thing I can say is that on the dvd release there is a line missing that was on the vhs, and that line just happen's to be one of my favorite's.    Hawkeye: My father warned me about you...   Cora Munro: [interupting] Your Father?   Hawkeye: Chingachgook, he warned me about people like you.   Cora Munro: Oh, did he?   Hawkeye: He said \\"Do not try to understand them\\".   Cora Munro: What?   Hawkeye: Yes, and, \\"do not try to make them understand you. That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense\\".     There may be a few other thing's that were cut, but when I got the dvd that is what I noticed. It says a lot about the movie that the lowest review it recieved was mainly because this line was cut out of the dvd.    You can feel the wildness, the savageness of the country they travel through. You can almost feel the fire on your face, the straps of rawhide cutting into your wrist's, and the damp air of the cave survivor's hide in waiting to be found or passed by. The only certainty that you have is that no one is exempt from death as you wait to see who survive's. The love story is there, definitely, but it's not the focus of the story. A revenge seeking native, attacking french force (that have bigger gun's and more of them), and rebeling colonials lead the watcher to a satisfying end. It takes you through the entire range of emotion's, leaving an ache in your heart, but a smile on your face. Loved it.
0786886811|2.0|I'm not an amateur baker (worked in a bakery, bake almost every day, am comfortable with complicated and multi-step recipes) and I found this cookbook frustrating and unreliable. Firstly, it's difficult to find many of the ingredients the recipes call for, including self-rising cake flour (which isn't sold in American grocery stores) and many types of preserved or candied fruits. Secondly, I had consistent difficulties with many of the recipes. Although Lawson says this book is for the novice baker, she neglects to include many techniques that you need to know (such as tempering eggs for brulee, the proper way to handle egg whites to avoid deflation, etc.). I saw on an earlier review that there are some discrepancies between different versions of the book that may account for some of the problems. Also, while Lawson has a point that baking shouldn't be intimidating, it's the most technical of all the types of cooking, the one where measurements and technique matter the most. There a few bread and cookie recipes that I'll hand on to (her hearthbreads are good, and so are recipes like Italian cookies that are basically foolproof).   Overall, purchasing this book just isn't worth it when there are so many other great dessert cookbooks out there, and it especially shouldn't be your first dessert cookbook, unless you want to give up now. I recommend Martha Day's excellent 500 Fabulous Cakes and More (another British baker) instead. It also has a range of sweet and savory baking recipes that are consistently reliable with clear instructions that are easy to read and follow. If you're like me and are just interested in desserts, Nancy Bagget's All-American Dessert Book is another good one. I definitely don't recommend Lawson's book for new bakers, but if you're determined, you might have better luck buying the UK version and converting the measurements instead of buying the US version.
0061122416|5.0|This story is enjoyable, fascinating and it evokes pleasant emotions without being emotional. Read this book if you want to relax and drift away to a different world for a while.
045122499X|5.0|World Without End is the best book I have ever read. It will keep you spellbound throughout its entirety.  I could not put it down.  Ken Follett knows how to engage his readers and hold their interest by making his characters come alive with true to life emotions.  As other writers bore you with descriptions you tend to skip over, Ken knows how to put you right into the scene and make you feel a part of the action by blending descriptions into the storytelling as an important part of the whole.  Don't look at the size of the book.  Believe me, you will wish it, too, was wihout end.

B000000NN1|4.0|Originally released in 1975, this looks to be his third solo effort - didn't know (until now) that Vangelis was a member of the Greek progressive band, Aphrodite's Child. Hadn't heard this CD in ages, as I've never really kept up with his work that much. Liked this ageless neo-classical / New Age title more so than I remember. Both tracks here - \\"Heaven And Hell, Part 1\\" and \\"Heaven And Hell, Part 2\\" - clocking in at over twenty minutes each. Jon Anderson (Yes) provides the vocals on \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\" - a portion of the Part 1 cut, I'm sure I used to hear that song on late night FM radio many moons ago. Thoroughly enjoyed this CD reissue's beautiful symphonic passages that manage to take the listener(s) by surprize. Should appeal to fans of Patrick Moraz, Yanni, Tangerine Dream and Mike Oldfield.
B000IMV4IW|5.0|I can whine and moan and complain like other reviewers about which songs should have been included but were skipped or that Be Here Now was omitted altogether from this compilation, but everyone has to understand that this CD is merely a concise sampler of Oasis's career from 1994 - 2006. People that are interested in buying this CD probably don't want to own an Oasis album and simply want to own the songs they heard playing on the radio back in the 90s or are trying to see if spending money on Oasis's back catalog is \\"worth it\\" from a sampling of their career. If either is the case, this CD will suffice. It includes many songs that showcase why Oasis was one of the most popular British rock bands in recent history and, since most of the songs come from their strongest albums, will give buyers their money's worth. Enjoy!
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Just saw this movie yesterday.  Great movie.  Clint Eastwood is at his best.  His role as a korean war vet is excellent.  What makes this movie so great is his acting.

B000002L5P|5.0|This album recorded so long ago, should merit No.1 of all time.  If it were not for a \\"competitive world\\", of breathtaking music   it would be! The flamboyant Morrissey, prancing around the stage   with a bush of flowers in his back pocket....who can beat it?  Johnny Marr playing his beloved Fender Telecaster, perfectly in  time, complete with mirror sunglasses...who can beat it?    Let's not forget Andy Rourke laying down the bass lines, impecable  mixture of notes, arpeggios and chords...who can beat that?  I cannot fault one single song on this album. If you love the Smiths. you  might understand. It is a fascinating progression of songs that will leave  you wanting to investigate the rest of the Smiths' catalog of excellence.  And for the record, Amazon has the best selection for anyone to chose from.  [with the price factor added it's worth investgating].
0312383320|1.0|I have read all of Janet's book.....BUT I can't get through this one. Today I closed it half way through and thought ENOUGH. The story line is weak,if there is one. The characters are goofy, but not funny. It was just a big bore, Sorry Janet..this just isn't you...ghost writer maybe?  Save your money fans!
B000003TA4|5.0|Kiddies, back in the 90s when you were born, this album came and swept the rock listening public off its feet. It was aggressive, immediate, and catchy. When this album came out and rotated heavily through the media outlets (radio and MTV, no MP3s or Internet back then!), a flood of bands arose in its wake trying to recreate and imitate the sound so perfectly captured here. It's as important a rock album as Never Mind the Bollocks, London Calling, Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper, and Thriller. There has yet to be a band to release something so dynamic and refreshing and groundbreaking as this.

1439102813|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is one of the more compelling novels I've read in a while.  It pulled me in on the first page, and I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  The story then lingered in my mind for days.       The central character of the novel, Alice Howland, is a middle-aged professor of psycholinguistics at Harvard, married with three grown children.  In the first chapter (\\"September 2003\\") she is experiencing some minor forgetfulness, but as the chapters unfold (one chapter per month) the memory lapses intensify, and she is ultimately diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.     What I find most fascinating about \\"Still Alice\\" is how, even though the novel is written using fairly conventional third-person narration, the point of view is at all times strictly that of Alice.  The reader only sees and hears what Alice sees and hears.  It's as if the reader is inside Alice's head, hearing her thoughts, and learning how she perceives and reacts to what is happening around her.  As the disease progresses, the reader experiences, seemingly first-hand, the range of her emotional responses: confusion, frustration, anger, panic, isolation.  Later on, when Alice begins to have real difficulties in identifying familiar faces and everyday objects, the reader is faced with some of the same difficulties, because the people and objects are described as Alice sees and understands them.  There are a number of chilling moments when the reader realizes before Alice does that there has been a major cognitive breakdown.  I was truly impressed with the author's technical skill in making this rather unusual narrative format work so effectively.    The story is, of course, heartbreaking.  But Alice's spunk and determination provide an upbeat reminder that although we may not be able to win all of life's battles, we can certainly summon up our courage and fight those battles with dignity.      I highly recommend this book.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|After winning the 2008 edition of the cultural phenomenon that is \\"American Idol,\\" David Cook became an instant icon. And now, he has continued to live out his dream with the release of his self-titled debut album.<br /><br />As a whole, Cook tends to interweave and alternate the typical rocker style he has become known for with a softer, more melodic approach. While the standard rock feel works very well for Cook, it is a little more difficult to take him seriously as a power ballad kind of guy. Although he can pull this off, listeners can identify his unfamiliarity with the style. But, with the type of talent this guy has, he's got plenty of room to grow.<br /><br />Probably the most notable tracks on the album (beside the original song from \\"Idol\\") are \\"Declaration\\" featuring a cool 80s \\"hair band\\" vibe, \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Avalanche\\" with a particularly catchy hooks, and \\"A Daily Anthem\\" with its deeper lyrical content.<br /><br />What seem be probably some of the weaker songs would have to be \\"Come Back to Me,\\" \\"Life on the Moon,\\" and \\"I Did It for You\\" which all seem to come off either a little soft or somewhat bland.<br /><br />All in all, I'd rate this CD a 3.75/5 or a solid \\"B\\" on the grading scale.<br /><br />Although performers like Chris Daughtry, Bo Bice and Constantine Maroulis paved the way for rockers on \\"Idol,\\" Cook was the first to take the title. And, if this album is any indication, the single-platinum status he has earned from it will be one of many.
1401216676|5.0|After forgetting comics from my youth, this was forced on me in college, and I was resistant. I remember my friend saying \\"Just read the first couple of pages\\". I did, and I was astounded. This was like nothing I had ever seen. The art was incredible. The story was gripping. This short graphic novel showed me why comics aren't just for kids.

B001EYGOEM|3.0|Young country music sensation Taylor Swift recently released \\"Fearless,\\" the highly anticipated follow-up to her debut album. And with it, it seems Swift was looking to give her fans some of her familiar sound mixed with a little bit of experimentation.<br /><br />Probably the most intriguing track on the album is the outstanding \\"Love Story\\" sporting an old school sound infused with something of a new and modern feel. The songs \\"White Horse\\" and \\"Change\\" are also quite good and feature a style reminiscent of the works found on her first CD and louder and more emotional vibe respectively.<br /><br />Conversely, the worst songs on fearless tend to be a little bland at best. Two good examples of this are \\"You Belong With Me\\" and \\"Forever & Always.\\"<br /><br />Most of the rest of \\"Fearless\\" falls into the average category, having some level of quality offset by either lack of originality or creativity. And at least two of the songs, \\"Fifteen\\" and \\"The Best Day\\" can best be described as simplistic. This of course, can be looked at one of two ways.<br /><br />Swift is actively involved in the songwriting on \\"Fearless\\" and it shows. Much of the lyrical content circulates around the typical experiences of youth and may turn some off. But despite this, it is quite obvious she is very talented, especially for somebody of such a young age.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate this CD a 3.5/5 or a \\"B-\\" on a typical grading scale and I would recommend it to any casual country music fan.

0340838035|5.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult novel I've read.  I am a big James Patterson fan and anything murder/mystery.  However, I had finished reading a book early one evening but wasn't quite ready for bed.  I picked up the Jodi Picoult novel my mother had left me.  Wow!  I was hooked from the very beginning.  Never in my life have I read something so moving and so surreal.  I loved this book and it actually made me cry, something I've never done reading ANY book.  Well done to Jodi.  Great writing and great storyline!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Personally, I loved this movie. I watched it opening weekend and I was blown away. That said, my sister, who attended with me, absolutely hated it. I just couldn't understand how we could have such extremely opposite reactions, but now that time has passed, I realize that this is just one of those movies that people either love or hate. There is very little middle ground (as reflected in the reviews).    The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that sometimes the 'cameraman' is obviously doing things that are for an interesting shot instead of how an actual person would act. This is supposed to be 'found footage,' and shots like that really draw you out of the experience. The most obvious example of this is when our heroes are making their way across the roof of a building that has semi-collapsed into another building. In a real situation like that, either the camera would be off, or the person holding it would be occasionally using that hand to grab hold and steady himself, resulting in random shots of the roof, his feet, his stomach, etc. Instead, we are treated to a nice, bird's eye view of the monster rampaging in the distance, with just a few shaky movements to indicate that this is all happening on a hand-held camera.    Moments like these are few and far between though, so it isn't difficult to recommend this movie to all of my friends.
0446402389|5.0|I normally do not read Historical Thrillers, but this one based in Russia came highly recommended by \\"Thriller Lover.\\" It is loosely based on a Russian serial murderer, Andrei Chikatilo, called the \\"Butcher of Rostov\\" who murdered over 50 women and children in Russia during the 1980s. But Child 44 is set in the 1950s during the Stalin communist society. His creation of life in Moscow is realistic, and the maxims included could well be part of a communist handbook. His ability to recreate the emotional milieu of the communist society adds to the sense of realism and horror.<br /><br />The characters are carefully drawn, vivid and fascinating, within a novel that is complex with drama and unexpected twists. It was fascinating how the author completely changed one of the main characters from a ruthless officer in the MGB (the secret police) to a lovable hero.<br /><br />It is no wonder that the movie rights for \\"Child 44\\" have already been sold for this accomplished debut novel by author \\"Tom Rob Smith.\\"<br /><br />One of the best books I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Author of [[ASIN:0741449102 al-Qaeda Strikes Again]]
B000002G87|5.0|I cannot praise this work enough. It is simply beautiful, so utterly full of feeling...whew. I don't really have the words. This is Clapton at his best. And of course Allman is superb. There isn't a bad cut on the entire record.   If you're a rock fan, this is a MUST.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I'm not one of those fans who didn't like season 3. In fact, I thought season 3 was pretty good, so I don't really understand all the trumpeting of 'the return of Lost,' but I will agree that season 4 is one of the leanest, most gripping seasons of the show's run. Every episode is filled to the brim with great acting, twists and turns, and every episode moves the plot along nicely, which I have to admit wasn't always the case in season 3.    The extras in this package are, typically for Lost, a nicely rounded bunch. The commentaries are good for the most part, and the other extras are great. I loved the featurette on the music of Lost because it is one of my favorite things about the show. It was supremely interesting to see all of the offbeat 'instruments' that they use to achieve the unique auditory signature of the show.    Overall, if you're a fan of Lost, you're going to pick this up whether I recommend it or not. Luckily, it gets my highest recommendation.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|This is the first time I've bought LOST on blu-ray, and it's definitely worth it.  One of the best shows on TV deserves to be seen in hi-def w/surround sound.  Can't beat it, and can't beat the price here on amazon.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|just writing a review because i think the average rating of 4/5 is very low for this movie, it is a 4.5/5 at least!  best pixar movie so far and without a doubt a masterpiece.
B001ACH4DS|1.0|Nothing original or inspiring here.  Been there done that with thousands of other wanna-be rockers.  Boring and I suggest you skip it.
0143038419|4.0|This book reads as a refreshingly intimate account of one womans quest at true happiness. Melissa Gilbert is painfully honest with her emotions and thoughts and at times I contemplated my guilt at delighting in this entertainment. She reveals herself like a confiding girlfriend and the details are enough to keep one engaged until the end. Her adventures are tumultuous and raw with emotion, spiritualism and sexuality. Gilbert keeps the reader yearning for more. The end; I felt a bit cheated but I suppose the typical reader will sigh with euphoria. A definite read.
0810995212|5.0|This book is an excellent addition for any collector of J. C. Leyendecker images.  It is filled with the artist's Saturday Evening Post cover images in 2\\" X 3\\" format.  Other images are highlighted in full page format.  All images are in full color.  One thing it lacked were images of Leyendecker's clothing advertisements and others.  Nevertheless it's a great buy.  It is better than the 1974 J. C. Leyendecker book by Michael Schau in terms of its color image content.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|OK, I'm a Johnny-come-lately Coldplay convert, but, \\"better late than never,\\" I always say.<br /><br />'Saw them on SNL and sought out the album from which the songs performed were culled.  Thus, \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All Friends\\" became a part of my collection.<br /><br />I find the album's songs to be a great blend of pop and rock, with hints of the classics and regional European music.  I was most impressed by the cuts \\"Lovers in Japan,\\" \\"Cemetaries of London,\\" \\"Lost!,\\" \\"Viva La Vida,\\" \\"Strawberry Swing,\\" and \\"Death and All His Friends.\\"<br /><br />Also, I'm sure that I may incure the wrath of many by remarking that \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends\\" is, at times, reminiscent of the Beatles at their most innovative.<br /><br />But, I guess I'm in the same boat as much of the world in my admiration for the band.<br /><br />Running time: 45.9 minutes
B0013ND30W|5.0|I rented the remastered standard edition dvd a while back and was not impressed while watching with my six year old daughter.  In fact, I was probably catching up on something else when it was playing.    After I popped in this blu-ray addition, wow!  The colors and detail, especially the background images were amazing which made the overall movie more enjoyable. This is probably how people felt when it was released in the theaters.  Every scene just made me want to grab a screen shot and make it my wallpaper on my computer or something.    The sound was great in that the musical score didn't sound monotone and dated like these movies often due.  While it supports 7.1, the surrounds weren't really engaged.  My left surround seemed louder than the rest which made me think I needed to calibrate my receiver or it could have been the movie itself.    The only flaws in the movie itself was the fact that the fairies didn't know how to make a cake or dress after taking care of Aurora for 16 years?  Also the prince got way too much help from the fairies in my opinion.  Will be using that as a lesson somehow for my daughter in the future.  Don't count on no prince charming, etc.    You got to get this disc, it's like watching it for the first time.
B000063COX|5.0|If you love the early Maiden stuff, the remastered CDs are a great value. There's new artwork and pictures, and the songs sound better than ever. The packaging featuring a protective sleeve that I also like.
B00006AVRK|5.0|This box set is simply the best single entertainment purchase I have made all year.  If you are a Wodehouse fan you won't be disappointed.
B00011F5DK|1.0|I suppose that this might be a fun toy if it came with the correct parts, but I have no way of knowing.  The game came with too many red parts and not enough green parts (i.e., 3 bags of red, only one bag of green).  This should seem like a fairly straightforward problem to a company that makes a puzzle game, but when I called the 24/7 \\"customer service\\" line, the gentleman spent about 10 minutes trying to assure me that this was impossible.  I sat down and counted every single part of every single color with him on the phone to assure him that this was not impossible.  Instead of simply saying that he would send me the right parts, he said that he would have to have somebody get back to me.  I guess this was too puzzling for \\"Educational Insights\\".  Instead of somebody calling me back, I received an e-mail saying that I should call Mattel for replacement parts. (Huh?)  I called Mattel at the number provided in the e-mail, and they had no idea what I was talking about or why I would be told to call Mattel (as I assumed would be the case).  I wrote back to the person that sent me the e-mail to advise her that Mattel had no clue, but I never received a response.  Save your money. If the game arrives in unplayable condition you will be stuck without help from customer service.
B0018M6J90|5.0|[[ASIN:B0018M6J90 Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (Widescreen & Full Screen Edition)]]<br />Where can I even begin. When I first saw this film it was a Saturday night Pay-Per-View endeavour. I eagerly wished for the best but expected the worst. On a rainy Saturday night, $3.99 purchased me two hours of the finest entertainment and best piece of film I have seen in years. The story is out of this world incredible and one becomes so caught up in the whirlwind day of one out of work, down on her luck British nanny and an American actress hopeful caught between three men. The story is so well written and so enrapturing that you almost forget the entire thing takes place in one 24 hour period. With such an outrageous plot casting the right individuals was a must. And what better choices than the ever versatile Frances McDormand, the beautiful, talented Amy Adams, and the relatively new face of Lee Pace who absolutely dazzles me not only on the big screen but also in the whimsical hit Pushing Daisies. The film was in and out of theatres relatively quickly and didn't make much of a splash as far as advertising, but it is well worth any price.
B00139W3NE|2.0|The main problem with this movie is that I never believe what's going on.  It's feels like a Narnia knock-off.  An adventure for an adventure sakes.  I never understood WHY LYRA.  What made her so special?  Even Nicole Kidman's performance is a reminder of the White Witch in Narnia.  I never really understand the dust thing and exactly what they mean about it settling in their daemons.  I thought about watching it again to try to understand again-but I just don't want to.  My time is worth more than that.  However, I suspect that the book is a lot better than this film.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|If you have never used a game pad before, you NEED too. Game pads are so much nicer to game with than the keyboard. For years I have been using Wolfking products, but this is SOOOO much better, it is not even funny.<br /><br />The software simply is amazing.

B0007PLLQ0|1.0|If you're looking for nostalgia buy the other version this is a stupid directors cut!!!! the real version is not on here.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Everything has already been said about this latest installment of the Batman Enterprise.  Who knew someone could give Jack Nicholason a run for his money on his interpetation of the Joker?  Everything is here, viewers: good script, great direction and top notch CGI.  You'll want to watch this a couple of times to catch all the politcal nuiances-whether you agree with them or not.  Just pop you some popcorn, kick up your feet and enjoy.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|Although I believe this product to be a bit pricey at $5 per pair, I believe that it's worth it.  I haven't been one of those who has their finger slip off the R2 and L2 buttons but I still decided to give these a try.  I must admit they do make the controls feel more like triggers similar to the Xbox 360 controller.  Personally I like them a lot.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Classic Enya with a few more \\"upbeat and quick\\" songs make this a very good CD to buy to relax/do Pilates, etc..
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|This is indeed a very colorful production and the acting is all pretty good, especially Kate Blanchette.   However it has two main problems   -- First there is the mis-blending of plots and episodes in the movie: Elizabeth's affairs at court with Sir Walter Raleigh shares about the same screen time as does the war with the spanish. But neither get dealt with properly or fully - they get dabbled in ... pity.   I am not sure how accurate the movie is. I honestly don't know but as a general history lesson it brings up interesting stuff about the religious background to spain etc. If it is correct in it's depictions then as a believer in secularism I am glad the spanish armada did not succeed againt England. The church has a lot to answer for in history no doubt. I say that tough I now live in Spain myself and love it to bits.   -- The second problem is the presence of Hollywood - the over-iconiation of Elizabeth is a pain amidst all the continuous background synthesized wall-to-wall dribble music. When will these producers ever learn? With all the classical music available not to mention endless abstract pieces that could have been used, I cannot understand the dullness of mind which the director is guilty of here. This is why this movie will always be a \\"B\\" flick. What a pity! A bit of simple taste and it might have been a classic. Certainly the stunning visual settings and costumes were all up to it.   I wish Hollywood would learn. Maybe take a page from A Man for all Seasons - pace things on the screen a little bit more rather than bombarding the viewer with this overproduction. Modern technology is great but we need to know when not to apply it.   Especially having spend all the time and money.   Let me give one small example of what I mean: There is a scene at a late stage of the file where the camera rotates a few times round a beautifully crafted doll/statuette of the queen(Kate Blanchette). Really marvelous idea but not at this stage of the story and for so long with all the meaningless background music raging. The film at this stage was boring and the scene served only to irritate this viewer - I just wanted it to end. Why not have this maybe in the opening scene and without the sound assault?!   The mark of a great film is wanting to watch it again at every excuse. Not this one  Que lastima!
074325144X|5.0|Heard many wonderful comments on this book and it was recommended to give as a gift.  Receiver seems very pleased with the choice!
1582701709|1.0|I totally bought into this book.  I even spent a day creating a \\"vision board,\\" with all the things that I loved and wanted in my life.  I posted it where I dressed every morning, and I looked at it, visualizing how the universe would attract those things to me;  My girlfriend of three years, a great condo, a new car, my close friends, travel to my favorite cities, my dog and my interest in writing.  I followed the instructions, you know?    Well, within a year, almost everything in my vision board vanished from my life.  I still have the dog, but lost my girl, lost my job, lost my 401K and now I have to relocate to a small town where I'll be away from my friends and won't be affording a car or travel anytime soon.  When I think about Oprah and the others shilling this book as such a life changing thing, it just makes me angry.     I submit that the real \\"Secret\\" is that the book is itself a strong repellant for good fortune and happiness.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Based on Andrew Lloyd Webber's  musical smash hit The Phantom of the Opera, Joel Schumacher adapts it to the big screen!    In 2004, after nearly twenty years of waiting, a Phantom movie was being made. I was very excited! I already knew the music by heart after listening to the Original Cast Recording with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman literally dozens of times, and wondered how a movie version would turn out.    After seeing it, I was blown away! The music is just as marvelous and catchy as ever. The film is full of color and amazing special effects that are a feast for the eyes.      The cast includes Gerard Butler as the Phantom, Emmy Rossum as Christine, Patrick Wilson as Raoul, Minnie Driver as Carlotta, and Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry.     Many fans of the stage musical expressed doubts about the film because of the fact that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman did not reprise their roles as the Phantom and Christine respectively. I think the new cast does an excellent job. However, Crawford and Brightman are nearly irreplaceable in my opinion. Some also worried about the choice of Schumacher as director (who was responsible for the horrible 1997 film, Batman & Robin). I think Schumacher does much better with Phantom.     Some other changes were made from the stage musical, including some revisions in the lyrics, some events were switched around, and some additional scenes were added to help bridge-the-gap where scene changes were in the stage version. Also, the Phantom's facial deformity is toned-down considerably from the original look.     Overall, I thought this was a very good adaption of The Phantom of the Opera. It's worth seeing for any fan of the musical!
032147404X|4.0|Looking at the title and buying online withought benefit of thumbing through the contents, you might get the impression that this is an all encompassing book on digital photography.  The price should have been my clue.  Each page contains a half page, or less, of text with a photo above.  The text clearly explains what you need to do to capture a similar image.  Scott's book is not a primer on digital photograpy but rather a collection of tips that I personally found very helpful, once you get beyond the lame humor.  Scott's recommendations for printers were particularly useful.  I expected more from the book, but for the price it's a handy reference.  The book is small enough to fit in your camera bag or pocket of a backpack so you can reference it easily on your shoots.
0956031609|5.0|This book was simply Amazing. It was so well written that after reading the first chapter I could not put it down. I read the book in three sittings. The way Sarif describes the characters and the surroundings made me visualize the things actually happening. It was a must read, and a must stay in my collection. If you haven't read this book, you are missing out on pure art.
B001C3KCSY|1.0|Sounds an aweful lot like Peter Gabriel and a whole mess of stuff I've heard before.  Nothing original or creative about this band or the millions of sheep who love them.
B001ED7C58|2.0|I recently fell in love with the Twilight series and also the movie- I was going to go out and just buy the soundtrack without listening to it, but got the oppoortunity to listen to it first from a friend. I'm glad I did, because i only liked 3 of the songs- The first one by Muse, Rob Pattinson's, and then Bella's Lullaby, although I think a piano solo would have been more appropriate for that piece. I loved Debussy before I ever knew about Twilight and was thrilled that Claire de Lune was in the book and movie, although I already have that piece on an album of Debussy.   Almost all the songs on this album don't feel like the movie to me- thank goodness, because if I had heard those Paramore songs on the film I think the movie would have been ruined for me. Besides the first, Rob's song and Bella's Lullaby, the songs were all pretty teenage-angst, hot topic-ish emo. Not what I felt to be fluid with the background of this entrancing love story...

B00006RIO7|5.0|Chicago is my FAVORITE movie musical and after I watched the movie, I instantly fell in love with the songs. I was going to order it on amazon but I was too anxious, so I bought it instore at Target for $11.99 :[. If you're thinking of buying this, definitely buy it on Amazon!! It's the cheapest I've found. But, once I got the CD, I rushed to upload it on my computer and ipod!. I think it's the greatest soundtrack ever! I listen to almost every song like everyday! I love Catherine Zeta-Jones's voice and Ren&eacute;e's is good too :]. Richard Gere was the perfect choice for Billy Flynn. I was really surprised when I saw the movie though, I didn't know any of the actors could sing! (besides Queen Latifah). Especially John C. Reilly!<br /><br />Also, you get the song \\"I Move On\\" which is played during the credits for the movie and \\"Class\\" which was cut from the movie.<br /><br />If you love the movie like me, you should really buy the CD!
B001AKTZO6|5.0|REVIEW: Sophomore effort from Creedence finds lead singer John Fogerty maturing as a songwriter with such classic tracks as \\"Proud Mary\\" (a Number 2 hit), \\"Born On The Bayou\\", and the menacing blues of \\"Graveyard Train\\" (a sorrowful tale of a guy who, after having a fight with his girl, learns that she has been killed in a collision with a train as she was \\"flying through the crossroads\\" in her car). Proof of C.C.R.'s potency as a first-class cover band is evident from their pounding version of Little Richard's \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\". While the raucous \\"Penthouse Pauper\\", and the dirty swamp rock of \\"Bootleg\\" and \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" shows just how much vitality (and humor) they can inject into a rough-and-tumble jam. Chooglin' indeed.    HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 7    HIGHEST BILLBOARD R&B ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 41    HIT SINGLES: \\"Proud Mary\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 2)

0375701427|4.0|I didn't just read this book - I felt that I actually lived it too.  I was so caught up in \\"The Swede's\\" great life turned horribly bad that it was a real relief when it was over!  Roth saturates you into his life with all of the minute details he can render - and still leaves many, many questions unanswered.  I agree with someone who said the Swede's life is a symbol of America in the 50s and 60s and how things changed so drastically.  The writing was a little difficult to keep pace with - it's pretty dense and I felt quite repititious, especially when telling about Swede's state of mind after the bombing.  I would have liked to know a little more about what happened in between Swede's two lives - but I guess that was not the point of the book.  Recommended but know before going in that it's not light reading and Roth uses almost none of his wonderful humor in this one.
B001JFZ118|1.0|Hi folks,    I admit it...I love this movie...I saw this at my local shop (dvd planet) and couldn't resist... Directors Cut..6 more minutes! I got a sick feelingn when I put it in my player and the SAME menu as the previous edition came up... Turns out to be the same as previously released with a new cover. If you have the previous release...do NOT buy this.    lets hope a Blu Ray edition with some real bonus features will happen eventually. My 1 star rating is for this hopeless retread in packaging NOT the excellent movie!
185984054X|2.0|I struggled with how many stars to give this book, though the decision was always between two or three stars, never any more or less. (I'd love to be able to give it 2 and a half)...  I suppose that before getting into my thoughts on the book, I should preface it with how I approached the work.    I am an Orthodox Christian who is studying the differences between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism.  One of the ways that I think one can see the effects that the differences in dogma and practices have is in the differences between their saints (though Mother Teresa is not yet given the title of 'saint' in Roman Catholicism, she is clearly on the way).  After all, when a Church glorifies a person with sainthood, does not this mean that that figure embodies much of what the members of that faith are struggling to become?  Thus, while reading Kathryn Spink's \\"Mother Teresa\\" and the recently-released personal letters of Mother Teresa (Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light) I also picked up this little book for another viewpoint.  The book, however, didn't fit my purpose.  I review it, then, both for what it is and what it is not...    Firstly, I find Hitchens an interesting character who often provides sometimes very interesting insights - whether I agree with them or not - into different topics, though who sometimes lacks the ability to look at things beyond a superficial way.  This latter trait often causes him to fail to understand (or maybe ever want to understand) the worldview behind one's beliefs and actions.  This, I think, occurred a bit in this book.    Hitchens' anti-religion attitude soils some of the pages here.  I use my language intentionally.  Hitchens' atheism influences negatively what might have been a more convincing tract because it corrupts a purely reasoned-based approach.  I had expected an approach aimed to convince Catholic and non-Catholic alike; the approach used, however, appears to let the author's atheism (especially early on in the book) stand up front equally with straight logic.    This influences Hitchens' writing style, as well.  Even when I disagree with Hitchens, I find much of his writing very eloquent, a priceless aid when trying to convince readers.  However, in certain places, Hitchens' style crosses the line from reasoned eloquence to bitter polemics.  This certainly did not occur as often as it could have, but when it does occur, the result is a desire in the reader to dismiss Hitchens as being a fanatic in his own right.  Though this may be unfair, Hitchens makes it too easy to do at times.    Beyond Hitchens' pure distaste for Catholicism, a certain quibble I had was that he seems not to understand both some simple and more difficult elements of RC doctrine.  One or two cases of this are dismissible, as they do not altar his line of reasoning.  At times, however, I think it causes his understanding to remain, as stated above, on a very superficial level.  Because he did not try to understand Mother Teresa's worldview, he remained incredulous and astounded at certain quotations of hers that I found to actually speak in her favor.     Coupled with Hitchens' anti-religious views is his anti-abortion stance which again influences much of his objections to Mother Teresa.  Though, like his atheist views, this is fine for some, I found that it detracted from a more convincing read.  If a reader is already anti-religion and pro-abortion, there would be no need to read a book against Mother Teresa; Hitchens would have done better to focus more on the person of Mother Teresa from a more balanced standpoint.    Finally, even when ignoring all of these objections to view the book from a purely logical standpoint, certain pages of the book do contain logical fallacies which rupture the foundations of Hitchens' reasoning.  A good Philosophy 101 could point out some of these fallacies without many headaches.      All this being said, Hitchens did make some valid points along the way questioning the exalted viewmuch of the world has of Mother Teresa today.  Though these views can be found in multiple other reviewers, I will say that I found this question the most interesting: How is it that, with so many donations and so much publicity, the quality of the care being given be the Missionaries of Charity did not seem to improve, much, with time?  Where was the money going?  This could be the result of Mother Teresa' s exalted view of suffering, but to arrive full circle, I end up looking to examples of recent Orthodox saints which took a very different approach:     Elder Paisios, for instance, was an amazing ascetic who suffered greatly from physical maladies, especially at the end of his life.  However, he constantly asked God to be given the pain of those he met.  He wanted to suffer for them; he didn't want them to suffer.  It was his example that taught others how suffering can be transfigured and made good.             I would like to see Mother Teresa examined from a spiritual point of view, especially given her private letters which were recently published.  She seemed to want to balance spirituality and humanism in a way that could not be done, so that she said many profound things and had a great and respectable personal piety even in the face of great doubt but, in her efforts to help others, she neglected the quality of care that her clinics and houses had a potential to give.      I understand much of what Hitchens was trying to do with this book, and though I can think of possible objections to many of his arguments, I think that one conclusion bears further examination: Mother Teresa is a phenomenon who may be more myth than reality.  I think that there are questions which should be answered.  Ultimately, however, a more balanced approach is needed.  Unfortunately, I am afraid that Hitchens' own agenda mars much of his judgment.
1401216676|4.0|I am a comic book nerd and whenever people give me that smug look this is the comic I lend them. It takes about thirty minutes to read and the story is grown up enough to make people realize that comics aren't for kids, they're just about story telling. This is fast paced and so emotional; only Moore could create a story that actually has you feeling sorry for a bad guy. Read this book!
B001F7MSG6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie even more than Hellboy. The action is abundant but still has a good storyline. The blu-ray audio and video is reference quality. The lossless audio provides enveloping sound with extensive use of surrounds and good LFE. The picture quality is clear with good contrast. A very enjoyable movie made even better by flawless audio and video.

B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I enjoy action movies and like Angelina Jolie. She doesn't disappoint in this movie. The rest of the cast is also very good. I enjoyed it more than Lara Croft and on a par with Mr. and Mrs. Smith. The blu-ray audio and video is reference quality. The lossless audio provides enveloping sound with extensive use of surrounds and good LFE. The picture quality is clear with good contrast. A very enjoyable movie made even better by flawless audio and video.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Original, vibrant and packed full of extras which make it possibly like-for-like the cheapest product on the market.  Pre-ordered two weeks before release, the DVD was delivered in good time and I was made fully aware of each stage of delivery as it happened.  Wonderful customer care.
0545128285|4.0|I will admit, I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan, but this book just wasn't all I would expect from Rowling, as a branch off from the famous Harry Potter books. Then again, I am 18 and this book is written for children =] so as an adult, it wasn't all bad, just short. Children who know of Harry Potter and Dumbledore should definitely enjoy this book, though.
0061537934|5.0|Forget about Edgar Sawtelle and all the other hyped novels in 2008.  This is the one book you should read.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  I read 40+ books last year and this one is definitely in the top 3.
0810993139|5.0|I bought this book for our friends' 8 year old son.  He read it in two days then loaned it to my 8 year old son.  My son says he loves this book, and I haven't heard him ever say that about any book.
0316920045|5.0|I refer not to the book's storyline but to the readers of this sprawling mega-dense manuscript.   David Foster Wallace knows how to write.  And write he does - over a thousand pages worth of writing.  Yes, his writing is brilliant, cleaver, funny and stylistically unique but it's only for those willing to take the time and effort.      I was debating a 4-star versus a 5-star rating. On the downside, I thought that much of the writing was over-wrought.  At times, Wallace lures the reader into a myriad of details that dead-end and don't always seem to advance the storyline.   Other times, I felt (as another reviewer stated) that Wallace was writing only to impress the reader.      But the 5-stars won out because the novel was so original with multiple storylines and multi-dimensional eclectic characters that blended so well.  The United States has merged with Canada and Mexico to form the Organization of North American Nations.  The calendar has been sold to the highest corporate bidder.  So now a mad genius runs a tennis academy in The Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment (following the Year of the Whopper, etc.).  Doesn't get more original than that and that is what you get in \\"Infinite Jest.\\"    Not for everyone but for the determined and persistent reader \\"Infinite Jest\\" is a one-of-a-kind classic gem.
B0000CF30C|4.0|This is the best \\"Toys\\" ever sounded! The surround mix clears up some of the things that were lost in the mix before. Be careful-heavy on the bass!
B0018QCXGY|2.0|What was the director of Cloverfield thinking when he decided to film this movie from the perspective of a hand-held movie camera? All the way through, the almost constant jerking, jumping, and swerving of the camera made my eyes hurt and my head swim.  Half of the time, I couldn't tell what was taking place.  The Blu-ray video transfer was not very good, but the audio was fantastic.  Great effects from the rear channels.<br /><br />The best thing about this film are the CGI effects and the well-designed creatures.  Hats off to their designer.  Too bad, the director ruined the movie filming it in this fashion, as this was possibly the best giant monster-creature I have ever seen.  The ending is abrupt and leaves one with a sense of dissatisfaction and no closure.  What a shame!  It could have been a great horror flick!
006135323X|1.0|I have read hundreds of books about human behavior, and this auther describs I have read hundreds of books about human behavior, and this author describes the worst theories for unscientific studies.  Any university that lets its tenured professes ply this hogwash should be ashamed at the very least to have their name on this book.  The \\"Studies\\" in this book are done on a very specific group; college students in a class instructed by the author.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|The thing that stuck out most about Casino Royale to me above anything was the video quality. I have loved every blu-ray movie I've bought, but this one surpassed them all by a long shot in term of video quality. This is the first time I haven't doubted blu-ray, the picture is so perfect that it seems to jump off the screen at you and welcome you in to the scene. And this is with my 50\\" 720p tv that's about 2 years old, I can't even imagine what it looks like on a newer 1080p display. I don't have surround sound but just from my TV the audio was pretty good, I'm sure it's amazing as well if you have a theatre system. The movie itself is great as well, probably my favorite bond movie, although I'm biased towards the newer ones. It's exciting throughout, and there's always a new twist to every turn in the movie. My favorite blu-ray so far, it's def. worth the buy if you don't have it yet.
0307454894|3.0|This is one of those rare instances in which the film is better than the novel.  Kate Winslet is beyond belief in the role - as is everyone else in the movie.  Another film you might like that comes up to this one, on the same subject: \\"The Music Box\\" with Jessica Lange.  Wow.  In fact, that one is even more vivid, however, thanks to the performances, \\"The Reader\\" is also a major stand-out.
1596434252|5.0|It realy matches the video shown in youtube.  It makes a great gift for designers...  Loved it.
B000IOM0WE|5.0|I read all of the reviews by the nay-sayers and I don't get it.  I really enjoyed the concept and the special effects.  Plenty of action imaginatively told.    If, however ,you are a huge fan of the MTV show, you won't like it.  Anyway, I thought it was great.
B001GQO50I|1.0|How many times can they issue product they claim to be new, rare, unreleased or something else...when in fact it's all the same old, same old.     I can forgive the Doors issuing Absolutely Live on CD when it already existed on the IN Concert CD. I can forgive them calling a disc Live in New York when one song is from Los Angeles. I can forgive them for putting a disc called Band Favorites of studio songs which we all own anyway.     I cannot forgive them for this mess. Sure it's great to hear this...but my Mp3 boot sounds better. They blatantly lied about this release. I bought all the Doors recordings up til now...even the 12 disc Box that came with 6 DVD-A...that was awesome...but i digress...this was a blatant lie. It remains to this day the only disc i have returned to Amazon based on quality. Yes, I know it's a boot but they promised it was better, clearer and i thought it was from the master tapes as it stated. It was not. How much money do the Doors want? Makes me wonder what Morrison would think about this? Is Densmore part of this too?
B00005JPO1|1.0|Brilliant review by Joseph below, his hits the nail on the head... exactly what I felt about the film when I left the cinema.    If I could add a few things. The film was hugely dissapointing, I still haven't got over the sense of sadness I had while watching it. Such a shame that Spielberg didn't put his foot down and insist that they made the Frank Darabont script... that was a fabulous script.     Lucas should be ashamed of himself, but then... really, so should Spielberg in small measure as he must have known this one wouldn't work.  And, I do love Spielberg, i think it's only through his love for the fans that we got any kind of Indy movie. I guess he at least wanted to give the fans something after all this time, but Lucas just seemed to want to build the franchise and sell toys... he doesn't care about the fans who support the films or what it means to people.  It meant a great deal to me personally, the original Indiana Jones films are my three favourite movies.     Have you seen how many toys this movie has spawned and how many products are out there? Lucas' idea to introduce a son was a purley commercial one, honestly... read the Darabont script that he rejected... the one Spielberg loved, and it all becomes clear.  Most people's problems with the finished film are addressed in that script.  They certainly were for me, almost every complaint i had about the finished movie seemed to be the things that were changed from the Darabont draft.  That is a story full of peril and danger and great charcterization.  Instead we got a cartoon style film with poor characterization and no danger or excitement at all.  The Marion charcter in the Darabont draft is superbly written and the banter is funny and fresh.  She has a real 'raiders-style' spunkiness to her and she's essential to the story.  The action setpieces are also wonderfully invetive and superior to anything in the film as it turned out.  And the character of Indy is front and center, no son is there takingattention away from the greatest icon in film history.  He is the Indy I remember from the first three films.  Darabont, you wrote a great script, you are a genius.  Ah, if only that movie had been allowed to happen.  Lucas, I will forever hold a grudge for turning that script down.    Frank Darabont said he looked Lucas in the eye and told him he was crazy but that it made no difference.  Spielberg has said he handed the Darabont draft to Lucas with pride, and that he thought it the finest Indy script since Raiders.  And I agree.  I guess, for better or worse (mostly worse) we instead got Lucas' preffered version... well, that's a tragic shame.      We were denied a true Indy movie and instead got this bull****... biggest dissapointment in film history
B0000542D2|5.0|It's amazing how much of the Fab Four was captured in a low budget film that really has no plot, start or ending, cost less to make than their first record, and is about as Anti-Holly Wood as you could get[and the film was nominated for 3 Oscars]. Just a , \\"day in the life\\" sort of spontaneous quality that is full of energy, great music, and the innocence of the Beatles, before they became, \\"ARTISTS.\\" [I can remember watching it in a theater and all the girls screaming-at a film!].I think many won't understand the movie or the impact of the Beatles because you almost had to be there to witness the start of a musical evolution, that's effects continue through today. Make sure you watch all of the extra material that was thrown in-it's amazing how much of the movie was literally, off the cuff or impromptu.<br />Add George Martin & Son's remix of a Beatle's Medly, \\"Beatles Love\\" as a companion and you really have a nice surprise in store.<br />Now if Paul can get permission from John & George's wives to release many Beatles songs never heard before, we will be in for much more of  Lennon-McCartney's song writing genius, the best in music history which will span the past and presence into another revolution.

0060594896|5.0|I picked up Jack Canfield's Sucess Principles book since I was having such success with his Dream Big System, and didn't want to miss out on any nuggets of information that would help me get to where I am so excited to go. I am so glad I bought this book. There is nowhere else you need to go to figure out your life purpose, and begin to work your dream plan. He covers EVERYTHING you need to know about conceptualizing your goal from the thought stage, to buidling your team, to dealing with obstacles, and finally, to learning to manage your success once you get there. There are no leaves left unturned in this pathway to success, and if you want to learn more about a certain concept or topic, Jack has listed the website for you to explore that area of interest. I love this book, and find it a helpful partner to the Dream Big System and the Vision Board Book. I challenge you to read it, and then get up and do something with what you learn.

B000FC10HA|1.0|I purchased this product because I believed the title. However, since this book was published such a long time ago, it's no longer relevant and should be pulled from the shelves.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|I've listened to rock from the 60's to 2008 and this is one of the most energetic and well put together CD's I've ever heard.  You'll never get tired of these songs.  The band is awesome and Hayley is charismatic and has a beautiful rock voice.    I'm surprised no one has mentioned the videos that were made for some of these songs.  If you watch the videos your appreciation of Paramore goes up to another level.  Watch Misery Business and That's What You Get and you may just fall in love with Hayley like I did.    1 more tip.

0553381687|1.0|I have to say that I took a friend's advice and read this book with high hopes. Those hopes were supported through the first; oh, 300 pages. Martin brings his characters to life very well at first glance. His method of plot development and storytelling - jumping between character viewpoints - is a refreshing change of pace from most omnipotent-perspective fantasy.<br /><br />However, as the story lengthens, it begins to really drag. Instead of developing characters, readers are given superficial information that doesn't build their characters or present any background. Children whine, girls cry, women have high expectation - these are recurring themes that could be introduced briefly and concisely, and instead they are reiterated ad nauseum from various viewpoints, often across characters (as in, character x acts in a way, and in the next chapter, character y observes character x acting a way already described).<br /><br />Altogether, the book is well written. That absolutely cannot be contested. However, there is a tinge of \\"Wheel of Time\\" syndrome here - the book suffers from its own situation. Too many character viewpoints add a sense of convolution to a fairly simple storyline. This means that the book's 802 pages could probably be trimmed to about 500.<br /><br />Maybe that is an exaggeration, but I'd like to stress this - the enjoyment of this book can't be evaluated upon overall WRITING quality. Instead its a question of preference. I can't name this epic fantasy - it isn't captivating throughout, it lacks forward development in significant places, and there is a cliffhanger without a sense of plot accomplishment. It is a good read if you are the literophile (fabricated word alert!) that devours books constantly. Worth the read of the first book, maybe, but I don't know if I'll invest in the rest of the series.
0618154248|5.0|my 19 month old son loves curious george and these books are great for a quick distraction. We read through them the other night when dinner was taking longer than expected and he totally forgot about how hungry he was and was immersed in george. They are very simple and short but great for young kids and I imagine good for learning to read too! And perfect for tossing in the diaper bag or car trips!
630469654X|3.0|Believe it or not, the much discussed \\"disco-medieval\\" soundtrack is the least offensive thing about this movie. Actually, I thought it fit well, since this movie is far more enjoyable as a \\"what were they thinking?!\\" coked-out 80's big-budget trainwreck...<br /><br /> I'm a huge fan of the crop of lush, romantic 80's fantasies, but Matthew Broderick's thoroughly un-funny prattling throughout the movie unfortunately upstages much of the more restrained acting by the other leads. Plus, director Richard Donner is clearly not one for continuity, since the movie jumps all over the place, with important scenes being referenced only later in dialogue (I assume they were cut)... I notice at least 3 screenwriters were credited, I either assume that their contributions were either savaged by cut-happy executives, or they were simply completely incompetent to begin with.<br /><br />I wouldn't even call this film a \\"fantasy\\", more of a historical romance. Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is thoroughly 80's, and he's a genius, so rest assured that the picture looks great. Unfortunately, Richard Donner is a Hollywood hack through-and-through, and the motivations of the characters and plot make no sense, and are fairly ludicrous in parts.
B000H1RFKA|5.0|Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout) is one of the smartest writers in the action genre, and in this, his debut as a director, he knocks it out of the park. It's the perfect example of what you might call post-post-modernism: thoroughly aware of what it is (silly intrigue-laden romantic buddy thriller), and kidding about it, but in the end it turns out to be a pretty effective example.<br />But I digress. Robert Downey Jr. is very well used, Val Kilmer is a great foil, Michelle Monaghan is the heart-melting love interest, and the photography, for a low-budget film, is luscious. I expect to be watching Kiss Kiss Bang Bang many more times just for the pleasure of spending more hours in the company of these characters.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Let's face it, after Syd left, Roger Waters was the creative genius behind Pink Floyd.  The Wall, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals...etc all Roger's vision.  Yes, this is a Roger Waters' album, a great album, moving in a different direction, like all the rest of the so called Pink Floyd albums.  After Roger left, to me,  Pink Floyd albums became David Gilmour trying to write Roger Waters' era Pink Floyd songs.  They all seem contrived, to sound like Pink Floyd.  Yes, they sold millions and made those members of the original Floyd untold millions, but they did not take any original creative leaps, just the same old Pink Floyd sound, without the genius of taking chances.  That said, David Gilmour is an awesome guital player and has a great voice, and I enjoy the newer stuff, but it does not move me.  I'm on my way to the Fletcher Memorial Home...
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|The grain that was intended for this film is a distraction in this high definition, blu-ray release. The reviewer who refers to pixels blinking in the background is pretty spot on. About 1/3rd of this reveals the gorgeous color palette in HD that you would expect and the rest of the movie on the disc can be disconcerting by comparison.     Just an FYI to folks who are looking to upgrade from the regular DVD, you may be disappointed. I'm a pretty big advocate of blu-ray, but not so much for this particular release.
6304711905|5.0|As with any movie involving the legend of the OK Corral, this is not history. Script writers were limited only by their prolific imaginations.    Kurt Russell plays a believable Wyatt Earp, Sam Elliot a phenomenal Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe a perfect Curly Bill, and Val Kilmer a bazaar Doc Holliday. Kilmer's entertaining interpretation of the role is unlike any done before.    This movie has a radical change in character at the mid-point. The first half consists of introductions and character development. There is plenty of action to carry the story forward, plenty of the tension of anticipating the next act of violence. The focus is on the Earps and their friends and love interests, the Clantons and their allies, and the dynamics of Tombstone. The second half is unbridled action, with no effort to tell a story. There is little story left to tell, but the action sustains the adrenalin flow, keeping the viewer absorbed while waiting for the final details to unfold.    Though the violence is more graphic then the westerns of the John Wayne era, gore doesn't become a co-star. One of the best westerns of the last three decades.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|This is an amazing movie. All the actors did a stunning job of immersing you into the story. You feel so connected to the main character.    This movie is on my top 10 favorite movies.    if you havn't seen this movie, BUY IT !
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|First, let's put down the overhype.<br /><br />Many reviewers have said this movie is the greatest movie of all time.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />Many reviewers have said Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is the greatest performance of all time.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />This movie, however, is a very good and intelligent comic book film. It will not change the world and it will not change your life. It may, however, change your perspective of the world and of human nature. And that is more than what you can say about most films.<br /><br />This movie isn't that violent and deserves its PG-13 and not R rating. Its action sequences, although good, are nothing special by today's standards.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed with the fight sequences. As a martial arts practitioner, I felt many of the previous Batman movies, such as the Batman Begins, had far better fighting sequences and more elaborate choreography.<br /><br />This movie deserves its all time best ranking as a superhero film along with the Superman (1977) and Spiderman 2 (2004). Just don't expect it to blow you away unles you are less than 16 years old.<br /><br />Finally, I do not understand all the adulation of Heath Ledger. My guess is he is lionized because of his role in Brokeback Mountain. But I think we need to see him as he was. He was a good actor who had an unfortunate and heavy dependency on precription drugs (at least 7) that killed him. I am sure he was a very decent fellow, but Heath simply was not a good role model for anyone.
B00003CWL6|5.0|After watching this movie, it became an instant classic in my movie collection. How could ordinary life be so enthralling ?    The characters are represented perfectly, and the story couldn't have been told any better.     The genre for this movie is drama.    If you haven't seen American Beauty, you're missing out.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Very pleased with CD. Had all the great songs on it.  Would recommend this for Beatle lovers.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|This is another movie that INSTANTLY went on my top 10 favorite movies list. I still remember when this movie first came out. All my friends and i went to see it the day it came out, and we were not disappointed.    This movie has been out for quite a while now. If you STILL have not seen this movie, you are defiantly behind times.    This movie is a must see.

B001NB6IN8|5.0|I have listened to the album through around 7 times now so I believe I am well placed to comment on its merits.    I was quite shocked that several reviewers here believe that fall out boy have peaked and this album is contrived and weak in comparison with the other 2 full length studio albums.     I believe this album stands shoulder to shoulder with the other two but its qualities are not revealed to a casual or cursory listener. You have to give it time and it will shine. Musically superb - its like advanced mathematics, vocally consistent - patrick stump uses all of his extensive range and is eminently listenable (Though there is a tad much warbling for me - woah ooh woah ooh woah ooh woah).     If anything, 'I dont care' is the weakest track on the album, which is not a sleight, but a testimony to the quality of the rest of it.    Fall Out Boy brings joy, listen, EN-joy, dont get too caught up in trying to derive meaning and purpose in the content.
031606792X|2.0|Like the other books in the Twilight series, the story was creative and interesting and character development was strong. However, those are the only good things about the books. In my opinion, I thought this final book in the Twilight Saga had the most flaws. One example was Bella. I've noticed that she doesn't have any self concern for herself, and it's even more clear in this book. After she had sex with Edward, he accidently gave her bruises all over. Instead of thinking about the danger, she got pissed because Edward's concern for her was ruining her fun. Even worse, she kept begging him for more sex and even wept about it, until he gave in. This showed how selfish she was and how far she would go to get what she wanted. She did not use logic, and all she thought about was sex. She even wanted to postpone the date of her transformation into a vampire because of sex. I guess the author was trying to say that sex is the only good thing about being human. That's a rotten message. So my point, I guess, is that there's nothing good about Bella, and is a bad role model. She was so selfish and whiny, I believe that Edward loved her only because she was the only person whose mind he couldn't read, which made her stand out from everyone else.    Secondly, Bella's pregnancy shouldn't have occurred. Stephanie said that vampires were completely filled with venom, so there was no way Edward could have gotten Bella pregnant. This indicated that Stephanie wasn't a good writer, because she was breaking her own rules. Vampires don't even have tears, yet male vampires have sperm? It doesn't make any sense.    I also agreed with some of the other reviewers that Bella got everything she wanted without much of a problem. This was unrealistic, because people have to fight for some things in order to gain them. But Bella easily got everything she wanted. A baby, which I already said shouldn't have existed based on Stephanie's rules about vampires (but probably included to make Bellaand Rosalie happy) and the ability to have excellent self control and can be around humans. Yes, Stephanie Meyer used the excuse that Bella had better self control because she was aware of the conflicts of being a vampire, but she still would have suffered immense thirst when she became a newborn, which was natural. But no, Meyer made Bella have a lot better self control than most other vampires, so as to make her happy and still talk to Charlie. Like I said, unrealistic.     So all in all, I thought this book was a disappointment. It has poor literary value. So if you want to read it, have fun but don't be influenced by everything Stephanie Meyer writes, because some parts are trash.
0743554450|5.0|This novel broke my heart over and over and left me exhausted. Hosseini has a voice and a love for Afghanistan that draws you into a world of hearbreaking injustice and heartbreaking beauty. And you follow willingly because the people are people you need to get to know.     \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" never seems contrived; never over sells; and doesn't steer you into a 'happily ever after' ending. But it takes you to a totally satisfying and 'real' stopping point where you know that these lives continue, perhaps in happiness, perhaps not. But, for me, these people are now real; are out there living in the Afghanistan they love, with all the dangers and beauties that go with it.     This unabridged audio production is excellent, with Atossa Leoni's voice perfectly matched to the story.
0375842209|5.0|My heart is sore and swollen after reading this book. In fact, it's been wrung dry. I believe you get a finite number of books like these in your lifetime, so they need to be savored and exhalted. This book shows us the best and worst of humanity and somehow leaves us with hope.    Here are a few things, among many, that I loved about this book. First, it takes a look at Nazi Germany from the perspective of \\"ordinary\\" Germans. It is so easily to villify Nazi Germany and project universal condemnation, but this story shows how many Germans became both victims and heroes. Second, the story is a love letter to books and the power of words. Any booklover recognizes the force that words play in our lives, and this book looks at that from the perspective of a girl who goes from no words to reading them and writing them and healing others in the process. Finally, the characters -- all of them -- are original and unforgettable. I had to keep reminding myself that these weren't real people, for they touched me as surely and deeply as many actual people I have known.    If I have one complaint about the book, it's that there was too much foreshadowing for my taste. Reflecting on the book, I realize that there was a lot of happiness in it, but you were always stopped short from fully appreciating or relaxing into it because of the sense of foreboding around the next corner.    A small complaint in the grand scheme of a grand story. Read it. You will not be disappointed.
0316143472|4.0|I love David Sedaris' readings on National Public Radio and his occasional written pieces in The New Yorker. Naturally, when I saw his latest collection of stories, I had to have it. David writes about, I guess, the essential and enduring crappiness of people, himself included. In doing so he amuses, but more importantly, reconciles you with your own crappiness. No wonder he's so successful.
1582701709|2.0|A little bit too focused on the material aspect of the Law of Attraction for my taste. I hope that most people picking up a book like this are looking to attract more than a new car and a good parking space. It would be a good introduction to the concept of the Law of Attraction for people without any previous exposure.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|Take a hero with superhuman powers (yea!), match him up against a villain with apparently identical powers (uh-oh!), and you have The Dark Knight. I always hated it that Batman movies are filmed in the dark, but that's Batman's shtick and what are you gonna do about it? This sequel isn't just visually dark, it's dark to the core of its very soul . . . so dark, in fact, I wonder how it managed to get its PG-13 rating. The violence is horrendous and graphic. Evil comes at you from all directions and never stops. Premise, plot line, ending . . . dark through and through. How residents of Gotham manage to get through the day without slitting their wrists is a mystery.  The Dark Knight was created by dementors.  I would never play this DVD with a 13-year-old in the room.
031606792X|5.0|This book is a wonderful ending to a beautifully written collection of sagas.  One can't be held accountable for being mesmerized by the entire story.  Its like the commercial \\"once you pop you just can't stop\\"  this is how it is when reading the entire collection.  No matter what age you are..it is fulfilling and stimulating.  This book arrived in excellent condition, safely packaged, and was earlier than it was expected.  Super Saver Shipping is the way to go.  Thanks Amazon for delievering on the quality you are known for.  From a dedicated consumer!~
B001GKJ2FW|2.0|My wife knew she was going to love Mamma Mia, and she did. I expected to have mixed reactions, because while I adore Meryl Streep, I never liked the music of ABBA.    My reactions weren't mixed at all. I hated Mamma Mia: the acting, the story line, the music, the lip-synching, the dancing. It was frivolous, shallow, vapid.    Yeah, so? All musicals are frivolous, yet there are many I love. Cabaret. The 2005 version of The Producers. The Sound of Music. What was it about Mamma Mia that riled me so?    I think I hated Mamma Mia because it was such a transparently cynical attempt to exploit a stereotype: the \\"female demographic\\" pandered to by morning news & entertainment shows, The View, Oprah & Doctor Phil, Access Hollywood. I suppose there are women who fit that stereotype, just as there are men who fit the \\"male youth demographic\\" stereotype movies like Transformers aim at.  But I don't have to like it.    Meryl, how could you? Where's your pride?
B00068TJM6|5.0|I loved this watch the moment I saw it on the internet.I said to my wife that if I have to get a watch it has to be this only.To my surprise my wife gifted me this watch on my birthday and to say the least I felt privileged to have this.  This is an awesome watch and more prettier than what it looks in the picture.  And I am not saying anything out of this world,you yourself can see the ratings and judge it yourself.  Although you need to explore all the features (not to mentions)a lot more than you actually need.  I will recommend anybody to buy this watch.
0783227434|4.0|The film still holds up for good laughs and a solid satirical storyline, but even in ninety minutes I felt the movie lagged at times. Overall, I was only mildly disappointed, mostly because it didn't live up to my unrealistic expectations after so many years. Anyone who has never seen this and likes the horror genre must watch it.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|While it is an amazing film, I don't think The Dark Knight needed to be a Batman film. The plot -really, the whole Nolanverse- takes the characters and skews them into dark entities they were never meant to be.    While Heath Ledger was an amazing Joker, he wasn't THE Joker. I know that this is more the fault of Nolan (if it can be called a fault over an alteration), and I'm sure Heath would've made a spectacular traditional Joker, but THE Joker is a maniac with only himself in mind who loves making a fool of people, not a depraved terrorist who tricks people into killing each other, carves a few up, and burns entire fortunes just to be flashy.

B0000640VN|4.0|This is a pleasant romantic comedy about time travel that is truly elevated by Hugh Jackman's carefully constructed, nuanced performance. If you're a fan of Jackman's, this is a must see.<br />This is not on the level of a Nora Ephron romantic comedy with her trademark witty character development, but it is amusing, sometimes thoughtful, and very romantic. Even Meg Ryan, who I've grown tired of as a rom-com staple, is better in this than in some recent films she's done. Breckin Meyer as Ryan's brother turns in a low-key, endearing performance.

B00007GZR5|4.0|I will be perfectly honest ... with myself.    I am a huge fan of Robin Williams' work, and I found him sympathetic enough that I found a kind of chemistry between the characters of Christy and Annie that was deeper than on-screen sexual destiny.  I completely bought into the more mature and engaging chemistry of two people who have shared some of the most important, most wonderful, and most painful experiences life can offer.  Add to this that the actors who play the children are gifted in bringing us around to liking them and being concerned over what bothers them.  There are only two role left, well, one actually...but I don't want to ruin that little tweak.  Suffice it to say that I am ever impressed by Cuba Gooding, Jr's emotional range and depth and his remarkable ability to share his outstanding interpretation of his character with us, and as for Max Von Sydow?  Who else can be so charming, strong, fatherly, and somehow frightening all at once?  For many of us, he will ever be the iconic \\"old priest\\" -- Father Merin from a little movie that never quite gives up its hold on #1 on the list of scariest movies ever made.     So that's the technical stuff.  Now for the honesty.      It is possible that this film is emotionally manipulative, and I know some critics that denounce such exhibits of film making prowess as \\"cheesy,\\" \\"predictable,\\" and \\"pushy.\\"   Twenty years ago, Robin starred in another emo machine called Dead Poets Society.  Again, critics who have not the talent to elicit more than cynicism panned the film because it succeeded in creating an emotional response.  Tell me Romeo & Juliet is anything but a calculated tear-jerker.  Shall we give Shakespeare one star?  So what's it all add up to?  Simply this honest statement:  I've not cried at a film like this since Dead Poets.  That film I cried at as a child beginning his first year of teaching.  This one I cried with as an adult who better    understands something of loss, regret, and never giving up.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|Annie is my favorite female rock vocalist. She's a strong writer with great vocal range. There are a few swell songs, but a few \\"skip throughs\\" unfortunately. My favorite solo Cd is still Diva, and I'll continue to purchase anything new she comes out with.
B000NVL9KG|5.0|When this album was recorded, prog keyboardists like Keith Emerson had organ, grand piano, mellotron (which Emerson doesn't use here) and monophonic Moog synthesizer (one note at a time, you couldn't do chords), which was then being scaled down into the more portable and easily programmed Minimoog. A bit confining, compared to the Korg and Yamaha polyphonic gear people like Neal Morse have available to them. Still, the antique gear Emerson uses here stands him in good stead when blended with Greg Lake's resonant baritone, articulate bass playing and very underrated acoustic guitar work done on his powerful dreadnought (used more on their other albums). The signature work is the title track, of course. That work enjoys the distinction of being that rare long track that is still covered by other artists, including a variation of the Hammond fanfare that is an \\"ID card\\" for the \\"Battlefield\\" section being used by Microsoft in the boot-up sequence of Vista. But it's too easy when you have a track like this one to dismiss the \\"short subjects\\" that round out the album. \\"Jeremy Bender\\" is a whimsical track in the manner of some of the work Emerson did as leader of his earlier band The Nice. \\"Bitches Crystal\\" is an oddity--a heavy metal jazz waltz, sort of Brubeck on a downer. \\"Infinte Space/ The Only Way\\" is an anti-hymn of disillusionment with Christianity and its seeming mission of stifling individual thought (you have to remember that the Boomer generation had pretty much had it with the jingoism being preached from some pulpits of that time), which seques into another Brubeck-ish 7/4 coda. \\"A Time and a Place\\" switches to Emerson's mighty C-3 with pretty much the same result as \\"The Barbarian\\" from ELP's freshman effort, but with a vocal that pushes the envelope on what high notes Lake could reach at the time. Then, to refute the mainstream/ punk claim that the prog crowd were \\"a bunch of geeks who took themselves too seriously what the object of rock'n'roll was fun\\", the group finishes off with a rollicking jest at this album's studio engineer Eddy Offord in the Jerry Lee Lewis style--\\"Are You Ready Eddy\\". This string of short tracks may seem an anti-climax following the epic \\"Tarkus\\" (maybe that one should have been the b-side finale of the original vinyl). Plus, each one seems to be aimed at a different type of listener. But none of them are throways. I guess you have to be a solid ELP fan to appreciate them all.the group finishes off with a rollicking jest at this album's studio engineer Eddy Offord in the Jerry Lee Lewis style--\\"Are You Ready Eddy\\".

0316017922|4.0|If you know and enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's previous books, this will be a good investment. If not, I would probably say starting with any of his books would be fine. The 'aha' quality of his writing, his interesting ideas and findings combined with small narratives makes his books a pleasure - but it seems this is his only angle on writing. This doesn't disappoint me but it also means that none of his books stands out as superior to the others in my mind.    I listened to Malcolm read the book in audiobook format and it made for a quick read. I could not wait to get the headphones on most of the time but there were some tiring spots where, if I had a microphone too, I would have said - alright Malcolm, I get the point! But, more often than not, those moments transformed into new insights and so, I left pleased.

1400032717|3.0|I was very intrigued by this book and would recommend it to others but the ending really bothered me--his dad is a murderer and a coward.  (He killed an animal in rage and didn't tell anyone and since no one presses charges and since its \\"just an animal\\" he gets away with it.) And the ending seems to brush over this and instead holds promise and happpiness. He even gets Christopher a dog of his own.  I say he should stay far away from \\"Father\\".

0375826726|3.0|I have just received my book ordered from this site.  I am disappointed in the quality of the book.  I have the others of the series and wanted this first edition printing for my collection.    The book itself has markings on the loose ends of the pages including the bottom corner where something green has rubbed onto the page edges.  This is a horrible example of a brand new book from a site that made their beginnings in selling books.    I have ordered many items from Amazon through the years and I don't know if this book was in this condition from their supplier or if these \\"damages\\" occurred with them.      I am extremely disappointed in the condition, almost like someone colored on the edges or the book was not protected somewhere along the way in shipping (it was well protected when shipped to me), but still, for the price of the book, a horrible specimen to send out as a new book.    It will not prevent my using Amazon for future purchases due to the experiences I have had with them through the years, however the damages also will reduce future value of the book as an individual or as part of a set.     I keep many different collections of books and this is one of the worst \\"new\\" books I have received so close to release.    I will update my review when I complete reading the book.
1595141979|5.0|Richelle Mead has a fan in me.     I fell for the Vampire Academy series very recently (as in two weeks ago). Although I can't say fairly that Shadow Kiss is my favorite book in the series - I love all of them! - I CAN say that I LOVED it.     There are a lot of things I loved about this book. What I love the most are Rose and Dimitri. You see their relationship take a new route. Where they had been avoiding each other before, suddenly they have lost their so-called \\"control\\" and learn that they can't deny that which makes them who they are.     I also loved Rose and Christian taking on Strigoi together.     Even though the ending of Shadow Kiss hurt so much to read, it was still an awesome addition to an awesome series. It left me sad and needing more. I am eagerly awaiting Blood Promise's debut!

B001GKJ2DO|2.0|I was very excited to watch this movie because it is my wife's favorite musical.  I knew the songs would be fun and just be an enjoyable movie to watch.  Wow was I wrong.  I suffered through an hour and fifty minutes of for the most part terrible singing and hyperactive acting.  If your idea for entertainment is listening to Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep sing then go ahead and enjoy.      Yes the actors looked like they enjoyed themselves and the song Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia were fun, that is why I gave it two stars rather then one.  I felt the acting was over the top and I caught myself laughing at the movie rather then laughing because it was actually funny.  I would recommend taking a pass on this one even if you like musicals.  Try Hairspray or Phantom of the Opera, those were much much better

B0010X8NF0|4.0|In the five years or so following the heaps of acclaim bestowed upon Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, and the commercial success of The Royal Tenenbaums, those who consider Wes Anderson a genius and an innovator seem to have lost some ground to those who consider him the worst thing to happen to cinema since someone decided it would be a good idea to start making movies out of video games.  Still, there's no denying that Anderson remains a premier visual stylist, and over the course of his last two movies the ambition of his storytelling has started to catch up with his artistic vision and his well-documented influences.  His most recent work, the Darjeeling Limited, continues in the globetrotting vein of its classic predecessor The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, while indulging pretty much all of the fetishes (alienated characters, meticulous wardrobe and set design, British Invasion and world music, Owen Wilson) that make Anderson's movies so quickly recognizable.  Like all of his movies, it at least looks good, which makes it a step up from the sitcom-style direction that marks a lot of Hollywood comedies these days, and as usual Anderson avoids the overreliance on contrived quirks that indie movies so often give in to.<br /><br />If you belong to the faction who say (not without reason) that Anderson's movies dwell excessively on familial dysfunction and father issues, The Darjeeling Limited definitely won't do much to answer your criticisms.  Following three estranged American brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman) who reunite a year after their father's death for a train trip across India, the movie explores the lingering divide between its relationship-impaired characters with Anderson's usual sympathy even as he pokes fun at their failings.  In a device only Anderson could get away with, Wilson's alpha-brother Francis lays out the parameters early on--a spiritual journey open to anything, no matter how shocking or painful--complete with an itinerary provided by Francis's alapecea-stricken assistant.  Of course, this being an Anderson movie, the trip quickly descends into a morass of resentment, backbiting, and fractured relationships, all conveyed with his usual deadpan humor and a bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />While I have to admit I was a little bummed about the near-total absence of Bill Murray this time around, if nothing else The Darjeeling Limited does mark another chapter in the fruitful collaboration of Anderson and Owen Wilson.  While their long-time connection hasn't quite reached the level of Scorsese-DeNiro or Kurosawa-Mifune,  the quality of their directing/acting/sometimes writing partnership does at least put them in the company of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.  Of late Wilson seems to have been in a contest with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn to see who can appear in the most mediocre Hollywood comedies, but he's always done good work with Anderson whether he co-wrote or not, and his performance here is a nice variation on the wide-eyed optimist persona that he first developed in Bottle Rocket.  As Francis's brothers and travel partners, Brody manages to at least add a layer of reflectiveness to his usual bland competence, while Schwartzman (sporting a classic adult-film mustache) skillfully projects the same mix of innocence and smarm that he brought to his Rushmore breakthrough.<br /><br />While Anderson's movies have never precisely taken place in the real world, The Darjeeling Limited does see him bringing his whimsical style to an exploration of cultural convergence as its wealthy, entitled protagonists find themselves adrift in a more traditional (and, the movie shows, in some ways backward) society.  Fittingly, it's not until the brothers are forced to deviate from their pre-planned itinerary that the trip really gets going, with their reconciliation mirroring their engagement with India and its more out-of-the-way locales.  Much like on The Life Aquatic, Anderson clearly made a playground of his exotic locations, and it all shows up in the film.  From some great, Scorsese-esque tracking shots inside the train to claustrophobic cityscapes to expansive cinematography of the Indian countryside, the setting figures as extensively in this movie as Anderson's old high school in Rushmore or the high seas in The Life Aquatic, adding another layer of the personality that's always set Anderson movies apart.<br /><br />Overall, aside from Anderson's usual visual flair, The Darjeeling Limited contains more than enough characterization and humor to be another sytlish and entertaining entry in the Wes Anderson filmography.  Not quite as essential as some of his other films, but if you like his prior work you should find a lot to enjoy in this one.de a playground of his exotic locations, and it all shows up in the film.

B001HPP2X2|5.0|Who hasn't heard of Dexter? Seriously.  This show is AMAZING.  Watch a couple of episodes (if the first doesn't hook you somehow).  Dexter on dvd/blu-ray is the best - it's just one of those shows that once you start, you'll finish it in a day or two.      Michael C. Hall - you rock!
B001EYGOG0|5.0|What's not to love about Tony Bennett, especially when he teams up with such a gifted group of musicians? This music comes from the heart and they have a lot of fun in the process. Great Christmas CD.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Just got the triggers today and they snapped on my PS3 controller without any problems.  They work great and after using them they feel so natural.  Best $5 I have spent in a long time.  Must have!
B00192KCQ0|1.0|I have to say I thought, with Bob Rock gone and Rick Rubin added, that the pu$$yness would have been beaten out of this band by now... I was wrong. This band sold out completely when they joined up with Bob Rock. He might as well still be with them though, as they just seem to be beyond redemption. Sad. Metallica was once-upon-a-time the greatest metal band ever. They have fallen and sunk lower than anyone else imaginable...<br /><br />The only good thing about this album is, since it sucks so much, it'll save you money, because you will not buy it...<br /><br />Why is it that Lars couldn't have been the one who fell out of the bus that day.....Sigh....
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I certainly am not upset that Yentl is finally coming to DVD...especially in a great 2-disc edition.  BUT...Amazon was preordering at $8.99...and now says that item was discontinued (????) and the DVD has to reordered at $20.99!!!  Hmmmmmmmmmmmm....
B000001FN3|5.0|This is the first album by The Alan Parsons Project. Alan Parsons is the engineer behind Pink Floyd's mega-success \\"The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" and he and project partner Eric Woolfson put together this incredible soundtrack to some of Edgar Allan Poe's writings. If you enjoy theme-oriented rock operas, this album should be in your collection.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I'd say it's interesting more than anything else.  There's nothing wrong with it, there's nothing mindblowing about it.  The first time I heard it was at a wedding reception dinner and it was really nice background music.  It's in no way an essential Beatles album, nor would I say it's for fans only (actually I think non fans would enjoy this more), nor would I say it's a good introductory album for people who are learning about the Beatles.  I've got it, I listen to it from time to time.  It's worth the money, it's worth the listen, I recommend it.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|From the familiar opening track \\"Sirius\\" to the powerful closing song \\"Old and Wise,\\" this album delivers a truly enjoyable listening experience. The Alan Parsons Project's albums are themed, and this one is loosely based on the subject of surveillance. However, I like the songs individually as well. This is a pop- and radio-friendly album, but please don't mistake that for shallow or simple. The works of The Alan Parsons Project are indeed deep and complex.  This album was released in 1982, but I did not \\"discover\\" it until 1994.<br /><br />The song \\"Silence and I\\" is truly remarkable, and probably one of the best rock-orchestra songs I have ever heard. The only problem is that at a running time of 7:19, it just seems too short. It could have easily been developed into a 15 minute piece. I bought this album (in CD format) in 1994 along with  \\"I Robot,\\" and 1994-1995 were transitional years for me. This album provided much-needed incentive to make fundamental changes in my life, all for the better. Any music that can do that is 5-star material for sure. Thank you, Alan Parsons, Eric Woolfson, and company.
1433502445|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is one of the best I have used. Aside from containing the ESV itself, which is a great translation (imperfect, like all translations, but very good), the study Bible has excellent notes, charts, and maps. The writing is good and clear, the scholarship is good and well-considered, and I was actually quite surprised how many different viewpoints on difficult topics are presented. The contributors clearly have doctrinal preferences on most if not all of these issues, but they are remarkably fair to differing viewpoints.    All in all, an excellent study Bible. Strongly recommended for those who want to go deeper and want commentary from a large number of individuals.
B000002U82|5.0|There is a reason why this album appears on just about every \\"best of\\" rock album list ever published, and why it remained on Billboard's top album list for 14 years. It's awesome. The songs, the lyrics, the sound effects, the mix, the clarity - it's all top-notch. This album was released in 1973, but there is no hint as to when it was recorded when you listen to it. It is timeless and certainly a classic.<br /><br />If you are younger and have never heard this album, I implore you to give it a try. You will discover the depth of a true classic rock album.
B000007R0S|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  I heard it during a demo of a 5.1 sound system and decided I had to have it.  It has been very enjoyable to listen to and it really takes advantage of the 5.1 sound system.
B000002U8G|4.0|This album came out in 1971, two years before their classic \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  This album is quite different, although the last track is certainly indicative of what is to come.<br /><br />About the magnificent song Echoes: This song is among my absolute favorites of all time, and I would have purchased Meddle just for this 23-plus minute masterpiece. On the original vinyl release, this song occupied all of side 2. How to describe this song? Imagine a journey to the bottom of the sea set to music, complete with whale song once you get there.  The various movements of the piece mimic your journey down and back up again. But, you can let your mind go anywhere you want, not necessarily on an underwater journey. Pop it in your iPod and take a walk  - you can cover nearly 2 miles during this song. This is certainly amoung Pink Floyd's best, and I wish I had discovered this album 38 years ago. As a side note, you can play this song while watching the \\"Jupiter and Beyond\\" segment in the movie \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" I don't know if the band did this on purpose, but it is a lot of fun.
0312330529|5.0|I'm a reader, not a writer so excuse me. This is a top book.   Read it and behold a great tale told greatly.    If you don't like it, suck it!
1554072840|4.0|This one of the best introduction to potty training books out there.    I did not give it 5 stars for the following reasons:  1.  The potty chair in the book looks like a jug with a handle on it.  It looks nothing like the potty chairs on the market.  2.  The book shows the potty chair being misused as other things, and I don't want to give my child any ideas.  However, the book does say, \\"No.\\"  The potty chair isn't for those purposes.  3.  There is a page where she misses the potty and accidentally pees and poops on the floor.  Again, I don't want to give my child any ideas, although I know the purpose was to show that accidents will occur.    Comparably speaking, this book is one of the best, and I've read LOTS of potty books.  It was worth my money.      The DVD is even better.  The potty chair actually looks like a potty chair, and it is clear in the DVD the potty chair should not be used for other purposes.  The DVD also includes both parents whereas the book only has a mommy.     I recommend buying the book and especially the DVD.
078322737X|5.0|This is a great DVD. It is the regular full length movie with additional features at the end explaining how, where and when the movie was filmed. There were funny stories about the process you wouldn't have known without this.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This descriptive tale was an interesting ride. I came in not knowing the history behind it at all. I found myself changing my views on the characters, which made for quite the reading ride.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|This is a very good CD if you liked him in AI you'll like the CD
0374530718|5.0|Thank you, Mr Gaarder.<br />This book opened a world of ideas for me.<br />It succeeded in its purpose of making philosophy a much more accesssible part of life, not merely a study of meaning, purpose, thought and ideas, but actually real and applicable. Having followed more than one philosophy course in the past, I found this book to be at least as useful and infomative, if not more so.<br />An incredible resource, reference book and a good story too; this is what he does, Mr Gaarder, he takes a concept, a principle, field, or a historical person, and breathes life into it. Love it!
B00005JPS8|5.0|The movie was awesome!  I'm not someone who grew up with the superhero characters so I didnt really have an interest in seeing this.  But I bought it for someone as a gift and we watched it together.  I am now a fan of this movie and cant wait for another one.
B000050FEN|4.0|I must say that the movies like Seven are not my favorite type of films; but Seven is an interesting movie in all aspects.it gives information about seven deadly sins in christianity.of course it has an interesting topic; someone kills people according to the seven deadly sins in christianity.this is interesting...  Both brad pitt and morgan freeman are good at their roles.and the rainy and dark places; and all these things make seven a classic.
0671449028|5.0|My son loves this book.  He requested it every night for me to read before bedtime.  We actually read it so much he memorized it at the age of 3.  I was so impressed.  I have bought other Sandra Boynton books, but this is the best.
0312383320|5.0|I can't agree with other reviewers.  This was a good Stephanie Plum.  I was disappointed in 14, but I enjoyed this one and got some very good laughs.  Joe, Ranger and Grandma made it in this \\"between the numbers\\" book, and that's a GOOD thing!!  It does have silly, nonsense in it.  People, this is FICTION, funny fiction!!!  Stephanie's life revolves around nutty things happening to her.  Diesel is a great caracter and I enjoyed Carl.  I hope Ms. Evanovich keeps writing the between books.  I am now looking forward to 15!!!!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing from start to finish, and the thought of Taylor writing every song on the CD is just mind boggling.  Here are the songs that will likely become singles, and could all become huge blockbuster hits on both Country and Pop radio:    ~1~\\"Love Story\\"  ~2~\\"White Horse\\"  ~3~\\"You Belong With Me\\"  ~4~\\"Fearless\\"  ~5~\\"The Way I Loved You\\"    Note:  \\"Change\\" was a big hit last summer at the Olympics, and \\"The Best Day\\" - which happens to be the best song on the whole album - most likely will not get released as a single.  It's sad, but this CD is so loaded with hits, \\"Fifteen\\" and \\"Forever and Always\\" will probably also just become amazing album tracks.  So make sure you buy this CD - it is an absolute classic!!!!!!!!

B001FBSMW6|4.0|When I was in high school in the 1980's, the word \\"poser\\" frequently referred to someone who only became interested in a band or artist after they hit mainstream.<br /><br />Example (from 1985): That Madonna wannabe is such a poser! She only started listening after \\"Like A Virgin\\" got popular.<br /><br />By this qualification, I am a self-confessed poser when it comes to Keane.  I have very little interest in their first two albums, thereby incurring the wrath of at least half the people posting here.  But Perfect Symmetry is simply a fun wonderful piece of music!  The songs are catchy, the sound is amazingly crisp, the lyrics are introspective and gloomy.  It's the best damn album that The Psychedelic Furs never recorded!<br /><br />My personal highlight: \\"Pretend That You're Alone\\" (sorry Beauchamp). There is something so very inspiring, alive, and well, lonely about this song.  The opener \\"Spiralling\\" is a great welcome into this 80's retro world, and \\"The Lovers Are Losing\\" sends my mind back to twirling around in a club around kids with big green hair and shoulder pads.<br /><br />In short, this album will please the posers such as myself.  For all the serious hardcore Keane fans, take your nose out of your classical novels and lighten up!!
0199536481|4.0|I've seen the 1988 picture directed by Stephen Frears several times, and each viewing left me making a promise to myself that I would read the book. Finally I do it with great enthusiasm. This is a reminder that I am reviewing Les Liaisons Dangereuses published by Oxford World's Classics. At the beginning, I am greeted by the bibliography of the author Choderlos de Laclos and then an overlong thirty page introduction of first half offering more insights into Choderlos' life and his personality which is quite educating and second half which dreadfully becomes an analysis of the story itself I am about to embark to read (but I skipped reading the latter half entirely). At least I can say thanks to the presenter for failing to mention that excessively odious made film with three kids that was released in 1999. Now Les Liaisons Dangereuses...I'll say that I am torn apart between two aspects. Firstly, I couldn't stand the reading of the letters after such a time because of the increasingly fluffiness of the language when a few sentences would suffice. Then again, that's the traditional writing of that period of time. At the same time, the letters do advance the story very slowly that it actually takes pages before the next step is finally taken. For a book that is a little bit more than three hundred pages, it's a surprisingly slow moving story although in an epistolary form. Yet Choderlos de Laclos achieves the impossible here: keeping along with the flow of the story quite nicely while admirably shifting between tones and attitudes of the characters albeit the almost one-dimensional unfolding of the actions. Quite an achievement...yes. On the other side of the coin, I have a hard time tolerating the characters' personalities most especially Marquise de Merteuil, C&eacute;cile Volanges, and Chevalier Danceny. The way they wrote had my eyes rolling so many times by the way they described whatever they were feeling and pretentiousness of them (which is probably the true intention of the author to achieve this specific effect so to make me to feel this way). Vicomte de Valmont shouldn't find himself absolved of the crime either. That's why it's hard for me to keep my attention level high enough to read on; somehow, some of the sentences in the letters are so damned hard to follow yet I don't think it's Choderlos de Lacos' fault but the translator Douglas Parm&eacute;e who had the audacity to be further sneering in his explanatory notes which were postmarked during the reading. I honestly forewent all of them and read the book without bothering to check in the back of the book (a great hindrance to my flow of reading). After finishing reading Les Liaisons Dangereuses, I honestly feel that the book is a literature of very high morality although there are instances of immoral acts and creations. The latter part didn't bother me very much because I still think all of the characters are absolute jokes and would be laughed at (again, possibly the exact intention of Choderlos de Laclos). I must say, I was ready to give the book a `3' but Letters 163 to 175 along with the feeling of what Choderlos de Laclos wanted to say as the true purpose of the book carried me over to `4'. To start the blame game, I'll say that everybody is at least in fault for the misfortune of the situations; most of the blame is owned to Marquise de Marteuil and Vicomte de Valmont. As for Madame de Tourvel, what the hell is wrong with this girl? She is claimed and claims to be so virtuous yet she already has cheated on her husband by secretly corresponding with the rogue and each time she says she refuses to speak with him again, she still never follows through her word. What a hypocrite. C&eacute;cile Volanges is an everlastingly dumb girl who can't keep straight on her path to righteousness, but it's actually Chevalier Danceny who really started off the snowball effect in her mind yet cheats on her by committing infidelity with Marquise de Merteuil. Finally, Madamede Volanges...I admit her situation is the most difficult and the most interesting of any because really to be in her shoes, it is not easy to have prevented what had just happened. She was almost and absolutely in the dark in the entire time although she did have tried to exert some influence on Madame de Tourvel's wrestling with her feelings of Vicomte de Valmont. So, I am almost inclined to give Madame de Volanges a full pardon from blame. All in all, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, despite some of its shortcomings at least from on-the-surface reading viewpoint, is an outstanding piece of work, but in the future, I will only read the book for a last try and this time through a different and hopefully better translation.mit her situation is the most difficult and the most interesting of any because really to be in her shoes, it is not easy to have prevented what had just happened.

0765316897|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's The Hero of Ages is an impressive conclusion to his first trilogy of fantasy novels. His writing style, captivating to begin with in Elantris, has matured over the course of the Mistborn series. This final installment strays far from the classic fairytale ending paradigms to create something truly surprising, leading the reader to question many of the conclusions they form along the way. I found it easy to get caught up in the story and was very satisfied with its ending, which brings a sense of closure while hinting at the possibility of things to come.
0425220931|4.0|I love Victor and his playing through and through and have since I first caught him with Bela Fleck.  He's definitely one of the most talented bassists around and his positive attitude shines through every performance.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  A lot of it is wrapped in new age examples and personal spiritual experiences that are difficult to swallow.  But read between the antics of Victor, Michael and the larger cast of characters and you get solid advice on approaching improvement as a musician, particularly if you're a bassist.  Learning to listen, learning to play the spaces, learning to set up an audience for desired effect.<br /><br />Worth your time, but be prepared for a lot of hocus-pocus among the practical advice.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|The DVD's are just what I wanted with both HD and regular episodes available in one convenient location.  The remastered Star Trek shows are fantastic!  The cases however are not up to par.  They are made of substandard brittle plastic, and seem to break just by looking at them.  The last DVD set of the original series, was well made of a nice somewhat flexible sturdy plastic.  It seems that these new cases were a cost cutting effort.  Well, for the price that the DVD's are listed for one just expects a better product, one that is ranked up there with Star Trek the show!

B001OGWY1W|5.0|This series is so much better than the Tim Burton adaptation. What a shame about Heath Leger... if he doesn't win some kind of Academy Award for this performance, I don't know what will. He has no equal as the Joker.
0930289234|5.0|I just can't wait for the movie opening up in May.  This a quick read and the second half picks up like throttle on a motorcycle.
1580088694|5.0|Wonderful book! I saw it at my son's P&T meeting as they were using it at school and I had to buy it for myself. This book equals a visit to a home in each country they depict. Unbelievable!
B000R7HY0K|4.0|They sell the movies separately yet they were in theaters together.  Besides the point, this movie drags on until the last scene when Kurt Russell races the three girls.  I liked it but not my favorite.
0062502182|5.0|For me, great movements in my life have never started with spirituality, depending instead on hard work and a determined push towards the goal.  And yet, my experience with The Alchemist was so life-changing, so profound, so topical, that when I recall it a shiver marches through me to the very bowels of my being.    It was the summer of 2007 and, through no one's fault but my own, I found my life in the toilet.  I felt as if there were four walls surrounding me, locking me in place, and as if all of my hopes and dreams were being flushed away by a torrent of terrible experiences.  It was so bad that I was feeling it physically - doubled-over by cramps and wracked by cold sweats.  As I said, I consider myself a determined fellow, so even though I managed to pass the primary obstacle that was tormenting me prior to finding The Alchemist, I still felt soiled by the experience and unable to leave my tiny prison.    And then, like a miracle, I found the book (literally - it was under a sink).  I read the back jacket and suddenly a voice in my head, clear as day, was telling me \\"this is what you need\\".  And you know what?  It was.  I was touched by the start of Santiago's journey in Chapter 1 - Coelho writes with a soft, gentle style that felt like silk to my tired soul.  I wiped out the first half of the book without moving from my spot - it felt like it might have been just a minute or two.  And yet even after finishing with just half the book, I knew I had what I needed: I felt clean again, able to finally move on with my life.    So I flushed the soiled pages and left the bathroom, having found the best possible use for this terrible, terrible book.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I love Batman but looking past that, this is a great movie that renewed faith in the franchise with Christian Bale and Michael Caine.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Funny funny funny. We enjoyed this as much or more than any recent animated feature. That is one funny Panda! Jack Black simply kills it!
B001I189MQ|5.0|One of my personal favorite movies of the year.  Some people who enjoyed Iron Man may also enjoy this film.  This takes a more serious look at Bruce Wayne and the reality of being a superhero or not. I highly recommend this film on bluray.  The special effects pop off the screen and since it was also shot in imax film, the longshots of buildings and skylines are gorgeous in HD.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Everything about this watch is awesome.  I have only worn it for several weeks and have received many compliments.  It is classy and really catches a lot of attention.  I've never been much of a \\"watch guy\\" and I have purchased a few just to look like I am all grown up.  My other watches are rather expensive but seldom get noticed by others.  This watch is by far the best and around 90% less costly.  I would definitely recommend this watch.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The way the BBC team arranged these beautiful videos is really amazing.  If you want to push the limits of your HD tv, play this series.  You will seen in continous shots changing of seasons, waterfalls, and so many obscure places on earth that are breath-taking.
B0000062Y2|3.0|Most of the performances on this album are good, and I particularly liked Carl Anderson as Judas, and Larry Marshall as Simon.    However, Ted Neeley's vocal performance has always seemed far sub-par to Ian Gillan's in the original album.     Neeley has an annoying vocal habit which, once you notice it, is very hard to ignore:  He consistently begins each line a beat or two late, and then catches up at the end of the line.  I assume he intends for this to add extra drama to the vocal performance, but I find it very distracting because he does it so consistently.    I saw him play Jesus in a 1980s stage production, and this affection had gotten even worse, to the point, where on certain stanzas, I would be cringing, thinking he was going to throw the musicians off.    I suspect that if I had heard Neeley's version first, I wouldn't have quite such a problem with his performance.  I imagine that many of those who prefer the movie soundtrack are those who heard it first, and for whom Neeley's interpretation feels 'right'.    For me, Ian Gillan is the definitive Jesus.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|Great buy on the Gold box deal.  First one is much better with all of the fight scenes, the second one is also good but Kung fu dialogue is not bearable after the first hour.  Overall, a must buy on bluray.
0786838655|5.0|As a mom with 5 kids, I've been reading children's literature a long time. This series is one of the best I've found! It has non-stop action, lots of humor, a girl and a boy as the two main characters- so everyone can relate to someone- and a well-developed plot. Each book is as good as the previous one, unlike many series, where the author is milking the success of his first -and only- good book. I highly recommend this to anyone, including reluctant readers. I'm guessing you'll love it, too!
B00129H7VS|5.0|A must buy on Bluray for any fan of action and war movies. Im not a fan of David Schwimmer, spelling?, anyway, very interesting and the special effects are on par with Saving Private Ryan.  Great writing also.
B001GJOL22|4.0|For startes, any concert DVD with Rush is going to be first rate in terms of performance.  I have four other live Rush DVD's and this one is somewhat disapointing as the first blue-ray version I've owned.  I'm picky when viewing live shows and I expect to see the audio synchronized with hand movements on stage.  In this production, hand movements for Alex, Geddy, and particularly Neil are off throughout the entire show.  It's becomes annoying at times, particularly when watching a masterful performance such as Neil's drum solo, which is a conerstone of every Rush show.  That fraction of a second delay between audio and video is just poor editing during production.  The set list and sound quality are excellent and I'd recommend this disk if you didn't get a chance to catch them on the Snakes and Arrows tour.  Just be prepared for delays between audio and video synchronization.
0152048049|5.0|Some time in the past year or so I read some of the other reviews here, including some that fill in the story of de Saint-Exupery's life.  In the end, this remains a perfect little book.  It became a part of me when I read it as a young adult, and I enjoyed it just as much 30 years later when I happened upon it in a bookstore in New York.  Essential reading.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is a wonderful CD! If you like Norah Jones then you'll be happy with Adele. They both have such a unique voice that you don't come across very often. I've listened to it over and over again. Go get it, you won't be disappointed.
1416562605|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this book at first even with all the good reviews + the fact this book won a prize. Usually books that win prizes are boring(in my opinion). The White Tiger deserved to win a Man Booker prize! What a page turner! I never knew what was going to happen next and I loved the dark humor.<br />Grade A+.
B000MTFDCO|4.0|This is a great film that will keep you on the edge of your seat almost through out the whole movie.I don't want to go in to the movie because it will give it away.It a steal for 10.00 dollars.I did not give it 5 stars because the very end i though was a little weak.Also i can't stand Sean Penn.
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|First off, Clint Eastwood may not have a whole lot of range as an actor, but this is the kind of role he and few others can pull off and be believable. The man is a legend for both acting and directing. This movie was close to getting five stars from me, but there was one thing I couldn't get over. Some of the Asian actors, including the main kid Eastwood's character befriends, have never acted before and it shows big time. It's even painful to watch them try to act at times. Now what really caught me by surprise was just how funny the movie is. Clint has some great one liners and most are racially charged, but it is done in such a way that it's funny, not offensive. My whole theater erupted with laughter on several occasions. There is also a scene in a barber shop where Walt (Eastwood) tries to teach his new friend Thao (Bee Vang) how to talk like a man. This is one of the funniest scenes I have seen in recent memory.<br /><br />If you are a fan of any of his westerns or the Dirty Harry films, you'll find much to enjoy here. In fact he could have called this thing Dirty Harry 6: The Golden Years.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
1563894696|5.0|As someone else said, I was also afraid of how I would like Batman taking on the mob.  Not to worry though, it is mob based but there are the famous Batman villains.  From one Halloween to the next Halloween, a killer named Holiday is loose and knocking off mob members.<br /><br />You'll get to see Bruce Wayne in jail.  The story is easy to follow and read.  Catwoman is drawn nicely.  If you like the pulp stories or gangster films of the old days, you'll like this.
B000TGJ80S|3.0|It's not often that a novel, not to mention a great classic is transformed into a novel with beauty, style and faithfulness to the source. This wonder of cinema captures the Victorian era, the collated diary style so effective in the novel and is packed with little details only readers will pick up. This film fails in only one respect, the Mina/Vlad Love Story. It's terrible and a stain on the entire picture. It sticks out like a thorn in the side of the this otherwise faithful film. Everyone seems to blame that James Hart guy but as the director FF Coppola had the final say, it is, in the end, his fault. I can't help but think that it was put in to make the film feature length. Other than that, the film is well cast, with wonderful performances by mostly everyone. I personally liked Gary Oldman, the 3 suitors, Lucy, Renfield and Hopkins' Van Helsing the best. Hopkins isn't over the top at all when you read about Van Helsing's rants in the book. Check out his \\"King Laugh\\" speech when he explains while he laughs and cries in quick succession after Lucy's death in the novel and you'll see the connection with Hopkin's performance. Altogether, a wonderfully great adaption save for the one jarring element, the love story.
0440539811|5.0|I never thought I would have the desire to read a 800 page book.  It takes a great author to be able to take you along for 800 pages.  This book was hilarious and introduced me to Robert Anton Wilson.  If you're wanting to read something different then look at this.  I was bored with reading until I discovered RAW and HP Lovecraft.  Good stuff here!  No kidding!
B00008976Y|5.0|This 1993 masterpiece is a profound meditation on loss. The \\"blue\\" of the title shows up throughout; it's extraordinary how the film-makers integrate it into almost every shot. This is a movie where everything counts -- the photography, the music, the composition of the shots, the dialogue, the acting -- everything.<br />Juliet Binoche gives a wonderfully restrained performance as a woman who loses her husband and small daughter in a horrible accident. She tries to kill herself but cannot go through with it so she rebuilds a new kind of life -- a life without connection, without purpose, empty. The movie deals with her slow realization that this kind of detachment is ultimately impossible. Slowly, she begins to reconnect -- to a prostitute who lives in her building, to her mother suffering from Alzheimers, to her husband's lover and finally to the man who loves her.<br />This is a profound movie well worth watching and then thinking about.
0930289234|5.0|I wanted to buy this before the movie came out to understand it better.  I was impressed with the drawings and characters.  The characters are all flawed.  The Comedian isn't a funny character.  He's a lowlife.  Hard to feel sympathetic towards him, so it shows the mind frame of Rorschach who sets the ball into motion.  It's a great read.  I wasn't expecting the ending.  It was a nice twist.  It was a great read.<br /><br />I didn't like the pirate comic that was within the story.  That's the only thing I disliked.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight might be the best Batman film ever made and 2008 movie of the year. Heath Ledger gave a grandstanding performance as the Joker.  YOU MUST SEE IT FOR THE THE SAKE OF THE JOKER.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I love the music on this cd.  One song that really stands out is Starstruck. I play it over and over.  Lady GaGa is a new music star to watch.  I will definately look for anything new she releases.  She is refreshly clever with her style and style of music! Her debut on \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\" this past summer was absolutely fantastic to watch and I have been on the watch for her ever since.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Was really a great movie.  Humans can be slobs.  It was a interesting take on cleaning up earth.
0763631205|5.0|I, like so many others, love the story \\"A Christmas Carol\\", and I love a lot of the movies that have been done on this story, the version with Alastair Sims being my all time favorite.  But I've always wanted the buy the book, and I wanted to find one that was as beautiful as the story, and this book is!  Beautiful pictures, nice thick pages, nicely bound, and just pretty to look at.  And the story is the unabridged version, so its Dickens actual words total and complete, and you can't beat the price! I would totally recommend this version!  Buy it, you won't be sorry.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|Do not buy this series unless you have a HD DVD player. Because they do not make them anymore.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been doing this workout for more than a week, and the first time I was sore and exhausted. Now, I'm doing Level One pretty well, and feel great. The program does a good job of getting your heart rate up, building strength and toning in a short amount of time, without injury. This is well worth your time and money. I also appreciate Jillian's attitude. Exercise isn't fun, and she doesn't try and make it perky and cute. But she gets the job done and she gets results.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|I first saw that they were FINALLY coming with the trilogy on blu ray like 6 months ago, and I had it on my wish list for the longest, anyways...  Like the other review this should've been out for the holidays.  I cant wait, i didn't buy it on DVD because i knew they had to come with it, so hurry up and put this out, because I'm getting my copy!

B00005OM4K|5.0|CCR were and alwys will be one of the greatest rock bands ever created.  John Fogerty is carring the CCR torch by himself these days and doing a very good job with it, but this collection shows in full how great CCR truly were.  Fogerty's vocals are second to none, awesome guitar and just flawless performance.  Contained here are some of the greatest rock music in american history.
1594201927|3.0|This is a good reference book to give the average reader an idea of what money currently is, and what represented in mankind's history. It's not academic, so it can be read easily.
1406301639|5.0|This is a fun story for the child and the adult.  I find myself saying the repeated line, \\"We're going on a bear hunt....\\" in my head.  The pictures are terrific and the story line is cute.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|WOW!  Awesome series. The show just keeps getting better and better.  what more can they do to these poor guys.    I can't wait to purchase season 4..    P.S.  It would'nt hurt to find a way to bring John Winchester back!  What a guy!
B001EOQWEO|4.0|I'll be blunt rather than sugar coat it. I don't like the Wall-E robot, nor his companion. They are much too cutsie as well as noisy, for silent robots sent on a mission or enduring private duties. In fact, the movie doesn't get rolling for me until we meet the captain of the ship on it's last survival trek from a demolished earth planet. The captain is far more interesting than Wall-E, and his dilemma with trying to figure the new mission of the escape ship due to a discovery of possible new plant life sample thru Wall-E is really the base of the movie. His haggling with the automatic pilot refusal to accept a new mission is also clever. It doesn't matter the condition of the crew, but just goes to show the possibilities of personnel so strapped to seats & monitors, you would think they would have sense enough to break for a gym, or look up steady nutrition to combat obesity. Regardless, it's about our unwillingness to abandon earth entirely even after it has been overrun with decay, as long as it shows the slightest hint of hope to revitalize. Animation in ship is a winner as well as soundtrack score. Define treadmill.
0807014265|4.0|This is a very powerful book both spiritually and intellectually.  I read it more than 20 years ago and but when re read it ths time, it still moves and inspires me to live life diligently to my fullest capacity.
0307278409|4.0|I loved the book and the progression of the language in the book.  Very good.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I LOVE this soundtrack and it's one of those CD's that I can just pop in and listen to the whole thing without having to skip songs. It has beautiful songs and I have listened to it over and over again and I am still not sick of it.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I always love Tarantino film soundtracks, This one did not disappoint. I wish I had purchased one without explicit lyrics though because I fail to see the point of the language on this album.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|I have read other reviews complaining about the 'insert' being too large to fit the Blu-ray version of the remastered trilogy, but in reality I was able to place the insert inside the case without issue.  Picture looks great and the movies themselves are of course classics so I am glad I waited until now to purchase.  The first time I saw these movies was on VHS so anything is better than that.  Thanks to Amazon for the black-friday sale where I got these movies for over 50%off, and the sale ran longer than Best Buy's did.  It was an offer I couldn't...well you know.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I loved the original but the extended version is even better and filled with extras making it worth the extra $$.
6305882592|5.0|This film has been well described by many other reviewers so I won't rehash the plot.  However, despite the overwhelming theme of death and dying - real and faked - this is one of the most ultimately joyous films I have ever seen and loved.  Just hearing a Cat Stevens song from the movie makes me smile and laugh out loud.  We are all crazy sometimes and we are all wound too tightly sometimes.  And sometimes a love that can go nowhere is exactly what we need.
B001GKJ2DO|2.0|Having grown up in the disco era, with ABBA on the radio every ten minutes, I thought this would be an interesting and enjoyable movie.  I was wrong.  It tried too hard in some places, not enough in others, and plodded along for the most part.  The pretense was actually quite the setup for a good comedy. Strong actors was a good move also and the location was great! The unfolding of the plot was weak, at best. And it seemed some of the songs just didn't fit well to what was going on.  I'm not sure what I would have done differently here... the story was made to be wrapped around songs by the group ABBA. These songs weren't written for that purpose and therefore the fit just isn't quite right.  This is definitely a chick flick and geared for the teen section. Which I'm sure it will win over. Myself?  I watched it and returned it. Don't think I'll watch it again.
B001NFNFNU|2.0|So this movie was very well written, and seemed to have a really good story behind it. So you ask how do I manage only two stars? Acting my friends or lack there of. This movie is attempting to tell an emotional story that is trying to draw you in. It's like doing The Godfather with Big Bird as Don Corleone. You just can not but into it. I tried to enjoy this because of the story, and the well written movie, but I could not get past the acting. Its just bad, scenes where you are supposed to be drawn to tears, end up have you laughing, or scenes where you are supposed to be enraged, once again laughing, and not as so often put \\"funny ha ha\\" but instead \\"funny oh no\\". I highly reccomend that if you feel you must see this movie for the story, rent it, or get it on demand, but do not buy this, you will be sorry if you do.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I cannot say enough good about this movie. If you are a fan of comic book movies, or action movies, this is for you! It has it all!  A few things struck me in this movie that didn't in the others.  First, gotham has a 'real city' feel to it this time. Not so unrealistic as in the other movies with oddly shaped buildings and dark skylines. This city is glass and concrete, proportional to other large cities and similar in appearances.  Second... the Joker. Sad note here is we'll never have Heath Ledger as the Joker again. Truly sad because he took this character into a malevolent level that had never been done before. The insanity of this character came shining through.  Third... Two Face! What a great adaptation of this villian! I haven't read the comics since I was a child, but the earlier series of Batman movies gave this character a different flow into the story line. This line is much more believable.  Fourth... all was taken seriously. I like that a lot.  Instead of having the comic book feel on film, they took the story seriously and presented it to you.  Sets, costumes, gadgets, plot, acting, music.... all was done to excellence. More adult in nature, though, than the previous series of Batman flicks.  Late teenagers to adults will enjoy this if they like comic book or action movies.... I don't believe this is good for children.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I guess I can tell everyone ahead of time that this will be a very bias review, seeing how I've been a Rush fanatic since 1979....That being said-this DVD is spectacular. A lot of time went into the production, and the results speak for themselves.  The sights and sounds of this Blu-ray disc are incredible! Every little detail of the concert stands out, and begs to be viewed..The cameras were placed in just the right areas to capture every detail of a live Rush show....not only do you get a bird's-eye view of the professionalism of the band, but you also get to see the humorous side of the band as well, mainly through Alex. His antics and facial expressions towards the end of the concert prove again that although Rush is a true professional band, with incredible musicians, they also learned to not take everything seriously as well.   The setlist is great, with Entre Nous making the setlist for the first time ever.  Circumstances was played live as well for the first time in many years, and sounds wonderful.  Of course you get the old radio favorites like \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Freewill\\", and \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", but you get fan favorites as well including \\"Natural Science\\" (my favorite), \\"YYZ\\", \\"Passage to Bangkok\\", \\"Mission\\", \\"Between the Wheels\\", and many more.  These guys know how to put on a live show, and it really shows in magnificent detail in this DVD.  The only thing that I would change is the crowd...they went to Rotterdam to film this, when I believe they should have recorded the entire DVD in the United States(you do get four \\"bootlegged\\" songs from Atlana). The Rotterdam crowd seemed to be very subdued, and I think if it was done with an American crowd, you would have gotten a better view of what the typical Rush crowd was like at a show.  That being said...this DVD gets a \\"big thumbs up\\" from me, and should be a staple in any Rush fans video library. You ask \\"what do I have to compare it against\\"??? I saw this tour live 4 times, so it feels just like I was there again. And that is the best compliment a band can receive about a live recording that they've put out.....5 out of 5 stars!
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Everything has already been covered in other reviews here. This is a strong debut from this duo, and it's no surprise that they sound like The Flaming Lips since they used David Fridmann as their producer.<br /><br />\\"Time To Pretend\\" expands upon the sample from Aphex Twin, to make a great song, one of the best on the cd. Elsewhere, \\"Weekend Wars\\", \\"The Youth\\", \\"The Handshake\\", \\"Future Reflections\\" remind me of something Donovan might have done in the 1960's. \\"Electric Feel\\" has a Prince vibe to it. \\"Pieces of What\\" is Pink Floyd-ish. \\"Kids\\" has a more electronic edge to it.<br /><br />Generally, this is a nice collection of songs that are diverse enough to hold your attention, and the lyrics are interesting enough to think about. It will be interesting to see what they do next.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Beautifull box, made of good quality materials. Includes the Pilot Episode's script, printed with photos. A tribute to the show.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GKJ2FM Mamma Mia! The Movie (Full Screen)]] How fun is this?  Sing along and enjoy the songs and the story again and again with your own DVD. Whether you saw the Theater Production or the movie at the theater, this is a wonderful DVD to own. Susan Kalina
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm having a hard time writing this because I simply don't know where to start.  Out of the doldrums of the writers strike, the Whedon clan has managed to craft an amazing musical.    The acting is superb and the singing even more so.  Harris and Day play off of each other in a way that is simply magnetic.  The songs range from over-the-top hysterical to tear jerking and soulful.  Not bad for what is essentially a comic book brought to life.    The singular fault I had with this production was that it was over far too quickly and I hate waiting for the hinted at continuing escapades of Dr. H and the ELOL.  Write quickly, Joss.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Our kids love to play board games.  They like this game because of the family interaction, the multiple dimensions, and even the bright colors.   We like this game because it helps them think ahead - it creates opportunities for us to talk about options and making good decisions.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|I am a 57 year old man who loves a wide range of music from classic rock to blue grass and even some symphony compilations. I can honestly say that when I first listened to, and watched, Roy Orbison perfoming on stage with all of these other excellent performers I was amazed by Roy's voice and the interaction between him and all the others. Since then I have watched it several times and it will continue to be an alblum that I will never grow tired of. This DVD is a classic that showcases Roy's incredible voice and songwriting talent.

6305428522|5.0|What Happened to 'Weng Weng'?  Everyone knows Quiz Show is an amazing film. I give it 5 Stars.   But did you know this....  Little known fact- the `Quiz Show' set was closed down for 2 days when Redford and Fiennes had a disagreement over whether Fiennes would be allowed to have his 2'9\\" miniature Silverback Gorilla `Weng Weng' (Swahili for \\"Sexy Pants\\") on-set with him.   Fiennes, who insisted in playing \\"catch\\" and wrestling with `Weng Weng' when not at call, was often at costume designer Kathy O'Rear's wit's end. The costume designer said she had no clue how to get out those kinds of stains from a Giorgio Armani suit. Additionally, several of the cast and crew had to be treated for gorilla related injuries, including, actor Paul Scofield. The most serious incident involved Craft Services manager Michael Demers who suffered a gunshot wound while trying to remove `Weng Weng' from the cafeteria. Fiennes claimed no knowledge of how `Weng Weng' acquired the handgun.   Executive producer Richard Dryfuss had to finally step in and mediate an agreement. It is not known what the outcome was but Weng Weng was never seen again.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Okay I'm a 21 year old guy and this was the secound blu ray I bought 2 years ago. I thought the movie was cute the colore and the picture quality is top notch. I would give the movie 5 out of 5 stars and the pq qaulity a 5. The specail features are good to.

B00009ZYC1|5.0|My grandson wanted Shrek 1 and this was a great price for a hard to find movie.
0312360266|1.0|I think these books might have been better if I were still in high school. But probably not.  Sadly, once I finished the first book I had to know what happened, just for completion of the story, so I read the next two, thinking that the writing might get better.  Nope.  So now I'm just going to stop reading.  The plot is not bad, though slightly reminiscent of Harry Potter, only with vampires.  It's the main character who kills it.  Zoey is an annoying mix of ditz and goody-goody.  She's supposed to be this intelligent Chosen one who is special and different than everyone else, yet she is no different than the rest of the blandly babbling teenagers you see in stereotypical high school movies or books.  BLAH.  P.C. Cast's daughter says she went over the writing to make it sound like a teenager.  Well, I don't know what teenagers she knew or what she was like as one, but at times I actually found myself cringing in annoyance at Zoey and her ditzy blather.  Not to mention the fact that she says, as one other reviewer points out, that she doesn't fit in, yet she is dating the star quarterback in the beginning, and soon meets the most popular boy at vampire school, who is likewise smitten.  This all might make more sense if she was believably characterized as being different and intriguing, not like other teenagers.  As it is, I can't understand why anyone would pick her out of the rest of the rabble.  Everyone in this book sounded like middle schoolers, not sixteen-almost-seventeen-year-olds.  Also, after three of these books, you will find yourself wanting to scream after hearing her mention her love of brown pop the millionth time.  Bottom line: don't bother reading these.  It's too annoying.
B000MTFFZY|5.0|This Nightwish-sounding band should pretty much be music to any alternative genre lover's ears. Once engaged, you become entranced by the craftily created harmonics and vocals. Songs are uplifting, powerful, epic, and remind one perhaps of battles, days of old, and the supernatural. Highly recommend.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|The trail of good cop/bad cop films grows longer as does the fascination with Serial Killers (witness the success of the excellent television series DEXTER where killing of 'people who deserve to die' is condoned).  RIGHTEOUS KILL is a good story with problems: the script is wrinkled with aphorisms, the direction allows the dialogue to overlap so often that subtitles are required to keep the viewer alert as to what is happening, and the music score too often drowns out what could be heard of the actors' voices.  But at the core of this much-maligned film is a tour de force for two aging actors (actually three) in Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and  Brian Dennehy.  Jon Avnet works with crusty lighting effects and photography to create a sense of tired, aging, worn out detectives who show us a side of law enforcement we'd rather not see.<br /><br />Turk (Robert De Niro) is seen in the opening in a videotaped monologue about how he came to kill 14 people while in the line of duty.  His partner is Rooster (Al Pacino) and the two of them run their mode of law enforcement in their own style: even their boss Lieutenant Higgis (Brian Dennehy) gives them free reign.  An event occurs which triggers the concept of a serial killer whose murders of 'worthless street trash' victims who are tied to crimes for which they escape punishment.  Turk's fellow detective (an S&M girlfriend) Karen (Carla Gugino) becomes suspicious as do young detectives Perez (Leguizamo) and Riley (Donnie Wahlberg) - the idea of the perpetrator being a cop drives the 'honest cops' to extremes.  The twist at the ending could have had more impact with a better script (the work of Russell Gewirtz), but the interplay between De Niro and Pacino makes the entire film and ending well worth watching.<br /><br />Great movie? No, but given the flaws and the overexposure of the theme the 'old guys' carry it off and provide a riveting, fast paced film worth the attention of more viewers.  Grady Harp, January 09

B001F7MSFM|4.0|\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" takes a more fantasy approach in the second installment of Hellboy. This time, Hellboy and his pals from the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense take on a renegade elf-prince and his bid for world domination by controlling 490 goblin-made golden robots.    If you liked the first Hellboy, you'll like the second, as long as you don't mind the somewhat lighter air to it. To refresh your memory, Hellboy is a stone-handed demon who was snatched from Hell by the Nazis and instead raised by a Catholic scholar to be a force for good. As the line from the first movie goes, \\"There are things that go bump in the night, and we are the things that bump back.\\" He has Hell's fury and man's love for candy bars and cats.    Now Hellboy's got to deal with no only the Legolas-Stalin cross-breed, he's got a new boss (\\"Family Guy's\\" Seth MacFarland, channeling Klauss from \\"American Dad!\\") and a rocky romance with his girlfriend, along with the ongoing issues with his identity and role in the world.    Fans of the original Hellboy may not like the lighter mood, but mainstream audiences will. Barry Manilow would be proud of Perlman's take of his music, too.
B000031XCR|4.0|During the mid- to late-1990s, there seemed to be one female voice dominating the airwaves: Celine Dion. Before her short hiatus from music at the beginning of the millennium, Dion released \\"All the Way...A Decade of Song\\" as a pseudo-greatest hits collection. With nine previous hit tracks and seven new songs, the album is a decent summary of the first half of Dion's career.    There are two unusual things about this record. The first is its lack of material from Celine's first English-language album, \\"Unison\\". 'Where Does My Heart Beat Now' was a hit for the singer, and the fact that it's missing is a bit sad. The second thing I find strange about the CD is the plethora of new songs. It's not unusual for artists to include one or two new tunes on a retrospective disk (such as a greatest hits collection), but nearly half of the CD is filled with new material.    Certainly, Dion's biggest hits are included: 'The Power of Love', 'My Heart Will Go On', and 'Because You Loved Me' are all here. 'To Love You More', which is a spectacular track but didn't fare too well in the US as a single, is included as well. Fans who own her previous albums may want to note that the versions here are those heard on the airwaves, not the previous album versions, so some parts of songs (such as the bridge in 'It's All Coming Back to Me Now') are missing.    Of the seven new songs, some stand out. 'That's the Way It Is' was a dance-like hit for Dion in 1999, while 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face' and 'All the Way' are outstanding covers, the latter engineered to be a duet with the late Frank Sinatra. However, the last few tracks are predictable; 'Then You Look at Me', 'I Want You to Need Me' and 'Live for the One I Love' are all power ballads.    Overall, the CD has lasted the test of time as it is still a decent collection of music. Dion's greatest hits up to that point? Not quite. But it is a pleasant way to pass an afternoon.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|Ok, let me say this, after reading the reviews I didn't expect much!  Maybe that's why I really enjoyed this movie!  It's really the first movie that these two gigantic icons get to play off each other and I found it amusing and was quite taken!  Of course the actors come first here and the story comes second!  But I enjoyed the gritty little movie they were in!  If you're an active movie watcher like me and been around awhile (I'm in my late 40's) you will appreciate that Al and Bobby chew up the scenery with their filthy little mouths...it's what they do best...playing cops or crooks, after all, there isn't that much difference when you learn the lesson of Righteous Kill!
B00127RAJY|4.0|You just can't beat Jillian. I usually don't like exercise (aerobic) videos. I am not very coordinated so I found her simple patterns very nice and doable. You will sweat if you don't your not really trying. Her 321 philosophy really works I burned as many calories in her biginners session for 30 min as I do in my spinning class. If you like jillian and you want to work on strength this is great video.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The 30 Day Shred kicks butt. I consider myself someone who is already in good shape and Jillian's routines are TOUGH. She combines 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs for a very effective routine to burn fat and build lean muscle. The program has three levels so you can progress as you improve. Jillian does not really explain when to move on or how much weight to use for moves, so I would recommend this video to people who are already knowledgeable about fitness and can determine those things on their own.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Got for my husband for Christmas... he didn't even know it was out!  After watching the programs on HBO he told me several times he was getting it when it came out.  Perfect timing for a gift and far less expensive that I ever expected!
0545128285|3.0|I enjoyed Rowling's latest book, however it does not hold a candle to the Harry Potter series. This book includes 5 fairy tale type stories that exist within the wizarding world. Similar to our Snow White or Sleeping Beauty, these are stories that all wizard/witch children grow up knowing. Although the stories were entertaining, this book seems fair in comparison to her other series. If you are a HP fan, it is worth a read. The stories are all very short and are followed by commentaries made by Albus Dumbledore.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is the funniest thing I've seen in ages. My husband & I laughed so hard we almost peed our pants. You sympathize with the villain and wish he'd get the girl & the super hero is a self involved a-hole. Love both Nathan Fillion & Neil Patrick Harris. Some of the songs are sooooo funny, I may have to buy the CD as well.

I have a lot of \\"stand by\\" cookies that I make during Christmas however, I think some of the ones I added in from Martha's book this year will become staple recipes as well.<br /><br />The directions are very easy and the ingredients were not hard to come by.  A lot of the ingredients were ones I already had in my kitchen, nothing complex about any of the recipes.  One thing I learned is if the book said to do something specific in the instructions, DO IT.  Don't try to manuver around or cut corners.  If it says to use parchment paper (instead of air bake pans) or coarse salt or whatever, do as the directions state, and you will produce excellent cookies every time.
0451205766|4.0|Most have seen the movie - which follows the book pretty closely - but the book offers a bit more background and details of the Corleone family and their reach.<br /><br />The book is pretty well written and keeps the flow of the story going - lots of side stories about minor characters that the book probably could have done without, but otherwise a great read (and even these side stories are interesting, and loosely tie in).
B0000065O1|4.0|I have used this workout to get in, and stay in, toned shape for many years.   it is challenging.  Highly recommended. Lots of squats, lunges, tons of crunches, weight training for arms.  This is a total body shaper.  Only drawback is it offers no cardio.  Beginners will not wreck their knees with this program.  Beginners can also work their way up to doing all the exercises. This is an intermediate/advanced program to get through it all. I got in the best shape of my life using this program.  One drawback I found is you need to find the motivation yourself because Cindy doesn't encourage you to 'keep going'.  The music is also dry.  But if you want a straightforward, no nonsense, intense program; this is it.  You will get the best abs of your life.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We love this game.  We usually play at least 3 or 4 games at a time if not more.  It is a great game unlike any other.  You'll be addicted!  I've never played with kids however, so I'm not sure how they would like it.  It is definitely a great strategy game!  The only down side is that you have to have at least three players.  It really doesn't work with less.  You need to buy the expansion set as well if you have more than 4 players.  It is worth it though for the extra fun that it adds.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I'm sure there are many albums, movies, novels, etc. that are considered masterpieces, yet I've never heard, seen, or read them, so, if you dont own this album I guess it's understandable, and we shouldn't be angry. Yes, this album is great, and like the last five hundred thousand reviews that are here, yes, I recommend you to purchase it. And when you purchase it, pop it into your car's player, screw a Newport between your lips and give it a light. Dont be alarmed, that's just \\"Ambitionz as a Ridah\\" serenading your vehicle, remain calm and stay relaxed. The next step is very important to maximizing the enjoyment of this album... Raise your left hand, wrap your middle finger around your ring finger, stretch the others out, tuck your thumb in, and wave it out the window. Please make sure rhythmic head bobbing and devious laughing is included. Here's the advice you were looking for, now stop reading reviews and buy it. There, you're welcome.
B00009W0WM|5.0|There's nothing like an old classic to watch a very old but good movie it's a joy to watch.
0061139378|4.0|Despite everything that's been said about it, this is a story mostly for kids. Original and refreshing yes, but a fairytale all the same.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|As expected the writing in this show just gets better. Just wish they would release it in HD.
B001EO2UKO|4.0|I've never considered myself a Dido fan. I've liked, even loved a few songs off her previous albums, but to listen to the albums in their entirety was always a huge bore where most songs were just too weak and run of the mill.    Not so with this album - from the moment I began listening I knew I was in for something different. This album is beautiful with so much depth and great songwriting.    I can now count myself one of her many fans and can only hope that she continues to produce work of this caliber.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This DVD collection is great, not only due you get every episode(2 per Disc) you also get an extra DVD with extras. There's not many extras, but there's a neat video diary that HBO gave Ron Livingston during his time a Actor Boot Camp. I would Highly HIGHLY recommend this.
0545128285|2.0|It's good that this book is for charity, but overall it was way too short, and didn't really deal with the characters that you've grown to love in the books.
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|Gift for my grown grandson for christmas--was on his wish list.  Amazon is the best place to obtain DVD--Quality place to shop.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I'm glad I bought this series.  The old footage is amazing--from all sides of the war.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to have a better historical understanding of WWII from beginning to end with a perspective on all of the countries involved.  Freedom is not free.
B00005JOHC|5.0|We love Two and 1/2 Men shows. this was a surprize (First season series) for my adult son--as usual amazon is the best place for DVD shopping and delivery.
B001EC9V58|5.0|Great zombie flick.  Very realistic and scary.  Shot in grainy, documentary style ala Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield.  I've also seen \\"Quarantine\\", the US virtually shot by shot remake, this original Spanish-made version with relatively less know starts (versus Quarantine which had the girl who plays Dexter's sister in the lead role, and another actress who appears as a regular in \\"Two and a Half Men\\") definitely superior tho the US version wasnt too bad.    I hope they release a Blu-Ray version of this movie, maybe as a back to back with the US version.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|A gift for Grandson's Birthday--was on his wish list.  As I have said in the past--Amazon is the best, reliable site to   purchase DVD's--( or anything else for that matter)
0956010903|5.0|I was so happy when this finally arrived at my doorstep. My dad said I had to do homework before I could open it. So after I did my homework, I ran to the coat closet and got my white wool gloves just for the occasion to handle it with care. When I opened the box I found the large phonebook sized case surrounded with a paper covering. My first thought when I removed the paper covering was that it smelled like new shoes because of all the leather. All in all it was a beatiful product.
B00002MZ12|4.0|Amazon Review:<br />\\"Never mind that Alanis Morissette's career spans back to her early teens and she has four prior CDs to her credit. It's just too early to go unplugged. Performances like this are better done in the privacy of one's acoustically appointed bathroom. An expressive, emotionally naked \\"singer, Morissette bares a little too much on this outing. Recorded at New York's Brooklyn Academy of Music and produced solely by Morissette, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the carefully wrought songs and slices of her inner life, but there's little to be said about her shrill, thin delivery. Included is the never-before-released \\"No Pressure Over Cappuccino,\\" which she debuted on her Jagged Little Pill tour, and two songs left off last year's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie: \\"Princes Familiar\\" and \\"These Are the Thoughts.\\" They were dumped for good reason. The only redeeming moment is her out-of-breath rendering of the coy \\"Head Over Feet.\\" --Jaan Uhelszki\\"<br /><br />---- This is absolutely irresponsible and uncalled for.<br /><br />I have no idea why Amazon would post a review like this as the official review of the CD. Idiotic, asinine, just plain F ed up if you ask me. I love this album. It rules. Either way, there is no call to write a review like this one (previous) I have half a mind to give up on Amazon over principal alone. Reprehensible!<br /><br />My opinion? I like the album.<br />I don't LOVE it, but it is entirely listen-to-able... there is a certain raw and naked and open quality (pretty much what the Amazon A-hole criticized, I like about it.)<br /> It is in your face, unabashed and unapologetic - does that make sense?<br />Alanis is an extremely gifted and deep singer/musician.<br /><br />That comes out well in this album.
0956010903|5.0|Cute stories, and the book within a book is beautifully made.  I have no regrets about this purchase.  This book has found a home on top of an antique jewelry armoire.  With its gold lettering and designs in the leather(?) it looks like it was made for the spot.  By the way, each story is followed by commentary by Albus Dumbledor.  What more could you want?
B001F12J3Y|3.0|Overall the quality (Sound and picture) is excellent (5/5).  The 3d effect is pretty good (3 out of 5 stars) it's just not the 3d you would get in an imax movie theater.  9.00 extra over the DVD version; that's a tough one, especially if you have a good upscaling DVD player.  That's what keeps this from being a 4 star rating.      Blu-ray is doomed if the prices don't fall in the 19.99 and under range.
