0446672653|1.0|Dr. Weiss seems to be writing the SAME book over and over again! While his message is comforting and well meaning-his writing leaves much to be desired. Maybe one of the &quot;Masters&quot; should dictate and he can transcribe...
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie makes me want to get an import and make it fast
B00005Y228|1.0|I cry, I mean really, really, cry every time I hear Kylie sing &quot;Fever.&quot;  But it's tears of laughter.  No matter how bad the day has been, I'm ROTFLMAO within fifteen seconds after I play this cut.  It's just so TOTALLY AWESOME that I've never had to try the others.<br />If the whole world would just listen to this song every minute of every day all the time there would never be any wars.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I haven't taken this out of my CD player since I bought it. Norah has a great voice and some of the songs (Shoot the Moon, Don't Know Why, Feelin' the Same Way, Turn Me On, Seven Years and the title song) are fantastic. A few songs drag a little and there is a sameness to her delivery, but she definitely has the talent to become more than a one-hit wonder. This is a great CD to pop in after a stressful day. It's irrelevant that she is a natural beauty and seems like a very nice person and a serious musician (see Blender article) but I'm going to mention it anyway because I think it just makes her even more endearing.
B000002NHN|5.0|What is it about McKennitt's music that has the uncanny ability to move one's emotional state, one's whole consciousness, to a time and place that is only dreamed about and desperately yearned for, though has never existed? Or should exist. There is a kind of intuition in her melodies, something hidden, that if possibly decoded and understood, all would be revealed.<br />~The Book of Secrets~ has an atmospheric quality throughout, which should be played on rainy overcast afternoons by a warm fire while reading a good book.<br />McKennitt has a distinct aura of the past that surrounds her, though her music, despite echoing of secret histories, long forgotten histories, possesses a newness that shines through, something prescient and important - a message? She certainly provides us with enough clues - the actual CD cover, a little book of diary entries taken from her extensive travels and her lyrics, illustrates that her music defies any particular category, and is deeply informed by many sources - history, religion, literature, poetry and myth. To be sure, there is a conscious search for Celtic origins, but the music has many influences -Celtic, folk, Sufi and jazz. These influences delve into the past, though she magically pushes them forward into the present; mixing the notes like an alchemist's attempt to achieve the Philosophers Stone. And an honest attempt at that...<br />This CD is a treasure to own.
B00005UKKF|1.0|This would have to be the worst performance I have seen in a very long time. Britney lip-synced almost every song. Her tired dance moves echoed Madonna and Janet Jackson's early 90's performances. <br />It has been clear to many for a long time that Britney does not have a very strong voice and it is proven here. The songs also seem to all be part of medleys (performed mostly at under 3 minutes). Too much time and money is spent on costumes and set. Basiaclly it's a live music video. Also can't help but be a little confused by the whole 12 year old girl thing for one song and then the grown up wannabe madonna for the next???<br />The show is cheap. The DVD quality is very good. Britney is very bad live (even with pre-recorded vocals) and all the songs seem to have the same beat, same sounds and same formula ( intro / verse / chourus / verse / chourus / bridge-verse / altered chourus / chourus with ad lib / end ...
B000063UR2|5.0|I saw this movie along time ago on HBO, loved the movie and tried to record it twice on my vcr, but it never came out right.It seemed to missing something. When I heard it was coming out in DVD I was really excited because it was going to be a double also included a version that was never seen here in the U.S. Well I have seen both versions and I cannot believe what we had missed here in the U.S. the musical version was so much better,lost scenes were returned listeneing to the actors and the actresses talk about making this movie it was wonderful. The story plot is simple but the fantastic scenes and the lost movie score seemed to make it a whole new movie. I am so glad that I own the DVD that I can watch it anytime I like, but I have to say that I love the non-usa version so much better. I wish that I could find the cd in the European Musical  version.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I am a Journey fan of all eras.  I bought &quot;Arrival&quot; when it came out last year, and it was definitely my favorite CD of the year.  I also saw the band in concert last summer and found their performance nothing short of stunning.  I knew that there was no chance that I wouldn't absolutely love this DVD before I bought it, and I was right.  Nonetheless, in watching it I was still surprised how good it is.<br />The reason for my surprise is simple:  I have never heard better sound quality on a DVD.  I cranked this DVD through my stereo speakers and felt like I truly was at the concert.  The production could not be more crisp and clear.<br />Now to the more obvious part of my review:  the songs and performances were all top-notch.  This does not look like a band that has been around for nearly 30 years.  Steve Augeri for sure brings a youthful energy to the band.  He of course sounds great on the new songs he sang on &quot;Arrival&quot;, but he also absolutely does all the Steve Perry classics justice.<br />I hate to say it, but the best thing for Neil Schon was for Steve Perry to leave this band.  As the true band leader once again, he plays with a flamboyance that is remarkable considering the number of years he had been doing this.  It is so obvious to me that he and this band have a new lease on life.  Watch this performance and I think you will agree.<br />For sure, many of the classics and all of the biggest hits are here.  From the rockers like &quot;Stone In Love&quot; to the ballads like &quot;Faithfully&quot; (which was the beautiful, touching way the band closed this performance), the songs are all masterfully performed.  Like other reviewers, I am impressed with the inclusion of the rare &quot;La Raza Del Sol&quot;.<br />Bottom line:  DO NOT listen to those that say this band is done because Steve Perry is no longer with them.  Obviously, he was great and contributed much to their success, but he was not the only important component of the band.  Watch this performance and see how great this band still is.  The outrage should not be that Journey is going on without Steve Perry, but instead that this band in its new incarnation is not getting the recognition it so richly deserves.  If you are a true fan of Journey in particular and classic rock in general, do not give up on this band!  And for sure, this DVD comes strongly recommended.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This has to be the SINGLE most greatest DVD/Movie of all time.First lets start with the DVD itself.The cover is the coolest thing I've EVER seen and it gets even better as you open it up and see the little booklet with excerpts from magazine, film \\"people\\" and the author of Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk.Its just great and the cover would be anythin to catch anyones eye. Now the movie has to be the best movie ever made, its just hilariously funny and smart. If your into dark comedies this has to be the one for you. It has such a great plot and such memorable lines that just crack you up laughing.I recommend that anyone that has a brain buy this DVD, its not a waste of your money at all, unlike some movies out there now.
B000002572|5.0|If you are an obsessive fan of melodic rock (as I am), then you owe an awful lot to this band and particularly this impressive debut album.  While many other bands and albums of this type (i.e., searing, melodic vocals set to a heavy guitar sound) have come out since, this was the first known one of its type--and no one else has ever sounded quite like this.  It truly was a starting point for some of the best music in rock and roll history.  <br />As others have mentioned, each and every one of these tracks made it to rock radio and has remained there for all these years.  I actually grew weary of hearing them all the time for a several-year period; but since classic rock stations are becoming less and less common (and since I listen to less music on radio nowadays anyway), whenever I play this CD now it sounds as fresh as ever.  For sure, it is a sonic masterpiece with amazing production and sound quality.<br />None of these songs need to be introduced to long-time classic rock fans.  From the famous opening guitar lead-in of &quot;More Than A Feeling&quot; to the last spirited notes of &quot;Let Me Take You Home Tonight&quot;, this album just doesn't let up.  Each and every note of each and every song demands to be heard.  &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot; and &quot;Hitch A Ride&quot; are among the many highlights.  In a nutshell, every true rock and roll music fan should have this album in their collection.
B000069HJN|5.0|Supertramp's 1985 album, &quot;Brother Where You Bound,&quot; drove a big wedge deep into the group's fanbase, which was not too surprising, as this was the band's first album without singer/songwriter Roger Hodgson, leaving co-singer/songwriter Rick Davies solely at the helm. Some fans balked at the mere *idea* of Supertramp carrying on without Hodgson, while the more open-minded Tramp fans (like me) decided to give Davies &amp; the rest of the group a chance. Let me put it to you this way: if you truly believe that Supertramp are nothing without Roger Hodgson---even though Davies DID write 50% of the band's Hodgson-era material---then there's no point in me recommending to you &quot;Brother Where You Bound.&quot; But if you happen to know better, and you know that Rick Davies is just as great a musical genius as his former partner, then you're in for a real treat. Just six tracks long, &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; is a stunning album, one of Supertramp's very best. Davies, sax man John Halliwell, bassist Dougie Thomson, and drummer Bob Siebenberg take a bold, daring turn into full-on progressive jazz/rock (with Pink Floyd-like voices &amp; sound effects thrown in for extra measure). The album contains longer songs and thrilling extended jams, allowing the group to really stretch out. Although Roger Hodgson is missed, what could have been a major problem for Davies &amp; company was turned into a great musical opportunity. There's no need to worry: &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; is pure, powerful Supertramp from start to finish. The album speaks for itself.Obviously, with Hodgson's departure being a big hurdle for the band to jump over, Rick &amp; the boys had something to prove, and they had to throw down the gauntlet right at the start of the album. What better song for Supertramp to kick off &quot;Brother&quot; with then the slammin', take-no-prisoners track, &quot;Cannonball&quot; (edited down to single length, it was the group's final Top 40 hit).A rough &amp; tough 7 1/2 minute jazz-rocker about betrayal, Rick Davies &amp; the band tear up the place with great relish. It's an instant Supertramp classic (and a great crowd-pleaser live in concert). After the dust settles, Davies reminds us of his affection for 50's flavored pop with the fun tune, &quot;Still In Love.&quot; Then it's back into prog-jazz territory once more, with the atmospheric &quot;No Inbetween&quot; &amp; &quot;Better Days,&quot; both excellent songs. But without question, the album's centerpiece is the sprawling, 16 1/2 minute title suite, guest-starring none other than Pink Floyd's David Gilmour on lead guitar. This piece is simply a mindblower, THE most epic work in the band's catalog. Davies &amp; company really take the listener on a great adventure with this one, and they play it to pure perfection, with guest-guitarist Gilmour serving up some very classy lead guitar licks along the way as only Gilmour can. Finally, there's the brief-but-beautiful coda, &quot;Ever Open Door,&quot; featuring just Rick Davies, his piano &amp; synths, ending the album on a very poignant note.The group's album sales may have gone down another notch with Hodgson's defection, but not the quality of their music. Supertramp is completely safe in the capable hands of Rick Davies &amp; company, and &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; is the testament to that. Supertramp rides again! :-)
B00003CXSM|4.0|OK, I have to admit it right at the start: I am a J-Lo fan, much to the amusement of my kids. I don't care, I'm right out with it, Jennifer Lopez, in my opinion, is one of today's great talents.<br />The Wedding Planner is a sweet and mindless comedy about a woman whose job it is to plan other people's weddings. She's been hurt in the past, and has closed her heart to any thought of her own romance, but she's wonderful at executing the most spectacular of fairytale weddings.<br />Along comes a mismatched couple if there ever was one. Matthew McConaughey is the hapless groom, whose low-key, even temperament is no match for his social climbing, obnoxious (but beautiful) bride-to-be. Lopez is hired to plan the wedding. Lopez and McConaughey are attracted. Each tries to deny it. And the ending is inevitable.<br />To me, this easy-to-watch video is as satisfying as a well-written romance in print, the kind you want to curl up and devour. I have done so with this movie about 5 times now, and I still love it. On the intelligence meter, it probably deserves a 1. On the enjoyment meter, a good, solid 10. Indulge yourself. It's just plain wonderful.
0385503954|5.0|Great, collossal book..  Very, very satisfying reading experience.  Will try to read as many McEwan books as I can lay my hands on.
B000002BE9|5.0|All I have to say is that I highly recommend this CD because I could never come up with compliments befitting an album this good or an artist this talented.

6305807086|5.0|This dazzling portrayal of identity and exploitation can only be described as a contrasted work. Ideas and concepts are so conflicted, the world it portrays seems at times both upside down and the right way up. It is an effect nothing short of sensational success. To call this film clever wouldn't even touch on the whirlpool of fascinating themes it concocts. To call this film original is not even granting it the tiniest fraction of the laudation that its immensely talented writer's endless imagination deserves. It is both dreamlike and truthful. It is both scathingly funny and undeniably beautiful. And it is at all times utterly and unrelentingly magnetic. <br />We see scenes in which a tortured artist, a puppeteer no less who can only find an audience performing on street corners - a venture that often leaves him battered by offended onlookers, casually discussing babies with his dowdy, pet loving wife. It is so profoundly honest about the world that these not-so-ordinary folk inhabit and yet so aware of the audiences apprehension to relate to these characters. And that's precisely what this film wants, it throws this world ever so slightly off balance with some devilish sleight of hand only cinema can achieve, and then suddenly tips everything on its head, throwing the audience into a torrent of unreality and relentless wit. <br />We see a thrilling chase through a literal myriad of the private memories of a well known actor. We glimpse the painful childhood of a mentally unsound monkey named Elijah. We watch as third rate actors tell us how and why a secret floor of miniature proportions in a well known office block was built. And of course a scene that is already engraved in movie history, what exactly happens when a man enters his own mind. And yet as we witness this, there is something that is always maintained, no matter how wild and untamed the story grows, and that is the undying humanity of these characters, the incredibly poignant truth that is undoubtedly the core of this movie. This film is a remarkable landmark in both screenwriting and direction, something that will not be matched for many years to come.
B00000099Y|5.0|...to make albums like this,one where i can truely say,there was no actual BAD songs,i mean there isnt any song that makes me want to skip,even the intermissions i dont have the urge to skip past,its an amazing album! my only bad thing to say is i wish it had more tracks...maynard is amazing with his voice but the thing is everyone else in the band stands out to,the music is set so that the drummer the guitarist the bassit all stand out on thier own,showing thier instruments are just as good as maynards (his voice). if you just a rock fan,this is a cd you should get and if your a music fan,this is the music you should make!
B00003CX5P|4.0|I loved this movie! The effects, the story, and the characters.  I stood in line for the Star Wars nine nights in a row, and remember that the reviewers (who tend to feel that movies about good and evil are not serious film) panned the show for much the same reasons.  If Jive Dudes make you nervous, that's your problem. You are a creature of your times. That's OK, but certainly not a flaw in the movie...
B00005JL3A|3.0|I am not a fan of the games.  I rarely (if ever) pick up a video game.  I know about the \\"Resident Evil\\" games, I know it's one of the most popular of items.  This movie just lacks \\"something.\\"  You can't really put your finger on it but overall it's great eye candy.  Great special effects, awesome sound and for once, a good plot!  The biggest problem here though is, for a video game turned movie, this DVD sure lacks quite a bit of inspiration!  Where's the deleted scenes?  Where's the \\"fun\\" extras??  Where's the fun???  All are missing unfortunately.  So, I guess we'll have to wait for the real deal when Blade 2 comes to DVD in September.  In the meantime, this DVD is worth a rental.  Cheers!
B000065U1N|4.0|You know the story. On october 3rd, 1993, a group of Delta Force and Ranger soldiers got trapped behind enemy lines in the hostile territory of Mogadishu, Somalia, while they were trying to bring down a cruel warlord. With angry somalies shooting at these soldiers from every direction, they only could protect themselves by shooting back and running through the sandy streets. The rescue, that was suppoused to take less than 30 minutes, actually took over 15 hours, leaving several dead american soldiers and hundreds of slaughtered somalies.<br />True, you may not get a lot of character development, but I don't think that was the point of the movie. I've always thought you got to watch a movie in its own context and if you see this one as in interesting experiment of almost a documentary it's quite terrific. Cinematography couldn't be better and I think Hans Zimmer's score is quite simply marvelous: it really makes you feel tense and in certain moments, certain vocalizations by Lisa Gerrard are quite macabre, just like the movie. It is not a gross movie, it's just creepy, scary, macabre in its own way, because you definately can feel what's going on. And you get to see how things get even more complicated as the hours go by and the team begins to dissolve.<br />Ewan McGregor does a funny job as the desk-boy Johnny Grimes, and I'd have liked to see more of him, preparing coffee and running around screaming. Josh Hartnett is practically himself (don't get me wrong, I like him, but he always acts the same way). Sam Shepard has a very interesting role and probably the best developed one, as the leader of the whole situation. Tom Sizemore is great, as one soldier leading the wounded out of the hostile territory, but you can actually see he's terrified, the way he sweats, the way he's cursing all the time but that look in his eyes that says he just wants to get out as soon as possible. Eric Bana, Jason Isaacs and William Fichtner are the brave soldiers, they are not scared of anything and they just keep fighting and trying to protect their men. Orlando Bloom, Richard Tyson, Jeremy Piven, Ron Eldard, Kim Coates and Ewen Bremner also star in this non-stop battle, beautifully directed by Ridley Scott, in a way that you can actually forget about the world and you are allowed to get into the movie.<br />I give it 4 stars and not 5 because of the lack of screentime for Ewan McGregor and especially, the lack of special features. It only features a behind-the-scenes and two trailers from Spider-Man and The One, but no trailer for this movie. Kinda silly, ain't it? Fortunately, somewhere in early 2003 Clumbia TriStar is going to release a 2-disc set for this one, hopefully including the chilling trailer featuring the Dave Matthews Band song, The Space Between.<br />If you're really interested in this movie, I'd recommend waiting for the special edition, hoo-ah?f anything and they just keep fighting and trying to protect their men.

B000067CPX|5.0|I do not understand the negative reactions here. What if the Beatles stopped evolving after Please please me?<BR>The fact that the album is totally different from say BSSM, doesn't mean it's bad. <BR>Any band trying to write the same album over and over is not making music but money.<BR>Personally I think this is a masterpiece. It will probably be recognised as such in ten years time by everyone.
B0000636UN|1.0|I must confess I have not listened to this album -- nor will I. One time through &quot;Soak up the Sun&quot; on the radio was all I needed to hear. What an insipid and annoying song. I can't believe a professional, 40-something musician would put her name on such godawful drek. It must have been written by the marketing department to get late spring airplay. A pyrrhic victory, I'm afraid.
B000067CPX|2.0|After reading a couple reviews here giving this all the praise in the world, I'd have to say I think the band really skated on this and its as if they really gave it no more energy than a lot of typical pop trash we're already spoon fed on a daily basis.<br />Don't get me wrong, I think the RHCP rock, but this work is totally lame in comparison to \\"Mother's Milk\\" and \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic.\\"  Since Frusciante's first exit, there has been little creative expression comparitively...Anyway, these guys have huge amount of talent of talent and I don't think it shows at all here.  I thought with Frusciante coming back, we could expect some supreme new creations, but I was so wrong...again don't get me wrong, but this is like pop standard rock.  It's not powerhouse creative magic like they've showed before and I would have canned this until I had something that showcased my talent before I wrote stuff that could be the back up music for Brittany Spears!  Sorry Dudes.  Better luck next time.  Oh yeah, I do play so I understand a bit about music.  Of course that doesn't matter.  <br />Anyone thinking it worth debate has to listen to Mother's Milf (oops that's \\"Milk\\") and Blood Sugar sex Magic before they tout how beautiful this \\"pop\\" album is.  These guys are way more talented than this.
6305127638|5.0|Following the worst Star Trek movie ever, well maybe tied with The Motion Picture, First Contact became one of the best movies, not just Star Trek, I've ever seen. <br />This movie does it all. As someone who can very honestly say he's seen every movie along with every episode of all five series, I can say they stayed true to the ever growing timeline. Patrick Stewart has a superb performance, as does the rest of the crew. Troi and Riker both add some comedic relief at the right times, along with a wonderfully cast James Cromwell as Zefram Cochran. <br />After the many failures of Generations, from a weak plot, to it coming off as a giant episode of The Next Generation, rather than a movie, to the absolutely useless and pathetic killing of the Great James T. Kirk, First Contact rectifies the previous injustices and goes all out. <br />You wanna know what really made it work, look no farther than the director's credit. Frakes could easily be one of the top director's in Hollywood.
B00005JL3A|3.0|As a fan of all the video games I was thrilled when I heard the long awaited movie was finally hitting theatres. The first dissapointment to me was the story. I hoped it would have all the classic characters from the game. Also, I wish the movie was in the mansion, however, I soon got over this as I watched because there were some redeeming qualities. Anybody can say their thirst for zombies was fulfilled as I have never seen so many on a screen since Night of the Living Dead. Also, the movie is very suspensful and there a few slow instances. There were some jumpy times but I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie...(its more action).  This movie is a lot of fun and a good rent but I probably would not buy it. The story brought the grade down a full star because even after watching it a second time I still didn't fully understand what was going on. So its up to you. A good rental for a party with friends but nothing more. 7/10
B00000ILBK|4.0|I've read many reviews, with most being off or not thought out. Insurrection was a really good installment, it just had a hard act to follow. For those who say it was a giant tv episode, it can't hold a candle in that department compared to Generations. <br />What gets me is people complaining about too strong of a humorous element. Star Trek has always held some humor in it. From Bones and Spock arguing, to Data's misunderstandings, Quark in general, the Doctor and Neelix, humor has always been a strong element. Besides, this isn't even the funniest movie in the series. Everybody remember The Voyage Home? Kirk and Spock trying to get around in 1985, along with Chekov just being Chekov, made #4 a lot funnier. <br />There are some holes in the plot, but not as many as you'd think. Like, why was Data on that planet in the first place? And what was so special that Worf took a vacation and happened to on board. Besides a few others, this movie was very good, albeit not quite as good as First Contact. Fear not though, I guess that they are going all out in Star Trek X: Nemesis.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I am a fanatic Austen fan...believe me, this is THE ONLY FAITHFUL version of P&amp;P!  Garvey and Rintoul were spectacular!  All of the other actors were PERFECTION!  I just wish it would be released on DVD!
B000066NW0|3.0|Is that music really hers? She didn't write all those songs by herself. SO please, don't call her an awesome writer. She co-wrote them. You say she's something new, I say she's just another clone of Britney Spears. Just disgruntled and a new wardrobe.<BR>There's nothing really &quot;new&quot; in her music. I mean she barely plays it and she has elements of sum 41 in there. With the whole rap thing. I personally think that Avril is a poseur. Her image might scream &quot;IM PUNK&quot; but her music screams out &quot;IM POP&quot;. It's just the image that makes you think that music is what it is.
0671578855|5.0|I was sitting on the couch at about 2 in the morning, after two weeks of straight reading this series. I was trying to finish a paragraph... and I couldn't, because I was laughing so hard that every time I finished the first sentence of the paragraph I would start crying and fall off the couch. This woke up my husband, who came and stood staring blearily from the doorway at me then went back to bed (and closed the door very hard).<br />After about 5 minuites of this, I had to blow my nose and wipe my eyes, and I finaly finished the paragraph. Then, a few minuites later, I started all over again with the laughing... I havn't laughed so hard in YEARS.<br />The rest of the series is excelent and I recommend reading all the books, in order. At once.
079073253X|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times since it first came out, i hvae no idea what the number is. This is an amazingly depressing yet wonderful story based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's experiences with his 3 friends from childhood to adulthood. Like I said, I have seen this movie countless times and it never fails to make me cry. It's such a sensitive subject that is dealt with very well. These boys (the ones still living are around 40+ years old) went through SO much being abused, sexually and physically by sadistic, sick guards. Kevin Bacon plays the main guard who later gets what he deserves by John and Tommy. Joe Perrino and Jason Patric as Lorenzo \\"Shakes\\" Carcaterra were both wonderful as the younger and older Shakes. Joe Perrino did exceptionally well, beyond what most child actors perform. He made you feel the pain that Shakes had to go through, as did Jason Patric. Jason Patric was also chilling with the narraration. Brad Renfro and Brad Pitt play Michael Sullivan, the ringleader, who later becomes an attorney. He, along with Shakes who is a reporter, rig the trial of John Reilly (Geoffrey Wigdor and Ron Eldard) and Tommy Marcano (Jonathan Tucker and Billy Crudup). The movie is about their horrific childhood experiences at the prison for boys and how they get revenge on the guards who tortured and raped them when they were little boys. It's a very moving story, and theres controversy as to whether or not it's true. I believe this story, but it doesn't matter if it's true or not..It's still a beautifully chilling movie and everyone should see it. The book is extremely good, well written and like the movie, will make you cry. Again, I've seen this movie countless times, own it on dvd and vhs and I watch it every time it comes on TV. It is that good...
B000002H33|5.0|This was it, the pinnacle of their career, this was everything Metallica was.  This is their quintiessential metal album, just no nonsense, no apologies metal.  Sanitarium is one of everyone's favorite songs.   And Master Of Puppets is essential and a staple of rock radio.  The best song on here is probably Disposable Heroes.  Want to hear everything Cliff Burton was about and capable of: Orion.  Battery, excellent start up song, very encouraging to go on to the rest of the album.  As good as Metallica got, but they would never even come close again.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Looking through the reviews of Mulholland Drive it seems as if most of the low ratings are written by those who just don't &quot;get it.&quot;  Well, getting it is not necessary!  Allow Lynch to take you on a visual and visceral trip; then decide what it all means if you please.
B000003S2K|4.0|haunting, beautiful, mesmerizing, great for doing homework, and great if you want to write true mood music. I totally recommend this.
B000002NBY|5.0|I have given other albums five stars, but \\"Graceland,\\" quite simply, exceeds all rating. After becoming slightly less visible during the late '70s, Paul Simon reappeared in full force with this miraculous, powerful, and timeless album. What is so distinctive about \\"Graceland\\" is that it shows a masterful collaboration between Simon and various South African musicians, specifically the outstanding group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The beauty of this album is that it is NOT an imitation or an exploitation of African musicians, but rather an honest sharing of cultures, a partnership that everyone benefited from. It is a global celebration of the richness of outstanding South African musical expression (Ladysmith B. M. RULES! I JUST SAW THEM IN CONCERT AND--WOW WOW WOW!) in partnership with one of our greatest American musicians.<BR> This album is real. It is at once raw and refined, traditional and modern. Rather than emphasizing the suffering and rage of the black South African people at the time (which perhaps Simon could not have and was not in the place to convey authentically) it becomes an exuberant celebration of their rich and vivacious musical culture. Everyone benefits from \\"Graceland\\" and the ethno-musical boundaries that it has opened and exposed. For me, this album marks a turning point in Paul Simon's career, a point at which he broke out of the folk-rock that society expected and blossomed to a whole new level of intense and brilliant musicality. <BR> What's actually on the album? I planned on keeping this review concise, but I fear that goal has gone out the window. It is impossible to write about the \\"highlights from 'Graceland,'\\" because all of the songs on here are fantastic and distinctive. \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" is dark and forceful, with fascinating lyrics and a strong tune. It immediately illustrates the perfect blending of American and South African musical styles-take some time to really listen to all the elements of this song. \\"Graceland\\" is equally moving, but with a somewhat lighter feel. All of the songs are truly impossible to describe in words with any justice, and so I will simply say that Graceland is totally unique. It is touching and catchy and sad and joyous and exciting and tired and funny. \\"I Know What I Know\\" is possibly my favorite song on the album. It sounds very South African, but also very universally vivacious. The words are simple but meaningful, and it is Simon's unassuming but powerful vocals and the amazing background vocals that truly complete the song. <BR>\\"Gumboots\\" is another fun yet serious song that moves wonderfully, and \\"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\\" is similarly vivacious yet as wonderfully distinct as any song on this album. (I would love to describe them in greater detail, but that could get dangerously long, and besides, listening is the only way to do justice to the songs.) \\"Call Me Al\\" is a song I have come to adore in so many different respects-like most of the songs on this album it sounds lighthearted enough, but is also meaningful and musically outstanding. I just love how the words sound on this song. \\"Under African Skies\\" is a beautiful and versatile duet, with a strong and exhilarating chorus. <BR>\\"Homeless\\" is the most striking example of Ladysmith's essential contribution to this album, an inspiring and distinctive blending of voices. It is a beautiful example of the partnership of \\"Graceland\\"-Simon is not in any way copying South African music, but is rather becoming a part of it, working alongside Ladysmith to create authentic masterpieces. \\"That Was Your Mother\\" has a Cajun element to it that is remarkably complimentary to the South African elements, and so it feels right on the album. It is upbeat and fun, but interesting at the same time. Perhaps it seems a leap from the clear South African influences on the rest of the album, but Simon pulls it off. \\"Crazy Love\\" and \\"All Around the World\\" feel similar to me, both have a strong background and alternating lively choruses and (slightly) more pensive verses. Again, they are simply great songs, blending American music and that of South Africa. <BR>Clearly, I love this album. It's truly inspired, and inspiring, full of sheer human energy and an amazingly unique yet authentic blend of cultures and music. There is no low-point, no song that you would skip over-each one is fascinatingly different and exiting yet they form an extremely unified album. \\"Graceland\\" is a timeless album, a true highlight in global music. Who'd have though that my favorite album of all time would be from the '80s?! Words cannot describe the innovation and musical and cultural insight in this album-you've got to experience it for yourself.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Well, in my own opinion, I liked this movie. I mean, by no means was it a great flick, but I had fun watching it. As previously stated, no, it doesn't follow any of the games' plots directly. However, Umbrella's still the evil corporation, the T-Virus is still the, well, virus. Not to mention, that the filmmakers have, in fact, taken scenes from the games and stuffed 'em right in the flick. I won't go into detail about them, but suffice it to say that if you've played the games, you'll notice these scenes recreated for the movie. Now, in conclusion, this isn't an intelligent movie, or an extremely well-acted movie, however, it can be fun to watch if you don't get caught up in how they strayed from the games, or if you don't mind dumb movies. Plus there's something eerie about watching stuff from games I've been playing for years acted out on the big screen.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This CD is an absolute must to add to your collection of Prince music.  This CD has a different \\"flavor\\", but for those of you who have followed Prince's music throughout the years will hear the powerful talent in this CD.  The Rainbow Children has a flare for being jazzy/inspirational.  There's no sexual innuendos or profanity on any of the tracks; which is a different twist for the music industry alone.  ---no profanity--- could that be the reason they don't play his new stuff on the radio?<br />This CD is a winner!
B000002H2H|5.0|It's better than Kill 'Em All but not as good as Master Of Puppets.  It's the epic, anthemic rock of Metallica we all grew to love in the early 80's but didn't stay with us for long.  Cliff Burton was brilliantly gifted and Kirk Hammett has some of the fastest fingers ever given to a human being.  Fight Fir With Fire, Ride The Lightning, For Who The Bell Tolls... trademark Metallica.  Best song on here, and probably Metallica's best song ever, Fade To Black.  But don't get used to this, only one more like this to go and it's off the path we go.
B000069HK2|5.0|basically...rock is dying...and its bands like 'the used' that keeps it alive. and at the moment, they are on top.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|What happened to the musician we grew up with.  This CD has some good music but overall why must there always be a message?  What happened to the days of \\"She always in my hair\\" or the musician who was not afraid to make music on his terms?  I have been loyal for 20 years, but albums like this make me question that loyalty.  Give us the Prince we once knew, it goes back to \\"Purple Rain\\" the movie...\\"No one digs your music but yourself\\".
0451169514|5.0|I loved this book. I bought it a long time ago and always wanted to read it but never had the time so when i finally started it i was hoping for something good. I was definitely VERY,VERY, impressed. This book has everything; great character developement and great characters, pretty good writing, lots of explanation through subplots and such things, great story, lots of imagination (not to mention plenty of images left to the imagination of the reader). You know, I mean I laughed, I cried, I felt for all the characters in one way or another. When I read this, I got much more than I bargained for (definitely in a good way!).<br /> IT, taking place in Derry, Maine, is about a group of misfits and loners who call themselves the Losers Club. It begins with the death of one of the losers' brothers being killed by a mysterious clown in the sewer. IT can take the shape of your deepest fears, but most frequently appears as either Bob Gray, or Pennywise the Dancing Clown. After the Losers form the final 7 (lucky seven), they try desperately to beat IT by going down to the sewers and facing IT in IT's true form. They supposedly kill IT. Flash to 1985; IT's back and killin' little kids once again. They all come back to Derry to defeat the eternal evil without a name, known only as IT, once and for all. Read this book to find out what happens.<br /> Of course, I can't sum up the entire 1093-page novel in one paragraph, for it's too long and complicated. All I can say is read this great book. <br /> CAUTION (for the easily offended)---------there is much violence and some sex and language in this book.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple plan rocks and their new cd...No pads, no helmets...just balls! is amazing! i recommend it to everyone! Their music is great...everyone can connect to it! they sing about real life stuff! i just got the cd and i listen to it nonstop and it never gets old! so yea if you haven't already gotten it you should definetly go right now and get it! i can garuntee you will love it!
B0000027RL|5.0|This is one of the greatest debut albums of all time, at least top five, and Pearl Jam's best record. Eddie Vedder has got an amazing voice, screeching and screaming and above all else, really good. The dude has range and his melodies are second nature to him. Great rhythms, excellent lyrics. Black is the best song. Even Floew flat out rocks, my favorite PJ song. Alive is stylisti slow and hard rock 'n' roll. Release is kind of a psychedalic throw back to their inspirations. Why Go rocks. Jeremy slams. Proch is driving and pounding rock. And it's all really good, not just their to be the next noise. High quality.
B00003CXA3|5.0|Yes, everybody describes this movie as \\"gritty\\" and I do too.  \\"The French Connection\\" was filmed in a style which makes you feel like you're following these two guys around as they try to figure out what the drug dealers of New York City and Marseille are up to.  The storytelling is very well-done, as we are given signs of both hope and despair as the police find clues leading to when the big drug switch is going to take place.  This movie paved the way for some great film acting careers for Gene Hackman, who's still going strong in movies like \\"The Royal Tenenbaums,\\" and Roy Schieder, who we'll always remember as Chief Brody in \\"Jaws,\\" a classic in its own right.  If you want to know why everybody says that the 1970s were a great film decade, see \\"The French Connection\\" (and also \\"Chinatown\\" if you have time!)
B00000J7JO|4.0|Of course, I don't have to remind you that BloodSugarSexMagik is the best of the Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog. Blood is timeless and as relevant as it was back in the early 90's. After a few experimental albums, the peppers came back with full force in 1999 with Californication-the second best of their career. Not only are there the handful of huge radio hits-&quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, &quot;OtherSide&quot;, etc; but the other tracks are just as accessible. &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; is a big standout that was surprisingly never released as a single. The album is like Blood in its song diversity. All follow the signature formula, but are combined with new tricks as well-new wave, a disco feel, and 60's/70's pop and funk. Californication is a must have for any fan-and anyone for that matter.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Once I heard her voice, i was in love with it.  Mellow, smooth, heartfelt and just a wonder.  Her songs amongst the classics are just so mature and lovely.   I can't say anything about this album that is a miss.   Wonderful... just wonderful.   If you are feeling down and low, this CD is one you just want to listen to over and over.   Her agreeable vocals are just a pleasure to listen to.
B000069HKH|5.0|I haven't listened to a collection of music this moving in all my life. I have had it on - in my car, in my office, on my MP3 player, my living room stereo -it has been with me since I bought it 2 days ago. It will stay with me all my days.<BR>Thanks, Bruce. As someone said before, you work for us.
B000002H6C|2.0|What was the big deal with this album?... One is good, yeah, it's the one Metallica song everyone knows, I don't care who you are, where you live or how old you are.  Yeah, it's great.  Everybody knows that guitar part in the middle, I don't have to describe it, you know what I mean... Didn't this win some kind of Grammy or something, for what, worst album of the year?  Buy the single of One, excellently inspired by Johnny Go HIs Gun (movie/book) and the video is great, one of the most groundbreaking and memorable.  Ok wait, let's just run One on here 6 or 7 times and rename it One, then it'll be good.
B00004T0P1|5.0|I read a lot of reviews, and whenever I saw one for a score composed by James Newton Howard, the reviewers almost always refered back to Dinosaur as one of his key scores.  Being a JNH fan, I couldn't pass this one up.<br />The the themes are very good, exciting, and for the most part original (that first part of the theme first heard in \\"The Egg Travels\\" is exactly like the first part for the main theme for Jerry Goldsmith's The 13th Warrior).  Along with Hans Zimmer's The Lion King and Jerry Goldsmith's Mulan, this is one of the best scores to a Disney movie ever.  It could almost be mistaken for a dramatic score, although there are some slightly \\"kiddish\\" moments in it, and I think he uses the African vocals just a bit too much (but I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know how that fits in...).  If I had to pick a favorite cue, it would probably be \\"Raptors Attack-Stand Together.\\"  It's just plain AWESOME!  The theme heard in that one is exceptional; it creates a sense of desperation and fear, but also gives you an adrenaline rush.<br />One problem: most of the other reviews mention that there are no musical style songs and/or pop songs on it.  Although this may be true for the cd advertised here at amazon.com, I, unfortunately, got mine on ebay's half.com, and my cd DID have a pop song!  Maybe it's a special edition worth a lot of money...(I can only hope!).  Unfortunately for me, I was expecting only JNH's excellent score, and now I have to skip over track 2 (pop song) which interferes with my listening enjoyment.  I hope it doesn't happen to you unless you want that pop song.  The time was just about right at [I'm guessing] 52:00 (somewhere around there, mine is 57:00 with the pop song).  Go out and buy this if you're a fan of adventure scores, James Newton Howard, or good music in general.  Well, get it here, you don't have to go anywhere else!
B00004WC6J|1.0|This 'best of' outing from the self-styled high bastion of serious pop music David Sylvian sums up all his efforts to date. <br />To the uninitiated, the CD promises everything. It features his trademark tastefully understated cover art. There is a role call of extremely competent, renowned musicians. The songs, which are unfamiliar to those who listen to the radio, have mysterious, mature-sounding titles. <br />But it delivers nothing. <br />First, there are the songs. To be fair, I am told that Sylvian's talent is in the atmospheric quality of his music. His songs create different moods. If this is the case, then the listener's mood is frequently bewilderment. Where are the tunes? This is a question to which there appears no answer, unless you take the view that this is due to the songs' \\"subtley\\".<br />Second, there is Sylvian's performance. Sylvian does not so much sing as moan, and he does so like a rusty lavatory door hinge the morning after a vindaloo curry eating marathon. Sylvian's vocal range covers no more than an octave. So no matter how much urgency and desperate effort is applied to the door, the moan never climbs or drops more than 7 notes. <br />Finally, and in Sylvian's defence, his work has been described as avant garde and original. Fans point to his Japan era, when he pioneered the New Romantic look and sound. Actually, what happened was that in about 1979 Sylvian wore a huge peroxide mullet on his head and sang a very flat and discordant version of \\"Second that Emotion\\". The haircut was a double rip off from two of Sylvian's heroes. The peroxide bottle and bouffant was Andy Warhol's idea, and the mullet was of course pure Ziggy-era Bowie. The song however is original, but only if sung by the great Smokey Robinson. And the prize for inspiring the New Romantics goes to David Bowie, the man into whom Sylvian has transformed over the years whenever he has opened his dressing up box for the next photo shoot. <br />Judging by the other reviews on Amazon \\"Everything and Nothing\\" will sell a copy to each of the Sylvian fans who comprise his increasingly 'selective' audience. They will accept no substitute. The rest of us are better to look for the real thing.
6305291446|3.0|This is one of the best halloweens in the series it opens up in a good horror form. It ends in a great horror form. this is a very challenging thriller then we can all say Jamie's back!Michael is more evil than he has been in a while this is worth you money if u love slasher films.
B000069HKH|5.0|The expectations for a Bruce record are always so high yet this is better than advertised. It has no low points and so many great songs. Some make you really reflect on the last year and some just rock.  Bruce and the E Street Band have never sounded better. Max is at the top of his game and the addition of the background singers add the perfect touch. FANTASTIC !!
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice And Men?  Oh no, no, no.  Of Genius and Sheer Brilliance is so much more fitting.  You can read it in about an hour, but be ready to read it three or four times in a row.  It is splendidly entertaining.  You root for these guys, a little down on thier luck, to win.  All you want is for this big goof Lenny to get his warm so he can be warm and loving as he is deep down inside and raise him some rabbits.  I'm reminded of the Abominable Snowman character from the old Bugs Bunny cartoons.  I'm gonna hug him and pet him and squeeze him and love him... But anyway, this is short, simple and very easy to read.  However, the easiest thing to do is enjoy this novel.  Yes, you are a little upset and disappointed when Lenny is killed, but it's still one of the best novels ever written.
0399226907|5.0|I remember reading this book when I was a child, and I rediscovered Eric Carle's beautiful book when I started working at a daycare. Now I read it to my own son, who is 8 months old. While I enjoy Eric Carle's style and collages, I find that some of his more recent books are disappointing. The stories aren't that great, and the collages aren't as unique. But The Very Hungry Caterpillar exceeds his more recent works in its simplicity. Children love to look at all of the food the caterpillar ate through, and the story (about a natural process of the caterpillar turning into a butterfly) is depicted in such a fresh manner. I have also purchased some other Eric Carle books, but this one is a must have. It's a classic.
B000050FEN|5.0|It really, truly is.  There are very few movies that present this aura of hopelessness without making it too over-the-top or corny.  Road To Perdition (the best film I have seen so far this year) is a movie that succeeds at this, and is one of the few that has done it since Seven.  <br />Instead of beating around the bush, Seven gets right into it, and introduces you to two very well-developed characters that are as different from each other as God and Satan.  One is the cocky, overconfident David Mills, not so much a rookie, but definitly too young to know what he is doing (Brad Pitt in, I believe, the best performance of his career.)  The other is soft-spoken, intelligent, by-the-book veteran William Sommerset, a man that has seen the ropes and knows which ones not to try and balance on.  With a 400+ pound man tortured beyond anything either of them has ever witnessed, the detectives are off on the trail of a killer that is elusive, intelligent, ruthless, and, as Sommerset calls his worse characteristic &quot;patient.&quot;  The reason that this movie had such an impact with Hollywood and the general theater going public is the reason that a killer with such motives was never introduced with quite the level of ferocity.  Certainly, we all have heard of Ed Gein and Jack The Ripper, both supposedly assassins of sin, but never has a character of such magnitude and with so many dimensions like John Doe been introduced.  Even though Kevin Spacey's role was short lived, he deserved an Academy Award nomination for his performance.  It was chilling to the point of hating it when it looked like he was looking at you.  <br />By the end, you are not only shocked, you are drained.  When it seems that every horrible thing has happened, it just keeps getting worse.  You seriously feel like you have been dried out and need water.  This shows the movie's brilliance.  You are drawn into the lives of characters that seem simplistic, but are developed on a very realistic level, especially Mills.  The acting was excellent, the direction and set design are worthy of applause, and the script was written with power, a rarity in today's cinematic vision.  You feel like these characters are people you know, and you feel for them.  You laugh with them, and you certainly gasp and cry with them.  This movie is one of the most amazing films ever to be produced in the last twenty years of film.  David Fincher has, for the most part (with the exclusion of Alien 3 and Panic Room which both were big wastes of time) to be one of the most underappreciated and brilliant directors ever to come along.  Brad Pitt is not just some pretty boy looking for the fast buck.  The man knows how to act and does it very well.  Morgan Freeman is impossible not to like in any role he is in and Gwyneth Paltrow's softness and beauty just make for the perfect touch to contrast with Kevin Spacey's sinister soul.  This movie will always be remembered and is going to be a classic.  Not so much because the content is like poetry, but because the content is real, and is something that no one ever saw before.
6305137293|3.0|This is a good sequel not as sharp as the first but still good. This movie first begins as the ending of the first and takes place in the hospital where Laurie Strode (Curtis) is in critical condition because Michael is back! this is a scary movie and it bring some thrills i recommend this.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden have always rocked, even in the dark years with Jannick and even Blaze. Now to start out this no doubt is maidens best album yet. The drumming is spectacular as usual since its good ol Nicko, screamn siren bruce is here and bass Cant go wrong with the legendary Steve Harris. The 3 guitar line up is spectacular, with Dave, Adrian, and Jannick are just soaringly incredible. Most people think Jannick was what ruined them originally, but you know its not true. Jannick was just very raw and very wild nothing wrong with that. Most of peoples favorite tracks on this album were actually written by him. Just accept the fact that maiden had to replace the great adrian smith and they replaced him with someone who filled the shoes perfectly. Smith and Murray would even tell you that, enough said about Jannick. Anyway every song is excellently written and played, there isnt one bad song off here.<br />Wickerman-spectacular song and great solo by adrian, strange lyrics. They really jam on this one. (Solo by Smith)<br />Ghost of the Navigator-this is spectacular song, awesome lyrics and Jannick's solo is just dynamite he tears that guitar up,not a very good guitarist huh?(Solo by Gers)<br />Brave New World-Powerful smooth tune with some very powerful lyrics and excellent solos.(Solos by Gers/Murray)<br />Blood Brothers-Jethro Toll influence on steroids indeed. An incredible song with superb bass, vocals are so deep and the guitar playing was so powerful, they really played this song with their heart and soul.(Solos by Murray/Gers)<br />The Mercenary-This song really rocks, they really jam and you get to hear Jannick play the bridge repeatidily, while Dave's solo is just like the fastest solo played in metal history and then Adrian comes in with a smooth paced solo as well, very raw tune and a metal classic.(This is one of maiden's most heaviest songs, so yes, jannick delivers the old fashioned maiden chemistry as well.)(Bridge by Gers, solos by Murray/Smith)<br />Dreamof Mirrors-Superb very long tune, great melodies,incredible lyrics. Perhaps the greatest guitar solo in metal history. Gers never stops moving his fingers across the board, he plays the guitar the way its supposed to be played. The most complex maiden song aside from Sign of the Cross and 7th son. (Solo by Gers)<br />Fallen Angel-Great fast tune deep, religious, and exciting. <BR>Terrific solos by all 3 of the boys back to back. Talk about a complex thing to do, having 3 different guitarists delivering 3 solos back to back.(solos by Smith/Murray/Gers)<br />The Nomad-Superb interesting song, dynamite solos and the melody in the middle of the song of bass and smooth guitar is just incredible and will make you want to just be desincitized. (Solos by Gers/Murray/Smith)<br />Out of the Silent Planet-Perhaps the rawest song on here, opening with the superb guitar solo nothing else greater, very simple, but nothing wrong with some simpleness, with some of the best lyrics of our time. This is all Jannick on this one. Very heavy and raw, not maidenish? Please!!!(Solo by Gers)<br />Thin Line Between Love and Hate-Metal classic, very transcending lyrics so true and deep, and a wonderous closing, and Dave nailing the guitar down repeatidly as well as adrian and jannick delivering a piece.(Solos by Murray/Gers, bridge by Smith)<br />Maiden are metal gods, this is maiden's best yet, now that doesnt mean it has to be your favorite maiden album, but talent wise as well as complex, it is their best. If you luv real talented metal, this is for you, get it now. It doesnt have their old sound, maiden doesnt have an old sound, all of their albums in the 80's as well as 90's were heavier or more mellow then others. There is only more melody here, these boys still have it, and will always have it. You can be in a calm mood as well as a headbanging mood to enjoy this album. Cant wait till their next album, and in my opinion as a guitarist, if you think they need to get rid of Jannick thenMaiden is not for you
B000001E21|5.0|This was an excellent experiment and throwback to the glory days of their beginnings.  Desert Song is a driving and anthemic beginning and Two Steps Behind and Miss You In A Heartbeat are the familiar sounding and up to date ballads.  Only After Dark is a funky, kind of bluesy, just plain fun number.  Action! is a great song, just straight up fast and hard rock 'n' roll.  It's more of the no nonsense Def Leppard from the beginning, just a little bit later in thier careers.  It's really good and it's true to their classic style, great addition to a Def Leppard fan's collection or any fan of rock'n' roll for that matter.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I have never read any of the Harry Potter books so I didn't quite understand what the big deal was over the movie when it came out. But I decided to get it on DVD to see what all the hype was about. I was really quite surprised how much I enjoyed the film. It's such a charming family movie. <BR>The best parts of the film were definitely the special effects. The actors who played Harry Potter and Ron were adorable and very likable. Ron and Harry's female friend Hermione, was a character who was simply annoying, but I suppose this was the point of her character. Alan Rickman as the puzzling, yet slimy Snape couldn't have been played any better.<BR>From the music, to the cinematography, and great story, I just can't go on enough about Harry Potter. Surprising to me however, was the length of the movie, about 2 1/2 hours. A bit long for a children's movie, but the pace moved along really well, so I don't think anyone over 7 or 8 would be too bored. The extras on the DVD are pretty good too, especially the deleted scenes. You have to play a game to access them, but that's half of the fun.
B000068QVN|1.0|I am one of the biggest fan of GFR and I have seen them on tour since April of 71. I do feel out of their four live recordings this is the poorest. The quality of the sound is very poor. It is almost like a bootleg version. Their first live album and Bosnia album are much better in their sound quality. Although I had been waiting for this recording for a while, the selection of the songs are remarkable. I wished they sounded better!
6305971099|3.0|This is close to the same as the return except new plotline a descent film but this movie is on the bad side of michael myers still is a good slasher movie though.
B000065U1N|5.0|BEING A EX VET THIS IS ONE OF THE NEARIST YOU WILL GET TO THE REAL THING,THIS IS THE VERY BEST OF A WAR FILM, THE INTENCE GUN FIGHTS ARE VERRY REAL TO LIVE,AS YOU CAN GET.<BR>ITS MY KIND OF FILM MY STAR RATEING IS *****
B000000OUE|5.0|Yeah, I loved it when it came out, yeah, I went and saw them and it was a killer show, truly a live band. However, some of the songs on here are just nonsense. Creature of the Wheel and Grease Paint and Monkey Brains are just retarded. More Human Than Human is merely single material, but wasn't quality. Electric Head 1 and 2 and El Phantasmo are the best songs on here and Blood Milk and Sky is their epic, sweeping \\"masterpiece\\" that every band has every now and then.  Rob Zombie is a great song writer, but some times he just goes wrong.  It's very psychadelic and just pulse pounding and very trippy. It's not bad, but it isn't great. It's fun to listen to, don't get me wrong, but it just isn't as great as the far superior quality of La Sexorcisto.
B00003CXPD|5.0|.<br />Does the perfect movie exist? Billy Elliot must come very close. From its brilliant casting, to clever cinematography to ... foot stomping choreography, this movie has got it all. The freshness and originality of Billy Elliot almost jumps off the screen. The British production house, Working Title Films over the last five years or so have had some great hits: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones' Diary, Elizabeth and in late 2000 we got Billy Elliot. They take great risks by using untried scriptwriters, directors and young actors and somehow have produced a string of fabulous movies.<br />The plot of Billy Elliot is simple enough; a North Country lad from a coal mining family discovers the joys of dance. Against opposition from his father and elder brother, young Billy discovers himself and his talents. All this happens within the vortex of Margaret Thatcher's mid-1980's economic and social revolution, which swirls around them.<br />At first glance, you might be tempted to classify Billy Elliot into the well-trodden school of gritty, British social realism, best expressed by Ken Loach of Cathy Come Home fame. Although mostly set in a working class world, the direction and camera work captures scenes of outstanding beauty. Cranes and bridges move like graceful, colourful birds; a kitchen table containing just two sauce bottles and duck-egg blue salt and pepper shakers has the aesthetics of an Old Master's still life.<br />The film's Director of Photography, Brian Tufano, has been quoted as saying, &quot;... framing, composition, colours and texture are the elements you need to convey a story.&quot; Some scenes captured by Tufano's camera are nothing short of magical. We have Billy and his girlfriend Debbie walking past a wall of riot-shielded policemen. She nonchalantly rattles a stick along the shields and then she passes behind a parked police van. The van moves off and Debbie has disappeared. Has she been beamed up or abducted?<br />Billy's elder brother, Tony, a hotheaded union agitator, is chased along the streets near the Elliot family's terrace house. The lanes are full of virginal white, bedsheets hanging out to dry. Tony gets caught up in these as the police lay into him with their truncheons. We have the understatement of only seeing his blood seeping through the shroud-like sheets. If this movie were out of today's Hollywood, it would have been full-on gore. Despite the drama and action in this scene, it has an almost comic touch, with the soundtrack giving us The Clash doing London Calling. The chase through the streets and houses could come straight from a Max Sennet Keystone Cops movie from the 1920s.<br />In the reconciliation scene between Billy and his Dad, we see the two of them perched on a fence. A cemetery - where Billy's Mum lies buried - is in the foreground. Behind the fence is a field of golden ripe corn and on the skyline there are the sinister looking headframes of the coal mines. When we see the two of them wrestling and laughing in the cornfield, we are reminded that truly emotionally moving scenes in movies are possible without relying on Hollywood's formulaic schmaltz. <br />The blending of classical and contemporary music throughout the movie, both as a setting for the dance routines and as background music is natural and seamless. The climactic final scene, which is set 14 years later, has Billy debuting in a starring role in the Royal Ballet's Swan Lake. The build-up and tension from Tchaikovsky's music takes us to that transcending moment where Billy launches himself into a grand jete, where he seems to float in space. <br />Billy Elliot is a film that appeals at many levels, but the best recommendation is to just sit back and enjoy one of the best movies you will see in a long time. <br />As a footnote, it's worth seeing the DVD version of the movie since the subtitles will really help you get the most from the subtle nuances in the thickly accented dialogue.
B00006690G|5.0|After the Marshall Mathers LP, I had a suspicion that Shady might be the world's greatest rapper; after the Eminem Show (and relistening to the Slim Shady LP) the hunch is confirmed - he's the illest rapper to ever walk the planet.  A lot of people will argue that and say Biggie or Tupac were better.  All due respect to those legends, they just were not as talented as Slim.  As an English teacher and very occassional writer, I'm truly impressed by his insanely poetic lyrics and ability to connect with people like no artist has in a very long time.  Who was the last one to do it?  Dylan, probably.  But honestly, Shady's music is far more fun to listen to than Bobby D's.  One day he may just get, \\"the props he deserves.\\"
B00005JKL8|4.0|GREAT WAR FILM NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE TRUTH, AS YOU CAN GET.<BR>AGAIN COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO, YOU TELL ME??
B00003CX95|5.0|This is the grand and glorious, romantic and adnventuours, thrilling, action packed and exciting, sweeping epic of battle and struggle of good against evil, the upper class and the lower nobody's that everyone knows, everyone loves and everyone has got in their vocabulary. \\"...for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies, that they may take our lives, but they'll never take, our freedom.\\" \\"Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!\\"  How can this movie not inspire courage in everyone?  How can it not reaffirm the majesty and mytsique of the glorious epic dramas of yesterday?  This is a wonderful film, with a wonderful score, beautiful cinematography and some damn good performances.  This is an excellent film and it gets my highest recommendation possible.
B00005YUTD|5.0|Fantastic movie!  Great enjoyable lively classical music in backround but very fun, happy and educational visuals all throughout the movie. NOT a boring \\"let your kids be exposed to classical music\\" movie. To all who give it a try, enjoy!
B000069CWE|4.0|Reanimation is sorta like the alter oposite ego of Hybrid Theory...bad, but u know we like bad things...the remixes are truly great opening with a strange classical intro takin you through the first single, Pts of Athority, good track to the next best classic standout track En th End leading you on a ride of fear, surprise and excitment as we close with another one of their best tracks that standout on the cd, 1Stp Kloser. The originals were good, the remixes are even better. Hybrid Theory was more of a rock/rap type LP as Reanimation of a  rap/rock LP..not bad still keepin both elements in it that make up Linkin Park...this cd gives a good transiton from the 8+ million selling debut to their nxt album with new material.<br />Only thing i found bad about this cd is that Mike isnt the best rapper, but the lyrics and music make up for it completly...Overall great CD...<br />BUY IT if u liked Hybrid Theory, Reanimation breathes new life into their previous Lp...***DA MUSIC MAN
B00004T0US|5.0|These tracks were recorded in the last eighteen months of Elvis' life, and everybody has a different opinion about them. I suspect that the real reason some people dislike them is their obvious country orientation.<br />There are plenty of country songs here, including If you love me let me know (Olivia Newton-John), He'll have to go (Jim Reeves), She thinks I still care (George Jones), Blue eyes crying in the rain (which Elvis probably covered after hearing Willie Nelson's cover of Roy Acuff's song) and Bitter they are harder they fall (Larry Gatlin). For the heart later became a country number one for the Judds, under the title Had a dream.<br />Unchained melody, which opens this set, has become a pop classic everywhere, but nowhere more than in Britain, where it hits the upper reaches of the charts every few years. It has been number one for three (maybe four) different artists at different times, making it (arguably) the most popular song in British chart history. Elvis' live version is not the best version of this song, but it's reasonable.<br />Other pop classics covered here include Pledging my love (Johnny Ace), Hurt (Timi Yuro, later a country number one for Juice Newton), The last farewell (Roger Whittaker), I'll never fall in love again (Tom Jones), Solitaire (written by Neil Sedaka, but the Carpenters and Andy Williams each had hits with it).<br />The old Irish folk song Danny Boy also gets a nice workout. The big hits, Moody blue and Way down, were successful on both the pop and country charts.<br />So, this may not be the best of Elvis, but it's a great album for country music fans to have. If you don't like country music, there are plenty of other albums by Elvis that will suit you better.
B000002H97|3.0|I can't take it anymore, make Metallica go away.  They were never that good to begin with, just something you can slam your head to.  Enter Sandman is hideously overplayed.  Sad But True is the best song on here and it's so simple a child could write it.  That what all of this music is, simple.  When they first started, they seemed great and groundbreaking and revolutionary.  Eh... it's just mindless head pounding, not good music.  They new stuff [is not that good] and this is where they started to go down hill. It gets a lot more credit than it deserves.  Yes, this music is great for up beat moods just the guys sitting around drinking beer, but the quality is seriously lacking.  This album might have had some redemption if more of the songs were like Unforgiven, their most original song, but the rest just stinks.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I've finally given up the struggle of trying to find out what everyone likes about this album, and simply accepted the fact that I totally disagree in every way. Mayer's songs are all very pleasant--and that's about it. Where's the intensity, original thought, artistic expression? Well I guess you'll have to dig deeper than I'm willing to go to find it, because all I hear is some pleasantly bland guitar playing, an almost soulless voice, and some of the most atrocious lyrics ever put to paper. \\"I wanna run through the halls of my high school. I wanna scream at the top of my lungs\\", says Mayer in a near whisper. This is a scream? Also, anyone who has any concern whatsoever about their ten year high school reunion should really consider moving somewhere else--maybe into, say, the present and/or future. I've been out of high school for one year and already have no desire to go back, so I don't see what Johnny boy could possibly be talking about, unless he's simply lying for some catchy lyrics. Hows THAT for artistic integrity?! \\"Your body is a wonderland\\". If anyone ever told me that my body was a wonderland I'd either start charging for admission or run screaming. And I'm not one of those guys who needs an electric guitar blasting at me to be happy; I don't consider myself a punk guy and I love acoustic music, but the guitar line in this song is simply LAME. I'm sorry, but it is. It makes me want to bob my head moronically with my face contorted to look like a chipmunk. \\"I'm never speaking up again, starting now\\", which is OF COURSE followed by a whole extra verse before arriving in the same boring place. Man is this guy convincing with his words! But I guess that's all we need these days. In the sea of...that is modern pop, with white boys rapping and playing \\"NU\\" metal and teenage girls showing off their midrifts while lip-synching, people like John Mayer can be seen as a breath of fresh air, unoriginal as they may be. I think he's better than most of what's out there, but the air is still pretty polluted. Sigh. When is the new Radiohead album coming out?
B000002H6C|5.0|This is another great Metallica album, the 4th of 5 great releases.  The first one with Jason Newsted, and if he wasn't so underplayed by the bad production, we'd see how great he truly was.  I can safely say from watching them live that he is a talented bassist.  Anyways, you can barely hear the bass on this album, but if you can get past that, this may be Metallica's best album.  Definitely their most mature and complex.  This shows some very mature songwriting, while still staying true to thrash, something the Black album didn't always do(don't get me wrong, I love the Black album, but it's certainly not as thrashy as this).  The riffs and time changes are great. Kirk Hammet plays some of his best solos here, namely \\"One\\", but all of his solos are quite good.  This was the first album where I noticed how great a drummer Lars is.  I don't know if it's me or if he just plays alot better on this album, either way, he sounds great. Some highlights:<br />Blackened - Wow! What a great way to start an album like this.  Fantastic time changes and then a great solo.  Cool.<br />...And Justice For All - Great riffs in this song.  A 10 minute epic with great lyrics.     <br />One - If you haven't heard this song, it's pretty much worth the price of the album.  All i can say is that it's one of Metallica's best songs ever, with one of the best solos ever.<br />To Live is To Die - Another rather long track, it's mostly instrumental with great riffs and solos.<br />All the songs are great, and I would recommend this to any Metallica fan.  I'm sure you will enjoy it.
0385503954|4.0|Anne of Green Gables lived in the real world?  She would be Briony Tallis, still as fanciful as ever, but now her actions have consequences.  That is what I thought of as I read this book.  Indeed thirteen year old Briony is also a budding writer, who takes extraordinary flights of imagination, and has incredible drama for everyday events in her life. Like Anne, Briony is also capable of summoning up outrage at the events in the world around her. <br />It is just this outrage which unintentionally sets off a terrible chain of events. Briony witnesses an episode between her sister, Cecilia and their childhood friend, Robbie.  This is followed up by more events, in the same day,  that Briony is too young to understand, plenty of childish imagination, and then one final horror in the late evening.  This sets the stage for an emotionally charged Briony to mistakenly identifying someone.<BR>The rest of the story follows the fallout of that one day.  <br />Atonement is a splendid story, told very much through the impressions of the characters rather than their actions.  This lends the novel an emotional immediacy that allows the reader to walk slowly through the narration and savour every bit.  We feel the lurking menace early on in the novel, the sickly sweet heat of the victorian home, the emotional cascades of the characters, the heat of surprise love making, and the horrors of war.<br />While I feel that this is a fine novel, there were things that I felt weren't really necessary.  The narration from the POV of Emily, Briony's mother, doesn't really add anything to the story. It shares no new information, nor is Emily a main character to the story.  It was, in my opinion, a waste of space.  I also felt that some plot points were a tiny bit weak (especially Robbie's conviction and Lola's marriage), however, this may be forgiven as the book is less about the plot lines than about the effect upon the characters.
B00005ATZT|5.0|This is one of the best adventure stories, best mysterys, best suspense-thrillers of 1993, of the 90's of all time.  Harrison Ford is brilliant. Tommy Lee Jones turned in the best performance of his career.  It also has one of the top 5 action movie stunts ever recorded on film.  That train wreck sequence is just so heart pounding, edge of your seat, biting your nails down past the cuticles exciting that you just have to stop and watch it again, rewind it immediately and just watch two or three extra times.  Phenomenal, phenomenal story, performances and film as a whole.
0451527712|4.0|Having to read Frankenstein for my Freshman Honors Eng. Class, I thought it would be much more boring than it really is. The writings before the novel are splendid. As a novel,Frankenstein  is an excellent book, not a Clancy, but detailed enough for me. Shelley's work on the novel is phenomonal.<br />The novel starts out with a man by the name of Robert Walton writing letters to his dearest. Soon enough, Frankenstein is rescued in an ice flow. Soon after Frankenstein is rescued, he comes to tell his tale.<br />I rate this book 4 stars.
B00005U16N|4.0|Johnny Depp is Blow. The movie like the intrinsic narcissism of the drug, spirals out of Depp's eye. J.D. is fast becoming a hell of a character actor a la Val Kilmer. Only stylized acting like this transforms such a script into a movie I'll watch every few years. Depp's sensibilities, the cat-house cool, the vaunted respect balanced with a well hidden cockiness are all the vital inflections needed against the drug lords and soldiers he encounters in the movie. George Jung's ambitions far outweigh his talent. The gringo-makes-nice with a far-off world. Yea the documentary facade of the film is obvious, and all the nasty trappings of the Life are well delivered, but to rest on this is missing the point. Blow is a metaphor for the edge, Kristeva's semiotic unspeakable. Like any Eastwood movie, character, not the voice tracking of mainstream acting, is the true anima to an new economy. The late Ted Demme's eye for character is astounding. Jordi Malla's part as Depp's partner is brilliantly creepy and cloying, the devil in disguise. Cliff Curtis, who plays Escobar, is necessary, beedy eyes and all; not to mention Paul Reubens, the Bobcat and even Ray Liotta, who brought something essential. Yea this all happened I guess, no Scarface, but definitely a Boogie Nights.
B000066NW0|5.0|i would have to say that this CD is THE BEST EVER!!!!!!!<BR>Avril is my favorte and my idol NO DOUBT!<BR>her CD rox and i love all of her songs!<BR>i listen to the CD pretty much 24/7 and memorized every song!<BR>THIS CD DESERVES EVERYTHING AND THE BEST REVIEWS!...
B000009DUY|4.0|It's great, but John Williams has had so many better scores.  Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Schindler's List and of course, JAWS.  This great, but with a name like John Williams and the kind of credentials he has under his name, you have to expect something a little more.  I know Spielberg didn't want so much scoring in this film, but that's fine, Williams should have at least made it better quality.  Hymn To The Fallen is a wonderful tribute and I especially like how it book ended this score, although only showing up at the end of the film.  Revisiting Normandy is the best track, just full of passion and beautiful gentle but dynamically strong.  Great John Williams.
B00005A46T|5.0|Dont listen to people that say this C.D sounds just like the other one and that this band has no talent.  Being a guitar player I will say that this band is bursting at the seams with talent. Not only does the band have nine members and get all those members to play together the guitar riffs are also not just three chords played really fast. Most of the time the music has many layers to it that really give the CD alot of depth.  The guitar riffs are not easy to play and if you dont believe me go look at their tab book and try to play every song in there.  It is not easy  This CD is a huge evolution from the last one which sounded much more dirty while this one sounds much more crisp and loud.  The last one was more of a nu-metal sound that is always contributed to bands like KOrn and Limp Bizkit.  This one goes away from that and sounds more like it is taking pages out of the musical book of slayer or pantera.  Corey Taylor the lead singer also does a good job at mixing the yelling with melody. Other reviews have complained that this is the main problem and that it is just yelling and boring.  Listen to the song \\"Gently\\" and tell me that there is no melody or just listen to the song on the Spider-Man soundtrack \\"bother\\" with only Corey Taylor.  Anyone that says this is boring or the same as the last CD doesnt know what it is like to make an evolution in sound.  This CD is one of the best metal albums to come out in a while and doesnt follow the same sound that is now classified as \\"metal\\".  If you think this is going to be Linkin Park or some nu-metal sound, your severly mistaken.  This CD is a sonic assault on you ear drums and emotions.  If you want to get fired up and hear an excellent band buy this CD!!!!
B000001DVD|5.0|This is a signature album full of signature Def Leppard rock 'n' roll.  Bringin' On The Heartache is signature Def Leppard all in one song.  Very classic, very popular.  Even better follow up: Switch 625.  Great instrumental, very guitar driven.  It's just great, very up beat and fast rock 'n' roll.  Just plain good rock 'n' roll.
B000001EHS|5.0|Vault is a great colection of Lep hits,It has some great versions of old songs,like the cut version of Armageddon It.Greatest hits cd's uaslly suck but this one rocks you till you drop.
B000001EHS|5.0|This really is a collection of Def Leppard's greatest hits, the most memorable and most popular.  &quot;When Love and Hate Collide&quot; fits perfectly in the middle of the classics as a beacon of sorts of how the new stuff fits the classic mold and where the rest of their new music is going.  Nice additions of Pour Some Sugar On Me and Rocket's video versions, the more popular versions of the two.  Excellently compiled and produced.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|I have to admit that I was never a Bee Gees fan growing up, and never owned any kind of their music.  I purchased this as one of my first two DVDs after the completion of my home theater.  I bought this one because the reviews said that it was of very good video and audio quality and I wanted something in DTS.  I have never seen another of their DVDs nor have I ever seen them in concert, so I cannot comment on the group itself comparative to other of their performances.  But I do now have several other concert DVDs and can speak very highly of the sound and image quality and that this is one of the most watched DVDs in my home.
B000002ORU|5.0|This is the best box set I have ever had in my sights and in my hands.  From the beginning to the end, it has rarities and live songs, funny studio outtakes and the best of The Who.  Disc one start out great with some classic old surfy tunes from the High Numbers.  Disc three is probably the disc with the best music: Baba O'Riley, Won't Get Fooled Again, Behinsd Blue Eyes, The Seeker, Reign O'er Me, Join Together, 5.15.  Magic Bus is there, Who Are You?, Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere, Happy Jack, The OX (Rest In Peace John), Boris The Spider, Can't Explain and probably the greatest single song ever written by a rock and roll band: My Generation.  This is when R&amp;B meant something different and this is when The Who took their profession and they worked it to perfection.  The greatest music from on of the greatest rock bands ever assmebled.
B000069HKH|5.0|All you need is to hear the first two tracks, lonesome day and Into the fire to understand how good this album is.  Lonesome day in my mind combines all that was great about his best albums.  I feel the drumming of born in the usa, the powerful repetition of born to run, the lyrics of darkness, the emotion of Nebraska, just awesome.  And Into the Fire is the single best, inspirational, patriotic, 9.11 song written.  I love McCartney's and Youngs songs, but Paul's is a bit cheesy and Neil's is not nearly as powerful.  Into the Fire will if nothing less give you goosebumps.  It made my eyes teary.  - Thanks Boss
B000004286|5.0|This score, just so beautiful and moving, depicts the flow and pace of the film right onto a cd.  During the battle scenes, the score is the only thing heard.  And it transforms the energy and anger and advneture and excitement into music.  You can't help but replay the visuals of the movie as you sit and listen to this.  And you can't help but get chills over and over again when you listen to the final scenes orchestration and it gets to the part when Wallace's sword is heaved across the battle field.  It's magnificent.
B000000WFF|5.0|The Spice Girls recorded their second album at their pop culture peak. They were to be heard, watched, played with, eaten, read, and worshipped, with albums, a movie, dolls, lollipops, chewing gum, books, magazines, and an army of enthusiasts. Despite this massive merchandising pitch, the Girls were a musical act, first and foremost. They proved their first pop release wasn't a fluke, as they followed it with another album that was a perfect example of the pop form. Catchy lyrics, playful vocals, cheery pop instrumentation, and Girl Power coated the albums ten tracks. They go after Motown, disco, lounge, funk, and soul, leaving only the very faintest of fingerprints on the genres they embrace. The album as a whole functions both as a self contained pop record and a movie soundtrack. Fueled by the hit singles \\"Spice Up Your Life\\", \\"Too Much\\", \\"Stop\\", and \\"Viva Forever\\" the girls conquered the charts, and did it with pure pop style. Album tracks can be a tedious issue for some albums, but those here are all classic pop productions, the Girls shining on the neo-disco of \\"Never Give Up On The Good Times\\", the bitchy funk of \\"Denying\\", the free spirit of \\"Do It\\", and the campy lounge of \\"The Lady Is A Vamp\\". The last really classic album of their career before the exit of Geri Halliwell, I doubt they'll ever reach the pop peak they had with this and Spice ever again, but the recordings will always be great to look back on as defining records of the 90's pop sound.
B000001FKY|5.0|This is it, the one you've all heard about.  And believe me, it lives up to the hype.  It's got all those familiar hard rock songs, very true to style, and it introduced us to the melodic and gentle balads that got Def Leppard even more commerical success.  Pour Some Sugar On Me and Armageddon It are probably the most familiar songs on here and Hysteria is clearly the best song on this album and the best song they've ever recorded.  Gods Of War is a truly epic masterpiece of social commentary.  Rocket is a tribute to all the great old bands and songs that inspired Def Leppard, very touching tribute, sort of, but it's still good.  Animal is the sleeper hit, just a great and fun tune.  Hell, they're all good, check this one out too.
B00005Y228|3.0|Many counties have their own. Own Madonna. Sweden has popdiva Lena Philipsson. England has all the Spice Girls. USA has Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez. Australia have the might Kylie. She has been a superstars for years all around the world, excpet in the states. But she had some trouble years. But Ex popdiva Paula Abdul change that, with helping Kylie back on track with UK nr1 hit &quot;Spinning Around&quot; from last album &quot;Light Years&quot;. But it was with the grovvy &quot;Cant Get You Out Of My Head&quot; she showed us, she can be a light version of Madonna. But she has her own style, more popdance and disco. It feels very european. Highlight on the album is the great floorfiller &quot;Its In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Love At First Site&quot; and &quot;Burning Up&quot;.<BR>If you like Kylie, check out the new European superstar Sophie Ellis Bexter.<BR>So get your dance shoes on, sip up the drink and get on the dance floor! Becourse - Kylie is in town!
B000002V0Q|5.0|This is by far Megadeth's best music and best album.  Every song is great.  Skin O' My Teeth is a great opening track and Symphony Of Destruction brought them great commercial and popular success equaled and surpassed by the just as good song, Sweating Bullets.  Architecture of Aggression or Foreclosure of  Dream are the best songs.  Psychotoron really misses the mark, but the album gets right back on track with Captive Honour.  Then it finishes strong with Ashes In Your Mouth.  The most trademark and distincive Megadeth song, familiar to their style, is the speed metal High Speed Dirt.  Great album, gets my highest recommendation.
B00005RFAI|5.0|R'n'B diva went rock. Have we heard it before? Yes, but on just few tracks, Janets &quot;Black Cat&quot;, Whitneys &quot;Queen Of The Night&quot; and En Vogues &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;. So, now when Pink returns with her new album, it sounds like a dance-hip-hop-soul-Sheryl Crow. She have found her edge, in 4 Non Blonds Linda Perry. Great hooks, great melodies and some good lyrics. This is one of the best female albums in a long time. Best songs is &quot;Lonley Girl&quot;, &quot;Dont Let Me In&quot; and &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot;.And whatever you say - she is not a damn Britney Spears!
0800141806|5.0|How could this only get a couple Academy Award Nomination???  It's a travesty.  Superb screenplay.  Phenomenal directing.  Dynamite score and original songs from Neil Young and The Boss.  I think Neil's is better.  Denzel was just as worthy of a supporting actor Oscar as Tom Hanks was with his.  This is just a great film and the ending is so touching and deep and personal.  Everyone has got to love this movie.  Antonio has a nice small role, but even he took it on so well.  Tom Hanks turns in one of the best performances of all time.
B0000636UN|5.0|All i wanna do is have some fun. That was the start of a successful rock artits career. But never have Sheryl Crow been so good as she is on this great album. After having fun on first album, she turned to the darkside...if it makes you happy, why the hell are you so sad? From favorite mistakes and sweet child of mine, she is back, with her best album ever. &quot;Souk Up The Sun&quot; and &quot;Steve MQueen&quot; is the first taste of the new, sunny, delightful Sheryl. Title track is also a sunny rockpop song, that will make us all happy. In the beginning we had Billie Myers, Leah Andreone, Tracy Bonham and others. Now its only Sheryl and Alanis left. Sheryl makes a rocky-Alanis-kind-of-song in &quot;Lucky Kid&quot;. From rockers to more midtemp songs like &quot;Its so easy&quot;. So buy this great album, put it in your cdplayer in your car, turn up the volume and just enjoy the ride with the best music biz can give you this summer of 2002.
B000002HRE|2.0|No, not sell outs, just doing things different.  And, doing them very bad.  I thought Load was some kind of cruel, sick, bad joke... but, then there was this.  And the nightmare continued.  It's just not Metallica.  Maybe it's a Samson and Delilah thing.  If they grow their hair back, will they return to their hard rocking dominance?  Can they ever regroup, literally, and claw their way back to the top where they used to be.  \\"Fuel\\" is ok, Unforgiven II is preposterous and The Memory Remains is just wierd music.  Metallica is not supposed to be wierd, they're Metallica, just ...in your face pounding, driving rock 'n' roll.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is a story of real emotion and power about one day in Los Angeles in which 9 peoples lives are intertwined.  Theres a cop, drug addict, sick game show host, dying man, male nurse, a wife, an ex quiz kid, a current quiz kid and a man from an infomercial.  All of these character weave a beautiful story that looks like is all going down the drain until the hand of god plays a role.  A large pheonmenon happens that i won't reveal but is hinted at because of the prologue or Richard Jay talking about strange things that happen.  Some critics were angry or baffled at this but, i thought it was brilliant.  The perfect touch to a perfect movie with incredible acting, story telling and music all combined to make a modern classic.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is breathing and has love in their heart.<br />9/10 \\"And the book says \\"We may be through with the past but, the past ain't through with us\\"\\"
6305128952|5.0|Such a shameful Oscar snub.  This really is a perfect film.  Robert Redford stars in and directs himself so well.  Kristin Scott Thomas is great, not a film role I'm used to seeing her in and she was wonderful.  The romance that unfolds between those two is magical.  And I think it's funny that in The Hunt For Red October, Sam Neil said he would always liked to have seen Montana, and in this film and Jurassic Park, he does.  Just a funny little side note.  But seriously, the cinematography and score are pure cinema excellence.
B000002UDD|4.0|I really don't understand why people think this album isn't very good. It opens with the instrumental \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\", which has amazing energy, the goes onto \\"Set the World Afire\\", which comes from the angry Megadeth roots. The 3rd track is a waste I have to admit. They cover the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy in the U.K\\", which has no place on a heavy metal album. The fourth and 6th tracks (\\"Mary Jane\\" and \\"In My Darkest Hour\\") are written from the same riff, and they sound noticably samey. Back to the good points, \\"502\\" is a great track for driving, as it is about driving.\\"Liar\\" is my favourite song on the album, cause I love the opening riff. The final track is \\"Hook in Mouth\\" which is also one of my favourites because of all the insrumental bits, and Dave did a good job at writing the music on this one.
B000001F7R|5.0|This is a great debut from one of the 80's best bands and one the best hard rock bands ever and still going.  This is full of fist pumping, foot stomping good tunes.  &quot;Overture, Hello America, Rock Brigade...&quot; are all very good rock tunes.  Good transition from the 70's into the 80's.  Great debut, classic rock album.  Give it a listen.
B000067CPX|3.0|i don't think enough has been said about the rhythm of flea (bass) and chad (drums) on this album.   listen to the way they play together, it's awesome...i think so at least.   venice queen suprised me. the cd seems too long to me, and the order of the songs doesn't seem right to me either, except for the last two....if that's a sign of things to come, then their next album could really be something.  i still enjoy this CD though, I just can't listen to it as repetitively as some of their other Albums.
B000020617|5.0|This is some of the most original and beautiful music to come out of the 90's.  Foo Fighters are the best thing to ever happen to Dave Grohl.  Now he was finally able to step into the spotlight and flex his msucial muscles.  He writes wonderful lyrics and made a flawless transtition from drums to the guitar.  He has a great voice and is one of the best front men/stage presences I have ever seen.  Generator is the best song, familiar fast paced and up beat FF rock 'n' roll.  Learn To Fly is a great commcercial and it produced one of the best videos ever.  Next Year is a slow and adventurous number, quite excellent song writing.  Gimme Stitches is funky and fresh and Breakout is a scream out loud crowd pleaser.  I give this album my highest recommendation.
B00005T30L|5.0|'Ghost World' is extremely hard to classify. It's certainly not another teen movie; in fact it's the exact opposite of what we learned to expect from that category. Calling it a comics flick would also give a very wrong idea of what it is. It's certainly not a comedy, but it's not really a drama either. If you really must know what kind of film is it, think in the direction of 'Daria' but more intelligent, sensitive and with three-dimensional characters (not only physycally). Or, more accurately, three three-dimensional characters making their way in a two-dimensional world of cardboard and plastic.<br />The movie does have some very nice comedic moments, but it's more important traits are its atmosphere and symbolisms. It's beautiful and sensitive and creates a mesmerising atmosphere, Making for a superb adaptation of Daniel Clowes's original graphic novel (though the story itself has little to do with that of the source). The directing (Terry Zwigoff in his first non-documentry) is masterful and very original and unique, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent (quite a lot of it is taken directly from the novel, but the rest is in very much the same spirit), and the actors are all superb; Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi as the more sophisticated characters make a fantastic job. They are strenghtened by the wonderful, mostly hilerious cartoonish stereotypes that surround them, like Enid's father (Gosford Park's Bob Balaban), the creepy John Ellis (Pat Healy), the pretentious art teacher (Illeana Douglas), and the abnoxious Melorra (Debra Azar). A wonderful movie all around.<br />There is a change, though hardly unnoticed, happenning in the cinema world. More than ten years after the artistic revolution in comics, the graphic novel is finally being appreciated as a potential source for films, starting with the Hughes Brothers' excellent adaptation of Alan Moore's and Eddie Campbell's 'From Hell', soon followed by this adaptation of Daniel Clowes's classic. (With any luck, we might also see in the near future another Moore masterpiece, 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', brought to the big screen, as well as Frank Miller's groundsbreaking 'Batman - Year One'). Having been lucky enough to be in NY at precisely the time these two movies came out, I was thrilled to see the novels on which they were based in book stores... Some say comics is dead; i think it's just heading into a new phase.
0446310786|5.0|Alright, I'm only going to say this once.  You better be listening because I'm not going to repeat myself.  I have only one thing to say about this novel and it is this.  Quite simply, this is the finest, greates, the best American novel ever written.  The sad truth, it is Harper Lee's only.  If one person is capable of such art and beauty, you want them to write every word in their head.  Alas, no.  But that's it, there is no greater American novel, and I will argue with anyone who dares to prove to me otherwise.  It is the classic tale of growing and learning life.  Facing tragedy and coming face to face with discovery.  It is about innocence lost and innocence that stolen.  It is about the indominable human spirit deep within us all.  IT IS THE BEST AMERICAN NOVEL EVER WRITTEN!!!
B00005JL3A|1.0|This film was, I'm sorry, [really bad]. I just can't see a point to it. In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.<br />Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theatre, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick). Seeing a guy being sliced into a hundred little pieces isn't scary, it's repulsive. There IS a difference, you know. Two thumbs down.
B00004XQ83|5.0|One of the best not just soundtracks, but albums. It's phenomenal.<br />#1. Po Lazarus - What's great about this is that it is a real chain gang chopping wood in the 1950's.  Sure, you can have the inmate extras do it, but here's the authenticity and careful planning that went tino this soundtrack.<BR>#2. Big Rock Candy Mountain - Not for the kids.  My grandfather left out the good parts when he sang it to me whenI was child.  It's a great hobo theme song.  <BR>#3. You Are My Sunshine - Boy oh boy, I hope no one is disappointed when you hear all fot his song, not just the familiar chorus.  The pinnacle of old timey music.<BR>#4. Down To The River To Pray - Just a wonderfully melodic acapellea gospel tune.  I love this, it's one of my favorites.  Alison Krauss has a phenomenal voice.<BR>#5. I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow - First rough cut.  Not a bad version.  It gets better though.<BR>#6. Hard Time Killing Floor Blues - Damn, this is what the blues are all about.  Sorrowful lyrics, morose chords and guitar strumming and Chris has an excellent voice.<BR>#7. I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow - Just filler music, but I have no complaints.<BR>#8. Keep On The Sunny Side - Another one of those signature old timey classic.s<BR>#9. I'll Fly Away - Oh, this one is special.  Beautufil duet with Alison and Gillian.  So pretty, subtle and gentle gospel tune.<BR>#10. Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby - Just dirty and seductive and very enticing.  Gentle grooves, subtley funky.<BR>#11. In The Highways - Cute little praise nubmer and the girls do a great job.<BR>#12. I Am Weary (Let Me Rest) - Beautiful, beautiful singing, love the accompaniment.  Another great old timey classic.<BR>#13. I Am A Man OF Constant Sorrow - More filler, but no complaining here.<BR>#14. O Death - Truly inspired performane of a great dark and almost sinister song.<BR>#15. In The Jailhouse Now - Who would've thought that Tim Blake could really sing and that he has a heavenly voice.  This is a funny old story song.  I love it.<BR>#16. I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow - This is the one everyone knows and loves.  It's great.  It's country meets the blues.  Great lyrics, great rhythm backing, deep country beat, great song.<BR>#17. Indian War Whoop - Great blue grass, foot stompin' fiddle tune.  Great little number.<BR>#18. Lonesome Valley - I love this song, very clean acapella number.  Perfect harmonies.  <BR>#19. Angel Band - Great song and a great ending to this one of a kind music experience.  <br />All in all, this is phenomenal music.  Buy this and listen to it then wear a groove in it so you have to buy another one and listen to that one that much too.  It's just the perfect soundtrack, and great, for such a great movie.
B000002U88|4.0|America was deep in economic recession when this record came out in 1982. The \\"Global Economy\\" was just beginning to emerge, taking jobs away from Detroit's auto workers. While Springsteen's Nebraska is usually listed as the  work which best addressed the country's doubts at the time, I believe that Bob Seger came closer to getting it right: People WERE sad and scared, but they were also highly pissed off!<br />     \\"Making Thunderbirds,\\" \\"Boomtown Blues\\" and even \\"Little Victories\\" perfectly capture their righteous anger, but \\"Roll Me Away\\" is the classic here: A song obstensibly about escaping a dead-end town on a Harley and never looking back, it might just as well be talking about the abandonment of the American work ethic - and its accompanying values - by our people. But, in the end, the singer realizes that to abandon his home is also abandoning what he stands for. And so he starts back home, to \\"get it right.\\" <br />     The Distance is NOT a Night Moves, or Stranger In Town, but the addition of Roy Bittan (of Springsteen's E Street band) opens up the arrangements of the songs in ways not possible before.  And the writing here has a true sense of wistfullness to it, as if Seger realized that the world he grew up in was leaving town for good...
B00003CXA6|5.0|Don't let the length intimidate you.  Don't be deterred by the fact that Ted Turner produced this for television.  Yes, it was supposed to be a miniseries, but Turner and director Ronal F. Maxwell were so proud of their work and so confident of the accuracy of the retelling of Shaara's novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; and the actual Battle of Gettysburg that they released it in theatres instead.  And this is one of those rare movies that was destined and deserved nothing less than the silver screen.  A few names jump out at you right away: Martin Sheen in his most inspired and meaningful performance, just breathing life and artistry into the character of Robert E. Lee.  Tom Berenger was never more perfectly cast than as the Alabamian James Longstreet.  Honestly, perfect.  Jeff Daniels was exciting and energetic as Joshua Chamberlain, a relative of mine, no kidding, and he is truly awe inspiring, the way he comes from no military background and leads his men in superb order, just as good as any of the career soldiers.  And finally, special guest appearance by Sam Elliot.  Special guest appearance???  Elliot's guest appearance as the underlauded and underappreciated John Buford was forceful and personal.  Not only did Buford hold the ground for the approaching Union Army, but Elliot held down the film until Sheen, Berenger and Daniels took over the movie.  The cinematography is beautiful, the locations are truly majestic.  The score is wonderful, fusing the guitars in with a symphonic orchestra.  The costumes and the way in which they were worn and preferred by different officers is very true to form.  The performances are wonderful, full of intellegient reenactors who know what they're doing.  Please, don't let the lenght intimidate you.  You're not just learning about the battle here.  The more important thing here is the commaradery felt between men on both sides and the men on the different sides, highlighted by the touching depcitions of pre-war friendship ofLo Armistead and Winfield Scott Hancock.  Some fought for rights, others fought for mere pride, others fought because it seemed lke the right thing to do.  But what you learn by the end of this movie is that the only thing they were fighting for, was each other.
0553801481|5.0|If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would.I agree this is a fantastic story continuing with Fitz, Nighteyes,the <BR>Fool, and some new characters.

I have read quite a few writers in this genre, but Ms. Hobb's style is the BEST.
B00006DEF9|5.0|It's the greatest musical movie of all time.  It's the greatest movie soundtrack of all time.  It's Gene Kelly's best performance and Donald O'Connor's break out and best performance.  I love this movie, in part because I recently played Don Lockwood on the stage.  It was the most fun I have ever had.  It is one hell of a fun movie, one of the most romantic movies of all time, one of the just plain greatest stories and bar none one of the five funniest films of all time.  Don't just get this DVD or the video, but please, do yourself a favor and get the CD soundtrack and listen to it when you can't watch the movie.  You'll be all the better for it.
B0000028W9|5.0|More gems from Leonard Cohen. This album has a strong warning for the future, with a note of despair for the Orwellian future, which we seem faced with. The album is a little angrier and more brooding, but never with the bitter, nihilistic cant, that some other artists (such as Rodriguez) have spoiled their work with.<br />Cohen, unlike some of the others, always expresses love for humankind, rather than bitterness and honestly expresses the world a she sees it, rather than trying too hard to be anti-establishment just for the sake of it. There is maturity in his work, lacking in some others, who attempt similar themes.<br />The Future: Cohen warns of a dark, revolutionary, totalitarian, evil, Orwellian and Leninist future, where all norms of decency and compassion have broken down.<br />\\" There'll be the breaking of the ancient<br />Western code.<br />Your private life will suddenly explode.<br />There'll be phantoms<br />There'll be fires on the road<br />And the white man dancing<br />You'll see the woman hanging upside down<br />Her features covered by her falling gown<br />And all the lousy little poets<br />Coming round<br />Trying to sound like Charlie Manson'<br />This was written in 1992, just after the fall of totalitarian regimes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.<br />Hope for a free world, a triumph of liberal democracy was great.<br />Ten years later it seems the hope of then, has turned into a nightmare now.<br />Political correctness has crippled free thought; we are forgetting the distinction between good and evil. We are faced with a wave of terror around the world by Islamic fundamentalists (Remember September 11?); backed by Leninist revolutionaries and few are taking the steps necessary to oppose them head on.<br />Tiny democratic Israel is under attack from bloodthirsty Arab terror, and most of the world sides with the Arab killers. The world claims to care about human rights but then gives the greatest tyranny in the world today, Red China, the 2008 Olympic Games.<br />Families are breaking down, family values are under assault.

B000002LPD|5.0|Their music was never great, never anything special, just very popular and fan favorite.  Then this came along out of nowehre.  Poundcake is the hardest rocking song they ever recorded.  Right Now is very social commentary oriented.  Top Of The World and Run Around are just fun.  Pleasure Dome is great, 316 is probably the best guitar instrumental since Classic Gas.  The Dream Is Over is beautiful like poetry, Sammy's vocals shine on that track.  It's their best, highlighted by probably their best song Right Now.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Limp Bizkit really produced a good album here. This is the REAL Bizkit. Songs like Nookie (which is arguably the best song produced by Limp Bizkit)and Break Stuff lay down Limp Biskits style. The lyrics are better than 3 dollar bill and Chocolate Whatever. More personal sounding. This group rocks.<BR>     I also heard that Wes Borland sucks at guitar becuase he has no technique. I don't care about technique, and I dont care about technique cuz its what it sounds like that matters. You don't WATCH Wes Borland play guitar when you listen to the album so who cares? It just sounds good. I would recomend this CD over the other two. It is more solid then the rest and is true LB style.
B000002MUQ|3.0|Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do is a classic Van Halen rock song.  I Can't Stop Loving You is sappy and corny as hell.  And who the hell is Ray anyway?  Not Enough is the best song and Baluchitherium is next.  Amsterdam is terrible and Big Fat Money is just plain bad.  This is another clear case of &quot;Oh, how the mighty have fallen.&quot;
B00005JKNF|2.0|IT'S EASY FOR SOMEONE TO LOOK AT THIS FILM AND SAY IT'S WELL MADE. BUT HOW CAN SUCH A BORING FILM BE CONSIDERED 'WELL MADE' WHEN IT DOESN'T EVEN DO IT'S JOB. YES A MOVIE HAS A JOB, AND THAT JOB IS TO ENTERTAIN. I WAS NOT ENTERTAINED. I'M OF THE OPINION THAT ANYONE THAT WAS ENTERTAINED BY THIS MOVIE, COULD ALSO BE ENTERTAINED BY WATCHING PAINT DRY. AFTER I WATCHED GOSFORD PARK I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT MUST OF BEEN A BAD YEAR FOR MOVIES. BECAUSE IF THIS WAS AMONG THE BEST FIVE FILMS (OSCARS) OF 2001, I SERIOUSLY NEED TO LISTEN TO MORE MUSIC.
B000002TPS|3.0|Reckoning Day is good, Train Of Consequences is great.  Addicted To Chaos is the hardest song.  Victory is a great use of all the old song titles.  Other than that, this sucks.  Black Curtains and Youthanasia sound exactly the same.  A Tout le Monde is slow and boring.  What's the deal with the French?  Family tree is just not good, i never lsitened to all of that song and I still haven't.  Black Curtains isn't bad, but it isn't enough to pull the album up out of the muck.  Thank God Cryptic Writings was a return to form.  Just kind of skip over this album and go right on from Countdown to Cryptic.
B00006690G|5.0|I have never been a big rap or hip-hop fan but I love Eminem. I have listened to nothing but this CD for the last two weeks. The only song I dont like is Drips. All the other songs are amazing. I do believe he is an inspiration to never give up. And he just really love Hailie . And he isn't afraid of showing a softer side on this CD which I think makes this his best CD yet. He definitely will make you cry and smile also. I love him!!
B000000XB9|5.0|Everyone of these songs on here is great, from the eleven minute epic to their signature, and best song, is Proud Mary.  Creedence Clearwater Revival is one of the greatest bands ever.  John Fogerty is one of the best songwriters ever.  It's a shame the fate he had to suffer, not getting the right to any of his own songs.  Great protest songs such as Run Through The Jungle highlight this, the best of their career.  Who'll Stop The Rain and Have You Ever Seen The Rain are the best of their slower ballad-ish songs.  My favorite song is the up beat, even more of a protest song, Fortunate Son.  very meaningful.  Up Around The Bend and Down On The Corner are staples of rock radio and everyone's classic rock favorites.  This receives my highest recommendation.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Unless you're a gaming freak who's played Resident Evil 24/7 and watched this film expecting every single detail to match up to the game, I find it hard to believe how anyone could not find this film at the very least thoroughly entertaining. The story which is pretty simple goes like this. An underground research facility has been experimenting with DNA and doing dangerous and illegal testing on animals. The facility which is run by a computer shuts down and traps all of the employees inside and a virus breaks loose killing everyone instantly. Flash forward to Alice (played by Milla Jovovich) who wakes up alone in a mansion only to discover she has no clue who she or anyone else is. An army like swat team (including Michelle Rodriguez) breaks into the mansion, informs her that she used to be one of them and forces her and a mysterious man named Matt (played by Eric Mabius) to come along to inspect what's gone on in the lab. Soon they find themselves dying one by one and fighting for survival against zombies, mutant animals and monsters. This is one of those films you have to over look it's premise and watch with an open mind, but in the end what you get is a rewarding kick ...action / horror film with some amazing special effects and some sufficiant scares. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who desires some good thrills and lots of detailed gore. Similar to the video game, this movie is not to be watched alone and is filmed with many of the storylines and scenes taken from this game. I suggest watching this DVD twice. First watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is and then watch it with the hilarious commentary on provided by the film makers, Milla and Michelle who give alot of behind the scenes info about the frame to frame sequences they shot that were taken from the game. Also discussed is their time spent in Germany while making the film, the training that went into the fighting sequences and what to expect from the highly anticipated sequel. ... Witha great score by Marilyn Manson this loud, in your face flick is possibly the best movie made from a video game ever. Alot better than Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. For those who didn't like it, give it a second chance and watch it with an open mind.
B000002HMH|2.0|No, Metallica did not sell out.  They merely changed their style at a time when everyone else was doing the same thing, nothing to get in a stink over.  But, it sucks.  They tried to change their style like everyone else and they failed miserably.  This is a ridiculously overrated album and I'm just glad that most of my friends who once liked it are finally coming around.
0446310786|5.0|In post 9/11 21st America, kids can't go two feet without holding their parents hands. If they do, they risk rape and mutilation at the hands of the products of late 20th century political correctness. Harper Lee's brilliant novel gives us a view of what is what like at the other end of the pendulum swing, and lets us see what life was like back then - through the eyes of a very young, precocious tomboy named Scout. All of the ills that plague our society are there... rape, prejudice, fear of the unknown, and just plain meanness. Ms. Lee confronts these ills, but leads you slowly through a gentile, scenic picture of Maycomb County, Alabama during the Great Depression.<br />I was first introduced to this story by watching the movie on TV in the late 1960's and was fascinated with the story from the children's point of view. Later, when reading the novel in the 10th grade I realized that Ms. Lee had given us a compelling masterpiece dealing with crime, ignorance, prejudice, innocence, and community that stands out as one of the most enduring classics of the last century. Children were still allowed to be children back then. We follow the adventures of Scout, her older brother Jem, and their friend Dill until their adventures bring us into the rape trial of Tom Robinson, a black man being defended by her father. It is against the backdrop of the a 1930s rape trial that we are introduced to Atticus Finch, one of the best written father figures to ever spring from the mind of an author. His client is a black man accused of raping a white woman. It is through his relationship with his children that we experience the need to transcend social injustice with courage and compassion. The dialect of the characters, the colorful locals, and the rhythm and pace of the story is perfect. It is seasoned with humor, suspense, and some of the most wonderfully entertaining narrative prose I have ever read. I just re-read this book for the 15th time, and still highly recommend. Whetheryou're 15 or 95, To Kill A Mockingbird is still a sensational reading experience. After reading To Kill a Mockingbird you'll wish we had more people like Atticus Finch to make us feel safe and protected.

0792163710|5.0|This is a great morality play and as such it is possible to ritualize the scenes. The first great western to be made. I saw it when it first came out and it was new ground for a western. When Jack Palance shot Elisha Cook the noise rang through the theater. This is in my view is not only the greatest western but the greatest film of all time. Music was great, no weak spots. Every part is excellently played.
1857993284|3.0|I think that Jostein Gaarder has achieved one of his goals: to write an introduction to philosophy. He has constructed the book as part fiction, part non-fiction. Sophie, the main character, gets disturbing mail she has not asked for: a correspondence course in philosophy! To her great surprise, she finds the letters very interesting. This is the part where I think Gaarder has succeded. The correspondence course is well written, especially about the older philosophers and philosophies. If you are looking for an introduction to philosophy, this is a very good start. It can also be useful if you &quot;simply&quot; wish to brush up your common knowledge. Gaarder is a teacher, and it shows (in a good way in this part). <br />However, the story surrounding the correspondence course is not that well written, in my opinion. This is not a work of an author who wishes to tell a story, to relate to mankind etc. The story is in a sense skilfully developed, but that is not enough to create a really, really good read. I think that Gaarder fails to create trustworthy characters. The reader does not identify with them (at least I did not, and I had the same problem with Das Kartengesheimnis). There is also in some places a strange lack of empathy between the characters.<br />That Gaarder does not write that good fiction, in my opinion, does not mean that this is not a very good book, and I still recommend it.
6305499365|5.0|My dad recommended I see this film and, at my first viewing, I had no expectations. Little did I know that I would be watching what has since become one of my favourite films of all time. I've probably watched it about 15 times since and each time I enjoy it more and more. Stephen Root's role as the googly-eyed stapler-obsessed Milton is one of the funniest characters ever brought to the screen. Office Space is such a unique film. It's humour is relentless and gives your diaphragm a good workout as you helplessly roll about splitting your sides with laughter. I've since shared this film with my mother who loved it just as much as me. I ended up giving her my copy and buying another for myself. Such is this film. It is addictive, lighthearted relief from what can sometimes be a very mundane life.

B000002N3J|5.0|This is, in my opinion, Madonna's greatest compilation thus far. Granted, Madonna's vocal range is rather limited, but that is what makes this collection near perfect. She may not have the chords of Whitney or Mariah, but they aren't known for emotional performances. But, that is where Madonna delivers: her emotional performance. What she doesn't have in range/octaves, she more than makes up for with the emotion that she consistenly evokes into her music, most noteably, her ballads. On another, more cynical, note..<br />Yes, I gave this collection 5 stars, but there are a few mis-steps regarding the song selection. For instance, the inclusions of the inspid &quot;One More Chance,&quot; the thrown together &quot;Forbidden Love,&quot; and the useless instrumental of &quot;I Want You,&quot; are rather wasteful, when more, meaningful material such as &quot;Promise to Try,&quot; &quot;Spanish Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Love Tried to Welcome Me&quot; could've easily outshone the former, respectively. <br />But, as a whole, this is a great collection for anyone that appreciates emotional, and meaningful pop music.
B000067CPX|5.0|When i heard this new album i LOVED it, it is FANTASTIC! You are hearing this from a #1 Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. This is diffenitly one of there best albums, along with Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Trust me, this is a GREAT album that any person that even some what likes the Red Hot Chili Peppers will LOVE. <BR>  i recommend this album to anyone! i say that this album is DREAMING! but i know i won't have to worry about any of you disliking THIS Red Hot Chili Peppers album, or ANY of the Red Hot Chili Peppers albums! <BR>They are the #1 band in the entire world!
B000002KLP|5.0|If I had to describe this album with two words, those would be: pure and unadulterated. Yes, folks, I'm speaking of a Prince release. This is Prince at (one of...) his best. There's gender bending. Race relating. An incestuous rendezvous (&quot;Sister,&quot; a rather disturbing yet campy track). All is to be had on this album. This is Prince before the stardom. Before the distractions. This is Prince uncensored. <br />Enjoy!
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the freshest, most original movie I have seen in years. Just when my dislike of France had been almost perfected, this film comes along and makes me think they might just have a reason or two to be so snotty and superior. From the opening childhood scenes to the climaxes of discovery (I loved who the man in the photos turned out to be) there was absolutely nothing about this movie I did not like. Most DVDs should be rentals - you watch them once and then they gather dust on the shelf - but I'm sure I'll be watching this one for years to come. Did I mention how much I liked this movie?
B0000029LG|3.0|This is an oddly put together compilation. Yes, many of his classics are there. But, where's &quot;Smooth Criminal,&quot; &quot;In the Closet,&quot; &quot;Dirty Diana,&quot; &quot;Liberian Girl,&quot; &quot;Give in to Me&quot;? Not to mention others. For some odd reason, they compacted his mindblowing career into one disc, when in fact, the 2 discs could've been used to cover a complete retrospective of his adult solo career. The first disc seems rather incomplete. <br />Instead of releasing a second disc with all new material, Sony should've released HIStory as a strictly greatest hits compilation, as I had mentioned above. In addition, they should've released the second disc as a seperate, full studio album shortly thereafter. Coupling the feel good hits of the first disc with the angst driven &quot;leave me alone, I'm fragile&quot; songs of the second disc just seems, odd. <br />Don't get me wrong. I believe that the second disc is worth the price of admission. Sure, it's self-indulgent. Yes, it's masturbatory, in many senses. But, this is the only time (spanning his career) that Michael lifts the shield, and lets the public take a peak into the life of MJ. The torment. The scandals. He speaks rather candidly, actually. <br />It's too bad that they hadn't released the discs seperately. The second will, and has, been pitted against the first, and really, there is no comparison.
B00003CXI0|5.0|Great Film! I loved everything to the last bit. I though the acting was the best with an allstar performance from the adult vets to the young newcomers. I especially liked Daniel Radcliffe who played Harry. He's so cute and I just want to eat him up to peices.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|This film is a visual feast, especially the shots in the lush jungles of Cambodia. Considering the plot of the film has its roots in a video game, the film does admirably well... but it does take itself a little seriously.<br />The orphaned child of a wealthy, world-famous archeologist, Lara Croft lives the life of Batman... a stately mansion/castle w/ intensely loyal servants and a cavalcade of one-of-a-kind gizmos and James-Bond-esque weapons and gadgets, not to mention a garage full of Jaguars, Porsches and BMW's.<br />Mysterious dreams and/or voices in her head draw Lara to a forgotten relic in a storage space under the stairs which turns out to be the key to a device that controls time and space. Naturally, super villains seek to get the relic and learn how to use it, turning Lara Croft into a buxom Indiana Jones on a globe-trotting adventure with booby-traps, exotic locales and animated stone statues.<br />Much of the story is totally perposterous, so you make yourself escape, acknowledging that this is totally a fantasy... then you have actors and scenes and dialogue that treat the film as though it were a documentary... much of the film is way over-acted, forced and downright cheesy.<br />Despite silly cliche scenes, Angelina Jolie pulls off the character as a feminine, sexy, butt-kicking machine. Sadly, the filmmakers felt obliged to show her in a white cotton dress at the end of the film to underscore her feminine side. It was trite and almost insulting... but then again, so was a great percentage of this movie.<br />The amount of cheese will ensure you will not be calcium deficient, but the action is entertaining and enjoyable.<br />The DVD makes the movie that much more enjoyable by packing in a lot of features, including deleted scenes and behind the scenes footage of the special effects highlights.
B00005N83M|3.0|As far as her singing, I really don't know what all the hype is about J-Lo's.  Sure Im proud to say that she's a beautiful and successful puertorican woman, but to tell you the truth if it wasn't for the background music, J-Lo's cd's wouldn't be so popular.  Her voice is so ORDINARY.  Don't get me wrong, I really love the music(which of course is someone else's talent---the songwriter) and I love dancing to it, but she cannot hold a note or change her pitch AND her voice does not sound fresh or cute or sexy like let's say Aaliyah or Brandy or Beyonce or Ashanti or even Pink!!!(You get the picture!!!).........
B000002HRE|1.0|Whether or nor Metallica has \\"sold out\\" over the years really isn't relevant to this review.  Remember how the sequel to many movies isn't as good as the original?  Well, \\"Load\\" wasn't any good either, so you can imagine how \\"Reload\\" must sound.<br />\\"Where has all--the talent gone?--Long time passing...\\"  If you manage to sit through an entire session of \\"Reload,\\" you might have actually begun to think that the Kingston Trio added another member and a bass.  This music is so safe and harmless that I'm surprised the Moral Majority isn't lobbying to have our national anthem changed to \\"The Memory Remains.\\"<br />\\"Fuel\\" barely has a flicker of the flame Metallica has displayed in the past, and would you believe that it's the most energetic song on the album?  Speed isn't necessarily important, but you gotta have the \\"oomph\\" to make the music stick.  Well, \\"Reload\\" has \\"oomph,\\" but it sounds more like the grunt of somebody being pummeled in the gut.  \\"The Memory Remains\\" has a familiar rhythm, doesn't it?  It should.  Sounds an awful lot like \\"The God that Failed.\\"<br />Well, I'm not exactly sure God could have saved this album from four guys bent on sounding like a cross between an anemic Metallica, the Brian Setzer Orchestra, and the Kingston Trio, but you can certainly save yourself some pain and some cash by refusing to buy this album.
B000069HKH|4.0|First things first:  It's ridiculous to have to say this, but Springsteen isn't \\"capitalizing\\" on the events of Sept. 11th any more than he was capitalizing on the plight of Vietnam veterans when he wrote \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\"  If a popular artist is accused of selling out or taking advantage of people every time he forges an emotional connection with his audience, the very idea of creating art is moot.  Britney Spears shakes her chest and rear-end in front of fifth graders for millions of dollars a year, and this guy's integrity gets questioned?  Please.<br />That said, \\"The Rising\\" certainly isn't perfect, but it's as solid as any Springsteen album since \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" and its best songs are as compelling as anything in his catalogue.  I agree that a few of the tunes sound rushed.  Lyrically, \\"Empty Sky,\\" \\"Countin' on a Miracle,\\" and \\"Further on (Up the Road),\\" aren't particularly thrilling.  They're the kind of well-intentioned, half-finished songs that you might find on a Bruce bootleg.  \\"Worlds Apart,\\" with its Middle Eastern vocals, is also iffy, although it ends with a searing guitar solo that nearly saves it.  <br />But there's a lovely, prayerful quality to many of the other tunes.  (That's the idea behind the oft-denigrated chanting choruses, folks.  The Beatles used to do it, too.)  \\"My City of Ruins\\" is nothing less than a gospel song.  I get goose bumps every time I hear it.  The same goes for \\"Nothing Man,\\" \\"You're Missing,\\" \\"Paradise,\\" and \\"The Rising.\\"  They're remarkable tunes, small masterpieces of sorrow and empathy.  As usual, Springsteen brings a novelist's eye for detail to his work, and the results are often overwhelming.  <br />He also includes three charmingly upbeat songs that celebrate life in the midst of tragedy.  \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" and \\"Mary's Place\\" could have easily found a home on \\"The River.\\"  But the biggest surprise is a soulful little confection called \\"Let's Be Friend's (Skin to Skin)\\" that's intentionally derivative while being catchy as hell.  It's unlike anything Springsteen has ever recorded, and, in a strange way, is as impressive as the dramatic songs.  I find myself returning to it over and over again, but I'm sure hardcore fans who feel like they own the guy will be happy to hate it.  It would make a great single, if people still bought singles. <br />Take it from a New Yorker who stood on the roof of his apartment building and watched the twin towers burn-  this album aims for the heart, and, more often than not, reaches its mark with subdued grace and beauty.  It's another step in a healing process that won't be over for a long time, and Springsteen deserves a lot of credit for addressing the situation with such dignity.  It's been said before, and it should be said again:  you can call him The Boss, but he really works for us.  Buy the album, and pay him the attention he so richly deserves.
0684874350|5.0|I started out reading Angela's Ashes this summer for my Senior Advanced Placement english class next year.  At first, I only had the intent of reading this book because it was assigned, but I ended up wanting to read it and I absolutely loved this book!  Frank McCourt tells the story of his &quot;miserable Irish Catholic childhood&quot; with humor, love, and forgiveness.  It is a story that won't be forgotten.  I loved this book and I strongly recommend it to anybody!
B000002G7E|4.0|According to Lou Reed and John Cale, the sound engineer on WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT actually left the studio during the performance of &quot;Sister Ray,&quot; telling the band &quot;Just let me know when it's over.&quot;  This reaction is typical.  Most listeners will despise the recording; few will ever listen to it all the way through; fewer still will listen to it more than once.  And even many Velvet Underground fans consider it an abomination.<br />In fact, The Velvet Underground's WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT might best be described as a musical migraine.  It reeks of sea-sick rythmns, half-heard lyrics, and squalling guitars.  There is absolutely nothing likable about it.  So why then is it so famous?  Two reasons, really.  First, the entire point of the recording is to be a musical migraine, and in this absolutely everything about the work is entirely successful.  Second, WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT lays the groundwork for everything from 1970s punk to 1990s grunge--and by and large outdoes all of them and probably will continue to outdo all of them for as long as the recording exists.  These facts, however, do not make it musically accessible to most listeners.  Even fans of the hardest &quot;noisy&quot; bands will probably have difficulty with WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT, and in hindsight the members of The Velvet Underground themselves consider the recording a failure--partly because of various engineering failures and partly because it is too representative of the chaos in their private and public lives at the time and so is more than a little self-indulgent.<br />Do I recommend this for the casual listener?  NO.  Absolutely not.  On the other hand, if you are comfortable purchasing something with the clear expectation that you probably won't like it--you might actually be one of the rare people who can survive and actually enjoy this nihlistic sonic assault.  Even so, brace yourself.  It's a twisted, jarring, and chaotic ride.
B000066F6H|1.0|I got hives last week, and rather than go to a skin doctor, I decided to pick this up. It was not at all useful. The words were often indecipherable. When I could make things out, they had little or not relevance to proper skin care.
B00005RHGK|4.0|This was definately the freakiest movie I've ever seen, but the ending is so horrible that...I dunno!  The basic plot is Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother, Darry (Justin Long) are driving home from college when their car almost gets plowed by a huge truck (but not a cemi).  They calm down and go on their way after the whole thing, and then they drive by a church where they see the occupant of the same truck throwing bodies down a pipe that leads underground.  They soon go back to investigate after being run off the road AGAIN and because of their stupid move, they are now being trailed by a winged, muscular, supernatural flesh-eating demon, the Creeper (Jonathan Breck).  A really scary movie, buy it on DVD.
B000050XY8|5.0|if u did not own matrix dvd, get this boxset. for me, it is worth every single cent. the movie itself is also highly watchable although the story might be a bit blur. but sound and picture quality is great!!
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya has definitely knocked another one out of the park. I totally love A Day Without Rain.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|This movie is based on a computer game. the story is nice and Angelina Jolie did a great job. quite exciting. it is worth talking a look.
B000060P79|5.0|narley CD! Im a big Blink 182 fan and i heard that mark hoppus sings on this album so i bought it jsut so see. But then i gave it a listen and simple plan is awsome!

B000002J1O|5.0|In the often disposable world of popular music it's tough to find the works that can endure. After all, the stuff that lasts demands craft and balance and taste: characteristics that pop stardom can always do without.<br />When Genesis wrote and recorded &quot;Selling England&quot;, they produced one for the ages. I think it's the definitive record for them. The music is brilliantly conceived and played. From the perfect guitar work on &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; to the virtuoso drumming of &quot;Cinema Show&quot; to the lyrics that manage to sustain brilliant and sometimes cutting puns, &quot;Selling England&quot; is nothing short of perfect.<br />Here, the group plays wonderfully scored and arranged music as an almost orchestral unit, highly original and all their own. Importantly, every member of the group is equal and essential to the music.  &quot;Selling England&quot; itself leans to classical structures, with careful thematic  development and variation no where more compelling and enjoyable than &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;. This high degree of thematic development is also found in the lyrics. Air-tight variations like &quot;Up, up above the crowds, inside their Silver Clouds&quot; from &quot;Epping Forest&quot; are not only brilliantly funny, they're consistently great across all the songs. This is priceless stuff, and what is important about the lyrical development is the fact that Genesis never gets off subject. The puns aren't isolated little moments thrown in as a distraction. Instead, punning is sustained and becomes the central lyric style.<br />Some people favor &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;. That record and the ideas behind it have some shining moments, but nothing else that Genesis ever did comes up to the level of finish you'll hear on &quot;Selling England&quot;. With its far-ranging but perfectly controlled social observation and commentary, amazing writing and playing, more fool any Genesis fan, or progressive music collection, without it.t it.
B00000F14B|5.0|I was a kid when i first saw Robert Preston on Broadway.  When i heard he was also going to do the movie i was even more excited. What a wonderful actor.  Now we are blessed with the DVD version which is equally as stunning in scope and grandur.When this reopened on Broadway i saw it again and the actor that played Harold Hill was stunning.  He even looked like Robert Preston and if you close your eyes you would swear it was his voice too.By all means buy this Warner Brothers musical. They did a wonderful job and is almost word for word of the Broadway versions which usually is never the case. This is talent at it's very best and of course Shirly Jones is outstanding. She has graced so many of our classic musicals with total style. EXCELLENT!
B00005JKL8|3.0|I really wanted to like the movie more than I did. The premise is promising but as the story unfolded, I realized that nearly every clich&eacute; used in war movies appear here. The two that got on my nerves were: the use of the ever-popular &quot;flashback&quot; and worst of all, the &quot;I'll put my American uniform on a dead guy and I'll escape in his Bosnian uniform&quot; moment. Wow. I saw that one coming from a MILE away! The plot is contrived, yet in some moments, pretty exciting.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is Bruce at his best. This album reflects the poetry and mature understanding of human emotion. Bruce Springsteen had  captured youthful angst in &quot;Born to Run&quot;. This album refelcts the collective grief of a nation since the events of September 11th. I defy anyone not to be moved by &quot; Into the Fire&quot; and &quot;Everything&quot;.<br />This album is a classic and will become a must have for future generations.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|At the suggestion of a close friend, I decided to go against my better judgement (I loved &quot;Gosford Park,&quot; just to give you some idea of how &quot;against my better judgement&quot; this was) and watched this film. I started hating it with a passion almost immediately, as soon as John Leguizamo (what a waste of his comic talent!) started lisping and Ewan McGregor sang &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; For the opening sequence, in the Moulin Rouge, especially, but also for the whole movie, the cameramen must have been working under the influences of amphetamines or something, because the camera moved so quickly I thought I would puke. I tried to sit through it, and succeeded, but it was difficult because of a problem (for me) that repeats throughout the movie, and it is this: I'm sure that I'm not the only one who has trouble watching men in top hats and tailcoats waving there hats and white gloves, singing, &quot;Here we are now, entertain us!&quot; Kidman's performance of the various &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; numbers was passing, but still unbearable. Maybe, just maybe, if the writers had enough creativity and vision to actually write original songs (what a thought!), the movie might have been far better, because we would always be waiting to see what kind of song was coming up next, as opposed to knowing for a fact that it would be some over-blown classic. And poor Ewan McGregor, obviously straining his tenor's falsetto on camera! What an embarrassment. <br />But, there was one redeeming quality to this movie, one thing that kept it from being completely awful, and that was its eagerness to please. It was endearing, and this was the only conceivable reason to explain how I sat through the whole mess.
0767802470|5.0|There's a lot of good comments about this film, so I will just add a relatively short personal comment.<br />Most of the WWII films glorify the Allies, with the recent exceptions being made by 'Saving Private Ryan' and some where war atrocities are shown to be commited by either side.<BR>Hence, the really great war films are the ones that becomes more objective rather than subjective: for soldiers and civilians caught up in the frontlines of war, good and evil are relative terms, not absolute.<br />This movie shows the war as it is in the front felt by the foot soldiers, not by generals or great commanders sitting behind some wooden desks and in solid bunkers: hence, the movie becomes less political. Moreover, the Nazi high command are despised by submarine officers due to the ignorant orders of their commanders. Also, for the submariners, any sea-seasoned men are their potential friend even though they may have to face each other in the field of battle: this is shown when the U boat emerges on to a scene where they just torpedoed an allied tanker. The sailors are crying help from the burning ship and the German officers want to help them, only to be turned down by the steely captain who contains his helplessness by saying that they are not allowed to take prisoners. An officers sobs as the whole staff sees the blazing see covered with burning oil consume the sailors one by one.<br />It is this kind of humane expressions of the U boat crew that begins to endow life into subjects that may be just considered as lifeless robots in the form of loyal Nazi soldiers: you know, many old movies about WWII easily justifies the killing the Axis soldiers by not portraying who they really were. Just as Allied soldiers who died in the line of duty came from many walks of life, many Axis soldiers were also those kind of people who died serving their country, although the Axis leaders were clearly in the wrong and they were the ones to be punished to the extreme.<br />Politics go through the window once life and death situations arise as in a battle, and for many seasoned soldiers, they know that politics are like useless drugs that drive fresh, young, ignorant and willing men into their certain deaths. By having experienced officers mixed with fresh, young crew, the movie places the viewer at a crossroad where propaganda, nationalism, patriotism is invalid and only where survival, comradeship and longing to live to see another day is valid. This is more so when the background for battle is a confined steel cellar where pressure of death on the crew is as much as the pressure of water bearing on the canny submarine itself.<br />It is in this respect that the movie can be called one of the most greatest war movies of all the time despite portraying Germans in WWII. The movie shows what war is to a foot soldier in the front lines. If some more war movies were made like this...who knows. Polticians may not cry war that easily.
B00005MP58|5.0|I loved this movie.  It is very true to the wonderful book by Jane Austen.  The characters are very well developed and the acting is brilliant. <br />The movie is true to the times, the costumes are brilliant as are the sets.  Even my husband, who isn't usually a \\"period flick\\" lover, got hooked quickly on this DVD.  It is beautiful to watch and I quickly found myself caught up in whether Elizabeth and Mr Darcy would get together, even though I have read the book and knew full well the outcome!<br />This is a wonderful movie for a rainy weekend......it will make the time fly, with a combination of suspence, romance and humour!
B000067J1Y|5.0|This is one of the funniest films I've seen since....forever. Laughs are weaved into almost every second of the film so you are guaranteed a good time. A silly romantic comedy drawn to my attention with the knowledge of such a terrific cast. From Charlie Sheen to Ryan Stiles, this is a must-see and a must-have! If you like this one, be sure to check out Hot Shots part deux, which is equal in both laughs and love.

B00000055E|5.0|This cd, which wouldn't have ever come out if Tupac hadn't been killed, is better than that of most other rappers.  This cd just shows how much work Tupac put into his music.  These unreleased tracks are good enough to stand the test of time, which is rare.

B00005OAIE|4.0|You know that feeling right out of college (or high school), when you're grateful to be out, but scared to death at the same time cause you haven't got it all figured out yet the way you hoped you would?  For me, this CD pretty much encapsulates that feeling in one way or another.  John Mayer's reminds me a lot of how Dave Mathews might be if he create a CD while fresh out of school and suffering mid-twenties angst.  \\"No Such Thing\\" is probably my favorite track, because it really does have that I-just-got-out-of-school-and-figuring-out-what-I-want-to-do-now feel. Some of the other highlights:<br />- \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" is a great song about that sinking feeling after you say something really dumb on a date.<br />- \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" might seem like a rather benign love song, unless you really pay attention to it's sensual lyrics.<br />- \\"Neon\\" follows the familiar theme of unrequited love<br />- \\"'83\\" is a great track when you're hit with childhood nostalgia.<br />This guy's pretty talented, particularly if you like that guy playing the guitar in the coffee shop kind of music.  I'd recommend it to friends.
B000002G26|5.0|Ah... It's so much easier to review a 'greatest hits' album when you really aren't familiar with the work of the artist beyond that album. I bought this album after hearing it with my girlfriend, having never even HEARD of Bryan Adams, and it really grew on me, so much so that I had to track it down for myself.<br />Adams has a style to his music that I enjoy. The rock songs have the right amount of punch to them; there not so hard that they become ear-splitting, but the have enough beat to keep a listeners interest. The ballads might get sappy in places, but Adams sings them with a great deal of sincerity. Consequently, they are very enjoyable to listen to when you're feeling the need for sentimental music that really gets you in the heart.<br />This album does a particularly nice job mixing the rock tracks with the ballads. There are never too many rockers in a row, nor do the ballads pile up. The balance is one of the best features of this disc, especially since not all albums manage to stay so consistantly listenable.<br />Overall I reccomend this album to anyone interested is some good rock mixed with ballads. It certainly got me off on the right foot with Adams' music.
6300216365|5.0|Play It Again, Sam<br /> Don't forget this one!<br />As a fan of Woody Allen and \\"Casablanca\\", I can't believe it took me so long to see this movie.  And I'm a total fan of it.  A pre-Annie Hall teaming of Allen and Keaton, the story is about an insecure guy (big surprise) looking for love.  For support, he calls on the help an imaginary Bogart, who supplies plenty of \\"tough guy\\" advice.  The story has the many familiar Allen themes (love, marriage, and adultery) but it's really about learning to be comfortable in your own skin.  The movie is funny, charming, and an absolute delight even if you're only a moderate Woody Allen fan.
B000069CWE|4.0|Linkin Park's first CD, Hybrid Theory, was one of the best mixes of rap and rock on the planet, featuring great lyrics and excellent guitar and drum works. Reanimation, essentially a remix CD, adds to the greatness of the first CD by adding more tracks that weren't released, a bunch of new artists and DJ's into the mix, whom all add there own individual elements to an already great cd. Some of the lyrics were a bit drowned out but the music to them, but you could hear them fine for most of the cd. Definatley worth the purchase, especially if you missed the first album and want to jump on the Linkin Park bangwagon.
B00005O3VD|5.0|James Caan and Barbara Streisand are awesome together<br />This is a great movie.  I originally saw it because it was on AFI's 100 greatest romances.  And it is a great romance, because the movie's character's have the kind of chemistry of people who love each other, but also relentlessly get on each other's nerves (and if you've seen \\"Two For The Road or are a fan of Sam and Diane, then you know that those are some of the best stories).  Don't rent this is you're looking for the typical boy meets girl formula.  Rent this if you want to hear great music (I'm buying the soundtrack immediately) and see Barbra's awesome acting chops (her character, Fanny Bryce is the kinda hard-nosed girl who says everything you'd want to say) this is an absolute must-see.
0440224764|4.0|An attorney steals US$90 million from their partners, but is him a thief? As everything in life nothing is black and white and indeed Mr. Grisham does a superb work showing how in life nothing is what it seems in the surface. Granted, he relies to much in coincidence to explain parts of the plot, but what the hell, the reader knows it is buying a shallow work, not a Pulitzer Price masterpiece. So that sort of happy go lucky developments are to be expected.<br />In any case, the book provides what it offers, that is, a very interesting novel in which the reader is hooked to the book to see how the main character Patrick Lanigan, whether a crook or not, works his way out of the mess he and his girlfriend are in. Since the solutions are not made out of bullets, kicks and fists, but out of sheer strategy, it is almost impossible not to feel a large degree of emphaty with Lanigan.<br />Some people wonder why shall a &quot;thief&quot; be the hero of the novel. Well, (i) Lanigan just wants to beat the system (a very strong need in all of us) and (ii) most of his actions are oriented towards self defense against other persons who are  essentially dishonest.<br />However, the last two pages of the book are not really necessary, they do not make the plot smarter, are difficult to encopass with the smart personality of Mr. Lannigan, and are not made for this type of novels. They are a BIG mistake by the author.
B00005KFUM|5.0|LET me tell you something: Muse does not sound like Radiohead. And people who keep comparing the two bands are mistaken, because listening to Muse is a completely different musical experience.<br />It's something out of the ordinary, something utterly fantastic and musically rich.<br />Nothing can prepare you to what you are about to hear when playing a Muse record. And like me, you will probably feel really a-mused by the coolness and extreme of their second album &quot;Origin Of Symmetry&quot;.<br />The album saw the band come to new levels, making them one of the hottest and most talked about band on the British rock music scene, with critics describing them as creative and flamboyant.<br />It delivers 11 stunningly beautiful songs, beginning with &quot;New Born&quot;. featuring some wild and loud bass guitars.<br />From then on, the experience develops further into something intense and magnificent, as by the time you reach &quot;Hyper Music&quot; you will find yourself jumping up and about your room like you never ever did before. The song is one of the most hyper and blood-pumping you can find around these days. And frankly, its title tells all.<br />This would be followed by yet another great song &quot;Plug In Baby&quot;, which gives out quiet an interesting intro, and is a pure rocking endeavor. With &quot;Citizen Erased&quot;  and the melodic &quot;Screenanger&quot; the band once again explore a new angel and come up with another fascinating number.<br />The most rewarding song in the album however, must be the jazzy-tipped &quot;Feeling Good&quot; . It is certainly a great moment for rock music, as it provides the listener with &quot;good feeling&quot; throughout its three-plus minutes. The blend of piano sounds and bass and guitars and drums is remarkable, add to all that the tuneful and - yes- beautiful voice of Matthew Bellamy, is fabulously tremendous and perfect.<br />Bellmay's angelic voice soars at exactly the right moment for every song, giving every line its deserved attention.<br />I consider Muse to be a musical phenomenon in a sense that they have given us something we've not imagine we would get. Flamboyant music, filled with passion and electrifying sounds and some of most extraordinary, deep lyrics.<br />I believe the only way I can describe how I feel about Muse, is through one of their most popular lyrics, because that's how I exactly feel every time I listen to it:<br />&quot;Its a new dawn, its a new day, its a new life for me... and I'm feeling good.&quot;<br />&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; is quiet an achievement. Quiet a musical extravaganza. Quiet stunning, smashing, magnificent! Pure genius.deserved attention. <BR>I consider Muse to be a musical phenomenon in a sense that they have given us something we've not imagine we would get.

B0000640VO|4.0|A wonderful visual essay about how wonderful it is to be French: feeling sorry for someone who must eat borchst. But at the same time a caveat about how, as Al Bundy once so pithily put it, &quot;It is wrong to be French!&quot; That is, obsession with the past could leave one with &quot;brittle bones.&quot;<br />Or, an examination of activism vs. tragedy.<br />Etc, etc.
B000069CWE|5.0|i loved Hybrid Theory but was over with it after a year of heavy listening. This reanimation cd is incredible and all the songs sound different and sound very origional. the mixers did an excellent job by making cool sound effects and distortion effects. I love real Hip-Hop(underground) and this cd has some of the best underground rappers out there. Chali 2na, Planet Asia, Black Thought, Pharohe Monch,Zion and the list goes on. Get thiscd if u want good hip hop mixed with pulsating beats and guitar riffs.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I can only imagine that people who liked this are dreamers or tripping or are about to fry their last brain cell. This film was the worst I've ever seen. Hole in the plot you could drive a mack truck through. Naomi Watts was the only good thing about this film. Some thime films are a waste of time, but I trully regret seeing this one. A shocker.
B0000640VO|5.0|Supposedly charming movies I have hated:  \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" \\"Pretty Woman,\\" \\"Serendipity.\\"  Of course, serial infidelities and street prostitution *are* pretty delightful, so it's probably just me being a pill... <br />Instead of taking rather ugly situations and insisting without any particular proof that they are adorable or romantic, \\"Amelie\\" shows the effect that a particular mindset can produce, making the very ordinary into something magical.  While not exactly an advertisement for the Power of Positive Thinking, the advantages of a mischievous, curious approach to life are certainly amplified here.  <br />\\"Amelie\\" is not all sweetness and light.  Despite her appeal, the character Amelie is sly and secretive and has an unsettling disregard for the consequences of her actions.  Her playfulness takes on an air of cruelty in her treatment of the mean-spirited greengrocer, and I began to wonder if she orchestrated the romance for her co-worker out of friendship or spite... However, it is her playfulness that, for better or worse, makes things happen.  <br />Unlike most movies meant to entrance audiences (i.e., like those named above), \\"Amelie\\" takes place in a recognizable world where all the ordinary rules apply. Except for the contrivance of Amelie's occasional asides to the camera, demonstrating the workings of her busy mind, nothing happens in this movie that could not happen in real life.  The charm of this film rests on these practical underpinnings, and it is Amelie's imagination which provides the glow.     <br />Having never been to Paris, I can only say that the Paris of this film looks and feels exactly like Paris is supposed to:  twisty little streets, tilty old buildings, wheezy accordions, and ample evidence of le chic which happens to be very shabby.  And so far as the look of Amelie herself, so much has been said about Audrey Tautou and her doll-like, anime-eyed darlingness that I needn't say anything more on the subject.  Oh, OK, onemore thing:  she makes a very sexy Zorro!<br />So Amelie's love interest works in a porn shop.  So people in France have (not-very-graphic, actually) sex.  The sexual content is minimal and struck me as being mostly farcical - it's romance that is taken seriously here. I have no kids, but I think many would find it OK for older children, especially since there's so much else to enjoy - I would be more concerned about a child's ability to read the subtitles and keep up with the story!
B000065U1N|5.0|Stunning<br />The Movie<br />In one word, this movie is Stunning. It doesn't glamorize war or portray it in anyway to be anything but terrifying, bad and horrible. I do recommend that you read the book as well though as it gives you alot of background information about the situation and individuals. The acting is great, the camera work is terrific the sound is crystal clear and the picture is very sharp.  I don't think this movie was made to entertain as much as it was to tell the soldiers' story and commemerate the heroes who belonged to Task Force Ranger, Delta Force and the 160th SOAR who fought on those days. It shows how heroic every single one of those soldiers who fought on October 3rd and 4th, 1993 were. Soldiers like SFC Randy Shughart and MSG Gary Gordon who were willing to die trying to save Mike Durant and his crew must not be forgotten.<br />The Book - The Movie<br />Lot's people of people say Ridley Scott cut a lot of things that were in the book from the movie to make the \\"Americans\\" look good.  This is not true.  Ridley Scott cut things from the book that made the Somalis look bad.  He changed things such thimgs as Todd Blackburn falling from of the Blackhawk because the pilot dodged an RPG and cut things like Blackhawks coming in at night to deliver IV bags, ammo and food to the pinned down forces.  What Ridley Scott also didn't show was Somali militia hiding in crowds of women and children while shooting at the US soldiers.  What he didn't show was the Somalis dragging the bodies of the dead American soldiers through the streets and damaging them beyond recegnitionand cutting limbs off and swinging them around as if they were trophies.  One thing that was cut from the movie that made the Somalis look good was how well CWO Mike Durant was treated by the Somalis.This movie has no faults despite what you might hear.
B000002HHB|5.0|...and so starts out Natalie Merchant's \\"Tigerlilly\\" in \\"San Andreas Fault.\\" You'll be thinking though that paradise is spinning around in that metallic disc spinning around in your CD player as you listen to the finest of Merchant's three solo efforts.<br />Tigerlilly was Natalie's break from the Maniacs, yes that's right all 10,000 of them and she hasn't looked back since. Her songwriting abilities, her artistic bent, and transformation of those emotive sometimes issue-laden poetic lyrics into beat and blues and vocal acuity make for a music par excellence. \\"San Andreas Fault\\" is cool and crawling. \\"Wonder\\" belies Merchant's curious story-telling about a girl that might possibly be a medical oddity. Whatever she is talking about, it does make one wonder. \\"Beloved Wife\\" is a powerful ballad that puts Merchant in character of a husband that has lost a cherished wife. Her projection is amazing, vocally and dramatically. The hit \\"Carnival\\" went to prove that \\"Jealousy\\" wasn't a one-hit wonder. Both are just as catchy with repeat listens.<br />I would have to place \\"Tigerlilly\\" in my top 10 fave CD's.  It launched beautifully Merchant's solo flight.  Before \\"Tigerlilly\\" we liked her cool hip folk chalance as a maniac. But in solo, \\"Tigerlilly\\" made us love her.
B000002513|5.0|For the last three tracks, especially Incident on 57th Street and New York City Serenade, there are not enough superlatives to describe the lyrical mastery and vivid story telling.  It's clearly some of the best American music ever recorded.  The segue from Incident on 57th Street into Rosalita will give you goose bumps with its beauty.<br /><br />Each song tells a story in which you can easily feel and envisage the surrounding scenery and emotional complexity involved.  No one does this better than 1970s Springsteen.  In this album the stories of myriad Americans living on the semi fringe of society are described better than what most films could accomplish.<br /><br />During my college years I underwent some tough economic times in which selling my CDs played a part, but Wild, Innocent and E St. Shuffle was quickly set aside to avoid the selling block.  Anyone who purports to love great music cannot neglect to hear this Rosetta stone of rock.
0684833395|5.0|This book is savagely funny and deadly serious all in one breath.  There's the Texan that kills the soldier in white through unrelenting conviviality, the cat that sleeps on Hungry Joe's face and maybe eventually killing him, the soldier who see everything twice, Major Major Major Major, the atheist chaplain's assistants who run God's service so much better than the believing Chaplain ever could, and then there is the war and the desperate unfunny catch-22 to stay alive in a business that's bound to kill you.<br />I read this book in High School and have finished it off since then about 4 times.  It solidified my love for literature.  It taught me that to keep our sometimes feeble hold on sanity we have to find the ludicrous and humor in the dead seriousness of reality.  It is pacifist's plea to find some sanity to end the state of things where we legally go out to kill each other, trading blows with the enemy underneath the bombardier's sites and the enemies among us.  I wonder if Joseph Heller could find Peace quite as tragically funny.<br />\\"The only thing going on was a war, and no one seemed to notice...Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn't know shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn't funny at all.  And if that wasn't funny, there were lots of things that weren't even funnier.\\"  It's the humor amid the tragedy that in war people die and when people die, there is little laughter and to hold on to your sanity you must laugh.  That's a catch isn't it?  I'll close this in the words of Jimmy Buffet and thank you Joseph Heller for teaching us well, \\"If we didn't laugh we'd all go insane.\\"
B00005JL3A|4.0|If you are a die-hard fan of the RE video game series, you might be a bit let down.  In the whole movie, there are only a handful of items and instances where you will go \\"Ah...that I know\\".  Seeing this movie with the video game in mind might disappoint you.  <br />But as an action movie, it's up there with the best of the I've-got-some-time-to-kill-and-feel-like-watching-some-action-movie genre.  That's the situation I was under when I watched this movie.  Must say, I was thoroughly enjoying this movie.  Didn't really care that the plot was thin.  Didn't give a damn I didn't see any recognizable characters from the game (which I've played).  I saw a damn good action movie!<br />And that's what this is...a damn good action movie!<br />Rent it or buy it.  It'll give you 90 minutes of good ole action movie fun.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is the one of my favorite movies of all time! And if you decide to get this movie, I highly recomend the DVD edition. It is filled with huge amounts of extra footage that you may find very helpful. At the beginning of this movie I was alittle frightened, but as the movie progressed it just grew on me. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are all above exelant in this comical, tragic, wonderfully portraded musical spectactular! This is above far one of Ewan McGregor's best. His voice is extremely wonderful. And his ability to feel the charactor he is portraying is definantly seen in this movie, especially in the end. Nicole was so great in this film. And she can certainly sing as well as dance. It is a tragic love story that will capture your heart and lead you into believing that all you really do need is love.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Alot was expected out of this potentially-epic film.  One of the greatest tragedy in American history brought down to a measly romance film SET during the Pearl Harbor attack.  <br />Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing aginst romance films...unless it gets in the way of the important things in the movie...like everything else beside the romance, in this case.<br />Bah!  Maybe I was expecting a classic like Platoon or A Thin Red Line. Or the eastern hemisphere version of Saving Private Ryan.<br />My advice?  Don't buy, rent or wait til its Television premere.
B000063K2W|5.0|...a sparkling look at a real classic!<br />However, there is NO: &quot;Interview gallery with co-star Virginia Grey and hairstylist to the stars Sydney Guilaroff&quot; (as stated in item description) that I can find on this new DVD. Disappointing.<br />The two MGM shorts are interesting as is the alternate fashions show sequence (all b&amp;W - the models walk amongst the cast members). Buy this DVD for its look rather than its features.
0783235607|5.0|VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS<br />Psycho is a nightmare film. Not because it is scary - because it isn't particularly frightening. It is deeply unsettling, perhaps, more than scary. ''The Birds'' left me in shivers; this one only left me with deep elusive emotions and the memory of Norman's maniacal, psychotic smile at the close of the film, an image which almost twelve hours later has not left me. Any more than has ''Mother's'' voice. I suppose this film is a study: a disturbing, but true look into the human nature. We all could be psycho killers if we had been in his place, and although we cringe at the horror and sickness of Norman's twisted mind and split personality, we find it hard to despise him.<br />Norman Bates looks at first glance as innocent as anyone - he is really quite ordinary. Who would suspect he is a maniac scizophrenic? After all, practically anyone can acquire the aggravating habit of continuous candy corn consumption, or be twittery and stuttering, or look creepy in certain lights. But the moment the illumined ''Bates Motel'' sign comes into view through the weeping night, it is an edgy feeling that crawls over the viewer. But why? The cabins are no different from many others; in fact they are quite charming. Still, a peculiar air seems to be pervading the place, an air of dread, uncertainty and darkness. Not only the darkness of the hour, but of the mind. Perhaps it is the old house that stands guard of the cabins which is so menacing; perhaps she is protective of them. She looks as though she could reach out and destroy anything which threatened the solitude and silence of those twelve vacancies.<br />Mother's room is heavy, oppressive in its ornateness and antiquity. The imprint she left on the bed direct's one's mind - rather unsettlingly - to the thought of those plaster casts made from the hollows left by the victims of Pompeii. Trapped for years, perhaps, leaving a mark that will take many more years to efface. Norman's room is suggestive of the child he still is. His life as Norman ended at five, after all. When did he have a chance to grow up? At five his father died, and Norman began his long slow descent into madness. His toys have never been taken out of the place. The record in the player is Beethoven's ''Eroica'': powerful music, almost light at times, frightfully aggressive at other moments. The motive goes in circles, first loudly, then softly, sometimes overlapping, never really reaching a resolution until the slamming close.<br />Mother Bates herself isn't all that frightening. I expect we are too desensitised by this time - after all, one see hundreds of such masks and worse at Hallowe'en time. No matter how revolting they may be, such things no longer frighten us as they would have done the general public in 1960. Lila touches her shoulder; the corpse turns about - eyeless, all smile and teeth and grey hair and shawl. When Norman comes in, looking ridiculous and far too tall in Mother's dressing-gown and wig, and is taken over by Sam, Mother rocks peacefully, the eternal smile fixed. The light bulb as it swings gives a weird shadow effect. Where Mother's eyes should be, the shadows play back and forth as if she is glancing from side to side - laughing at what she sees, laughing at the destruction she has helped to create.<br />I would say everyone should see this film at least once, for the experience. It is well-done and thought-provoking, with much more depth than the cheap horror flicks of today. This is a real situation, this could actually happen (only let's hope not very much). I know a Bates Motel. I've never been in it. Perhaps someday I'll go check it out, but I think I'll stay out of the shower.hild he still is. His life as Norman ended at five, after all.

B000002GFC|5.0|This is a good collection of Cream's best work. Cream was the first &quot;power trio&quot;. The band dosen't get the credit that Hendrix gets for early acid metal. This was one of the first of the british blues metal bands that took hold in America. They didn't start hard rock, bands like The Kinks,Yardbirds,Who,and the Rolling Stones, were the pioneers of hard rock and metal. The music style began to gain popularity in the mid-late 60's. Cream and Hendrix made heavy rock a commercial success. It wouldn't be given the moniker &quot;heavy metal&quot; until rock critics started refering to Steppenwolf's music and bands similer to them as the &quot;heavy metal sound&quot;. Cream was one of the first bands to use long extended solos in their music,(bands like The Who,and the Stones didn't use long solos until their 70's work). Clapton was the least talented of the &quot;big three&quot;,but he was a master of the wah wah pedal. Cream is today considered a cornerstone in pioneering metal. They should rank up their with the greats. If their had been no Cream, you wouldn't have had Zeppelin,Sabbath,Purple,Mountain,Heep,Grand Funk,Aerosmith,and all who followed. Hard rock/metal started with bands like the Stones, but it gained most of its most famous traits from Cream. This is the best of the heavy rock legends. Not bad for only two years together!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I love this album, every song is awesome in it's own way. Every song is different, I have listened to this album over and over again and i still like it as much as when i first heard it! Also it seems that they are going in a much cooler direction. All of the songs are as cool as Drive and all of those other cool songs on the previous album, some even better. I especially like listening to the song &quot;Are You In?&quot;. It has such a cool beat to it and it makes you feel good. Also I don't think their are any cuss words in any of the songs. It's a Perfect! Just Perfect Album!
B000069HJM|3.0|When this album came out while I was in college, I was looking forward to something similar to &quot;Brother Where You Bound?&quot;  That album was moody and Pink-Floyd like, with David Gilmour on the title track.  I would recommend that album to anyone, including Pink Floyd-heads and Yes-zoners. <br />This album is such a departure.  The first half of the album has strangely upbeat pop songs.  Listening to this album is like chugging orange juice.  I really don't know what the point is.  The second side is not much different, although &quot;I'm Beggin' You,&quot; the single off the album, had a great MTV video and catchy horn crescendo.  I bought this CD reissue because I am missing that glossy, late 80's pop sound and I want to revisit my past.   You decide!
B000002ADT|5.0|Anyone looking to enjoy some classic, true jazz should buy this CD.  The instrumentation is fabulous, almost as if you are sitting on Beale Street.  Even a novice will enjoy this recording.  I highly recommend this as a true initiation to the enjoyment of classic jazz, and for seasoned jazz lovers, this is a must-have.  Everyone who enjoys this music should own this recording.  Truly, a masterpiece.
B000002GGW|5.0|&quot;Cannonball.&quot;  You can't stop listening to it.  It clocks in at over seven minutes.  But it could take over the entire album and you wouldn't get bored.<br />It's as epic and hypnotic as Led Zeppelin's Kashmir, but for Prog-pop fans.  Instead of a Jimmy Page guitar grind, you have a saxophone bridge and Davies' Hammond organ.<br />If you're one of those people who lights your cigarette lighter at a Phil Collins-Genesis concert, then you'll love this album.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Being a big fan of Bowie's later 70's stuff probably more so than the Ziggy era glam (even though that's great too), this album sees him at the transitory point between the more traditional pop of Young Americans and, later, the big 'triology' of Low, Heroes and Lodger. It has more in common with the latter three than the ones prior, and for this reason, subjectively speaking, it's all the better for it.<br />The fact that this album would be deemed 'experimental' in comparison to the more popular side of the Bowie repetoire should certainly NOT put you off. Every track is a song (as opposed to an instrumental - see the Berlin trilogy), and what wonderful songs they are.<br />It's a cliche, but the title track is the best thing the man has recorded, ever. Probably the best thing anyone's recorded (hyperbolic, but perhaps true). It's the sort of song that needs about 10 listens before you 'get it', but you NEVER get sick of it. Brilliant lyrics dealing with, amongst other things, Bowie's cocaine addiction, a symbolic return to Europe and its more intellectualised aesthetic approach (significant after his flirtation with all things Americana), and the introduction of his 'Thin White Duke' character - the scariest and most formidable of all the personas Bowie adopted. And what a groove. Brilliant playing by all involved and the coda is the funkiest thing I've ever heard - and, bonus!, it goes for about 3 minutes.<BR>Every track that comes after is almost as good. TVC 15, albeit poppy, is still very much a grower. Almost annoying the first few times, it gets better and better. Golden Years everyone knows and rightly so. I still find it amazing he managed to get such a great single out of such a left of centre approach - and it doesnt stick out on the album as being a 'wrong fit'. Word on a Wing and Wild is the Wind (do you think he meant the double alliteration?) are both wonderful ballads which really show what a terrific singer Bowie is. Wild is the Wind, particularlymay well be the best vocal he's recorded (and check out his performance of this song on the 3rd disc of the recently released Live at the Beeb - I'd say it matches the original. Brilliant). Stay is a song many people adore. For me it might be the weakest on the album, but against such strong contenders, it's obviously still great with a lengthy guitar solo to finish - the band really seem to be enjoying themselves.<BR>If for no other reason (and there are plenty of others), you should own this album for the title track. And if you haven't been into Bowie long enough to get into the later Low, Heroes and Lodger, Station to Station serves as a great primer for what's to come. I'd highly recommend it...and turn it up loud.
B000000OU6|4.0|ok, so Slash knew this album wasn't going to be a classic, but this was just a side project while GN'R weren't doin anything. Eric Dover is no Axl Rose (then again, who is?), Slash again provin one of the worlds greatest guitarists and a decent line-up for the rest of the band which is: Mike Inez(alice in chains normally), Gilby Clarke(ex-gnr), and Matt Sorum(ex-gnr). This was an experimental album for Slash, trying to add some blues to the GN'R sound which works in most cases. The second Snakepit album 'Ain't Life Grand'is probably better but this is well worth buying if you're into GN'R.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I read the reviews on Amazon, and wasn't sure if I should buy this CD.  I hadn't heard any of the songs on the radio, and there can be quite a high degree of variability in the quality of McCartney's solo releases.<br />I would place this in his top 5 easily.  \\"Lonely Road\\" is a great song, and I hear a lot of real emotion in it, not a common thing in a McCartney song.<br />Another favorite is \\"Heather\\".  It just flows as if the song is exactly how it should be.<br />\\"Freedom\\" is a nice way to end the CD.  A good little anthem to remind us of the events of 2001.  Don't often hear a fighting song from McCartney!<br />I'm not saying that I loved these tracks on the first listening.  I didn't.  It probably took me 3 listenings before the songs grew on me.  Give it a chance and it may grow on you too.
B00005LQ04|4.0|First, there are many reviews pertaining to this films content so I will skip that except to say that the film is indeed quite pretty and stylishly shot.<BR>The main point I want to address is the complete lack of subtitles.  I was very disappointed to find that despite the fact that the original language track is included on this disc there are no subtitles to allow those with no understanding of Italian to view and comprehend the film this way.<BR>I do wonder, however, if perhaps this was a decision made based on the idea that reading the subtitles would distract the viewer from the films hailed visuals.  Anyway, just a word of warning for the purists out there as I was rather shocked and upset by this intiailly.
B000066I6N|5.0|This is an adventurous, sweet and beautiful record. At first listen, you may, like me, think everyone who posted positively here is out of their minds....but repeated listenings bear wonderful and strange fruit....and soon the record becomes almost irresistible.<br />Possibly his best post-Zep record to date, and could likely stand the test of time; fresh and classic all at once.

Auster is one of my favorite writers, and for those new to his writing The New York Trilogy is a good place to start.<br />Essentially, these three novellas are detective stories with film-noir atmosphere, but the themes Auster tackles go beyond those of your standard spy novel.  There are questions of identity, power dynamics, the relationship between the writer and his characters, the relationship between a detective and his suspects.  <br />Additionally, this is a wonderfully bookish book; references to Lewis Carroll, Cervantes, etc. abound.  There are books within books within books; all the lines that separate reality from writing from fictional reality from fictional writing are blurred, turning the reader inside-out and upside-down as he or she reads.<br />Most importantly, these novellas are highly engaging and evocative.  Though Auster's writing has been described as cold and austere, these are compelling stories; it is easy succumb to the swift, gripping narrative.  <br />A truly lovely collection, very conceptual, breaks all the rules and wriggles its way out of any genre to which one might try to confine it.
B00003CXTF|1.0|I am so glad I caught this on cable, rather than spent my good, hard-earned money on this awful film.  While I give credit to Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett & Kate Beckinsale for some decent acting-it's a shame that this story as presented turned out to be more of a soap opera than anything else. Cuba Gooding, Jr. barely had much screen time, but the few scenes he had were outstanding & left me wanting much more. To be fair, the special effects scenes-especially showing the attack on Pearl Harbor, were terrific-it's just that Hollywood took too much poetic license here & made what should have been a terrific film into a terrible one.  The movie, thanks to the soap stuff(Rafe falls for nurse Evelyn, Rafe goes off to fight in Europe, crashes into the sea & is supposedly KIA, then after Evelyn finds consolation in the arms of Rafe's best buddy Danny, of course Rafe suddenly turns up all in one piece at Pearl Harbor, etc.)is about an hour too long.  SAVE YOUR MONEY, FOLKS-Watch it on cable(I've seen it on STARZ! myself)or wait til it eventually turns up on regular network television-edited down for tv, just as they did last year with the much more glorious Saving Private Ryan(they must make room for all those commercials, after all!).  Not recommended AT ALL.
B000065V1V|4.0|This album is everything I have wanted for about 20 years.  I've always been a big fan of David's ealier work, up to and even including &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; which was better than is commonly acknowledged.  However, his output during the 1990s left me cold.  &quot;Hours&quot; was the only one worth purchasing, and only about 50% of its tracks were appealing to me.  Even though the '90s albums weren't to my taste, I could tell that David was finding his muse again and replenishing his musical soul, and I always hoped that when he finished he would put out stuff as good as his work in the 60s, 70s and 80s.  That album is Heathen.  All of the songs are good, and some are excellent.  While clearly not a &quot;concept&quot; album, the CD hangs together as a coherent whole.  The three cover songs are well-chosen and well-executed.  The song &quot;I took a trip on a Gemini Spacecraft&quot; is the catchiest and coolest song I have ever heard, and my only complaint is that I cannot get it out of my head.
0316666343|4.0|When I picked up The Lovely Bones I thought it an odd title but after reading the jacket cover I thought I would give it a try.  I am glad I did.  Alice Sebold tells a wonderful story with humor and agony.  I found myself shedding a few tears along with a chuckle every now and then.  I could not put this book down and finsihed in one day.  I see great things ahead for Ms. Sebold based on this book.  If you want to lose yourself in a story that shows the dark side of Earth as well as the hope of heaven then I would recommend this book.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Before everyone clicks the \\"unhelpful\\" button, think about the fact that this review is about how all the footage of The Two Towers that I've seen looks. <BR>SPECIAL EFFECTS: 9/10 While SFX have been sparse in the trailers, what is shown(Gandalf lighting up, Uruk-Hai being thrown) looks excellent- hopefully I will someday change this rating to a 10.<BR>ACTING: 10/10 Dramatic and real, you feel the emotion that the actors give off that makes you want to see the movie RIGHT NOW.<BR>DIRECTION: 9/10 Very good, there are some tricky shots that were pulled off.

0930289234|4.0|I was prepped for this by having my comic store guy call it 'the best book ever written', someone else commented, 'getting Watchmen? ...', maybe the mystery and hype surrounding this wasn't the best way to get into it. The characters are so realistic it is literally funny for awhile as every character has such a dark, gritty life. I think the way the comic book synced with the what was happening in 'real life' was smart, as was Dr.Manhattan's memory and prediction. I didn't find myself caring about simple-minded sub-plots like Comedian attempting to rape one young superheroine, that seemed needless to me, though the almost-rape-victim was nearly interesting for her realism towards the end it never comes full circle or feels necessary. It ends on the note that some things are too complicated for superheroes and that was really interesting. I didn't think NiteOwl's relationship was intriguing enough to warrant as many pages as it got, many parts are too long, like the paragraphs about the old man who collected odd novelty items. Rorshach was a great character, who does interesting things. It centers around the end of the world and it has a palpably eerie aspect to that. I liked the interviews/journals/newspapers that really serve to put you in this world even if they aren't altogether necessary or informational. Comedian seemed like an untapped character, though he served a purpose when he burnt a list of crimes. SPOILER: I liked the ending, but not being able to blame the villain didn't seem like it had a very realistic reason outside of the spectacular idea of not being able to blame the villain.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I purchased this DVD on reputation alone. I was not disappointed. This is an absolutely stunning piece of work by David Lynch. If you are a fan of features such as 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'American Psycho' and 'Memento', you will love this movie. I do have one suggestion - do not watch this at midnight by yourself with the lights off.. it gets creepy.. everyone should own this.
B000069HKH|4.0|Don Imus spent the past week lambasting Springsteen for being self-centered and out-of-touch enough to think that people would care what he thought (and felt) about 9/11 and the world in which we now live. Of course the I-man might ask himself: who else has the guts to write songs about this that are not jingoistic, trite, or one-dimensional. Personally, I can't wait to hear what Eminem has to say.<br />There are songs you will listen to over and over. There is music that's up and more songs that are down. It's more personal than Born in the USA and, I think, more heart-felt than anything since Darkness on the Edge of Town. He's a better songwriter than he's ever been. And what's wrong with an artist (or a has-been, egomaniac, Dylan-wannabe, as Imus would have it) attempting to give a voice and a sound to our thoughts and feelings? ...<br />Some of the songs show Bruce working too hard. Some seem effortless. A couple will work on your emotions, if you have any. The best ones get under your skin. Like all his good stuff, it grows on you. Give it a shot.
0553277472|4.0|This is an amazing read. Pirsig knows how to dig into your head and pull out questions about you. If this book reflects his own thoughts and behavior, he should be commended for exposing the 'black box' within each of us that rarely gets attention. Occasionally, he rambles on a bit long about Phaedrus, and the story drags a little, but overall, very nice piece of work. This book reaquainted me with my desire to read philosophy. I have since read 'Socrates Cafe', which is also a great read along the same lines.
0060934913|4.0|I borrowed a copy of this between novels and must say I truly enjoyed it. It was a rather eye-opening account of the world of cooking (Bourdain's world anyway). It was well written and held my attention. I would recommend young chefs in training pick up a copy. Though Bourdain's way to success is not the common way, it sure has been quite a ride so far. Since reading this, my view point of the cooking field has changed somewhat. When going into restaurants now, I find myself trying to sneak a peak into the kitchen to see if I can see any 'hijinks in progress'.<br />Recommended
B00002E224|5.0|This movie is a refreshing look at romance, very European (though American made) and with fantastic chemistry. The unique, funny, (pseudo-)intellectual conversation practically non-stop through the film is great and the characters are believable.  One would almost think that the actors were not following a script but were rather just winging it, discussing their real ideas and plans.  While there may be some kitsch \\"we are all stardust\\"...the character's reactions quickly correct any slipping from the reality of two young travelers infatuated with each other and with life.  The scenes of Vienna, in the amusment park Prater, the clubs, and mostly the scene in the cafe, are extremely true to life. With so much trash being made by American directors today it's great to see a little gem like this.
B000002UAX|5.0|I purchased the White Album when I was around 8 years old. At the time, I was a real die-hard Beatles fan, and owned every one of the albums. Comparing the White Album to the Beatles' previous releases, I found it rather disappointing and didn't bother to give it a second listen. Now, 8 years older, I've rediscovered the White Album and it's musical brilliance. I was wrong to compare it with any of the Beatles' other work, because it is simply incomparable.  The Beatles write some of the most diverse material of their careers ranging in styles from \\"Beach Boys\\" pop, to folk, to blues, to hard rock to psychedelia.  In my experience, this album gets better and better every time you listen to it.
B00005QTAR|3.0|I suppose you could get sillier and more childishly simplistic than to find an unbelievable lava-rock monster pitting Abraham Lincoln against Genghis Khan on an arena planet (with Kirk and Spock aiding the centuries-dead ex-president) to see whether good is stronger than evil, but - come to think of it, no you couldn't.<br />That's \\"The Savage Curtain,\\" probably the worst-ever episode of the series.<br />\\"All Our Yesterdays\\" is one of the best-ever.<br />Kirk, Spock and McCoy try to evacuate the inhabitants of a planet about to be devastated by a supernova, only to find that they've already found their own way out via the Atavachron, a time-machine that sends people back into the past, out of harm's way. Kindly Mr. Atoz (Ian Wolfe) and his numerous clones mistake the Enterprise personnel for people needing to be evacuated - so, Kirk soon finds himself accused of being a witch in a 17th century setting to which he is sent against his will, and Spock and McCoy are sent back to the planet's Ice Age. The sole human resident in that Ice Age is the fetching Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley), a sad and tragic forgotten prisoner who falls madly in love with Spock (and he with her) and will do anything to keep him with her - even if it's possible to send the misplaced pair back to the place from whence they came.<br />This is a great episode, owing largely to Hartley's moving performance as the doomed beauty, Zarabeth. Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley really shine in this story, McCoy going crazy and Spock succumbing to his atavistically violent Vulcan lusts. Shatner does pretty well too, but this is really Nimoy and Kelley's time to show what they've got.
B000002JSP|1.0|This is the worst Led Zeppelin album ever!  Zeppelin DESTROYS their heavy blues rock image with the pop of \\"Fool in the Rain\\" and \\"All of My Love\\".  For die hard fans, your respect for Zep will vanish in the haze after listening to this album.  In the name of all things sacred, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005J6RE|3.0|\\"The Ultimate Computer\\" is a so-so entry, with more to recommend it than not, and \\"The Omega Glory\\" is  -  frankly  -  laughably bad, one of the worst scripts seen in the entire series.<br />William Marshall is Dr. Daystrom, \\"The Ultimate Computer\\"'s creator, whose title device is intended to replace an entire starship crew and fulfill all of their functions with far greater efficiency.  Unfortunately, Daystrom's genius comes largely from the fact that he was a social outcast, and the computer's mind is programmed directly from his own engrams.  The result:  something out of Stanley Kubrick's worst nightmare, with a dangerously schizoid personality and weaponry out the wazoo.  Commodore Wesley (Barry Russo), the commander of the lead starship engaged in war games with Daystrom's mad alter-ego, has to make a decision as to whether or not to terminate the homicidal hardware  -  and Kirk and Company, reduced to prisoners on board their own ship, have to find a way to help him, or they'll die with the killer computer.  Marshall is quite compelling in the role of the computer's creator, but the episode is otherwise fairly undistinguished.<br />\\"The Omega Glory\\" is perhaps the most absurdly propagandistic script to have emerged in any medium during the Cold War.  Morgan Woodward gives a wonderfully intense performance as Captain Ronald Tracy, a Starfleet commander gone mad as the sole survivor of a plague that devastated his crew  -  Tracy accidentally gained immunity by taking up residence on the planet from which the plague originated, where he must now remain or die.  While there, Tracy discovers Starfleet's superior weaponry is worthwhile in establishing himself as a king among a primitive tribe called the Comms, who war with a neighboring tribe called the Yangs  -  who turn out to be direct Earth parallels of the \\"Comm\\"unists and the \\"Yang\\"kees, with the Yangs even saying the U.S. pledge of allegiance.  Spock is seen as the devil because his pointed ears look like Satan's in the Yang \\"Sacred Book\\" (yes, they also have our Bible).  Yeah, you don't have to say it  -  it's pretty stupid to me, too.
0064471837|4.0|I read this book when I had nothing better to do...<br />And I loved it. This book should be read by everyone from Fantasy fanatics (Like me!) to anyone with hands to pick up a book.<br />It starts out with Sabriel a 18ish teenager on the \\"Normal\\" side of a magical border called Ancelstierre. She receives a cryptic message from her father Abhorsen that calls her over to the \\"Magical\\" side of this world called 'The Old kingdom. And it leads her on a very interesting quest.<br />She is joined by a Cat that's not really a cat named Mogget who is a variety of things or rather in his own words, \\"I have a variety of names... You may call me Mogget. As to what I am, I was once many things, but now I am only several...\\"<br />I personally loved the cat and so will you...<br />So read it<br />and the sequal 'Lirael' isnt bad either
0316666343|1.0|This book was hard to understand because of the sentence structure.  Choppy sentences that went no-where-&quot;worked together, the snow falling, almost wafting, down&quot;, and &quot;He had his family walking through the streets, going to school, passing, on their way, Mr. Harvey's green-shingled house&quot;. To be fair, I just finished &quot;Empire Falls, by Richard Russo. Mr. Russo writes in a smooth, elegant fashion.  I will give a book 50 pages to convince me its worth my time.  I stopped at page 43.
B00001OH82|1.0|most of the music is about drug's, it's okay if you are def. prob, being Im a david bowie, fan but this cd need's help. there's only one good song out of the whole cd.
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim and I absolutely love it.  I think Avril Lavigne is an amazing singer and songwriter.  Anyone who purchases this CD won't be disappointed.  I can't wait to hear more from her in the future!
B00005ATQH|2.0|This 1962 version of Lolita absolutely pales in comparison to the 1998 version, and to the novel itself.. James Mason as Humbert Humbert is wooden, and Sue Lyon barely even begins to capture the petulant yet erotic character of Lolita. The entire first half of the film builds upon the relationship between Humbert Humbert and Charlotte Haze (Lolita's mother). In the book the relationship between the two is incidental, and simply a part of the complicated plan to deliver Lolita into the sole care of Humbert. A good deal of time is spent exploring the character of Claire Quilty, which manages to ruin much of the surprise of the ending of the story. His character should have remained mysterious (as it did in the 1998 version) in order to create more effect for the ultimate outcome. Instead, Peter Sellers portrays him in a very Jerry Lewis like fashion, making the devious and sleazy child abductor into a comical and annoying character. Why would Lolita be attracted to this imbecile? The plot is lost in the dialog, and at the end the audience is left wanting. Why is Humbert Humbert so hurt by the loss of Lolita? He never really seemed like he tolerated her that much anyway.<br />Unless you're a Kubrick fan, I'd recommend staying away from this one. It's disappointing in so many ways that would take pages and pages to cover. Try instead the 1998 version. It's beautifully filmed, and strongly performed, and gives a much better vision to what you find in the novel.
B000069HKH|3.0|I love Bruce and I appreciate what he is trying to accomplish with this album.  Nevertheless, his lyrics are often uninspired.  He sings about wanting his lover's kiss in many songs.  He repeatedly talks about sunrises and an empty side of the bed.  The songs are also melodically and harmonically similar.  There are a couple of rockers, but most of the songs are slower ballads.  The band's talent is not used to enhance the album and you really have to listen to hear the sax.<br />Depite the failings of this album, it is still worth owning.  Some of the lyric repetition actually gives a meditative quality to the songs.  (Of course, other times the repition suggests a lack of originality.)  Nevertheless, a mediocre album by Bruce is better than most artists can hope to accomplish.  I won't be selling this to a used cd store.
B000069HKH|4.0|I don't want to sound like a sappy fan who thinks Bruce is my best friend (although I am).  I like this album.  It's an easy listen with an important message.  We should not forget and who better to remind us than the man one of our fellow fans asked to help us...NOW. (oops, I got sappy)  I like it.
B00005QIPH|3.0|\\"Everyone here says that \\"it doesn't matter if you're original\\" and \\"who cares if you can't play instruments?\\" If you go by those criteria, then any old garage band with anything resembling an instrument and a \\"voice\\" could achieve fame and fortune...haha it's not that simple!\\"<br />I definitely disagree with the people that say talent doesn't matter, because it does in a very big way.  However, I think it's easier to get to the top than most people think.  Look at Britney Spears.  I see no talent there.  Maybe she'd be considered talented by a strip club, but that's another story.  It really depresses me that singers/bands like her can get to the top simply because they have the looks.  That is such [bull].  Alright, so maybe The Strokes aren't the hippest thing, and maybe they're not even that great.  I guess their musical performance in general could use a little work.  But at least we know they're there for some other reason than their looks; they've got something that sets them apart from the others.  They're just a fun, retro band.  I'm not saying I'm a fan, but they do deserve a little credit.  In fact, any band that actually plays their own instruments deserves some credit.  It takes some guts to get out there in the public eye and do your thing, you know?<br />But as for me, I think I'll keep to the underground scene.  The kids there need more support.  Have you even seen what they've been up to lately?  Stop wasting your time on the bands that are \\"good\\" enough to make it on to MTV.  There's so much more out there!
B00005NWM3|1.0|This CD is, by no means, worth your money.  The only songs I'm particularly fond of are \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Too Bad.\\"  Even \\"How You Remind Me\\" has gotten old and dull.  The music itself is too simple and predictable.  For example, \\"How You Remind Me\\" has the same repetitive bass line throughout.  The drum parts aren't riveting enough to make the songs very good.  Instead, use your money to buy Creed or Staind, 2 similar (post-grunge) artists who are far superior to Chad Kroeger and Nickelback.
B00005R2M3|4.0|... not Alanis Morissette, to whom she has been compared.<br />I really didn't like this CD at first, when I listened to it in a record store. Many of the things I read in other reviews seemed to pertain: English lyrics were difficult to understand. Even though I absolutely love her other albums, this seemed a letdown. I grinned at the \\"English Dictionary\\" tumbling in the clothes dryer on the back cover, a nice touch, but I didn't buy it; I was just too disappointed.<br />Then I heard a song on a local Spanish language radio. Shakira. I didn't recognize the song, but I loved it. It was Te Dejo Madrid. How could I have missed this in the record store? <br />So I bought it. Now I LOVE it! <br />It is so interesting to listen to Shakira's voicings. She can't do in English what she does in Spanish. But I think she will, in time. Meanwhile you can listen to her playing her instrument, her voice, singing refreshingly naive college-girlish lyrics, you can ponder the differences between what she can do in each language, wonder what goes wrong when one is singing outside her own tongue, why the breadth of tonality shrinks, and then smile and admire the raw talent of this young woman who is with this CD taking steps into new territory, expanding her abilities.<br />Get the other albums first. They are much better. But if you develop a sweet spot for Shakira, then you'll want this one too.

B00002MZ2C|1.0|i got this album because i liked the songs &quot;testify&quot; and &quot;sleep now in the fire&quot; that i had heard on the radio.  but the whole album sounds so much alike, each song like the next, that i cannot listen to it.  i wish they would take more chances and experiment more.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|This album is everything that you would expect, the chilling effects of this intense movie are captured quite well with in its compelling music. If you liked the movie, you'll like the soundtrack, straight up.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Comparisons between the two are inevitable, but &quot;Hannibal&quot; is such a different kind of movie than its predecessor, it forces you into watching it in its own terms. First of all, the dark, dirty look on the original is gone. This is a Ridley Scott movie, so you know that the &quot;look&quot; is going to be something wild and crazy, very exquisite indeed since is set in the beautiful city of Florence. You also have to remember that in the previous movie, the real star was Clarice, while this film is all Hannibal. The good doctor is the absolute star in this, and you can almost find yourself rooting for him when he kills, crossing your fingers so that he never is caught. Definetely one of the most charismatic villains ever.<br />If you watch this movie hoping to see everything you saw in the first one, then you'll be disapointed. Like I said before, this is a completely different movie, and it can be better apreciated by fans of the Marquis de Sade, or anyone else who's in favor of &quot;good taste&quot; against the gruesome tale than the first one was. Personally, the only thing I don't like about this movie is that Clarice is played by a different actress this time. Not that I consider Julianne Moore a bad choice, is just that I'm a big Jodie Foster fan.<br />The extras in this edition are great, specially the deleted scenes. By the way, I think that &quot;alternative ending&quot; would have been better. Those of you who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about (the choping scene with the meat cleaver in front of the fridge). Those of you who don't know, well... I'm not going to spoil the fun for you.<br />Well, if you loved &quot;Silence of the lambs&quot;, then maybe you should reconsider if you're going to get this movie, specially if you see it merely as a sequel. On the other hand, if you're a Lecter fan (I know I am), then look no more! This is not &quot;Silence of the lambs 2&quot;, my friend, this is &quot;Hannibal&quot;.
0140186395|5.0|I was a little apprehensive to start reading this 602 page long novel, but after the first 40 pages or so, I really got into it and couldn't put it down.  The characters are well thought out and have distinct, unique personalities that make the reader feel as if he or she knows them.  To get the full meaning of East of Eden, I read Spark Notes after every chapter.  Doing this helped me understand the relationship between Cain and Abel, and Charles and Aron.  The only complaint I had with this book was that it seemed to end quickly.  It seemed a little predictable and put a damper on the wonderfully written 550 preceding pages.  However, East of Eden is my favorite novel written by Steinbeck, and I will definitely read it again.
0780020685|2.0|I have tried watching this film several times and have never been able to get through it due to boredom. The audio commentary on this one is something else as the commentator makes a big deal out of every shot, even the most mundane and obvious ones. He could find a silver lining in a typhoon! The acting is over-the-top as far as I am concerned. This is just another art house foreign film that you are supposed to like because it's good for you - just like broccoli, I suppose.
B000000OU6|2.0|When &quot;It's Five O'Clock Somewhere&quot; starts it seems like it's going to be a fine album.  the first two songs are cool, but after that the cd just loses momentum and most of the songs are just boring.  the good songs on this cd are neither can i, a bluesy song that starts slow but builds up, dime store rock, a hard rockin song, take it away, another decent rocker and back and forth again, a ballad with an amazing solo.  those are the only songs worth listening to.  Slash is a great guitarist but even he can not save this cd.  also the singer is pretty bad, he just sounds like an Axl impersonator.  The second snakepit cd is much better and i would reccomend that one, but don't bother with this one.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Thanks to some bad critics I didnt expect to much and so I was very suprised, how  good that movie is. Forget Tomb Raider. Up to now this is the best videogame to theatres adaption I saw. Thrilling, stylish, chilling. Okay, some of the actors played far better in other flicks (Michelle Rodriguez acts horrible in some szenes, and some cuts are not always logical) but still it grabs you. For gamers it finally opens the whole story and Anderson proves that after &quot;Event Horizon&quot; he is still able to direct some fast paced sci-fi-horror entertaiment. Not enough a &quot;Zombie&quot; Movie? Who cares. Take some popcorn and enter this bone-chilling Hitech-thrillride that will give you the adrenaline-rush you expect. Also a big A for the atmopsphere that hits the Game-Feeling perfectly. Cant wait for &quot;RE2:Nemesis&quot;.....
0679746048|5.0|The writing style of the author is very special; it feels strange at first, but after a few pages you get used to it. I liked the style. It was surreal and portrayed the chaotic emotional world of young Susanna perfectly. My favorite charakter from the book was, of course, Lisa. She was so intensive and I simply loved her. My favorite part of the book was when Lisa wrapped toilet paper all around the furniture in the living room. That was so funny, but touching. You wont know what I mean if you havent read it. Only the ending was disappointing, I think. It was too sudden and very hard to understand. But after all, read it! Its the money worth, and you will wonder if youre crazy yourself after reading it...
B00005R2M3|4.0|A Latin artist making a crossover English-language album in the wake of J-Lo - you're bound to have formed opinions already.  However, this is a very solid album indeed.  True it's no classic, but Shakira's vocals and a good bunch of songs make it an album that will last.  Songs like `Whenever, Wherever' mix a kind of train-of-thought lyrical style with Latin soul to ingenious effect, whilst there's enough dabbling in various other pop sounds to make it interesting.  Still, it's a mark of what a good artist she is (and talented - she also writes) that Shakira is by no means a one trick pony.  She tries disco with `Ready For The Good Times', a dance number set to the tango called `Objection' and a few lovely little ballads such as `Fool' and `The One'.<br />Whilst some have accused Shakira's `Underneath Your Clothes' as being boring and too close to Celine Dion, there's enough quirkiness in the lyrics and soul to her voice to make each song sound individual.  So it's a shame that after track seven the songs aren't quite as good.  True, the two Spanish songs were always going to be hard to sell to a English audience, but it's not that they're not good it's just that they're not as good as what the album promises to begin with.  Even so, praise should surely be in order for someone that has managed to retain some of the old formula rather than becoming another pop diva clone.  True there's some of the diva about her but with an album that's this good it's difficult to complain really.  If she treads a thin line between quirky and cringe-worthy lyrics Shakira is definitely someone whose second English-language album will be something to look forward to.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Like most of the reviewers here, I was blown away by John Cameron Mitchell's performance as Hedwig. Funny, sad, campy, reflective: If anybody had a more electrifying stage or screen presence in 2001, bring 'em on.<br />I am writing to point out to fans of the movie/CDs that the DVD has a couple of cool features:<br />1) The show-stopping &quot;Tear Me Down&quot; was filmed live and thus is a different version than both the original off-Broadway cast recording and, for some reason, the movie soundtrack itself. And it rocks, baby.<br />2) The featurette on the making of Hedwig is worth the price of admission alone. It includes home video of JCM trying out the Hedwig character in a nightclub setting, mounting the musical, how the film version came to be and JCM's successors in the stage production. It is hands down the best making-of feature I have seen on a DVD.
B000005Z0G|5.0|There's nothing more to say...2pac is just incredible...all of his albums are excellent, the only rapper i've ever listened to where i have loved all of his cd's.  This particular album has great songs such as: Holler If Ya Hear Me\\", \\"Last Wordz\\", \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\", \\"The Streetz R Deathrow\\", \\"I Get Around\\", \\"Papa'z Song.\\"  They are all incredible---he has a unique reason for rapping, and he does it for the love....not for the fame.he will always remain the greatest!! <br />P.S. I read in an interview with Amaru Entertainment, that he has a new album due in September....a new double CD that is supposed to surpass Until the End of Time...make sure you get it!
0790741520|4.0|A group of fanatic middle east terrorists hijacks a US-bound airliner, holding its crew and passengers hostage and demanding the release of their leader - a fearless mastermind of terror brazenly seized by US special forces in a daylight raid.  We soon learn, from a brilliant civilian analyst named Grant (Kurt Russel) that the hostage bid is actually a clever smokescreen - that the airliner is actually loaded with a highly potent nerve gas, perhaps enough to end life as we know it on America's east coast.  Without any proof, the US government has the choice blasting the plane into oblivion to end a threat it could never prove, or allowing the plane to reach US airspace, where it will disperse its deadly cargo.  Instead, a tricky plan is chosen - use a stealth transport with a special airlock to insert a team of special forces onto the plane, to retake it and disarm the bomb.<br />Up until then, \\"ED\\" is content to be a generic, enjoyable yet eventually forgettable action movie involving airplanes and \\"reel bad arabs\\" (Hey, I didn't make that up - some guy wrote a book about stereotyping arabs, and somebody else recommended that instead of this flick, as if the audience of one and the other's readership overlap that much).  This flick came out in March - not quite the time when people are lining up at the box office.  Though not a bad movie, it somehow manages to approach what we all love as the \\"so bad, we love it\\" category.  Something funny happens midway through though - you realize that you're watching a parody (probably unintentional, but why spoil the fun?) with plenty of violence, but still one that isn't quite right enough to take seriously.  Steven Seagal plays the intrepid head of the special forces, but he's dispatched early on, leaving his team to shoulder the task of ending the flying seige.  You really know something's wrong when, while describing the plan, Seagal suddenly but calmly tells the military brass and the political heads involved that what hereally wants is Kurt Russel's character (tuxedo and all) to come along for the trip.  The script suggests he's laughing inside at Russell who'll have to face these bloodthirsty terrorists alone, but he's more likely laughing at us.  The flick lards it up further in its choice of miscasting - adding BD Wong and John Leguizamo in as footsoldiers in Seagal's crack outfit.  Finally, in what may be a nod to all of those \\"Airport\\" flicks of the 70's (okay, so there were only 3 of them), the flick climaxes in the single least-convincing airplane crash-landing ever depicted on the modern screen.  (This is perhaps the strongest proof that the flick was intentionally parodying action movies: years earlier, a cosmetically altered 707 was used to brilliantly and chillingly simulate a crash landing 747 in \\"White Nights\\"; another 707 was dispatched in speed - certainly they could have done more than used models ala something by Sid and Marty Croft)  I'm conservative, but ED hadn't had me scamper around frothing about \\"arab terrorists\\", nor did I look at this flick in a new light because of September 11.  (I've seen far worse arabs in other films, while this one hints that most of the hijackers were out of the loop about the plan to dump nerva gas on the east coast.)  Instead, it's a welcome diversion from more self-conciously serious action movies, even if you'll forget most of it (even Donald Trump's ex, Marla Maples as a flight attendant, or the late JD Walsh as a senator) the next day.
B00005UQ9F|2.0|but unfortunately it tried to do be a lot of different things and did them only adequately at best.  The asylum seems almost haunted but not really.  The characters almost flesh themselves out but not really.  The movie started to be a psychological thriller at one point but not really...  You get the point.<br />One of the biggest hindrances was the music or misuse of it.  The minimalist style used would have worked a lot better if something scary actually happened when the music was building up.  But instead, except for the last 10 minutes of the movie every time the music built up, it would just stop and nothing, climactic or anti-climactic, would happen.  It's like the climax golden twins just decides to play around with an oboe and piano whenever they felt like it, without even watching the movie.<br />The premise for the movie really was great, but it ended up being a thriller without thrills.  Had the madness started creeping into the characters as the movie progressed; had there been a few false alarms; had some more paranormal stuff happened it really would have been a great movie even with most of the events happening in broad daylight.  But unfortunately the writers started with a great idea and never really took advantage of it.  as far as the actors go, they did the best they could with what they were given.<br />I really wanted to like this movie, and there were some points were it really shone, but unfortunately those parts couldn't overcome the long streaches of boring scenes that didn't really make sense.  And it's not that I couldn't understand it in the end, there are just way too many logical gaps.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|I assume that you have gathered that this movie runs backwards. I am also of the opinion that if I give away too much information it will spoil the movie for you.<br />When Roper of Chicago Sun-Times reviewed the movie he said, &quot;don't go to the restroom during this movie or you will be lost when you get back&quot;. Actually, the VHS/DVD format is great - stop the movie if you take a break! This is not an effects movie - so there is no value added from seeing in a threatre anyway.<br />The reason that I give this 5 stars - is this is like seeing the very, very best of Hitchcock. The twists and turns have twists and turns. The &quot;ending&quot; (actually &quot;beginning&quot; in time order - but at the end of the movie) is totally unexpected and jolting.<BR>The acting is sensational.<br />A possible thumbs down: The &quot;F&quot; word is stated about 50 times during the movie. It does not offend me personally, but precludes letting my son watch it. It could have been made without it. I think I would be derelict as a reviewer not to mention this.<br />All in all, I think 50 years from now - people will be watching this movie as a great classic.
B000002JSV|5.0|If the title of my review is a bit misleading, let me start by clarifying that in my view, 1978's &quot;Powerage&quot; is the best of AC/DC's era with the late singer Bon Scott (God rest his soul). But be warned, all you narrow-minded rockers who only expect the standard guitar-driven salutes to booze and women, &quot;Powerage&quot; is different, and far exceeds the limitations of AC/DC's previous works (and even some material after it). This record is far more accomplished, making it the most progressed and traditionally intelligent album of their '70's era.<br />Graced with Bon Scott's sneering howl and an unexpected bluesy spark, &quot;Powerage&quot; shows AC/DC at one of their peaks; the tracks are excellent and fit the band perfectly. 'Rock and Roll Damnation' is one of the most poignantly written blistering rock songs of all time, while 'Down Payment Blues,' 'Riff Raff,' 'Gimme a Bullet,' and 'Kicked in the Teeth' make it seem as if a Delta blues band attended an AC/DC concert and changed their tune. 'Sin City' is a growling and dare I say forewarning look at Las Vegas infidelity, while 'Up to My Neck in You' and 'Gone Shootin' (a true classic) are superb. But the highlight of &quot;Powerage&quot; is no doubt 'What's Next to the Moon,' which is sheer poetry from the view of a gritty rock and roller.<br />It's a shame that &quot;Powerage&quot; has been slightly obscured by its predecessor (1977's &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;) and its follow-up (the hit &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;) because this set exceeds both of them. And though it is superior than AC/DC's other 70's material, it still matches them perfectly--even if it shines brighter.
B000069HKH|2.0|This is an unusually humdrum and threadbare set of tunes from a tired, uninspired pseudo-populist who is not up to the challenge of articulating the grief of the nation.  Why he felt it was on his shoulders to heal the American public is beyond me.  It is understandable that many passionate Springsteen lovers have succumbed to the halo effect while writing their comments.  (I myself loved Springsteen until he went slack and lazy and threw his not inconsiderable talent aside to become some sort of self-appointed spokesperson for the public at large.)  The songs here are lyrically thin and watery and unpersuasive, and musically they are unadventurous and unambitious; the CD sounds like an overembellished demo, and a lot of the songs are rough drafts, not fully realized creations.  Springsteen is not a poet, not a genius, not a seer, not a thinker--and the little feeling that comes through in most of these songs sounds contrived. This album is product.  This album is a commodity. This is not a great record; it is not even a very good one. Too bad Bruce isn't like the poets he once wrote about: &quot;The poets around here don't say nothing at all--they just stand back and let it all be.&quot;  Almost everything on this disappointing album would have been better left unsaid.  It was crass of him to foist this cheese on a public hungry for something real, something valid, something true.
B000003PWZ|5.0|Excellent album for a mix of the &quot;classic&quot; Animals sound and some of the more bluesy material. Once you fall in love with this album and &quot;The Story of The Animals&quot; (another compilation album) try other albums like &quot;Animalisms&quot; and &quot;Roadrunners&quot;. If you like the material from the late 60s (more psychedelic sounding) then try &quot;Love Is&quot;, &quot;Never the Twain Shall Meet&quot;, &quot;Winds of Change&quot;, and &quot;Every One of Us&quot;
B000002J27|5.0|Este album es excelente. En vez de seguir con la tpica frmula de los aos anteriores (la mal llamada &quot;era de Gabriel&quot;, puesto que la influencia musical de los otros miembros era importantsima), Genesis busca un sonido distinto, que combina sus races progresivas con elementos del jazz, logrando una rica mezcla acompaada muy bien de la voz de Collins, un poco ms dulce que la de Gabriel. El liderazgo de Collins se hace notar en todas las composiciones, en este album Collins demuestra en forma ms clara sus virtudes en la batera y sus influencias jazzsticas. La incorporacin de estos elementos resulta en un sonido nico, realmente original, que logra de mejor manera los intentos de otras bandas que suenan demasiado a grupo de Jazz fusin.<BR>Es un album que pese a ser ms &quot;comercial&quot; que otros, da un atrevido paso adelante en la bsqueda de otro tipo de sonido. La interpretacin de los integrantes en sus instrumentos ha mejorado considerablemente y se logra crear una atmsfera que combine aspectos de su msica de antao con elementos ms meldicos. <BR>Yo lo incluira dentro de los mejores de Genesis, aunque personalmente encuentro mejor a su siguiente album, Wind And Wuthering.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I heard three tracks from this on the radio, and decided to buy it.  It's a great CD, an American OK Computer, and I recommend it if you enjoy albums, not songs.

B000000H42|5.0|This is a fine black metal album with fantastic lead and rhythm guitar work from Michael Denner and Hank Shermann.  King Diamond's voice has a Halford-esque quality to it when he hits the high notes, but is still original in its own right.  The music itself isn't dark, but the lyrics certainly are, focusing on demonic incarnations and meetings with the devil.  Obviously, you can't take that sort of stuff seriously.  Just don't play this at your grandmother's 80th birthday party...  <br />In summation, this album kicks.  A necessary listen for the devout metalhead.
B0000640SA|5.0|This movie is great. It is extremly interesting. It will leave you with so many diffrent thoughts. The actors are great. Joe Pantoliano, i think was what made the movie great, he plays Teddy who may or may not be Lenny's pal. Lenny is the main character played by Guy Pearce. He has a memory problem. Anyway watch it for yourself because it would take me too long to write all about it.
B00005JL3A|1.0|THE worst i mean worst movie ever,it lacks story plot devolopement and coherence.its pointless,you could care less if any of these characters live or die.plus it went to such lofty video game idea for a movie (they should have stuck with horror master GEORGE\\"DAWN OF THE DEAD \\"REMERO)AND THE SUPPOSED PAY OFF ENDING IS THE MOST AWFUL CGI I'VE EVER SEEN IN MOVIE HISTORY.whats supposed to be a completely menacing  \\"licker\\" ends up being a joke,i've seen scarier stuff on a tele-tubbies episode.this dvd would make a better drink coaster,its too bad you cant go lower than one star on your reviews cause i feel cheated in even giving it one star,dont rent or buy,cause this is 100 minutes of your life you can never get back
B00005V3Z4|4.0|\\"Bubble Boy\\" Jake Gyllenhaal did an excellent job of portraying a really disturbed kid. This movie is a bit quirky and dark (no pun intended), but is still entertaining. Some people may not get the ending, but I thought it was rather original.<br />...
B0000028WD|2.0|I usually do not buy CD's based on 1 video. However I saw \\"My Back Pages\\" featuring Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, and George Harrison and was blown away. I figured with all the great Dylan Music there was no way I would be disappointed. Guess what? I won't be buying anymore CD's based on one video.<br />This was such a letdown. With some exceptions a lot of the music here is rather obscure cuts from Dylan's past. John Mellencamp's version of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" wasn't bad to start off with. But then we're treated with a series of watered down versions, some of which have no resemblence to the original. \\"Blowin in the Wind\\" by Stevie Wonder, \\"The Times they are'a Changing\\" by Tracy Chapman, and especially \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\" by Johnny Cash & June Carter were bland and tasteless. You would think that there would be no way Neil Young could butcher a song like \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (my personal Dylan Favorite.) Yet, it came out as probably the worst rendition ever, even below Mahogany Rush's late 70's attempt.<br />So why did I rate this a 2 star instead of a 1. Roger McGuinn showed up late and brought the concert back to respectability with \\"Mr Tamborine Man.\\" And of course, as mentioned before, \\"My back Pages\\" is a GREAT, GREAT, version. But these bits of excellance could never justify the cost of this CD. Please, pass it up. There is way too much good Dylan stuff out there...
0385503954|5.0|This will not be a summary, but a recommendation!  Ian McEwan's novel Atonement is one of the very best works of literature to be presented in the last fifty years.  Some may find this a bit strong, but it is true nevertheless.  Atonement reads as a fairy tale, with complex characters who mature wisely, yet strangely.  The book has a purpose, not a plot, and the characters know it.  That Ian McEwan's books are not as widely read as John Grisham's, Tom Clancy's or James Patterson's is a pity.  The world could use more books like Atonement, which demands the mind's full attention and the heart's strings.  This is not the easiest book to read, as the paragraphs are thick with description and there is little dialogue; however, McEwan masters the art of writing with his style.  It is worth every penny and thought invested.  This little review is a toast to Ian McEwan, for enriching the minds of the interested instead of interesting the minds of the rich.
B00000255F|5.0|I was in high school in NJ in 1972, and my big sister was playing the &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park&quot; album and I was hooked.  In 1974 I took the &quot;Wild Innocent &amp; E Street Shuffle&quot; album to college and tried to convert all the kids in my dorm.  I thought &quot;Rosalita&quot; was higher art than Beethoven.  I waited longingly for the next Springsteen album.  In '75, I got &quot;Born to Run&quot; the minute it was released.  I was let down.  Yes, it rocked, but Bruce's voice had gone hoarse, and the light humor was gone.  But it was Bruce, and I listened over and over again.  Over time, I was transformed.  It is now forever ingrained, fabulous tunes of power, of desperation, of escape, of romance and broken romance.  Bruce single-handedly moved Rock into the big leagues during the era of otherwise awful disco.  I'm listening right now and every tune holds it glory.  If you are building a Bruce collection, start here.  Almost as essential is the followup, &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;.  &quot;Greetings&quot; is raw but fun, and &quot;Wild Innoncent E Street Shuffle&quot; is also necessary.  The first 4 albums, that's what you need.  &quot;Born in the USA&quot; made him a big time star, but these were his high water mark.
B000000H64|5.0|If you're a fan of metal, whether it's the most vicious death metal or something accessable as nu-metal I suggest you buy FF's sophomore album, Demanufacture, if you haven't already gotten it. Although it dates from 1995 it's very ahead of its time and an inspiration of many of the bands you probably know about today.<br /> In the band's second album, vocalist Burton C. Bell chills out his SOANM era growls and screams, but with the same death metal intensity, delivers a haunting voice with the emotions of Geoff Tate (Queensryche), early James Hetfield (Metallica) and even the bellows of Ozzy. <br /> Something about this album unlike what's around these days from other bands is that NO song is filler. Every song has been well thought-out and rewritten until it was what the band wanted. But there are \\"best\\" tracks:<br />Self Bias Resistor and Zero Signal go together as two rare things: bleak (...) but sung under cathartic, moving instrumentation. Replica is probably the most telling song of our society today, as it explains what becomes of an unwanted baby as he/she grows up (...) But the real surprise is \\"A Therapy For Pain\\", which will bring you to tears, based on a suicide-attempt(?)/drug overdose(?)/(or just altogether near death experience) of Bell.<br /> It's very disheartening that management problems and rivalry between some of the members brought the band to an end, but I expect that their importance in the music world will bring them back together on a reunion album or a tribute album by  artists that, like every FF fan, believed they played a huge part in the 90s metal scene.
6305095574|1.0|This  movie  has  hype.  Too  much  hype.  Now  I  rented  this  movie  either  expecting  to  be  scared  or  entertained  by  cheese  factor  at  the  least.  But  neither  happened  sadly  enough.  The  time  I  spent  watching  this  bore  is  forever  lost,  and  I  really  hated  it.  I  watched  EVIL  DEAD  at  12:00  Midnight,  alone,  and  not  once  did  it  even  give  me  chills.  Don't  get  me  wrong,  I  am  all  for  good  low  budget  movies,  but  this  one  just  isn't  good.  The  demons  are  just  so  stupid  looking  and  the  plot  is  beyond  idiotic.  The  characters  are  thin  to  say  at  the  least  and  the  main  character  Ash  is  just  plain  overrated.  I  have  heard  the  sequels  are  better  than  this  one,  but  I  won't  take  my  chances  since  this  one  bombed  so  horrifically.<br />   Oh,  and  for  a  special  mention,  that  one  scene  right  after  the  girl  got  raped  by  a  tree,(  yes  a  tree  )  she  runs  back  to  the  house  screaming,  the  most  annoying  scream  imaginable  by  the  human  mind.  That  harrowing  scene  is  a  reminder  that  EVIL  DEAD  is  among  the  most  painful  overhyped  horror  movies.<br />1  out  of  4  stars.

This film is different than the first three Chucky films, because Andy is not in the movie. <br />If you haven't seen The Bride Of Chucky aka Child's Play 4 I suggest renting the video from your local video store. I also suggest that you should watch the Child's Play movies in order so that you know all about Chucky.
B000066NW0|5.0|I just got my copy of \\"Let Go\\" a few weeks ago and I have not been able to stop listening to it.  It's easily one of the best CD's I've ever heard.  Every single song is insanely catchy , plus they are all co-written by Avril herself. Avril Lavigne is just what the pop world needs, a female singer who is unafraid to be herself when so many other singers are fake and manufactured.  I recommend that everyone who hears the debut single \\"Complicated\\" and likes it go out and buy the album.  It'll be one of the most enjoyable records you ever hear.  As for Avril, I hope that she continues to entertain us in the years to come. Rock on Avril, Rock on!
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is about the Soul of Combat Soldiers.  In contrast to most Hollywood war movies, Blackhawk Down is highly respectful of the series of moral decisions that human beings make in allowing themselves to be placed into a Battle such as this.  Early in the movie Ranger Sgt. Eversman is talking to his fellow Rangers about their presence in Somalia,  'It seems to me that we can either watch the country destroy itself (the famine and coexisting anarchy having resulted in 300,000 deaths) or we can try to help.'  <BR>After the battle Delta Sgt. Hooten, talking with<BR>Eversman, simply and honestly describes the morality of the professional warrior. Hooten recalls he was asked by his civilian friends, \\"'Hoot, why do you do it?  Are you some kind of war junkie?'  I don't say a damn thing because they wouldn't get it.  It's about the men next to you. That's all.\\"  This moral position may be mentioned in other movies but the makers of Blackhawk Down have eloquently captured it in the behavior of the soldiers in the film.  There is even an empathic portrayal of the rage of the Somali militia at the American implication that their culture was so simple and so defective that foreigners would believe they were entitled intrude as they saw fit.  There is also an ironic reference to the moral judgement of the Clinton administration. General Garrison is speaking with his officers about the tactical plans for the American action,  \\"I requested gunships and armor to provide additional back-up, but Washington, in its infinite wisdom, declined, saying it would be 'Too High Profile.'\\"  <br />This is a very stirring and powerful movie.
B00006690G|4.0|Rude, obnoxious, and purposefully offensive, the talent that's inherent in this cd is nearly passed by, by most people, thanks to the afformentioned things. but behind it all is a strong musical compliation that's enjoyable to listen to from start to finish. That is, if you're not easily offended. the songs are different enough that each one has a new sound, and there is rarely a track on the cd that isn't instantly likeable.

B000069HKH|5.0|Someone mentioned that listening to the Rising was better than a week in church. I agree. Bruce Springsteen is an American icon and profit. He is one of the few who can be honestly profound and also remain convincingly down to earth. Just a kid from the streets who can express in a simple song the angst of a nation. Bruce takes us to the river and rather than washing away our sins he forces us to honestly look at our own reflection. He is a unique voice in the wilderness (and the music's pretty good too).
B00004KD1L|4.0|I own this album simply due to the fact that &quot;At The River&quot; appears on it. as for the rest of the tracks, well, some of them are great (&quot;Dusk You &amp; I&quot;, &quot;If Everybody Looked The Same&quot;, to name a few), but others - particularly &quot;I See You Baby&quot; - are mildly annoying. If you have to have a reason to buy this album it would be &quot;At The River&quot;. It is seduction at its purest form. I haven't met any guy who did not appreciate this track on tapes (or CDs) I've made for them... especially in those special moments when the CD's supposed to be played *wink wink*.
B000069HJM|4.0|It's back in print! Hooray! After being MIA from record shops for several years, Supertramp's 1987 album, &quot;Free As A Bird,&quot; has been re-issued &amp; re-mastered, for which Tramp fans, especially those who missed the album the first time around, can be grateful. &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; barely made a dent on the album charts 15 years ago, and the band couldn't even tour for it in North America, but it's a great album all the same. After the serious tone of 1985's &quot;Brother Where You Bound,&quot; Rick Davies &amp; company decided for the follow-up album to lighten things up and have fun. &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; is a very catchy, upbeat, sometimes dance-oriented Tramp album that's perfect to play at a party, or cruise down the highway to. Songs like &quot;It's Alright&quot; &amp; &quot;I'm Beggin' You&quot; will get you on the dancefloor in no time. The title song, a minor hit, is a Supertramp concert staple, with a great sing-along chorus. And there's more great jazz/pop from the band in tracks like &quot;Not The Moment,&quot; &quot;Thing For You,&quot; and the calypso-influenced finale, &quot;An Awful Thing To Waste.&quot;After &quot;Free As A Bird,&quot; Supertramp took a whole decade off before resuming work with 1997's &quot;Some Things Never Change,&quot; and the &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; album itself went out of print for several years. But now that it's back, DON'T miss out. &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; is Supertramp at their most fun, and a great buried treasure from this great band. :-)
B00005O5JV|3.0|I just watched this film tonight.  In my honest opinion, its a \\"Clueless\\" wannabe.  I couldn't help but compare the two films, and I hate to say this film comes up short.  But, Reese Witherspoon is gorgeous and did a great job.  The plot is somewhat predictable, and alittle too convenient, but it still works.  This is a feel-good, \\"girl power\\" comedy film.<br />I would recommend this film to any girl/woman who has been dumped by someone they considered the love of their life.  You just might feel better afterwards (for a while maybe).
B000069CWE|1.0|I was highly disappointed when I found out that LP's new cd was only a remake of the songs on their last cd. LP was my favorite band. I listened to Hybrid Theory all the time. Now their new cd has disappointed me. I loved their style and now they've ruined it by making it hip hop. If you truly love Hybrid Theory as I do, then I wouldn't recommend Reanimation because you will be disappointed at the change.
B000002V07|3.0|\\"So Tonight that I Might See,\\" contains Mazzy Star's breakthrough single \\"Fade Into You.\\"  Nevertheless, it doesn't hold up to \\"Among My Swan,\\" the excellent album that was released after it.  The problem mostly lies in the songwriting.  After \\"Fade,\\" the album becomes very uneven, hitting other high points like \\"Five String Serenade,\\" \\"Bells Ring\\" and \\"Into Dust\\" but also foundering with clunkers like \\"Mary of Silence\\" and the title track.  Hope Sandoval's remarkable voice, so haunting on the best material, sounds strained and remote on the lesser tracks.<br />Overall, an uneven album that nevertheless put Mazzy Star and unique singer Hope Sandoval on the map.
B000002UTY|5.0|Despite the hard critism..., this album is a must for every psychedelica/west coast fan. And in my opinion, it beats all the albums by the Dead, Airplane & Miller. <BR>Much has been said about the contents already, so i will focus on the three different cd releases.<br />1) The Capitol 1988 cd release (which is longly deleted) is still the best sounding issue. Apart from some scratchy noises in the first eight seconds of it, this one sounds bright without getting hissy. The booklet has only only a front and a back but the legendary front picture looks great (as it did on the first lp release).<br />2) The Beat goes on (BGO) 1992 (also deleted since a few years) is by far the worst cd issue. The sound is extremely hissy and misses a nice high end. The booklet is much more informative (a story about the band history) but the front picture looks ugly. The bright colours have been made really dark.<br />3) The Sons of Mercury 2cdbox by Rhino in 1994, has a stunning sound quality. But unfortunately it only captures the WDYL single version and side 2 of the LP. Too bad because this one even beats the '88 cd. <br />4) The EMI electrola 2000 re-issue almost sounds as good as the '88 release but it seems that this one is digitally denoised or something. The booklet looks like the '88 one as well (bright colours) and has an informative story too. Considering that this is the only one still available, this is the easiest option. But for those who care for the \\"analog feeling\\"....
B000005JAK|4.0|&quot;Candy Apple Grey&quot; was legendary punk band Husker Du's first major label release after years of hard/fast punk albums featuring their unique melodic touch.  Most of &quot;Grey&quot; fits right in with the band's previous work, as songs like &quot;Crystal,&quot; &quot;Dead Set on Destruction&quot; and &quot;Sorry Somehow,&quot; roar along at a breakneck pace with bleak down-and-out lyrical imagery.  Right in the middle of the proceedings, however, the band throws a couple of curveballs in the form of two Bob Mould-penned accoustic numbers, &quot;Too Far Down,&quot; and &quot;Hardly Getting Over It.&quot;  These two songs are gorgeous and would marking the beginning of s diversification of Husker Du's sound that would result in the resounding triumph of their next album, &quot;Warehouse: Songs and Stories,&quot; as well as mark the path that Mould would eventually take on his early solo career.  Some long time fans of the band were disappointed by Mould allegedly &quot;going soft,&quot; but there is nothing wimpy about his accoustic side, as he has proven time and time again since then.<br />Overall, &quot;Candy Apple Grey&quot; is a first rate punk rock album with a maturity that is rare for the genre and has allowed it to stand the test of time.
B00006950W|2.0|I can tell you R.E. is nothing like its \\"hyped\\" up to be. advertisments make it look like the scariest movie of our time. I admit, it was cool to see a bunch of infected zombies walkin around eating people, but the background of the movie was horrible. The entire first 45 minutes were the most boring 45 minutes of any movie. it gets better, but the zombies arent scary at all and it just needs more suspense. the entire movie was a sinch to predict. Thats what makes it bad. If you go to see a horror movie and you can predict when there will be a zombie at every turn, its not gonna be that scary. the graphics were ok, but it just didnt have that \\"ew >:-(\\" and \\"ahhhhhhhh <=-0\\" like the game. the point i'm trying to make is that the 2nd R.E. movie is gonna need a lot of work to get a good rating from me.
1881273156|5.0|This book far exceeds John Gray's Mars and Venus series on many levels.  Each part of a relationship really is brought into five language choices.

The information within the book can be used on many relationship levels - spouse, friends, and even co-workers.<br />Even if you think \\"a love language for my co-workers?\\" this book will show you how to speak to them.  Some of your co-workers need you to speak their language in order to be understood.  This book puts you one step ahead of the game for work as well as your personal life.<br />Half the fun for couples is finding out what language your spouse speaks.  After determining the language, an entirely new realm opens for you to explore the possibilities.<br />Couples should read this book to really understand how to speak to their mate.

0385495323|5.0|I'm sure there are countless technical books that deal with cryptography in a lot more detail. But as an introduction to the concepts and as a reading experience, The Code Book is a paragon of popular science writing. <br />Singh is able to communicate all the basic ideas behind cryptography as well as the historical events that both led to and were the result of the cryptographic &quot;arms race.&quot;<br />What's more, Singh includes a cipher challenge at the end of the book in order to have readers try their own hands at codebreaking.<br />My only wish is that Singh had given more explanation of the homophonic substitution cipher, but that's a minor quibble. I recommend this book without reservation to anyone who will listen.
B0000640VO|5.0|I loved this movie. Second only to Withnail and I for my favorite foreign film.<br />As far as the &quot;6th grade humor&quot; mentioned in one review on this page, one really would have to perform feats of perceptual gymnastics to focus exclusively on the one or two orgasm jokes.  There are only a few of those moments in the film which are a reflection of Amelie's inexperience/innocence for her age, 23, whereas the hilarity begins practically from the first screen, extends throughout the film and is all in the POV.<br />The colors are great. The shots are great. If you like humor that comes from an odd POV, you'll like this. The only romantic comedy in a long time that hasn't left me yawning.
B000069HKH|2.0|I assume its pretty hard to write a whole album about an event such as 9/11.  Im sure Bruce Springsteen's heart was in it, but the music is mediocre.  No anthems, no raw sound his fans are used to, and the lyrics are pretty cliche.  Sounds over produced.  None of the instruments are really aloud to shine through.  Some people will like it.  After all, they are great musicians.  I am a musician and am very open minded about all kinds of music; but I couldnt really find anything that grabbed me in this album.  Its definately not the Boss we have heard in the past.  And I don't think the Boss on this album comes close.<BR>One track stood out to me, &quot;paradise&quot;.
B000001E18|4.0|Give U2 credit for not settling into a comfortable groove after the massive success of &quot;Ach-Tung Baby,&quot; and just releasing more albums in that same mold.  On &quot;Zooropa,&quot; Bono and the boys decided to experiment with their sound and take it in unusual new directions.  And while it doesn't always work, enough of it does to excuse them for not producing another single as catchy as &quot;Mysterious Ways.&quot;<br />The album is best characterized by &quot;Numb,&quot; in which seldom-heard-from guitarist The Edge mumbles the barely sensical spoken word lyrics over a gorgeous synthesizer background.  Other oddities include the slowly building opening title track, the strange vocals on &quot;Daddy's Going to Pay for Your Crashed Car,&quot; and the Johnny Cash collaboration &quot;The Wanderer,&quot; with some bizarre apocalyptic imagery that closes things on an appropriate note.  Even the more conventional songs, like &quot;Babyface,&quot; &quot;Stay,&quot; have an otherwordly quality about them.<br />Overall, &quot;Zooropa&quot; is not the place for casual fans to start their U2 collection.  Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile challenge for the already commited.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|With the many great films of 2001, none were more inovating, mind-boggling and truly great than this film. Without even knowing the story, the fact that the film move backwards is what sets this apart from the rest of the croud and what keeps you watching. There is something for eveyone in this film, action, drama and suspence.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Phil Collins is one of my all-time favorite musicians of all time. Only Peter Gabriel in my opinion rivals Phil. This fantastic collection of his music from 1981-1998 is what I said 'FANTASTIC!'. It's a great collection of most of Phils biggest hits from the ominous thundering drums of the angry bad blood vibe of 'In The Air Tonight' to the Prince 1999-esque 'Sussudio' to the ever so timeless Another Day In Paradise(One of my childhood favorites). This CD even has cuts from his more obscure albums like 1993 incredibly underrated Both Sides and 1996s Dance Into The Light also vastly underrated. This CD could've included Do You Remember, I Missed Again &amp; Father To Son and it could've included more songs from the Both Sides and Dance Into The Light albums and even some more new songs and made this collection a double album but the exclusions of these songs is made up for by the inclusions of his hit songs from soundtracks that are long out of print. Examples of these are the upbeat Two Hearts, Easy Lover &amp; the intimate and powerful Against All Odds which is one of Phils most beautiful ballads to date. This CD also has a new song called True Colors. True Colors was originally done by Cindi Lauper in 1986 which was a hit. While I like the original Phil Collins improves it with his own spin to it by even adding some Celtic Uillian pipes for an even better suprise. I hope Phil adds some more worldly sounds in his music just like Peter Gabriel does. Dance Into The Light was a great first step in my opinion. Even then Phil will always remain one of my favorites. I personally think this CD was very well put together and is a worthy collection for the fanbase. Even if it excludes some of Phils hits this CD has songs from 80s soundtracks that have been long out of print. This CD is definately a must. This CD will definately keep me satisfied at least while we all wait for the eagerly anticipated TESTIFY that is due later this year.
B00003W8NM|5.0|An excellent action movie with a physcological thriller effect that comments on the current tendency of society to obsess over modern-day conveniences and desires to live a posh lifestyle of wealth, self advancement, and comfort.  The paradoxical lives of the lead character's alter-ego in contrast to his depressing modern-day desire for self-improvent and perfection shed light and warning on values of the American public. How consumerism and marketing has brainwashed us and how we have lost senses of ur true selves and the things that makes us individuals.  How we strive to live to the expectations of how we think others will percieve us.  And how the male psyche has been watered down by political correctness, feminization, and ironically our own self perceptions of manhood.  The movie is a satire on how we strive to control our lives against fate and how we depress ourselves trying to live up to something we are not.  And how we give up on being ourselves.  Brad Pitt plays an excellent role.  One of his best acting performances I have ever seen.  The movie has an element of \\"Blue Velvet\\" feeling to it of a twisted psychosexual control of the male ego.
B00006690G|4.0|Much of what em does is reminiscent of naturalism, the European literary movement of the late nineteenth century. His premise is that the dysfunctional side of life, and his life in particular, are artistically appealing and certainly worth the money you spend on a CD. I think that basically this premise works. Life can be seen from many different perspectives, all of which deserve the attention of the curious, and all of which add something to the understanding of the human variety on this planet.<br />I think that \\"Superman\\" is a cool song, even if it stems from the inability to relate to adult women as fellow human beings. The dysfunctional nature of em's relationship with women is the origin of this song, but it still works independently of its origin as a put down of shallow, lying, cheating, and money-grubbing women.<br />\\"Drips\\" is a bizarre song of the same women-dissing genre, in which we learn that Obie did not use protection, facilitating the spread of infection carried by Denise, who is em's girlfriend, according to the song. Obie does a good job rapping. The guy has talent.<br />\\"Without Me\\" has been played so much that it is even unnecessary for me to say much about it. Em has the satisfaction of telling people off, and calling Mobie a [name]. <br />\\"White America\\" is a pretty decent effort at feigning humility. What he says in so many words is that he is a superstar because of his race. But in reality, he is a superstar because he can rap. People are not curious about him because he is a white rapper, they are curious about him because he is a gifted rapper.<BR>At the end of the album, on the track \\"My Dad Gone Crazy,\\" em drops the act and plainly calls himself a \\"genius.\\" He also says that when he speaks, it's tounge-in-cheek, so it's easy to misinterpret his verses at first. This progression of thought makes me dizzy. Are we to assume that he always speaks tounge-in-cheek? Is he ever serious?<br />Finally, I was not that crazy about em's allusions to 9-11. Here I have in mind the track \\"My Dad Gone Crazy.\\" Either he does not understand the seriousness of what took place, or I simply take 9-11 too hard, because I could not help but find his irreverent references revolting. He is way too smart and sensitive to use 9-11 this way, and I believe this was not the most apt use of a significant event in world politics--a subject about which em knows little.<br />Overall, I obviously recommend this record. Em is one of the most talented rappers today, and he and Dre make a good team. If you are an adult, then you should listen to the uncensored version of this album. So if you want Shady, this is what this album gives you: a little  bit of irreverence mixed with some hard lyrics.
B000069HKH|5.0|Finally music that has heart and soul, and tells a story...there is a stroy being told and its one of affirmation and faith and hope..
B000002KHH|4.0|Hard to believe, but more people now know Ozzy Osbourne as a sitcom star than as the lead singer for Black Sabbath.  Even harder to believe, it has now been 32 years since Oz and Sabbath released their best album, the lumbering \\"Paranoid.\\"  The first half of the album features Sabbath at their best.  The eight minute \\"War Pigs/Luke's Wall,\\" starts things off with a slow moving bang before giving way to the snappy classic \\"Paranoid,\\" the band's signature song.  The accoustic \\"Planet Caravan\\" will never be mistaken for Led Zeppelin, but it leads into the ultimate dinosaur rock anthem \\"Iron Man.\\"  Side two contains mostly lengthy jams with lyrics as ridiculous as titles like \\"Jack the Stripper\\" and \\"Rat Salad\\" would indicate.<br />Overall, \\"Paranoid\\" is remarkable period piece awaiting discovery by a generation who only know Ozzy as a TV dad.

6305531374|5.0|Halloween H20 is what I would like to call the official sequel to Halloween II. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode only to find that Michael is not just after her but also her son.<BR>If you happen to be someone who has not seen Halloween 3-6, it wouldn't be a bad idea to skip from Halloween II to Halloween H20 considering that this movie takes place 20 years after the events of Halloween II. This film probably has more of what the original Halloween fans are looking for but the previous sequels are still worth viewing.<BR>WARNING: Do not let the ending of H20 fool you!
6305841861|5.0|Evil runs wild in the exciting comedy-horror favorite \\"Evil Dead: Dead by Dawn\\". In the deep woods, a traveler named Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda find an abandoned cabin and accidentally unleashes an unspeakable evil force from the pages of the Necronomicon, the ancient Book of the Dead. Now, Ash must resist this strange evil's brutal torments in order to save his soul and send the evil force back to where it came from. Director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man 1 & 2) horror spectacle is an amazing combination of creepy stylish horror and hilarious slapstick comedy. \\"Evil Dead 2\\" is more of a big budget remake of the original \\"Evil Dead\\" (1982) than a sequel. Its storyline progresses smoothly and offers some good scares and very entertaining moments. The cult favorite contains some terrific camerawork, effective visuals effects, immense laughs and memorable gross-out scenes. Bruce Campbell's vivid performance as unlikely hero Ash is another good highlight of the 1987 film.<br /><br />For fans of the horror genre, \\"Evil Dead II\\" is a highly recommended purchase. The cult 1987 favorite is presented in both standard full screen and 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen formats. Its picture quality is reasonably sharp with good contrast. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is rather enjoyable with lively surround effects. This DVD contains a detailed audio commentary with filmmaker Sam Raimi, star Bruce Campbell and production crew, the amusing 30-minute \\"The Gore the Merrier\\" behind-the-scenes documentary, still galleries, original theatrical trailer and a short preview of \\"Evil Dead: Hail to the King\\" video game. The animated menus are excellent. Overall, \\"Evil Dead II\\" scores a surprising \\"B+\\".
6304082428|5.0|I've always liked the book and usually found the movie adaptations lacking in something. What - I wasn't sure, but they managed to just 'miss' a great rating ... not this version.<BR>Mr. Darcy always seemed to be a reserved romantic gentlemen, but Colin Firth's portrayal is HOT! Smoky eyes and a passion held in extreme check as only a proper English gentleman can be ...<BR>Absolutely THE version to own.<BR>I started to watch only the first two tapes [to stretch the enjoyment over two or three nights]. Lots of luck! I watched the whole thing in one sitting! I'll do it again.<BR>The perfect film for a rainy Sunday afternoon ...
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce-fans find in this record a synthese of one years'reflections about a tragedy. I'm european and maybe can't achieve to understand some feelings about september 11th, but i understand that this record is all about loss and reconstruction, friendship between different cultures. No political strategies, just real life of real people. My personal favourite is \\"My city of ruins\\": compared to the version on \\"Tribute to heroes\\" it's like the time is passing and a very mature and aware man is talking; i considere this song like \\"Darkness on the age of town\\" more then twenty years after. With a hope of rising and reconstruction.
0066620996|5.0|Especially looking ahead into 2003, many of us are wondering: \\"Is it possible for a good, mediocre or even terrible organization to become great?\\" Apparently 'YES' -- as argued in Good to Great, a worthy contribution to our concerns. Two notable strengths are 1) stressing real commitment to stated values; and 2) moving beyond simplistic organizational psychology toward real psychology. In psychology, the newest realization not only includes accepting the reality of individual differences and team building, but also understands what is called \\"constructive pessimism\\" (as in Ed Chang's edited books on optimism-pessimism) -- Optimal management intelligence can see nonlinear pathways and operates beyond the old positive--negative polarity in a new zone of thinking that is both realistic and creative. Meanwhile, simplistic 'positive thinking' is now seen as unrealistic optimism that is dangerous to the US economy.
B00005YUNY|5.0|The presence of the symphonic orchestra give a new dimension in the music of Yes. Especially when it's played by some enthousiast and young musicians. The version of \\"gates of delirium\\" is incredible. The new songs are very good except for one, but the setlist is great. The qualtiy of the picture and sound is excellent.
6305971099|4.0|Halloween 5 has the same plot of part 4 with Michael going after his niece and Dr. Sam Loomis still in hot pursuit of the masked murderer. This movie delivers as much as Halloween 4 and the ending of Halloween 5 is unexpected for anyone watching this film for the first time.
B000008LOV|5.0|This is music, you hear acoustic guitars, bass, drums, harmonica, no drum machines, and only a few fine touches on synthesizers (?) courtesy of Jeff Lynne. And, voices, there's real singing here, choruses, a true delight. The strongest track to me is the first, Handle With Care, a true anthem about the cost of living and the desire to carry on no matter what. All 5 Wilburys contribute vocally and the union of Harrison's slide and Dylan's harmonica is a much awaited reunion of friends, colleagues, both of whom helped launch rock and roll as art. And even if it is art, it is not that serious, while Rattled, Last Night, and Margarita (ties the best second song spot with Tweeter And The Monkeyman and Congratulations) are plain fun, Dirty World, Heading For The Light and of course The End Of The Line display more serious lyrics, kind of tongue in check. After all, these guys sum up more than a 100 years of music together. <BR>A must. She wrote a long letter on a short piece of paper.
B00000IOSU|5.0|It's very hard to talk about \\"Mirrorball\\": beeing a sort of synthesis of McLachlan's music so far, this record embodies all her qualities. Too many emotions come to the surface by listening to it: most of them are general human and others - i would say - expecially female. Favourites: the sequence \\"Hold on\\" - \\"Good enough\\", expecially this one: you understand why the autor talked about it as her best song, years ago, and why she has such an emotional attachement on it. \\"Adia\\" and \\"Sweet surrender\\" have a new dimension compared to the \\"Surfacing\\" version, \\"Ice cream\\" and \\"Fumbling towards ecstasy\\" are pure sensuality, even if a very different one. \\"The path of thorns\\" seems to me a beautyful slice of folkmusic. Sarah McLachlan has a very deep, strong, maybe contradictory connection with her fans. Is it to much to say that she is the best female songwriter of our times (and our 30-years old generation!)? I don't think so!
B000003Z12|5.0|I love my rock and roll, and Neal Schon and his band Journey have been a big part of that in my life.  That being said, this has got to be about the most soothing, beautiful CD I have ever heard.  Without a vocal note in it, it still speaks to the soul.<br />I just got this CD this past year.  I still know the beautiful first track &quot;Big Moon&quot; the best for a very good reason.  My wife and I often put on this CD this past winter and spring to go to sleep to, and it was so soothing and relaxing that we'd both often be asleep by the second or third track!<br />However, please don't take that to mean that this CD is boring...it is anything but that!  It truly does speak to my soul.  Tracks like &quot;Cool Breeze&quot;, &quot;Boulevard Of Dreams&quot;, and especially &quot;Send Me An Angel&quot; are so beautiful and emotional that they are almost beyond description.  The album as a whole is a soothing guitar masterpiece.<br />This is indeed Neal at his most mature and mellow.  While I love to hear him rock out more than anything, this is a side to him that is equally as good.  Take it from me and the other reviewers here who rave about this album.  You just have to hear it to believe it.
B00005QJDG|5.0|I have never studied a group so thoroughly before purchasing a cd.  My interest grew due to the inability to pigeonhole this group and the rabid fan following.  Against recommendations I purchased this cd first because I tend to like the feel of a live album and get to hear a \\"best of\\" from the group.  It has received daily play for the past couple weeks and gets better each time.  If you like Iron Maiden, Rush, Yes, and pre-Black album Metallica give this band a try.  But don't just skip through the cd expecting an instant revelation.  Skimming the sound will give the feel of a hair band, but they are so much deeper.  I avoided this group in the past because I thought they were a hair band, but thank ...reviewers for opening my eyes.
B00005KHJV|5.0|This movie is a classic that should be in everyone's collection. The extended edition DVD (with extra footage) is worth it for anyone who really likes this film. If you are thinking of getting Halloween on DVD, get the one that says Extend Edition on the upper portion of the DVD cover.
B000069HKH|3.0|While I was looking forward to The Boss' new Cd, I was rather disappionted with the final product. It's easy enough to listen to, but lacks the fire of earlier efforts such as Born To Run or Born In The USA. Contributions from The E street Band are nearly non existant. Bruce could have used studio musicians and come out with the same CD. Only long time Bruce fans willl love this one. After 18 years, I expected more.
6305177473|4.0|This movie is really good. I saw it when I was about 13 years old at the theater. I love it! I like the whole nineties feel of it. The first Parent Trap was okay, but a little out-dated to me. This version is more with the times. And it still has that happy ending the first one had. (I won't give it away!)<br />I agree with one particular viewer of this movie, when she or he said that Lindsay Lohen did an amazing job playing both twins and it wad her first movie. She did do an amazing job!<br />I thought the woman who played Hallie and Annie's father's fiance (who was she, anyway?) was hilaurious, espically when they went camping. She banged two sticks together to ward away &quot;mountain lions&quot; I believe it was. And when she sprayed sugar and water on herself, thinking it was bug spray, I couldn't stop laughing. <br />Go buy this movie. It's one choice you won't regret.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Take a time machine back to the original is my advise. The original is far superiour. The only thing better was the morlocks. Guy pierce's performance is bad, his character isnt nearly as likeable as rod taylors in the original. The Effects are cool but it's not enough to save this movie. Buy the original!!
6305313687|5.0|I don't know if controversial movies tend to be better than ones that are not, but like \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" or \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" controversial films leave nothing behind.  They have a tendency to throw everyhting at you at once, in a sort of \\"... you\\" kind of style.  \\"American History X\\" does exactly this.  <BR>The film has striking and stirring social issues.  The film, about a neo-nazi skinhead, trying to save his brother from the path that lead him to his own demise, is so rash and open that it can shock anyone.  It is more than just a story or social issues and racism, but it is also a story of family.  This part was what made the film exceptional.  The film captivated the pure emotion that a family faces in times of great tragedy and confusion.  <BR>I, personally, am drawn to movies about social issues becuase I enjoy discussing social inequalities.  In my sociology class, we discussed whether or not a person can be anyone they want if they were in seperate living environments.  This film made me re-analyze my original hypothesis.  I originally thought that a person can succeed, even under the most pressing circumstances.  This movie made me think, maybe it isn't that way.  <BR>This movie is a must-see.
B0000524CY|3.0|The beginning of this movie (I thought) was really stupid, and didn't really make much sense. But in the middle and end, it got really good. Some parts are really disgusting and scary. Well....this 12-year old girl named Reagen gets posessed by the devil (or so the thing claims). And everyone gets freaked out. They tie her to her bed so she can't hurt herself, and 2 priests come to try and get the spirit out of her.
6303481272|5.0|A very good movie.  The English dubbing was very good (I usually prefer subtitles)<BR>I recommend this movie to any anime fan.<BR>Not for children, shows sexual situations and graphic violence.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|This was a quality movie worthy of your attention.  you should at least see it once it is sure to be a classic...
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne, I believe is very talented. She can sing, songwrite, and play guitar. So what's there not to like? Back to the cd for now. The top songs here are Losing Grip, her first single Complicated, the slow ballad Tomorrow, as well as Nobody's Fool and Anything But Ordinary. Losing Grip is an angrier guitar-ridden track about not caring and moving on. Compicated explains itself. Tomorrow is a lullaby-like song about how things change for her and decision wise. In Nobody's Fool she shows off some wicked rapping skills that reminds me of Pink a bit. Anything But Ordinary is about being yourself no matter how you are and staying away from the norm. The only song that I really have a pet peeve about is Sk8er Boi which sounds like she's desperately trying to be punk, which is impossible after hearing her slow ballads, Tomorrow and I'm With You. Mobile is dull, dry, and boring about moving and changing her life. \\"This [disappoints]/Gotta get up and pack again/Gotta say goodbye to all my friends.\\" How shallow can you go? I most say though, this is an impressive debut for a seventeen-year-old (since I'm not to into the under-eighteen music maakers). Although I would recommend Michelle Branch over her or as well. Anyway, pick this up...I'd recommend pretty much anything from here except (again) Mobile and Sk8er Boi.
B000065V1V|4.0|This is really a fine album, reminding me a lot of Scary Monsters. I hope David continues along this path, doing his thing rather than trying to hit the pop-rock zeitgeist as sometimes seemed the case over the last decade. He's a brilliant artist who only needs to look inward for his inspiration. Heathen is an excellent offering.
B000063DFS|5.0|This is a great album that shound not be overlooked, even non-ozzy fans would probably like this.Theres great songs on there for everyone.<BR>The opening track (Mr.tinkertrain) is stunningly performed,i'd buy it just for that song.<BR>Also No More Tears,I Dont Want to change The World, Mama I'm Coming Home are great songs that should not be ignored.<BR>Overall, a great album that deserves a grade A.<BR>Buy it now and thank me later.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|I can't believe how terrible this movie was! It was not even worth a 4 dollar rental! it was shallow, booring, and it just stunk!
0441003257|5.0|It really will. We laugh when new connections are made in the brain, when ideas that are so dissimilar as to have never been connected are introduced. And Good Omens is just full of these kinds of weird and wonderful connections. Gaiman and Pratchett are both brilliantly funny and have no trouble throwing us meaty bones throughout the novel. Yes, it is absurd and often ridiculous, but it is also nicely salt and peppered with very astute observations which are funny  simply because they are so very true, but usually ignored as conditioning and familiarity get in the way of objectivity. This is just a very, very, funny book, so funny that at times I had difficulty reading as I was laughing so hard. I figure, if a book makes you laugh out loud when you are alone, then it has to be very funny indeed.
B00000634L|4.0|Bran Van 3000, an odd ball collection of non-musicians and some special guests, bring a debut filled with a variety of pleasant songs. Bran Van can either be considered an extremely original band or just a band who borrow styles from such diverse areas and combine them in very original ways. There are combinations of styles from country, hip hop, drum n bass, rap, rock and just about any other styles the members of bran van could get there hands on. Most of the songs on this CD I find to be incredible, however it does have a few fillers. If you're looking for something a bit different, with a ton of musical styles, this is a great album to try
B000005H40|5.0|This is one of my favorite jazz CDs.  The title song 'Blue Train' is sort of eerie with nice harmony notes in it.  'Moment's Notice' is a good tune also.  'Locomotion' (my personal favorite) is a nice upbeat tune.  The theme is a repeated pattern, with Coltrane taking off on short solo breaks and then goes into his actual solo.  After solos by Curtis Fuller, Lee Morgan, Kenny Drew, and &quot;Philly&quot; Joe Jones, it goes back to the theme.  'I'm Old Fashioned' is a laid back song, good to listen to when you're trying to relax.  'Lazy Bird' is simply an excellent song.  This is a great CD, and I recommend it to everyone.
B00005JL3A|3.0|As a fan of the Resident Evil games, I went to the film with the hopes of being scared out of my mind, sadly this did not happen.  Instead I was left sitting in the theater laughing at stuff that wasn't supposed to be laughed at.  Now upon purchasing the DVD and viewing the film a second and third time, I realize that the film isn't all that bad.  I wasn't really impressed with the audio commentaries by Paul Anderson, Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jeremy Bolt as they barely talked about the movie, but when they did talk about the movie it was insightful.  Some of the stuff they talk about in the commentary is entertaining and sometimes funny, but hardly worth it.  The featurettes are what make the disc worth it, especially Scoring Resident Evil, which talks about Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson teaming up to do the film's score.  All in all the disc is okay, I just hope there will be a director's cut sometime soon.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is my favourite of all the Beatles albums.  There probably would not have been Sgt. Pepper if it hadn't been for Revolver.  <br />Back in 1966, it was obvious that the Beatles were branching out with new sounds. They were tired of performing live (this was the year of their last tour).  Both a bad experience in the Philippines and John unintentionally offending many Americans with his comments about Jesus left a bad taste in the Beatles' mouths as touring become not only tiring but dangerous. <br />This is one of the few albums where George shines as brightly as John and Paul. His wry attack on the tax system in the UK(\\"Taxman\\") opens the album (this becomes a popular favourite on Tax Day, though I doubt Wilson and Heath appreciated being mentioned in the song!). \\"Love You To\\" may have been the 2nd song by the Beatles to feature sitar but it's probably the 1st Indian sounding songs from them (George was studying the sitar instrument under Ravi Shankar at the time of this album). \\"I Want to Tell You\\" is catchy with its unique chord changes.<br />Paul sings \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" with a string quartet which gives the song a Baroque feel. His \\"Here There and Everywhere\\" is probably the sweetest sounding song here, with fine Beach Boy-style harmonies from John and George. \\"For No One\\" is a bittersweet breakup song which features Alan Civil on trumpet. \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" sounds a lot like the music the Lovin' Spoonful and Mamas and Papas were recording.  \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" is one of the 1st rock songs to feature a brass section (3 trumpets and 3 saxophones) and I remember it becoming a big hit in 1976 the same time we were hearing \\"Silly Love Songs\\" and \\"Let Em In.\\"<br />John's songs are perhaps the most personal and introspective (his were also perhaps the most \\"psychedellic\\" sounding). \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" may be the closing track but it was actually the 1st song the Beatles worked on for this album (this was one of John's 1st \\"message\\" songs exhorting thelistener to \\"turn off your mind, relax and float downstream\\"). The title came from Ringo, whose drumming is fast and furious. \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is one of those \\"another boring day in the life\\" style songs which features some backwards guitar solos from George. \\"Dr. Robert\\" is John's ode to his dentist who introduced him and George to LSD (nobody's perfect, not even the Beatles!). \\"She Said She Said\\" tells about an encounter with Peter Fonda who felt the need to tell John \\"what it's like to be dead.\\"  \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" features wordplay from John and a cool double-tracked guitar riff from George! <br />Ringo's contribution is \\"Yellow Submarine.\\" Yes, it may be corny (I think that was the idea) but it's fun!  New sound effects are discovered in the studio for this.<br />So relax and float downstream as you listen to the Beatles as the experimental phase of their career was taking off!
B00005V9HH|5.0|\\"And like that...he's gone.\\"<br />Chilling words from one of the most chilling scenes in this brilliantly written, acted and directed film.  The Usual Suspects is the original Memento, as time is not a factor and the scenes are like a patchwork quilt, pitching you back and forth between what happened and what is happening.  Confusing, yes, but genius to write it as Christopher McQuarrie did.  He deserved the Oscar he received.  As did Kevin Spacey.<br />The Usual Suspects revolves primarily around Spacey, casting him as Verbal Kint, a gimped man with an odd, pigeon toed like walk.  The walk is brilliantly executed, as it causes the audience to feel sorrow, but at the same time have a deep-seated suspicion that something is going on, primarily because of his monotone voice and his occassional outburst that makes him seem to break from character.  Kint is the only survivor of a harsh firefight and a series of explosions that leave many dead...and one man teetering on the brink of death, repeating the words \\"Keyser Soze\\" over and over again.  Eventually, the detective heading the investigation (Chazz Palimentri in a flawlessly executed performance) gets the story (or lack thereof) out of Verbal about all the occurred before the fire in the night that left so many charred bodies in its wake.  It is a story involving drugs, deception and a lot of money. <br />By the end, everything comes together, but your brain is tied up in knots, as one question is hovering overhead...\\"How?\\"  The Usual Suspects is a chilling look into the consequences of greed and trust in a situation where no one deserves such a luxury.  It is a brilliantly written film with dynamic performances by Spacey, Palimentri, Kevin Pollak and Stephen Baldwin.  It is funny, chilling, suspenseful and action packed, making for an awesome movie experience.  <br />It will leave you breathless.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is a book that is both well conceived and well written. I don't know how some of the reviewers can berate it for not holding the reader's attention. What does it take for them? I thought it was quite riveting. And I liked the way Alice Sebold presented the entire book within the framework of a fantasy, beginning in heaven. It reminds me of another book I have read, and by the way recommend you read also, by Norman Thomas Remick that is presented within the framework of a fantasy looking down from heaven titled &quot;West Point..&quot;. Both that book and Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; will be enjoyable to anyone who enjoys &quot;heavenly&quot; presentations such as &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, etc. Believe the five star reviewers of this book. It really is quite wonderful.
B000069HKH|5.0|I love this new CD.  Empty Sky and You're Missing are sung with so much emotion that I can literally feel the pain and loneliness. Bruce's music has always had an effect on my life and he continues to do so.  His music takes us away and gives us hope.  Mary's Place is a great, fun song that will make you get up and dance!  Thank you Bruce, Patti and the E Street Band for another great albulm.  Please add more concerts in NJ!
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride truly is the Queen of Modern Country Music! She sings both happy and social issue songs equally excellent. She shoots the best videos and chooses the best songs to sing. She recently released her first Greatest Hits album and this is how I rate each song:<br />\\"My Baby Loves Me\\": good... a very sweet and happy song. (5 stars)<br />\\"Life #9\\": great... an up-tempo song about cheating, full of country dancing and two-stepping. (5 stars)<br />\\"Independence Day\\": Martina's career hit... an excellent song against domestic violence and can be used for patriotic purposes. (5 stars)<br />\\"Strangers\\": I love this song... but I am sad Martina never released it as a single. However, I'm glad she included it in this collection. (5 stars)<br />\\"Safe in the Arms of Love\\": a very cool sounding record, the background vocals are amazing, Martina's voice rules and it really is \\"pure ear candy.\\"<br />\\"Wild Angels\\": nice... Martina's first #1 song and an overall very happy song. Just like a cartoon. (5 stars)<br />\\"Valentine\\": a love ballad well sung by Martina, perfect for all weddings. She duets this song with guest artist, pianist, Jim Brickman. (5 stars)<br />\\"Broken Wing\\": what a beautiful song... I love how Martina holds the last note 'fly' for 12 seconds!!! (5 stars)<br />\\"Happy Girl\\": another up-tempo song, has real nice melody, shows the 'happy side' of Martina. (5 stars)<br />\\"Wrong Again\\": I love this... it has a different chorus every time, nice background vocals, an overall a strong vocal performance by Martina. (5 stars)<br />\\"Whatever You Say\\": wow... I still remember the vocal performance Martina did on the 1999 ACM awards of this song and I am blown away. I am in awe of such determination. (5 stars)<br />\\"I Love You\\": very cool song, found on the 'Runaway Bride' soundtrack and to this day, Martina's most successful single, spent 5 consecutive weeks at the #1 spot in Country charts. (5 stars)<br />\\"Love's the Only House\\": wow... this powerhouse song showsthe mature, humanizing side of Martina. It makes you want to do something for your fellow humans.  Full of very positive messages. (5 stars)<br />\\"There You Are\\": sung really low and soft in this recording. However, if you see Martina in concert, this song is a very powerful 5 star performance. (4 stars)<br />\\"When God-Fearin' Woman Get the Blues\\": a very cool up-tempo song, and drop dead hilarious... against cheating, and traditional instruments such as dobro and fiddle are included. (5 stars)<br />\\"Where Would You Be\\": my all-time favorite song by a female vocalist!!! Amazing and breathtaking! I love the raw emotions it has and its sincerity. Proves that Martina is the best soprano she can be. (6 stars!!!!)<br />\\"Concrete Angel\\": a very sad song about child abuse. Martina makes you want to do something and help today's children about this. May radio stations never stop playing this! (5 stars)<br />\\"Blessed\\": very good song about Martina's life being 'blessed.' Has very cool background vocals, by Carolyn Dawn Johnson, and a cool music video. (5 stars)<br />Overall Rating of the Album: 5 STARS!!!!!!!! (5 = BEST)<br />Definitely Worth Buying!!!
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols are a legendary punk rock group along with The Ramones, and The Misfits! This cd is great! GET IT! Johnny Rotten has the perfect voice for punk because, if you are listening to the song Problem. At the end of it he goes on and on with that annoying voice saying problem! The best song is probably Anarchy In The U.K. with the lyrics that every punk fan has to know! This is one of the best punk albums around and I am sure that the great punk bands today were influenced by The Sex Pistols! GET THIS ALBUM! R.I.P. Sid
B000000OXH|4.0|I really enjoy this album, to be perfectly honest. There are a ton of good pop songs here, and from tunes like \\"Don't Cry\\", \\"I Do What I Want\\", \\"The Heat Goes On\\", among others, it's a quite enjoyable listening experience. Granted, the songs don't quite have the feel of excitement, energy, and enthusiasm as the first Asia recording. However, this is well worth the very low price, and lovers of both 80's rock, as well as those many fans of Steve Howe (Yes) and John Wetton (King Crimson, et. al) will love the guitar and vocals, respectively.<BR>   I give this album 4 stars. A star is taken away for what I feel is sub-par sound quality. The debut album, recorded around a year or two earlier, has much better quality. Perhaps it is due to the early use of digital recording technology, or that this CD simply wasn't mastered optimally. Some of the instruments sound much quieter than others when they shouldn't be. Putting these small things aside, it's a worthy purchase. Although it wasn't a monster seller, it deserves to be re-mastered!!!
B00005AQE8|4.0|Good stuff if you are really into his music and classic rap that wasn't bad at all back then.  Much better than most of the stuff you'll find today.  This album has true meaning for you to discover about Tupac.  Buy if you have a craving for some True Rap.
B00005AWMF|3.0|Although the five or six tracks on this album that are worthy of best of material are amazing, the ones that aren't sorely stick out. Sade's skills as a vocalist and songwriter are evident on her hits such as Smooth Operator, Your Love is King, The Sweetest Taboo, Paradise and Hang on to Your Love. The problem with this album is that it includes tracks not worthy of such a compilation. Perhaps after a few more albums, such as Lover's Rock, Sade will be able to release a ten track best of compilation of really fine music.
B000000OYQ|5.0|THIS ALBUM ROCKS.... I AM A HUGE ZEPPELIN FAN... BUT ALSO A HUGE 80'S ROCK FAN.  THE SONGS MOLD THE TWO OF THOSE STYLES TOGETHER.<BR>I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER REVIEWERS ARE TALKING ABOUT.
0440295734|2.0|I enjoyed the first chapter very much.  However, things deteriorated fairly quickly for me.  <br />A book peopled with characters whom it is hard to identify with or like.  The main protaginist is a boring drunk who finds religion.  Enough said.
6303212263|5.0|Superman: The Movie is one of, if not, the best comic book based film ever made. The film's story is well done, the film's cast is perfect, and the production values were pretty impressive for 1978. Directed by Richard Donner (The Goonies, all 4 Lethal Weapon films, Maverick), Superman delivers everything expected concerning the Man of Steel. Christopher Reeve will forever be remembered as The Man of Steel, and his performance as Clark Kent/Superman is very well handled as he brought some humanity to the character. As each Superman sequel came, the film series lost its quality in the stories and in production values. It was always Reeve's portrayal of the lead character that still made the sequels worth watching. <br />Superman: The Movie is a must have film for anyone's video or DVD collection.
078401213X|5.0|Mathematics is everywhere and is the base of all the other sciences, so it is not strange to try to find the essential explanation of every kind of phenomenon, natural, non-natural, and even divine in mathematics, the chaos itself describes a pattern. That's what Pi is about. A mathematician obsessed with finding the number that controls Wall Street and would predict its behavior, and this same number happens to be the much hidden name of god if its digits are transformed into Hebrew letters according to the tradition of Kabala. The black and white and the hypnotizing techno music transmit a very special feeling when you see this movie. Some weird and surrealistic scenes complete this environment. It has an excellent photography and a great and very original argument.
6300268993|4.0|Superman II is one of those rare sequels that actually matches the original film. To some people, the first film is the better film, and to others, the sequel is better than the original. The three Kryptonian criminals were indeed worthy adversaries against Superman, and the battle in Metropolis was very much right off from what would be seen in a comic book!!!  I liked this sequel and found it to be just as entertaining as the first film. I would actually rate this five stars also, but knowing that this film had some problems behind-the-scenes, and to what some of the changes were made in the film's story, I rate it 4 stars.<br />Both Superman: The Movie and Superman II were shot at the same time, with Richard Donner directing. When problems occurred between Donner and the executive producers, Alexander & Ilya Salkind, Donner was fired. Most of the footage in Superman II belongs to Donner. Richard Lester was brought in to take over finishing Superman II. When Lester was on board some parts of the script were altered for him. Lester specialized in directing comedy, and some scenes ended up being rewritten than what Donner was to have filmed had he not be fired. What if...!<br />The debate rages on if Donner's original scripted version may have been more superior than the version that Lester finished doing. Hard to say. Its also unfortunate that there wasn't at least a co-directing credit to Donner and Lester. Lester got the full credit as the film's director.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This movie is so great... so powerful and with high suspense.<br />Kevin Spacey is a great actor as always. And I say all actors and the director did a great job especially with the amazing score.<br />This movie reminds me of &quot;Primal Fear&quot;. I'd recommend you watch both movies because they're both so powerful and with a surprisingly extreme twist at the end.
B00004U8WT|5.0|Basically a sequel to &quot;Load&quot;, something not done often with studio albums.  This import was released by Vertigo/Universal worldwide except Japan by Sony and the U.S. and Canada on Elektra.  If it's worth the extra money, so be it.<br />Before it came out, I confused &quot;The Memory Remains&quot; with &quot;The Forgiven II&quot; for some reason.
6305263248|2.0|This movie had all the elements of success: nice story, great drive chase, good acting and elite actors... but still all together doesn't fit. I still can't figure out why.<br />But maybe (I said maybe) this type of movie belongs to a younger generation of actors...<br />I know it's a good movie but there's something that affected it that I couldn't figure out what it is.
0887309372|2.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by Fred DeLuca, co-founder of Subway, as well as many of the reviewers here in Amazon. I do not quite share their enthusiasm.<br />If you are not already a devout believer in the all-encompassing power of branding you will probably NOT be convinced of it by reading this book. Every \\"law\\" mentioned in this book is backed by nothing more than generalizations and countless non sequiturs. With some real analysis, I would not be surprised if some of these \\"laws\\" were proven to be partially or entirely false.<br />There are some interesting ideas presented, but I do not think that is enough to recommend this book. If you do read it, make sure you take the \\"laws\\" with a grain of salt.
B00000ICN5|4.0|its easy to lose this album in the tidal wave of all that came after it.  but like &quot;In the beginning&quot;, this is how it all started, recorded over two nights, in an attempt to get the record deal, NOT make the record.  this is the demo tape that became the record.  that's what we are hearing.  this is the genesis.  its a little rough, a little familiar (he made no secret about his influences).  i don't think originality is really what he will be remembered for.  this is the equivalent of 9/11 or 11/22/63.  everyone remembers where they were the first time they heard Stevie.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Resident Evil, being one of my favorite video game franchise ever, intrigued me from the start and I was very excited to see the film when it opened. Now, while this is a very fun movie to watch, you can't help but notice the plot holes and imperfections that cause this movie to get only 3and a half stars from me. Again, don't get me wrong, I like the movie for what it is...action, action and more action. There is some great stylish violence in the film, some outstanding visual effects and make-up and decent acting from a reasonable cast. Milla Jovovich is very good in the film (although I must admit, I am kind of partial to her) and Michelle Rodrigues is another standout, However, the supporting cast was a little weak and I think they could have done a better job in that department.<br />The story of the film basically follows the game, but strays a little here and there. One of my favorite parts of the film is the \\"red queen\\" She is very interesting and well thought out. Overall, the movie is very entertaining and I enjoyed watching it, but I just can't bring myself to give it more than three and a half stars due to the plot holes and sub-par supporting cast.<br />The dvd is good. The menus look nice and the picture looks vivid and clear. The audio is also good. My only complaint is the extras, a little sub-par. The commentary track is nice, but there are no deleted scenes, outtakes or alternate scenes or endings. There are some featurettes, but they are a waste of time.<br />The movie gets 3 and a half stars. And the dvd presentation gets 3. A great movie to rent if you like action and one to own if you're zombified.

B000003TAW|5.0|I would like to start by saying I'm a HUGE OBSESSED fan.  I love all of Weezer's songs, but my favorites are on this cd.  I especially love Only In Dreams.  It helps me fall asleep at night, but it is not at all a boring song.  If you talk to a Weezer fan, they will tell you this is the best of all of their fantastic albums.
B000009FJL|5.0|Even though it was only their second album, Trespass is many miles ahead of From Genesis To Revelation. The songs on this are the fruits of their labors during the summer period when the five members all were living in the McPhail's cottage and practicing literally all day long. Phillips and Mayhew departed after this one - the former by his own choice (he developed bad stage fright, for one) and the latter by suggestion from the rest of the band. (He's not a bad drummer, but he really didn't provide much creative input.)    Some don't like Trespass because they think it's too simplistic, but in reality it's actually quite involved and shows a quantum leap in writing ability for five public school boys barely out of their teens. The delicate balance created through layered 12-string guitars, organ, flute, mellotron, and distant harmony vocals produced an innovative blend that oozes with pastoral atmospheres and melancholia and in places almost seems to stop time. The lyrics are also very involved, occasionally pretensious, sometimes cryptic, but often thought-provoking. Gabriel's personality is already coming into its own here - lots of color and emotion are on display.    MCA still owns the rights to this album in America, and they as yet haven't gotten around to remastering it... which, according to the informed opinions of quite a number of audiophiles, is actually a good thing, believe it or not. The imported \\"remastered\\" version has, as it turns out, been subjected to a form of noise reduction that does some very unkind things to the delicate acoustic guitars. The short of it, then, is get the MCA version if you can, and remember: a little tape hiss never hurt anyone.    Believe it when I say this is an excellent Genesis album from start to finish. I listen to this one perhaps more than some of the other Gabriel-era output because it has a unique and decidedly melancholy atmosphere about it that I love. Highly recommended.
B000060P79|5.0|This cd totally rocks! It keeps you wanting to rock the whole time and you cant help but listen when the lead singer comes on!
B000002MFN|5.0|Madonna delivers what is possibly her most intimate and stripped down album in the shape of Erotica. Most of us remember how this album was slaughtered by critics in 1992 for its cold, mechanical feel and its blatent sexual nature. Neither of these aspects of the album seems like a valid reason for criticism now. The songs are either playful or touchingly sweet...Even her jealousy is conveyed through the voice of a little girl scorned! A pure gem, as long as you get the version without the horrid Did You Do It. What were they thinking?!
B00004U8P9|4.0|a great movie about a transexual scientist from outer space who<BR>is makig the man of his dreams whos name is ''rock horror&quot;.<BR>this movie is full of wild and crazy music with weird lyrics if<BR>you like strange and funny mivies youll love this movie.
B000060P79|5.0|Hey everyone. I got this CD about 2 and a half weeks ago. I've spun it about 55 times. I haven't gotten tired of it and I doubt I will. This is a disc that you won't want to stop listening to. There's a flow to it where the song before and after the one you're listening to relates to it somehow. I think it's great! These guys are polished musicians and the vocals are awesome. The sound is crisp but still has a live feel to it, which you need in any CD that you wanna rock out to. This album features guest appearances from members of Blink-182 and Good Charlotte. The songs tackle the areas of teen heartbreak, friendship, girl-chasing, hopelessness and just plain old teen angst. Oh.. not to mention the goofball song My Alien. My favorite tracks are the last 3, &quot;I Won't Be There&quot;, &quot;One Day&quot;, and &quot;Perfect&quot;, Perfect being #1 on my list. They're songs about unsupportive parents who are unsupportive of their kid's creativity, aspirations, and free-thought. I can personally relate to them. So this is a record that reflects the everyday lives of all youth. It's an awesome CD, so pick it up either here, or at your local CD retailer. Peace Out!
0790731002|4.0|I saw this movie many times when it was in the theaters in 1995.  I bought the video as soon as it came out.  Now I have the DVD and still watch it frequently. It has stood the test of time.<BR>Val Kilmer does a great job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman.  His acting is much more layered than Michael Keaton's.  I think Keaton did a good job in the first two movies, but Val Kilmer gives a performance with many levels, especially when he is Bruce Wayne.  The viewer can see the torment which has created Batman in Kilmer's eyes.  I totally disagree with any review that says Kilmer's performance is wooden or one-dimensional.  It is simply subtler and deeper.  <BR>Tommy Lee Jones is very good as Two-Face.  Sometimes Jim Carrey goes a little too far over the top.  As several others have said, his Riddler is not much different than some of his other characters.<BR>This movie certainly beats the cheezy Batman and Robin hands down.  If there was ever an acator not destined to play Batman, it is George Clooney.  He has done a good job in seveal films, just not B&amp;R.<BR>If you want adventure, acation, romance and comedy all in one <BR>entertaining package, buy this DVD.
B000067CPX|4.0|I must admit that my first real experience with the Chilis was with their album 'Californication' and since then, I've been told that my opinion doesn't count.  So I bought 'By the Way' with trepidation, feeling like a fraud, not a true Chilis fan.  I put it in my car and listened to it and thought, \\"well that was most probably a waste of money\\" and waited until I got home to listen to it again where I was most pleasantly surprised.  I think my initial dislike was due to the other songs not being anything at all like 'By the Way' which I loved.  After a while though, the album tends to grow on you with songs such as 'Cabron' and 'Universally Speaking' staying in your mind for days to come.  Give the album a chance and don't write it off after a first listen!
B000063S6Z|4.0|What exactly is the REAL reason why Moby is Eminem's whipping boy?  Is it because Moby can make thoughtful, engaging music without making shallow pop culture references and dropping &quot;f-bombs&quot; left and right?  Regardless, Eminem has good reason to dislike him, for Moby has released a fine album of laid-back grooves and mellow beats that are as pleasant as an August summer breeze.  Those who are looking for the upbeat, hyperactive rhythms that distinguished his past work will be disappointed with &quot;18.&quot;  On this album, Moby brings down the tempo significantly, and creates his own chillout record; it's a fine disc to play after a hard night at the club, to listen to at the local cafe, or on a rainy Sunday morning.  The disc's first two tracks, &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; and &quot;In this World&quot; set the tone for the rest of the disc; the former track is a slice of guitar-fueled synth pop, and the latter is an ambient number that soars on the strength of its soulful vocals by Jennifer Price.  Elsewhere, we are treated to mid-tempo electronica, touches of light gospel, and even some blues.  Another interesting track of note is &quot;Jam for the Ladies&quot; featuring Angie Stone and MC Lyte, a rapper who apparently emerged from a &quot;where-are-they-now&quot; recording hiatus.  Sinead O'Connor lends her haunting voice to &quot;Harbour,&quot; and the Shining Light Gospel Choir turns up on a few tracks, giving &quot;18&quot; a welcome inspirational vibe.  Yeah, the disc could do without a couple tracks of semi-filler, but I'm hardly complaining.  &quot;18&quot; shows that not all masters of electronic dance music are one-trick ponies.  Moby isn't afraid to dabble in any genre, and that makes him all the more respectable a performer.  Some CDs give at least one good reason to buy it; this one has 18.
B000021XS0|4.0|AN OK CD,but not too progressive like many claim!if you're in you're in your 30's like me you will find mr. pettrucci's playing,and sound similar to kerry livegren-kansas,steve morse-steve morse band,dregs,and deep purple.the band actually sounds like alittle deep purple,alittle queen,and a lot kansas,the keyboard sounds alot like yngwie malmsteen's rising force,and like the older stuff from kansas from the 70's that's why i say it's not too progressive.although on the 1'st cd,john sounded more progressive,like (kee marcello)euroe-out of this world,and prisoners in paradise.this cd is a concept cd,all of the songs pertaining to the overall theme of the cd.like the movie the shining,a man buys a haunted house,haunted by a girl by her lover,and then himself,(a murder suicide)although in the beginning your hypnotized and you are told anytime you want to stop just open your eyes.at first the man see;s the girl in the mirror,''just like the mercyful fate song.the girl in the mirror on the cd time''.all sorts of creepy things go on throughout the cd,including james labrie who like king diamond goes back in time,and see's through her eye's.it's only at the very end when you find out the man in the cd,like the shining is the reincarnation of the lover.you here him come home he gets a drink,turns on the tv,then you hear labrie say ''open your eye's nicholas'',and he screams then you here just static he is kiled by labrie,or the ghost? there's a lot of good music on this and sining,although the xylophone is a bit much,there's even some indian music,and some 1920's piano music at a poker game that goes along with the reincarnation theme of the cd. a very good concept cd alot like king diamond's  abigail,and abigail 2 the revenge,you really get your moneys'worth...............
B000069HKH|4.0|Despite all the negative, disappointed reviews of The Rising that I've waded through in the last few days, I find it to be a welcome dose of reality. Remember, this is the same guy who was writing about psychological isolation 22 years ago in &quot;Stolen Car&quot; and &quot;State Trooper.&quot; Life - especially as an adult - is not a perpetual round of draft beer at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, NJ! One of the many fallouts of our &quot;Global Economy&quot; is that we must also put up with world-size terrors. While the music here doesn't always click, most of it is anthemic enough to remind us to kick it in gear and get ON with our lives - the real damage of 9/11 will be if it robs us our courage and confidence as a nation.<br />     The standout tracks for me are &quot;Further On Up The Road,&quot; &quot;Nothing Man.&quot; &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; and &quot;Paradise.&quot; Despite Springsten's lack of experience in dealing with Palestinian extremists, he does a remarkably good job of capturing their crazed, homicidal mind-set (On the latter 2 songs). The new production works fine, but this album reminds me of Human Touch and Lucky Town in that a little more time spent in the song-editing process could have worked wonders here. I also wonder why so many of the tracks on The Rising have drum machine samples on them - why use computers when you have one of the finest, most powerful drummers in the world sitting 5 feet away? Likewise, where is Clarence Clemons? I only heard him clearly on 1 track, and perhaps in the background on 2 more! Hopefully next time Brendon will figure out that utilizing some of the greatest musicians left in rock &amp; roll is infinitely more interesting than endless tape looping!<br />     With all that said, The Rising is still an excellent album - a worthy addition to the catalog of America's greatest rocker!
B000005JH5|4.0|Just an extraordinary debut. One of the things that make this such a good CD is her singing. Not even counting the backing vocals, which are intelligent and creative, her phrasing and enunciation are the foundation on which this disc is built. Opening with \\"Moving\\" we find Kate weaving her voice around a song that really doesn't have alot going for it. What she does is make the song better than it should be. \\"The<br />Saxaphone Song\\" is probably the worst song on the disc. It seems it exists just to give the sax player a reason to play. \\"Strange Phenonmena\\" like \\"Moving\\" is only above ordinary due to her remarkable vocals. \\"Kite\\" is where this set really takes off. Her imagery in her lyrics are simply unparalleled in women's songwriting. Along with Stuart Elliot's drums urging the song forward, her innovative backing vocals, its a no lose song. \\"The Man with the Child in his Eyes\\" is a tour de force with just Kate at the piano. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is really Kate pushing her voice to even higher levels. An overlooked item on this set is her quality piano playing which graces the disc, and it really shines on \\"Child\\" and \\"Heights.\\" \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" is Kate rocking out, but unlike other artists who rock out simply because they want to show their audience another side of them, Kate's lyrics and vocals let the audience know that she will do it on her terms. These 4 songs that make up the middle of this disc are outstanding. \\"Feel It\\" is next and Kate again cradles the song with her pipes. Again, its just with her on piano. However, it doesn't reach the heights of \\"The Man with the Child in his Eyes.\\" \\"Oh to be in Love\\" is next but because of the quality songs that came before it, this seems like a letdown. It isn't. Its a good song but not as good as others here. \\"L'Amour look something like You\\" is fairly tepid with not much to laud it except her exceptional lyrics. \\"Them Heavy People' uses a funky bass/drum pattern to<br />give us yet another winner. \\"Room for the Life\\" is a commercial tune that is light and sung with a sense of optimism. \\"The Kick Inside\\" is a rather solemn end to such a quality debut. Again with just Kate on piano, the song has a majestical quality to it that seems to come easy for her. Also, kudos must go to producer Andrew Powell and EMI Records. I can imagiine that when they signed her to do this record it would been easy to steer or mold her into somthing she is not, but they let her record her music her way. A Happy Meal should be bought for Engineer Jon Kelly and whoever did the orcestrating for her. Jon captured her spirit perfectly and the strings were pillows for her melodies to rest on. If I had any critisim at all it would be that Kate's voice(which has great range) can be a little too much to take at times. And her voice is particular to herself in that she really can only sing her songs. I cannot see her doing a disc of cover songs with any degree of believablity, for example.Life\\" is a commercial tune that is light and sung with a sense of optimism. \\"The Kick Inside\\" is a rather solemn end to such a quality debut.

078322737X|5.0|George Lucas' nostalgic look at the last &quot;innocent&quot; years of America is a great film, loved by critics and audiences alike. Lucas' clever approach to the realism shots adds a certain quality that everyday filmmakers miss. It's the flubs and mumbled lines that make the classic films like this one what they are. Happy Days star Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford (all pre-famous) are all excellent in their cavellier roles, cruising around the streets while listening to<br />Wolfman Jack.<br />The endless line of great songs from the early 60s like &quot;Rock around the Clock&quot;, &quot;16 Candles&quot; and &quot;Surfin' Safari&quot; are as memorable as the film itself. One of my all-time favourite films, this is a must-have movie with some great extras on the DVD. Features include an in-depth and fascinating doco by Laurent Bouzerau, a lengthy trailer, production notes and web links. Excellent.
B000001FTA|4.0|This is probaly Lizzy's 4th best overall cd. Some prime cuts on here include dancing in the moonlight, killer without a cause(pretty heavy) bad rep, and that woman's going to break your heart. The rest of the songs are very good ,too, opium trail is probaly the least of them. A varied lot of songs here, heavy and more melodic.
B00005J6UP|4.0|Richard Donner's madcap kids adventure was a big hit in it's own little way back in the 80s, and it's not hard to see why. It's filled with memorable lines and wacky humour that appealed to kids back then. But is it actually that good? Well, some of it is a bit grinding sometimes, where the film starts to verge on \\"screaming\\" humour, which we all know, ain't funny at all. But the bunch of weirdos who go off in search of 'One-eyed Willie's treasure proves for some good-natured fun and innocent adventure.<br />The standout performance in the film is Jonathan Ke Quan (INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), where we find out, that HEY, Some kids CAN act! It's fun to spot all the young kiddies who went on to bigger things like Josh Brolin and Sean Astin. And of course, Jeff Cohen as the wimpy 'Chunk' who keeps coming across corpses, providing some halarious moments. The fact that Donner helmed this small-scale adventure seems strange, given that he went on to do things like THE OMEN and the LETHAL WEAPON films, but it's handled well, and dosn't get TOO far-fetched. You have to have bad guys of course, and this one has Robert Davi (From A VIEW TO A KILL) and THE MATRIX's Joe Pantoliano as the bumbling Fratelli brothers chasing after the \\"Goonies\\". And of course Dave Grusin's memorable theme tune. THE GOONIES is one of those cute little films that Hollywood should do more often.
B000002J1M|4.0|This is a good cd from the Gabriel era but I think it gets a little over rated here. Watcher of the skies is the best song on the cd. Supper's ready is the best for 15 minutes, but takes off on a tangent for a couple of minutes. The rest of the song's are good, not great.
B00005U1YO|5.0|Chemical Brothers put together with 'Come With Us' their bets production since their 1997 album 'Dig Your Own Hole.' The title track, with its mindboggling sequences; the closing track (whose video can leave you speechless); and &quot;The State We're In&quot; with a beautiful rendition by Beth Orton, which openly flirts with chillout music, are my favorite tracks.
0786915749|5.0|What is it that makes this Fantasy work so much better than all the rest?  One can only answer that after reading it for oneself.  BUT, I'll try to explain a few things as best as possible.<br />As with every other fantasy novel created, the reader will open to the first page and be introduced to a new, vast world known as Krynn.  Wasting very little time(Meaning, not wasting PAGES to describe meaningless scenery), our new heroes are introduced.  Ok, now, with many novels, I personally have found myself picking out a favorite central character and accepting the rest simply because.  NOT the case with this book.  Each character introduced had their own special qualities that can get on instantly attached from start til way after finish.  Whether you like the small, mischievous characters with innocent kleptomania and optimism Or the dark soul type with boundless ambitions to attain power, these characters are definitely for keeps.  There are still more characters with other elements to them that WILL keep you hooked, but I won't spoil them all.<br />Plot is also another key.  No time is wasted getting this story going(Disappointed readers of Robert Jordan will definitely find this a golden quality).  A mysterious pair wanders into a tavern bearing a relic of immense interest.  So interesting, that evil has been immediately drawn to it.  Within a heartbeat, our 8 characters are on the run for their lives and to protect the mysterious couple.  Little do they realize just what an adventure they, and the rest of Krynn, are in for.<br />What else?  Its a New York Times Bestseller . . . so what?  I've seen my share of \\"Bestsellers\\" that definitely do not deserve such an honor.  This one, however, does deserve it.  The book makes amazing use of magic, gods, warriors and dragons.  This is the kind of book you'll hate to put down.  You'll find yourself lost in this book as the story deepens and develops into one of the greatest tales ever told.  Still have doubts?  Kick'em inthe gut and throw them aside.  Get this one.  You won't be disappointed with this or with the books that follow.  This one's definitely for keeps.
0441172717|5.0|An introduction by the author in my edition indicates his goals: to explore the messiah myth, to examine the relationship between politics and economics, to explore the consequence of the control of a limited resource, i.e., water as an analog of oil. The novel does this so admirably and a great deal more. Overlayed are a gripping story and some really big issues: loyalty vs. betrayal, love vs. obligation, nature vs. nurture. Strikingly, these inevitable conflicts are subjected to tension and resolution. Sure, this is space opera at its best, but it is a wonderfully written novel that can stand on its own beside traditional literature. Don't let the detractors keep you from this; they simply don't get the point.  It is a big, well written book that will enrich you whether or not you proceed on to the rest of the series.
B000002TQV|5.0|This is it, the one I like to call the best Radiohead album of their career.  All respect to Kid A, I do believe that this has the quality of music making edge over it.  The best song is High &amp; Dry, I just love it.  It's beautiful, subtle acoustic guitar, booming drum rhythm and Thom's beautiful, beautiful voice.  The Bends is great.  Fame Plastic trees is a touching and heartfelt little story song, yet again, showcasing Thom's vocals and stellar acoustic guitaring.  Black Star is a great up beat number, Bullet Proof is trippy and sort of exotic sounding.  Thom sounds almost in pain on that song, begging and pleading to be bullet proof.  Everything on here is great and I like to believe that this is the best Radiohead album, but I must relinquish that title to Kid A.  However, this album gets my highest recommendation.
0792842731|5.0|In his second outing as 007, Pierce Brosnan ignites the screen yet again with another full-throttle adventure to take us on! The new villain, Elliot Carver  is one of the most hilarious ever on a Bond adventure, his plan-create WWIII. The new Bond girl Wai Lin teams up with Brosnan to fight against Carver. Performing the title song is Sheryl Crow with K.d Lang doing a slightly different version at the end of the movie. this movie has it all:Ship attacks, motorcycle chases and total out-of-your seat fun! I have seen it 273 times and it is a Blast!!!!
B000002JR8|5.0|Arguably, the best and heaviest album ever.  Vinnie Paul is one of the best and most underrated drummers ever.  Rex has got the bass guitar down to an art.  He doesn't deliver the down beats, he is the pulse of the bad.  Dimebag Darrel is one of the best and most grossly underrated gutiarsits of all time.  He is so fast and plays so beautifully.  Seeing him live twice, once on this albums tour and then again on the Trendkill tour, he is truly a gutiar God.  And Phil Anselmo is just so pissed and so ... angry at everyone and everything, but he channels into beautiful vocals and just truly inspired lyrics.  5 Minutes Alone is great.  Becoming is great.  I'm Broken is the best.  Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills is funky, Rex's bass is awesome.  Slaughtered is the most underrated.  Planet Caravan is such a great song and a great tribute to Black Sabbath, giving some much deserved respect for their grandfathers and their inspiration.  This is the best, the hardest and most brutal ass kicking heavy metal album of all time.  It's gets my highest recommendation.
B000002H2H|5.0|Let me begin this review by saying that '80's metal is far from my favorite form of music. Iron Maiden, Dio, and Megadeth may all be musically talented bands, but I haven't listened to them, and most likely never will, so I really can't compare this CD to them. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with my ignorance.<br />Now then, Ride the Lightning is one of my favorite CD's and means so much to me because of its emotional power. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; &quot;Fade to Black,&quot; &quot;The Call of Ktullu,&quot; and all of the other songs have been there for me when no one else was. Nothing cures a bad day quite like the heavy riffs Metallica laid down on this CD. So far, I've bought ...And Justice for All and the Black Album and neither of them can hold a finger to this masterpiece. Master of Puppets will most likely be one of my next purchases, so then I'll be able to see if it is as good as everyone says it is. But for some reason, I've got this feeling that Ride the Lightning will always be my favorite Metallica CD. <br />If you get angry and depressed a lot, and need a boost every now and then, Ride the Lightning is your new favorite CD. If you are a perfectionist with a good life, loving girlfriend (or boyfriend), and parents who never get into fights, then stay far away from this.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is the one everyone knows Pink Floyd, but it's not their best.  I give it a great label, but it deserves it.  However, some of it is just too... how should I say, too much.  Something hit a nerve in Roger and it was fame and stardom, so he wrote this.  He's angry at the fans and himself and everyone.  But, this tells a great story.  It has wonderful songs on it,Another Brick In The Wall, Mother, Young Lust, Hey You, Anybody Out There, Comfortably Numb, Run Like Hell and The Trial.  Then the rest of it is typical soundtrack filler.  However, it's great.  This is very sarcastic and very in your face.  It has painful and intense lyrics like \\"Mother should I drop the bomb\\" or \\"Mother should I trust the government.\\"  The album as a whole is great, full of all good music and sounds and lyrics.  But to top it all off, this album has Pink Floyd's best song.  It seems unusual that they're best song is on this album, but it doesn't matter.  Comfortably Numb has recently been named the top song of the year by my local classic rock radio station and deservedly so.  It is their great rock masterpiece in just one song and everyone knows the song and they know that it is great.  This is a great album and I give it my highest recommendation.
B000069HKH|5.0|Unlike some reviews I think that most of the album well all of the album aren't fillers. You just have to like the music... Bruce and his writing styles, the producer (Brendan O'Brien) and the E Street Band. <br />It's a beautiful crafted album and the songs are amazing. Granted the fact that it's basically crafted towards the sad events of 9-11 but that shouldn't go against the album. It's also quite diverse musically. <br />Here's what I think of the tracks:<br />LONESOME DAY - it's the first track and a happy tune to start off the album and the way Bruce sings: \\"If I can just get through this lonesome day\\" is something to be awed but then that's just me. One of the album's best track.<br />INTO THE FIRE - from what I think the first 9-11 track on the album... it's sad and I cried when I first heard it. Again Bruce's vocals shine on this track with: \\"I need your kiss, but love and duty called you someplace higher\\" and then again \\"I need your near...\\"<br />WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY - almost happy tune and I love: \\"It's rainin' but there ain't a cloud in the sky/ Must of been a tear from your eye\\" I love this track and well it's one of the best songs well there isn't one that I don't like actually.<br />NOTHING MAN - a nice kind of slow tune.<br />COUNTIN' ON A MIRACLE - I think this is another semi 9-11 tune, it could have been a sad ballad if sung by the Balladers: Celine Dion etc., it would have been slow and dramatic. But this time it's an Rock sorta upbeat tune.<br />EMPTY SKY - an excellent piano and percussion intro before the rest of the band joins in. \\"I want a kiss from your lips/ I want an eye for an eye/ I woke up this morning to an empty sky\\"<br />WORLDS APART - my favorite track on 'The Rising' and it's this Arabic/Rock song that is amazing in every way imaginable and unimaginable with the Arabic music group:Asif Ali Khan and Group doing backup vocals and starting the song off. I'm pretty sure you can hear Patti Scialfa doing the \\"la la la\\" before Bruce comes in doing \\"la la la\\" and what about Steven Van Zadht's guitar work here on the song? Amazing. \\"Sometimes the truth just ain't enough / Or it's too much in times like this / Let's throw the truth awy, we'll find in this kiss / In your skin upon my skin, in the beating of our hearts / May the living let us in, before the dead tear us apart\\" and the way the song ends once again with the Arabic chant.<br />Other beautiful songs on the records:<br />THE FUSE - a nice Rock song again<br />YOU'RE MISSING - this has to be the saddest song on the record. I cried when I heard this too... it's a nice slow song with a piano playing the solo and strings playing with Max Weinberg playing simple beats. I love the simple lyrics: \\"Everything is everything / But you're missing\\" and \\"...You're house in waiting / For you to walk in, for you to walk in / But you're missing...\\" and \\"God's drifting in heaven, devil's in the mailbox / I got dust on my shoes, nothing but teardrops.\\"<br />THE RISING - a nice inspirational tune to get in good spirts with a nice beat and excellent background vocals.<br />MY CITY OF RUINS - I love this song, it's from the 9-11 Telethon, but not that version. This is the studio version. <br />I highly recommend this album and it's one of the best of 2002.
B000002JSN|5.0|I have to give this at least ten stars.  Trampled Under Foot is just jive and groove and sex all rolled up into automobiles.  Kashmir is the most epic and most beautiful song of all time.  It's long and it rocks out hard.  The strings are memorable, just as memorable as this whole song.  It is a staple of classic rock radio.  Disc two could have been another whole album, released all by itself.  In The Light is a long epic, great synthesizers that John Paul got better at with age.  Brown-Yr-Aur is great Jimmie Page, lovely guitar.  Down By The Seaside is a gentle song but then it picks up and rocks like so many other Zeppelin songs, but for some reason, you don't remember and don't expect it.  Ten Years Gone is THE best Zeppelin song you've never heard.  Boogie With Stu is a great funky, song.  Very groovey.  Then it's over and you just turn it right back on and listen to it all over again.  Why?  Because you have to.  There is some kind of force that grows up from deep down inside you and it just takes over your hands and makes you do it.  I think it's the Eastern influences of Kashmir.  They must have conjured up some voodoo spirits or something.  This album gets my highest recommendation.
B000060P79|5.0|This band is completly awesome. They are a totally cool punk band. If u dont have this cd, I recommend it! it's really great!
B000002C1W|4.0|This is a good album, but it's not Pink Floyd, it's David Gilmour.  This is a very good solo album, not so much a Pink Floyd album with the lack of presence in the writing process by Mason and Wright.  I know they were never that big a writing force to begin with, but still, they are in the band.  It has some noises that is typical Pink Floyd and some of the songs are familiar Pink Floyd as well.  Sorrow is the best song on here and is most typically Pink Floyd.  The beginning guitar sounds so sinister and evil.  Learning To Fly is a great song and made a great video.  Dopgs Of War is deep and sarcastic social commentary.  One Slip is good, I like the effects in the beginning and On The Turning Away is a great song, enjoyable melody.  Then it kind of falls off until Sorrow, but Sorrow picks it up.  The instrumentals are good, solid reminders of classic Pink Floyd.  All in all, good album.
B00005M989|1.0|Could Warner's be more greedy? Is it possible? What a shoddy, grossly incomplete collection. <br />Folks, please, pick up &quot;The Hits/B-sides&quot; immediately!
B000001FS3|5.0|This is one of those recordings that all other albums must answer to.  This is what it means to be great.  The very first song is my favorite U2 song and one of their best.  &quot;where The Streets Have No Name&quot; is a phenomenal song, love the opening chords and Bono's vocals are truly inspired.  I Still Haven't Found...&quot; remains one of their most popular and of their best as well.  I love Edge's very simple guitar solo in the middle.  Bono shines once again.  &quot;With Or Without You&quot; is a bitter, bitter song.  &quot;See the thorn twist'd in your side, and I wait, without you.&quot;  Man, that is apin.  Bono just wails at the end, grieving for something lost and never to return.  &quot;Bullet The Blue Sky&quot; rocks.  &quot;Running To Stand Still&quot; is a great song as is &quot;Red Hill Mining Town.&quot;  &quot;In God's Country&quot; is a fast and toe tapping song and &quot;I Trip Through Your Wires&quot; is a kind of blues and funky groovy song.  &quot;Exit&quot; is as great as the rest and &quot;Mothers Of The Disappeared&quot; is some serious, slap in the face social commentary.  This is what it means to be a great band.  This is one of the best albums of all time.  U2 really hit their stride on this one, very worthy of the Grammy's highest honor for 1987.
B00005Q66T|3.0|As a hardcore fan of Madonna's, I find this release to be a large disappointment. This was clearly a rushed release. Basically, Warner's wanted to cash in on Madonna's last tour/holiday season, so, they release an album full of awful radio edits (desecrating the originals). In addition, there are no new tracks to enjoy (such as the ones included \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" and \\"Something to Remember\\"). There are no Madonna-isms on \\"GHV2\\" (Madonna-isms  were blatantly apparent on \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" (i.e., steamy, banned video, controversial singles, lots of hype, fantastic photo shoot, etc.)), which is a problem. <br />Enough of my complaining, though. This is a collection for the casual Madonna fan. It's a fantastic collection of songs that happened to be edited in a not so desirable way. <br />I'll stick to the full studio albums.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This is quite good, another one of their eerie and trippy masterpieces.  However, it was tough to come back after Kid A and not get some guff about possibly not making another Kid A.  How good is this album.  It's great.  In light of Kid A, giving Kid A a five star rating, I can't give this a five.  But, It's got soothing rhythms and Thom York's trademark vocals.  You hear Thom and you know that it's Radiohead.  He has a wopnderful voice with great range.  It is acoustically driven, but there is nothing wrong with that from a techno-ish band as Radiohead.  Pyramid Song stands out, as a single of course, with a great video, but it's also a great song.  You can probably rank that withi the Top 5 of Radiohead's best.  Great album.
B00005RFQ5|2.0|I really tried to like this release. I forced myself to listen to it repeatedly. After several listens, I gave up. I realize that many will consider me a mere peon since I'm not head over heels in love with this release, as with all other Prince releases, but I gave it my best shot. There are a few good songs on the album, though (the titles escape me at the moment). But this is purely for the diehard Prince fan.
B000002UR7|4.0|This is a very deceiving album if you haven't heard it first.  You have to hear this album first then hear Radiohead's other four so you can see how they grew, how they developed into one of the best bands out there today.  Creep was a huge single for them, but that's what it was, a single.  It was a good song, released for the commercial success, that's what singles are released for.  However, the rest of this album doesn't tie together like the later releases do.  It's great, yes, a great debut, but it's not the familiar Radiohead.  Don't let it deter you from listening to the rest of their catalogue, because it only gets better from here.
B0000020C4|5.0|I was interested to buy this cd because i spotted a Filipina singer who is one of the major actors in the play, Miss Lea Salonga. I have followed her works in Miss Saigon and so i purchased it. I was not only enthralled by her singing prowess, but by the whole cast as well, from Jean Valjean to Javert to Fantine to the Thenardiers to Marius, etc. I haven't seen the play but i would if i could. It was an extraordinary concert from the main characters to the chorus to the orchestra. It was an added bonus when several Jean Valjeans from different countries sang as well. Two thumbs up! It would have been a dream come true to have seen it when it happened.
B000001FS6|4.0|Yes, it's great.  I love Helter Skelter and Bono's statement at the beginning of the song.  Watchtower is really good, few people can pull it off as a cover and I enjoy the Jimi homage with Star Spangled Banner.  Desire is a great funky bluesy throwback and Angel Of Harlem is one of my favorite U2 tunes.  But, it's labeled as a live album, at least make most of them live.  Their live tracks on here are really great and the sound is good, but why can't they all be live?  Still, it's great and I give it my highest recommendation.
0780624890|4.0|Blade takes the standard action film to a higher level. Filled with stylistic action and comic book flare, this vampire hunter movie stands above many other such films, such as John Carpenter's \\"Vampires\\". <br />Released before \\"The Matrix, Blade is a precurser in style to that sci-fi masterpiece. Its fast pace cutting and dazzling transitions create an adrenaline rush of a mood. The use of dark blacks and grays contrasts beautifully with the red blood as the vampires feast. Not that this film is exceptionally gory. It's not.<br />Filled with the non-stop action and visual style of comic books, this film accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's biggest problem is as it progesses, it loses some of the fast paced cutting and transistion use until the climatic end. This uneven style slows the middle of the film considerably.<br />But overall, this flick is a comic book come to life. If you liked \\"The Matrix\\", you'll enjoy \\"Blade\\".
B000002JNJ|5.0|Don't even think about heavy metal dying as long as Pantera is around.  With this 1990 release, they started something I don't even they could iamgine possible.  Many would argue that Cemetery Gates is Pantera's best song, I think it's a good assumption, but there is room for debate.  Cemetery Gates is a truly epic and just beat you brains out metal classic.  Cowboys From Hell will always be there theme song, fast and loud and Phil's screaming vocals.  Primal Concrete Sledge, Psycho Holiday and Domination are the stand out tunes, on top of Cemetery and Cowboys.  If you like insanely fast guitaring, thumping bass lines and pounding drums that just beat you rbrains out, then listen to Pantera.  And if you listen to Pantera, then start with their debut album.  This album gets my highest recommendation.
B000069CWE|1.0|My review on this CD is that it['s bad]. The first album of Hybrid Theory was awesome, good blend of mixes and catchy tunes with minimal rap. Now ReAnimation is the way NO remake of any CD should have gone. They add way too much of tasteless rapping that made the whole CD sound like an Eminem w/ Dr.Dre CD gone wrong. They clearly tried to blank out Chester in this album by putting his voice in 70% of music's back ground. The only song I had even the pleasure of listening to was number 2 (points of authority). Now Pts of Athrty (as they have it on the album) is a GOOD remix of an old song. It gave a good catchy tune. The rest of the album is all messed up. They even killed the song: Enth E ND with rap people popping up saying \\"Yo in this first album just came the man now from that came out Motion Man yo yo.\\" It will save you a lot of time to never buy this CD. If your going to then keep the cover and burn the plastic CD that's with-in it...I have nothing against Linkin Park, I think there a good band but remixing songs that were already quite perfect is not a good way to go.<br />Originality: 1/5 it's a remix album what do you expect?<BR>Music: 2/5 gives some credit to great mix master Hahn<BR>Vocals: 1/5 people keep popping up in the album with the words \\"yo, yeah, man\\"<BR>Playback Value: 1/5 If you going to play it again you might as well take your original hybrid CD and place Pts of Athrty in there....<br />If you like rap and your favorite original hybrid theory tracks ruined then get this album. If you like Linkin Park and don't mind wasting your money get this album. If you want me to save your time and your money DONT get this album. Your money is better spent buying a Jerry Springer VHS. Sorry Linkin Park this is not a good CD.
B000002A3T|4.0|It is better than A Momentary Lapse of Reason, but it's still not back to the old Pink Floyd. It is good to see Richard Wright writing some more songs, but where's Nick?  I suppose it's really no big deal, but I like to knit-pick.  Anyway, the insturmentals are good, Cluster One is one of the best I've ever heard. Marooned is great, worthy of the Grammy nod. Take It Back was a great single, Wearing The Inside Out is a great song, more great signature saxophone. Keep Talking is the best song on here and reminds me of Wish You Were Here, the album, not the song. High Hopes is excellent and majestic, very epic. All in all, it's good, but nowhere near great and is nothing like the old Pink Floyd we know and love.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|I would recommend this movie, but it wasnt exactly what I would call Great! I loved the Tomb Raider games and the previews looked amazing so I thought I would try it. Yes, the special effects were good but the plot wasnt good and the ending pretty much blew in my opinion. It was over too quick. But I would still recommend it. Try it and see if you like it!
B000002U82|5.0|There is no denying, Revolver is a close second to Dark Side Of The Moon.  There has never been a longer lasting, more popular album ever.  Maybe The White Album, but more Dark Side gets airplay, every college kid I know owns it or has downloaded some of it's songs.  The fact is, after Sid, Pink Floyd got technically better.  Their music was just as memorable, but now it was better.  When Roger and David were finally able to collaborate outright, this was what they came up with first.  Coincidence, I think not.<br />1 - Speak To Me/Breathe are like something you can't get in a solid drug.  It's mellow and just makes you slip into the cushions of your couch, relaxing and just going on some kind of great trip, setting you up for the rest of the album.<BR>2 - On The Run is a showcase of Richard Wright's synthesizers and it is beautiful.<BR>3 - Time is the best song on here, featuring the signature use of various sounds that Pink Floyd is famous for.<BR>4 - The Great Gig In The Sky is like an aria from some rock opera.  This chick has some pipes and she sounds like some kind of musical instrument, like Jim Morrison on LA Woman's Cars Hiss By My Window.<BR>5 - Money is funky, I love the guitar on it.  \\"Money, it's a gas, grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.\\"  Roger Waters is a genius.<BR>6 - Us And Them is slow and beautiful like some painful blues song pouring out of some blues guitarists fingers.  I love the saxophone.<BR>7 - Any Colour You Like is more Wright and this guy is some kind of virtuoso.  I would love to make him sit down with a book of Chopin and say \\"Here, make him look bad.\\"  And he could. <BR>8 - Brain Damage is some of the great lyrics Pink FLoyd is known for and some of the greatest in just one song.<BR>9 - Eclipse is not a song, it is a poem to music.  Read the lyrics in the booklet and it is in the form of and is unmistakabley a poem.<br />When all is said and done, you hear a heart beat, just like at the beginning, wonderfully book ending this album as something special.  It's the little things like that that make this stand out as the greatest masterpiece of all time when it comes to rock 'n' roll music.  I can't even begin to give this as high of a recommendation as I would like to.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band. &quot;Album&quot; of the year.<br />Lyrically one of his best collection of music ever.  Not a big rocker like his albums from the 70s, but best lyrics since Wild, and Innocent, and all songs go together for the first time since Born to Run.<br />Anyone else spot the simularity between Paradise and Paul Simon's solo version of Sounds of Silence?<br />Waiting on a Sunny Day, will be a huge single when its released.
B000002JSP|4.0|This is a good Zeppelin album, if Led Zeppelin was releasing this as a debut in 1979. They took on a new type of music too fast. It is good though, don't get me wrong, the music is good, highlighted by Fool In The Rain and All My Love, Robert crying out to his dead son, which is one of their more beautiful songs, showcasing Robert's voice. Led Zeppelin was reaching a troubled point in their musical careers, almost as if they new the event that took Bonzo's life was going to happen and their hearts didn't seem to be in the music.  The rest is great music, but just not the Led Zeppelin we expected nor the Led Zeppelin we want to admit we're listening to. It's good music, but let's just say, thank God it was Led Zeppelin's last.
B0000640VO|5.0|I love this film.  It is beautifully done from the costumes to the settings to the music to the story.  <br />I did not know what to expect when I started to watch it.  I'm glad I did not have any set idea in my head.<br />If you enjoyed &quot;Chocolat&quot; I think you'll enjoy this too.<br />The actors are wonderful.
B00004XONN|5.0|Why can't it be possible to rate some things with about seventeen stars?  Amazon.com should look into it.  Anyway... Right from the beginning, this is greatness.  Everything In It's Right Place is fascinating.  Thom's vocals are just kinda of catterwalling, but their brilliant.  Kid A is entoxicating.  The National Anthem is a meserizing and hypnotic pulse of bass and brass and just sounds never before heard in music.  It's revolutionary and it's a spectacle.  The National Anthem is probably the best song on here, but my favortie is Idioteque.  It's sheer brilliance.  It's some kind of techno-futureisitic iamgery of the end of the world.  \\"Who's in a bunker?  Who's in a bunker?  Women and children first.\\"  It's just sheer musical mastery.  The music is perfect and I swear, for the life of me, Thom Yokr has the best voice of any singer, make or female, singing today.
B0000062Y2|5.0|First of all, you should buy the original and listen to the hell out of it.  I spent my youth riding around in my dad's car with the 8-track plugged in quite a bit.  Then, buy the movie version (this one) and listen to it.  At first, you'll hate it.  Give it a chance though, because you will learn to love it in a completely different way.  It amazes me.  I bought this one in the early nineties and then listened to the original again (after a ten year break).  They are so different -- especially the movie version's Ted Neely as Jesus.  Yvonne Elliman is in both and she is amazing.  Carl Anderson (Judas) will make you lay back and wonder why God gave him that voice and not you because it has to be so cool to be able to sing like him.  So much emotion - depth - and voice.  He is INCREDIBLE! Incredible!  You can't go wrong by buying this because it really will be a whole different experience from the original.
B000002B35|4.0|It's good, yes, but it needs so much more pre-1973.  Yes, Pink Floyd had a rebirth after Dark Side, but where's the Meddle, where's the Animals, how about more Astronomy Domine?  It's good, yes, they are an excellent live act, but if you think of live albums as Greatest Hits of sorts, which they usually are, then this is not for you.  Buy every album if you can, or at least get Echoes, the very best of Pink Floyd, according to the band.  It's good, but not great.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This disk is wonderful.  I absolutely love it.  I knew that I would.  It has so many great songs that I used to hear when I was a teenager driving around in the car all day and all night.  This album 'is' and 'is not' the eighties.  It's weird.  It almost has a timeless quality.  The song (and I don't know the title or have it in front of me right now) 'I've got the brains ... you've got the looks ... let's make lots of money'  What a song!  All the songs rock!!!    Enjoy!
B000001DTM|5.0|This is a seriously brilliant album and that is an under statement.  It isn't their best, that goes to Joshua Tree.  But this was a phenom all its own.  Zoo Station is funky, Even Better Than The Real Thing is a great groove, One is probably thier best song.  Who's Gonna Ride Your Wide Horses? is a bitter sweet song, full of pain, Ultraviolet (Light My Way) is my favorite song on this album.  Acrobat is like something out of an opera.  The Fly is psychadelic a few years too late, but it;s like I'm stuck in a time warp.  Until the End of the World is one of their better 'rock\\" songs. So Cruel is eh, so-so.  Mysterious Ways has a great Eastern influence sound, but I've gotten very sick of it, probably the one U2 song played on the radio more than any other.  Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World... all I have to say is \\"A woman needs a man, like a fish needs a bicycle.\\"  Man, that is just great!!!  Love Is Blindness just hurts, it pains me to hear this song, I just want to cry.  Not because it's bad, that's just the emotion it stirs in me.  And that is what this whole album is, emotional and brilliant.  It recevies my highest recommendation.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|When the coming alignment of all the planets in the solar system triggers the ticking of a clock hidden away by Lara Croft's  (Angelina Jolie) eccentric archeologist father (John Voight) it signals the beginning of a new era for the young adventuress.  Lord Croft's disappearance and presumed death had hurt her badly, and she had spent her life so far in a desperate quest to be what her father wanted her to be, a great field archeologist, Britain's answer to Indiana Jones.<br />Within the clock is yet another, this one the key to unlock the two pieces of the Pyramid of Light.  And the holder of the Pyramid can warp time.  Lara can return to her father and discover the cause of his disappearance.  Or the Illuminati can take over the world.  To prevent this Lara must outwit and outmuscle Powell (Iain Glen) the conspiracies agent.  And keep her old friend Alex West (Daniel Craig) from selling her out.<br />Based on the computer game series by Eidos Interactive, Jolie's Lara is smart, sexy, and tough as nails.  The actress spent three months in hard physical training for the part and performed many of her own stunts.  Of course, this isn't the kind of film where great acting is to be expected.  But all the characters, from Lara's eccentric assistant Bryce (Noah Taylor) right through to the star herself turn in solid, professional performances.  If the dialog isn't brilliant, at least it isn't stupid.  Of course, the real stars of the film aren't the humans but the technical teams.<br />I hardly thought that, when I first read Shea and Wilson's 'Illuminatus Trilogy' some thirty years ago, that I would find myself watching astonishing adventures of at heroine of a computer game in a race against time to save the world.  Completely new technologies would have to come into being before this was possible.  Back then, the closest thing to a real time game was an anemic version of Star Trek, and the only adventure game had you chasing (very slowly) through a few dozen 'twisty little passages.'  Taken from that viewpoint, the spectacular visuals of 'Tomb Raider' are a testimonial to the state of animation and special effects.<br />The film is meant to be fun, and a recreation in 'reality' of a computer game world, and does that perfectly.  Lara, as a woman, succeeds in a world where we once thought only men had a place.  Even so, almost every other actor in the film is male, the next longest female role being the bit part of a Cambodian girl (Ayla Amiral), who points out the entrance to one of the lost tombs.  Angelina is literally 'without competition.'  Even with a new Lara Croft film in the offing, this one will be tough to beat.<br />The requisite extras are provided on the DVD.  Features on visual effects, Angelina Jolie, the computer game, Angelina Jolie, the director's commentary, and (of course) Angelina Jolie.little passages.'

B000002J03|5.0|This is everything your friends told you it was and it they weren't lying. Whole Lotta Love is the greatest hard rock song of all time. What Is And What Should Never Be is a great showcase for Robert's voice, kind of a slow beginning, \\"If I say to you tomorrow...\\" then the instruments kick in and his voice just shoots up so high it's unbelievable. The Lemon Song is, well, the Amazon review said, \\"the juice is running down Robert's leg,\\" you can figure it out. Thank You is one of the greatest loves songs of all time, and it's a positive love song from Led Zeppelin, not their down and out blues from their debut. Heartbreaker and Living Loving never go on the radio seperate, they are like We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions. Rock radio staples. Ramble On is one of the greatest songs ever, it's just so funky and the effect on Robert's voice is so cool. Sadly, Train and Fuel tried, and I stress tried, to cover this on a duel edition of VH1's story tellers and it wasn't good at all. Stick with the original. Moby Dick, come on now John, leave the poor drums alone, you beat the hell out of them enough on the debut, what did they ever do to you? I love this song and the guitar is great when it's there. Finally, Bring It On Home is the blues offering on this one, then, it's goes balls out and rocks and just hits you up side the head and knocks you off your feet. This fully affirms my stance that Led Zeppelin are the second greatest rock 'n' roll band of all time, behind only The Beatles.  This is a legendary album and it was only their second album.  The best sophomore album I have ever heard.  Let me just say, one of the greatest ever gets my highest recommendation.
6304806418|5.0|I don't know why some critics shot this film down or why the boxoffice business wasn't better.  I am not a Madonna fan but heard so much about this production and thinking what a wonderful pick.  When i finally did see the movie and saw Madonna, my first thoughts were Madonna IS Eva Peron.  Madonna is more than WONDERFUL in this film, she stood out like a Goddest.Give this film a change, everything about this production is flawless. Great Job!
B000002UJQ|4.0|This album is inventive and revolutionary.  Karma Police is the big hit and it's easy to see why.  Their collective musical abilities are best exemplified by this songs melodies and Thom Yorke is one of the best singers in a band today.  I love the meaning of it, very social-commentary like in the veins of Rage Against The Machine and the almighty PINK FLOYD.  The Stephen Hawking thing kinda weirds me out a bit and it sort of throws my listening experience off a bit, but it's still great.  You can't not like this album if this is your favorite genre, favorite band or you just like music.  Album of the Year nominee isn't too unreasonable, but one of VH1's 100 Greatest Albums of All Time, I would've picked Kid A for that distinction over Ok, Computer, but it still get's my highest recommendation.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Okay, here's some facts about the movie before I start this review.<br />Fact:  Yes, this movie isn't too close to the storylines in the \\"Resident Evil\\" games.  I've played a couple of them, but not much to know the storylines.<br />Another Fact:  This movie SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME SO BAD!  And I don't scare easliy when it comes to horror movies.<br />I happened to love everything about \\"Resident Evil.\\"  I was a little worried at first, because we all know track records of movies based on video games.  They're not that good.  So, I was going into this movie with some kind of hope, but I was worried.  Well, I ended up enjoying EVERY MINUTE of the movie.  It was so good and so scary.  It was dark, twisted, and sinister.<br />Though the movie does tend to seperate itself from the orignal video game some, the basic elements are still the same.  Zombies, killer dogs, mutant killers, and a nasty virus that can destroy mankind as we know it.<br />The story:  The Umbrella Corporation is a very wealthy business.  It sells household products everywhere.  But what the public doesn't know is that it makes most of its money off of human experimentaion and biological weapons.  One day....something goes wrong.  Very wrong.  That's all you need to know.  There's a bunch of twists and turns this movie takes that I am not going to give away.  But let me say this....this movie has one hell of a dark and twisted ending that really made the movie that much better.<br />The DVD looks and sounds incredible.  Too bad that there isn't a DTS option available, but they might release this in Superbit.  But it looked and sounded awesome.  It also has some nice extra features.  Not a lot, but enough to keep you happy.<br />(Note:  If you're wondering why they didn't load this DVD with extras, it's probably because of all the negative feedback this movie got and how little it made in the box office.  So don't complain about it and accept it.  How in the world do you expect them to put a lot of money on the DVD when it did so poorly at the theatres?)<br />All in all, this movie was fantastic, and I loved every minute of it.  Let it be known, if you are a die hard fan of the video game, then maybe you should pass on this one.  Because you might be disappointed.  Then again, I read some of the other reviews from people who are fans of the game and enjoyed the movie.  If you are looking for a really good scary zombie movie, instead of these stupid teen-slasher flicks that have been coming out, see \\"Resident Evil.\\"  If this doesn't sound like anything you'd like, maybe you'd be better off with seeing \\"Jason X\\" or the latest \\"Halloween\\" movie.  This was an awesome movie that scared the hell out of me.  I loved every second.<br />(Favorite scene in the movie:  When they are trying to shut the power down, the Red Queen is telling them it would be a mistake.  As soon as they're about to cut the power, she turns her head, looks at them, and says, \\"You're all going to die down here.\\"  Creepy and awesome!)money on the DVD when it did so poorly at the theatres?)<br />All in all, this movie was fantastic, and I loved every minute of it.

B000002J0B|5.0|This is just so great.  The Sone Remains The Same explodes just like normal Zeppelin rock and then settles off and lets Robert's vocals take over.  The Rain Song is just beautiful, wonderful orchestration and it's just a pretty, pretty song.  Over The Hills And Far Away is a fun and funky song, a very deep funky bass line.  It is my favorite Zeppelin song and it's just really great.  The Crunge, eh, I'm kind of indifferent.  Dacing Days is great, kind of funky, saying take that disco, sort of.  But it;s another Zeppelin dance song if you want to be so daring.  D'yer Mak'er is the most misunderstood song title ever.  It's pronounced Jamaica, little known fact.  But, it's great, like the calypso and the up and donw beats, very rhythmic.  No Quarter is one of the greatest Zeppelin songs you've never heard.  This is another song inspired by The Lord Of The Rings.  I love this song.  It starts out with a wierd synthesizer effect and then it starts to rock.  Robert wails and has just such an amazing voice, almost operatic.  John Paul's piano is grand.  The Ocean is a hard, no nonsense pound it out loud rock, great ending.  Great album, worthy follow up to IV.  Get's my highest recommendation.
B000063UR2|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to be released with the cut scenes restored for so long.  I had both soundtracks but had only seen the American version with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack.  I like the Tangerine Dream soundtrack more on its own, but I think I prefer the director's cut with the original score.  Although T.D.'s soundtrack is otherworldly, Goldsmith's reflects the innocence and naivete of the characters along with the dreamlike and nightmarish fantasy world.  I've always loved this movie, and the restored scenes made it even better.  It's one of my favorite movies of all time along with Blade Runner (although I'm undecided on which version is better for that one).  If only Ridley Scott would do more sci-fi/fantasy movies nowadays.
B000002J09|5.0|This is the absolute greatest hard rock record of all time.  I should 't even have to review it.  I should just take this time to tell you about me, that I'm a writer working on my first play, I act on stage, mostly musical but I prefer plays, and I'm seeking graduate admission to a history program at a western New York college.  And also, I listen to amazing music like this.  Now, I will decide to review this album.  It rocks.  It's hard and heavy and beautifully melodic and just so damn good.  Black Dog rocks and it rocks hard.  &quot;Hey, hey momma said the way you groove gonna make you sweat gonna make you groove.&quot;  Damn, you  just hear Rober Plant screach that out and your eyes just bug the hell out of your head.  This is one of the hardest songs ever and Jimmie has some of his most fun on his guitar on this song.  Rock And Roll is a Led Zeppelin dance tune, can you believe it?  It is an homage to the great old dance tunes and is a dance tune itself.  Bonzo's drums are great.  The Battle Of Evermore is a great story song, using some great inspiration from The Lord of the Rings and J.R.R. Tolien.  And then we have Stairway... I don't even have to say the whole title, you know exactly what I'm talking about.  It's an epic.  It's the most requested song in radio history.  A friend of mine told me that when she was in college, her school's radio station played it every night at 11 PM, every day, for one year straight.  This isn't a song, it's a masterpiece.  Misty Mountain Hop is funky and the synthesizers are great.  Four Sticks is groovey, very fast paced and I love the beat.  Going To California is Unplugged before they was MTV.  It's great.  And finally, the explosive When The Levee Breaks pounds and roars and is as destructive as the floods it depicts.  Turn down the volume because you can shake your speakers off the shelf with this one.  Let me just say, this is a classic, the classic hard rock album of all time from the greatest hard rock band of all time.  It get's my highest recommendation.
B000021Y77|5.0|A very creative, smart, hip, and stylish film.  The soundtrack is excellent (if you like techno).
B00005QDW5|5.0|I never thought it was possible to pick apart such albums as Dark Side or Wish You Were Here and come up with a best of Pink Floyd album, but I guess this is the best anyone could do.  If you have the money, please, do yourself a favor and go out and get every album that contributes a song to this compilation.  Yes, these are the best songs of Pink Floyd's career, but all of their albums have to be enjoyed in their entirety.  But nonetheless, if you want a great introduction to the Pink Floyd catalogue, this is it.  It can introduce you to the Syd era if you should choose that era, the Roger Waters era, or even the David Gilmour era.  I give this my highest recommendation.

Once I got beyond thinking that this was the original, only with cooler effects, I allowed myself to enjoy it. I think it deserves much more than the low star ratings I keep seeing pop up. This film does not, and in my opinion, does not try to replace the original. It's another vision of similar material. I loved it. And the effects are quite awesome. <br />On a slight side note: In my opinion, Jeremy Irons will always be perfectly cast as a villian. No offense to the actor. His voice, his mannerisms. . . he just plays one so well. I liked the lead actor also, even though I was somewhat bothered by him in the beginning. Good movie. If you're wondering, buy it, but don't go in expecting H.G. Wells. Sit back and have fun.
6304698623|1.0|Doesn't it bother anyone that they changed the book so much??? New York instead of London, Sarah not looking at all like she's supposed to, and a different ending?   If you REALLY want to appreciate A Little Princess, why doesn't someone make a DVD version of the BBC Production with Amelia Shankey, who is a much truer Sarah in a much more faithful version.  We managed to find it on VHS but not DVD.  The book has been loved for three generations -- why mess with it??

0375751513|3.0|Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a `full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.<br /><br />One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.<br /><br />Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. `Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].<br /><br />When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.<br /><br />Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.<br /><br />Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.<br /><br />Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially `snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.<br /><br />If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt.ourage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.  <BR> <BR>Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot.

B00005B36H|4.0|Why King Crimson opened for Tool and not the other way around will always be a mystery to me. I guess it's because Tool can literally make something out of nothing. If you take a little time to listen to each of the constituent parts of each of these songs you'll find only the most rudimentary riffs. The guitars all sound the same, no matter what register they're playing: a tight, snarling spring. The monotone singing hardly matters -- despite the sweating -- and the percussion is almost all tom fills.<br />What Tool accomplishes with these rudimentary elements is the real value of the music: the band must be a collection of master arrangers. These simple components are taken apart and put together in different ways, always comprised of a pattern that doesn't ever get past variations of Fast Loud / Slow Quiet / Fast Quiet / Slow Loud / Scream / Repeat. And that's where things start to happen. The interaction of these simple elements is all that's needed to keep you hooked as phrases begin to moire and shudder against each other, bleeding through the tightly sprung sound to create an illusion of music. (Anyone remember Rhys Chatham?).<br />In ways that are alternately numbing and exhilarating, Tool takes this severely limited vocabulary and hones it to a shining, serrated edge. The result is high style, breathtaking to behold, and completely unencumbered by substance. I like to think of this album as less &quot;progressive&quot; and more like a late 20th Century version of the Stooges &quot;Funhouse&quot;, despite the fact that  Tool does manage to paraphrase a riff from &quot;Lark's Tongues in Aspic.&quot;<br />No question, this is fun stuff and good to have around. The deliberate economy and monolithic quality of sounds and phrases is masterful -- just don't take it too seriously.
B000068QY7|4.0|I've loved a lot of Oasis tunes in my day, but strangely, it's a hidden track on \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" that might just rank as one of my favorites by the band. Long after \\"Better Man\\" ends, starting at 33 minutes, 13 seconds, a dusky voice counts off \\"two, three, four,\\" and listeners are suddenly privy to one of Oasis' most mesmerizing tunes ever. The hidden track sounds as if it was played in a smoky bar long after the last patron stumbled home, and the guys in the band, perhaps a little drunk themselves, are letting off some low-key steam. The draw of the song is a repetitive chiming riff played alongside easy drums and bass. A third of the way through, Noel Gallagher's guitar suddenly turns a little angrier as he wails away on one of the prettiest guitar moments I've ever heard by any band. The guitar solo by Noel has a faraway sound, only furthering the barroom feel of the song. It's as if he's standing away from the rest of his mates. This is all a tad blues-based, yes, but also very rock and roll. Midway through there's some solid harmonizing, the only vocals laid down during the song. The second solo by Gallagher is even more amazing, higher pitched, still far away and a tad more urgent. A lulling flute is thrown in after both guitar solos, giving the tune an elegiac feel. Despite its laid-back quality, I always find myself concentrating hard on every aspect of this beautiful tune, perhaps because it's not exactly readily available and I don't know when I'll hear it again.<br /><br />As far as the \\"un-hidden\\" tracks, much of this album is meaty rock and roll, vintage Oasis. Liam Gallagher contributed greatly to \\"Heathen Chemistry,\\" and his voice sounds fighting-hungry on the standout opening tune \\"The Hindu Times,\\" which should have been released as a single. The following song, \\"Force of Nature,\\" sung by Noel, is equally as tough and melodic, with some piano thrown in for good measure. Track three, \\"Hung in a Bad Place,\\" written by Gem Archer and sung perfectly by Liam, is a rollicking good time, the perfect Oasis song.<br /><br />Save for the overly maudlin \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out,\\" even the normally lame love songs are outstanding on this CD, with Liam contributing one of them. \\"Songbird\\" is a beauty of a short-and-sweet tune by Liam, with sincere, unique lyrics and great organ work. \\"She is Love\\" by Noel is another great love song, but of a different nature than \\"Songbird.\\" Like \\"Songbird,\\" \\"She is Love\\" is quiet but acoustic, and lively in a campfire sort of way, with non-cheesy and genuine lyrics.<br /><br />Noel does a bit of soul searching on the wonderful \\"Little by Little,\\" a mid-tempo song that might contain some of his best, most reflective lyrics ever put to tape. Equally as interesting is Liam's surprisingly psychedelic-sounding \\"Born on a Different Cloud,\\" a mellow tune that calls to mind some of the best work by The Beatles in that band's heyday. Liam's best song is probably the last official tune on the album, \\"Better Man,\\" a lively, almost danceable romp where he promises -- surprise, surprise -- to be a better guy to those around him. It's a great tune, and it of course leads to the aforementioned hidden track, which comes highly recommended.<br /><br />There's something about the production of \\"Heathen\\" that comes off as a bit more streamlined and clean than past Oasis albums, as if the new band lineup, shed of all its beer, drugs, women and touring, is looking to make a statement of starting afresh and acting in a more positive, grown-up way.

0316666343|5.0|I picked this book off the shelf at my book store for no other reason than being in a hurry.  It had not been recommended, nor had I ever heard of the book or the author, therefore I had no expectations.  I literally laughed and cried out loud the three nights it took me to fininsh this book!  I found it to be COMPLETLEY depressing and utterly beautiful at the same time!  My husband and kids all yelled at me saying, &quot;just put it down&quot; as I sobbed, and my answer was &quot;this is what a well written book does to you!&quot;  FANTASTIC!!
B0000630YA|5.0|I have owned this cd for about 10 years and have only recently rediscovered its beauty.  The images and stories described in these songs have inspired my writing and give light to the darker side of me.<br />The most noted song on this cd is the single \\"Only Women Bleed\\".  While this is a great song, three other songs stand out in my mind.  \\"Black Widow\\" and \\"Devil's Food\\", which could be one song in itself, tell the story of spider taking over the world from the view of a mad scientist.  The highlight of the cd for me is \\"Steven\\".  Steven is the character that makes regular appearances of Alice's cd.  This song allows Steven to speak directly to the listener.  Alice sings this song in a child-like voice.  \\"Escape\\" , \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\", and \\"The Awakening\\" are other great songs.  An awesome cd, and a must for any fan of Alice Cooper.  So are your nightmares like this?
B000003TAW|5.0|There are perhaps 10 or 11 albums I own that I can listen to all the way through and not skip any tracks.  This is one of them.  Fantastic musicianship with big guitars, Beach Boy-inspired harmonies and the best pop songwriting of the decade.  Throw out all the stupid monikers and genre-titles like &quot;geek rock&quot; and &quot;emo-core.&quot;  This is simply good rock and roll.  People tend to call all songs about not getting the girl, or getting dumped or unrequitted love &quot;emo.&quot;  News flash;  rock has _always_ been about that subject, from it's earliest incarnations as doo-whop to the masterpieces &quot;No One Else&quot; and &quot;Only In Dreams&quot; presented here.
0312265859|4.0|We thoroughly enjoyed Janet Evanovich's first six Stephanie Plum series about a bounty hunter who has trouble getting out of her own way. With a crazy supporting cast family, especially Grandma Mazur; and two male romantic interests -- Ranger, a fellow mysterious bounty hunter; and Morelli, a cop who deflowered Plum in high school, and who seems to be the best bet for her long term -- the humor and enjoyment seemed to come as a natural byproduct of the stories and the author's writing style. However, book #7 seemed so forced out it was a huge disappointment to almost all but the die-hard fans. Thankfully, Hard Eight is more of a return to the earlier work. Our only quibble is that now the ineptitude of Plum, and her tendency to burn up cars and find dead bodies all over the place, is getting a bit stale. It may be the set has little remaining life expectancy as is.<br />But this one continues to entertain with a light story about Plum's inability to capture one of her assignments; about a lawyer named Kloughn, the [brunt] of innumerable \\"clown\\" jokes, who follows Plum around like a puppy; and Steph's inability to resolve her own conflicts about the two men in her life and what to do about them. She finally \\"gets lucky\\" about halfway through the book, at which point we were almost relieved for her. But the book ends on some of the same querulous notes about her and Morelli as we've heard before.<br />A plot about a missing neighbor and her daughter was a slight shift from earlier books, but pretty much continued to pose as the excuse for the Plum goings-on throughout. In sum, Hard Eight represents a pretty typical entry in the Evanovich Plum series, but for those that have read all eight, the title may have some subtle ulterior meanings. Before we get \\"Nine Ball\\" (or whatever), perhaps somebody can figure out how to give Plum's life a facelift, as she does not seem to be growing older on us gracefully.
B000069HKH|5.0|perhaps no other album this year will touch this new springsteen in terms of musicanship, songwriting, depth or relative importance...but even so, this complete package works on so many intrinsic levels that all comparisons become irrelevant.  this, perhaps more so than any other US album released in recent memory, begs no comparison.    bruce and e-street have perfectly captured what was felt before, during and after the terrible occurances on that fateful day... the title itself relevant to all three, to love and hate not.  as the e-street players heed the call of the boss, the absolute american spirit will rise to the occasion.  this document will survive, as told by rock's greatest poet...
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce is back. He is the only artist who could emotionally and spiritually capture the mood of the country around the events of 9/11. You have to listen to this album from beginning to end without interruption at least once to get the full effect of his work. This is a brilliant piece of work that gets better with every listen. Do not listen to the nay sayers. You have to take the time to listen and digest the message being sent. That's what brilliant artists make you do. This is not your teenie bop album of songs that have no real message of meaning. Some of the highlights of the album are \\"You're Missing\\", \\"Empty Sky\\", \\"Worlds Apart\\" and \\"My City of Ruins\\". This album when looked at in its entirety will go down in history as one of the greatest records of all time.
0684800713|2.0|i had to read this book for school, and although it was good at times, i would never even think of reading it on my own. the first part was really boring and did not contribute anything to the whole book. about the second part, im a very patient person, but having the same thing happening over and over again without any action was really making the book longer and longer. seriously, every single day the characters did the same exact thing: drink, argue, drink, drink, and argue again. the only thing i liked about the book was the way hemingway wrote it. he really has beautiful and very poetical writing. im from spain, and i was really surprised at how exact his descriptions are of my country. though sometimes his descriptions were boring and lengthy, it was almost as if you were reading a photograph. i just think the story wasnt that great...  my point is: why read the book? just come to spain!
B000066HI4|5.0|This is and should be an essential album in the annals of music. What else can be said?
B000069HKH|5.0|After 9/11 a funny thing happened. The paramedics and firefighters I work with who are usually the stereotypical \\"tough\\" guys and girls, became softer and more open to emotion..and sharing emotion, while a lot of my friends who don't work in the emergency serives field became colder and closed off emotionally. Anyway this album was very cathartic for me. At first listen there doesn't apear to be much there..but after reading the lyrics it becomes a great album.Interesting how some of the saddest lyrics are partnered with the more upbeat music.

B00003CXZ1|4.0|Before I even watched this movie, I was convinced that this movie was gonna suck. After seeing such horrible video game-to-movie disasters as Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, and the Mortal Combat movies, I only decided to see this movie because of the presence of Angelina Jolie. To my surprise, I walked out of the theatre very satisfied with what I saw.     First, the plot was very good. I expected this movie to be a shoot-em-up movie with almost no story, but boy was I wrong! The plot of this movie is one of the most complex (and one of the coolest) I've ever seen! Put simply, Lara Croft must use a mysterious, ancient clock she found to race against the Illuminati to get the two halves of an ancient triangle. (The two halves are hid at opposite ends of the globe.) When the two halves are put together, they can alter time, but this can only happen during the planetary alignment, which only happens every 5,000 years.     Filling in the gaps are some great action scenes, which includes fighting giant rock monsters, a fight in Lara's mansion, and more. Also, Angelina's character is actually devloped in this film. I expected just some nudity or something, but instead there are emotional scenes that tastefully develop her as a person as well as her past.    Everything else is top-notch in this movie: The special effects are great and the villains are truly convincing. The sets are wonderful, as is the cinemetograpghy. The acting is decent and the action scenes are well executed. (Angelina Jolie trained for 3 months to learn fighting techniques and how to operate firearms for this film.)    The only flaw to this movie is that it sort of rips off Indiana Jones and the ending is sort of weak. But most people will be able to forgive the ending because of the earlier events in the movie.     Simply put, this movie is a must-see for action/adventure fans and anyone who appreciates a good story.    2001; 100 minutes; Rated PG-13 for intense but muted sequences of action/adventure violence, mild language, and some sensuality.
B000002KEV|5.0|OK, Maybe Live at Leeds. But not quite. This IS the definitive live R&R record of all time. And the definitive Deep Purple Album. Period. It just doesnt get better. Pure chemistry. Pure inspiration. This is pure Purple Magic at it's peak. A place in time and history that can never be repeated. Buy it now! Put on the headphones, turn it up and smile. By the time you get to Space Truckin' (I.P's cymbal work is majestic) you'll wonder if R&R has anything left to offer! Stop reading and buy it!
B000069HKH|3.0|Springsteen has set the standard for himself with past classic albums, such as Born to Run, Darkness and Nebraska (you can even add The River, Born in the USA, Tunnel of Love and Tom Joad). <br />I understand what Springsteen was attempting to do with his new album &quot;The Rising&quot;. However, I don't understand why the album needs to be 72 minutes long and I don't understand the arrangement and selection of some of the songs. <br />The fact that with classic past albums it is almost impossible to listen to them any other way then the way they have been presented to the audience. The way &quot;The Rising&quot; has been presented to us is absolutely frustarting, long and filled with repeptitve lyrics. <br />You can't listen to this CD from start to finish. The two facts that there are too many fillers, (Let's Be Friends, World's Apart, Counting on a Miracle,Nothing Man) and that the arrangement of the songs is so out of sync, you are forced to edit the album down to 10 or 11 songs in a proper &quot;Springsteen Story Telling Order&quot;. How can he leave of studio versions of &quot;American Skin&quot; and &quot;Land of Hopes and Dreams&quot; ? These are the two finest penned songs by Springsteen in the last decade. <br />Even the strongest songs on the album seem to be missing lyrics as he repeats the same lines over and over and over again. A sign that he possibly rushed this album in order to get out on the road to reconnect with the audience. <BR>My reccommendation would be to edit the album and rearragnge the songs in the following manner. With the list below you would have an album that ranks with Darkness rather than Human Touch(another album that suffers from poor song selection and arrangement). <br />1)Lonesome Day <BR>2)Into the Fire <BR>3)The Rising <BR>4)Empty Sky <BR>5)Your Missing <BR>6)My City of Ruins <BR>7)Further On <BR>8)The Fuse <BR>9)American Skin (add on) <BR>10)Waiting on a Sunny Day <BR>11)Mary's Place <BR>12)Land of Hopes and Dreams (add on)

B000059TPN|5.0|This film is simply the bomb!! I absoultely love it 2 bits.  I have watched it maybe 10 times and I still love it.  The action sequences r stunning and the plot complex and vastly entertaining.  But the best thing about the film are the characters.  Connery and Cage's characters are excellent 2 watch and it is hillarious how different they r.  Connery is the...SAS ultimate solder and Cage is the timid...\\"lab rat!!\\"  Fab movie and defintly one of the best action movies of all times.  Another refreshing thing is that the characters r really well developed and throughout the flick u begin 2 understand them and begin to bond with them.  Da bomb!!!
B000002BFL|5.0|The other night, a music critic who was a guest on some Tv show was saying that Springsteen's new album marked a return to form, after some fairly lost and desultory recordings made while Springsteen was living in LA.  Since I knew that Ghost of T. Joad had been recorded in LA, I decided to give it another listen.  Now, I feel that I never gave this astonishing recording a proper listen in the first place.<br />Just for the sake of argument, I wish that Tv critic had said something about his evaluative criteria; since the Tv show he was on was obviously about the new album and tour, I imagine that the critic sees the E St. Band as definitive and perhaps preferable Springsteen.  That's fine, but sometimes electricity and volume can be a kind of substitute, even a poor substitute, for the impact of the gentle, devastating beauty and compassion Springsteen achieves on this recording.<br />I haven't always been a big Springsteen fan, though I've always found his music interesting and fun enough.  As I listen to this recording, however, I have no doubt that this is the work of a great artist.  I find it very hard not to cry as I listen to these songs; regardless of tears, my heart aches, and in a way that renews my passion to work for a more just and humane world.<br />It would be interesting to spend an evening listening to Ghost of T. Joad, Steve Earle's Transcendental Blues, and Lucinda Williams (perhaps Car Wheels or Essence).  These are hugely compassionate artists who create astounding beauty in the very midst of almost intolerable heartache.  Check it out.
B00005YTN5|5.0|Of the many impressive facets of the Velvet Underground's debut, perhaps the most impressive of all is how completely undated it sounds. While those who followed in the VU's footsteps often sounded retro -- often purposefully so -- this gritty, thirty-five year-old creation seems not to have aged a day.<br /><br />Polydor's latest double-disc reissue collects both the mono and stereo mixes of the original album, digitally remastered, and adds contemporaneous singles and a quintet of VU-powered tracks from Nico's subsequent \\"Chelsea Girl\\" album. The package is enveloped in a foldout digipack (with or without peelable banana artwork), with a thick booklet that includes newly penned liner notes from Dave Thompson, photos, song lyrics and recording credits.<br /><br />Of particular interest to U.S. buyers is the mono album mix, previously available only outside the U.S. This is the band's vision of the album, later remixed into stereo by MGM staff producer (and, at the time, Simon & Garfunkel producer) Tom Wilson. The mono version is tougher, and in the opinion of the band's label at the time, too limiting for American audiences (both for its intensity, and for the US's burgeoning interest in stereo). The difference in atmosphere is a terrific lesson in how mixing affects an album, and how visceral mono recordings can be.<br /><br />The bonus tracks include five sides waxed by Nico with the original lineup of the Velvet Underground for her solo debut. Recorded in April 1967, they followed the band's original recording dates by exactly a year (the VU debut, recorded in April 1966, did not see release until March of the following year). The songs, from Reed, Cale and Sterling Morrison are rendered lightly, with strings and flutes (apparently much to Nico's displeasure), a minimum of Reed's guitar, and no drums. The VU's more ferocious and dissonant side really only turns up on \\"It Was a Pleasure Then.\\" Combining these sides with the original album provides a nice opportunity to listen to the original VU lineup's entire ouevre.<br /><br />The singles offer a chance to hear \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" shaved down from it's original 5:58 to a 45's worth of 2:49. Less radically, the single release of \\"I'll Be Your Mirror\\" resolves with a chord, rather than a fade as on the album. Even more minor is the two seconds of what seems to be engineer's chatter (announcing the tape roll) that precedes the single release of \\"Sunday Morning.\\" The fetishism of collecting these minute differences seems like a natural fit for VU fans.<br /><br />Those looking to hear this watershed album for the first time will likely be just as happy with the single-disc 1996 reissue. For those who've loved (and lived) this album over the last thirty-five years, the opportunity to view it from a new angle shouldn't be passed up.ginal VU lineup's entire ouevre.

B000002H6C|5.0|AJFA is without a doubt the greatest album ever recorded. Many people call Master of Puppets tallica's greatest but that's not right. AJFA is more complex, longer, heavier, and in my opinion faster. Blackened is get's you headbanging so fast it's not even funny. AJFA (title track) is my favorite song of all time. It's heavy, a pretty good speed, long as hell and it's just plain awesome. Eye of the Beholder is a nice heavy tune that fun to headbang to. What hasn't been said about \\"One?\\" It's one of the best songs ever written and there's no doubt why. It starts rather dark and very melodic and then get's down right fast. The last 2 minutes are incredibly fast and the solos are blistering. Harvester of Sorrow is an awesome song. It's one of those tunes that gets you pumped up and makes you feel like you're invincible. It's hard as hell and the main riff kicks ... The Shortest Straw is surprising fast and with good lyrics it rocks as well. The Frayed Ends of Sanity starts with something strait out of the Wizard of Oz but when it starts up it's fast and it has a great solo. To Live Is To Die was written in memory of Cliff Burton, they're first bassist. It's slower than the majority of songs on this album but it's probably their best instrumental. It's long and very emotional. And to close out the album is the very fast Dyer's Eve. For all of those double bass lovers, AJFA is the tallica album that has the most double bass. This album rocks and rank, in my book and in many others', as the greatest album ever!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I wasn't a fan of Pink's when I happened upon her infectious \\"Get the Party Started\\" video in a store. To me, she was just a blip on the music radar - a one-hit wonder; in fact, I couldn't even think of the title of her hit from her first album. So, when I saw the video for her sophomore album's first single, I was pleasantly surprised; I wasn't blown away yet, but the music had a nice beat. It was after I bought the album that I realized what an artist she truly is. Albeit her songs are danceable and contain within themselves elements of generic pop, there is a surprising amount of profundity instilled in her songs. Britney might lament that she's no longer a girl and not yet a woman, but Pink has more personal and agonizing issues with which to deal. <br />The rhythmic beats of \\"Missundaztood,\\" which opens the album, has a blithe and communal sound that shows Pink's willingness to bare her soul while having some fun. \\"I've been a bad, bad girl\\" is a line (from the catchy and devious-sounding \\"Dear Diary\\") that could easily tumble from the mouths of Britney Spears, Willa Ford, ad infinitum; however, with Pink there is an undeniable sense of honesty behind those words, an honesty that is not necessarily sexual in nature. \\"Get the Party Started\\" might be the indubitable radio hit, but \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" is another mid-tempo winner that concerns self-image and reveals Pink's insecurities, a song to which many girls should be able to relate. If her vocals haven't sound too impressive in the past, she makes up for it with tracks like the soulful and introspective \\"Eventually.\\" But, if slow and soulful songs are not your bag, there is still \\"Just Like A Pill,\\" another infectious song that sounds remarkably like a mid-tempo rock version of Whitney Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You.\\" Rockers will enjoy the in-your-face and guitar-heavy \\"Numb\\" that is reminiscent of Platinum Blonde. Heavy beats interspersed with silence flows into a rhythmic guitar introduction that brings along Pink's reflective and intense \\"My Vietnam.\\" \\"Life keeps on dropping bombs / and I keep score,\\" she sings on the track, an important statement that encapsulates the reason for her musical endeavors.<br />The diversity that Pink demonstrates on this second album is remarkable and rare; to improve with success is something rarely seen in the music business. She is surprisingly savvy about the music business - of course, there must be the radio hooks, which is irrefutably \\"Get the Party Started\\"; however, there must also be some depth and improvement to attest to longevity, and the rest of the album appeases a wide variety of tastes: the rock song, the sexy song, the painful and introspective song, the R&B / Soul song, etc. Some might be disappointed that the entire album doesn't contain songs similar to the first hit single, but some might just be pleasantly surprised with songs that will hold their interest for longer than a month.
B00004VVND|4.0|I remember when this movie came out - James was a very popular TV actor at the time, and this movie was supposed to be the catalyst for his transition from TV star to movie star.<BR>  So when you watch this, remember - James is the star of the movie, not Yul Brynner or that other guy with the dark hair.  Once you've got that sorted out you can enjoy the movie as I did when it was first released!
0553213105|5.0|This book was not on any of my school reading lists so I did not come across it until I was almost 30.  I am now 50 and have probably read it 10 times and seen every version of it on film...twice.  It is a becutiful story of women and human nature.  I have never had a problem seeing the Bennetts as my contemporaries. Anyone who reads this book will immediately recognize these characters and their situations.  Women may be more independent today, but there are still women who seek marriages simply to validate themselves or their lifestyles. Not only have I enjoyed this book, I have learned from it.  I highly recommend it.
B000005RS0|5.0|This is the most complete Tina Turner album there is, giving the best taste of all her abilities. Other albums of her's, whilst good do not give the full vocal/emotional picture. 'Help' is a sweet rendition of the Beatles' track and one of the best covers ever. 'Rock n roll widow' is soft and full of controlled pain. 'Steel Claw' is a hard rock scorcher, revealing her energy and rawness. 'What's love..?&quot; is a track you are always willing to listen to and 'Better be Good to Me' is another rock n roll belter. 'Let's stay together' and 'Private Dancer' are superb songs and very well sung, and are well framed by tracks such as 'I might have been Queen' and 'Show some respect' which superbly show you what this woman is about. Few albums are able to present and reveal a person as well as this album presents Tina Turner, in all her passion, drive and high octane raunch. 'I wrote a letter' and 'When I was young' are great additions to the album. Tina Turner is really only appreciated when considered as a live performer. 'I can't stand the rain', for example, works far better in concert than on a studio album. But 'Private Dancer' is an album that hints at what &quot;hurricane Tina&quot; is like live and does not disapoint. This album is a snapshot of the woman with the best legs on the planet, the scariest hair on the planet and a voice that &quot;can melt vinyl&quot;. Her life's pain, torment, courage and attitude are neatly packaged on this well-stocked album and I thoroughly recommend it to you as an essential part of any musical collection. This woman was married to the man who is the &quot;father of rock n roll&quot;, has sold more concert tickets than any other woman in history, has sold 75 million albums and still rocks in her sixties - she must have a place in all music collections, she is quite simply the best.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I can't really descibe in words how good this cd is, you have to listen. <BR>It contains so much emotions, and breaks new ground for music. <BR>The songs are beautiful, emotional, entertaining and hypnotic. <BR>As someone said, its like being in a dream you never wan't to wake up from.   <BR>I guess there is nothing i can say about this cd that has not already been said.<BR>All I can say is, that if you die without listening to this, <BR>then you really have missed something. <BR>When I first bought it i listened to it about 10 hours a day for three weeks or something. <BR>I have never been near to listen to any other cd that much. <BR>This is simply a cd that you can't get tired of, because it made with so much perfection, this is how good music actually can be. <BR>Nothing surpass this album. <BR>I trully believe this is the greatest record ever made, and anyone who likes music will like this.
B000069HKH|5.0|I always wondered what it would take to get me to submit a review, and this CD is it.<br />I think Bruce's work on this album is understated brilliance, and I alternately cried and danced in my chair on the first listenings (3 consecutive). As an artist, Bruce internalized the events of 9/11 and was inspired to create what few could ever hope to; a stunning compilation of songs that masterfully and beautifully articulates the confusion, pain, aftermath, and subsequent hope of a relief worker, a loved one, a nation.<br />Bruce's songwriting skills are top-notch, and the lyrics on this album really display his capacity for tapping in to the depth of the human spirit and emotion. But the theme here is healing, so while  many of the lyrics bring you back emotionally to the events of last year, in typical Bruce style, the music also has the power to rejuvenate.<br /><br />The album is thoroughly modern in its approach, yet elements of the \\"old\\" Bruce  - the great E-Street Band sound, Clarence's provocative sax, the knock-your-socks-off guitar solos, the memorable rock-n-roll anthems - are here again, too. While listening, I can't help but picture myself dancing and singing along to many of these songs with friends at a live show. (And if you've ever been to one of his shows, you know what I mean!!!)<br />A lot of care and thought has gone in to the production details as well. Songs thread seamlessly in to one another. Additional musicians and musical styles are used to full effect. And lyrics are included.<br />THE RISING is a modern classic, in my opinion ranking right up there with Bruce's best - but will stand on it's own. More than ever, it should solidify Bruce's place in musical history. It's an album that Neil Young, Billy Joel, and certainly Bon Jovi, among others, will wish they'd made.<br />Buy it.
B000069HKH|3.0|So along with many long time Brucie fans  - the question for me was whether The Rising would be up with the classic albums of his first fifteen years (Tunnel of Love, Darkness, Born To Run being my top three) - or down with the worthy mediority of his output since. And it's the second for me.<br />The good points first. The lyrics are as fantastic as ever - full of tenderness, understanding and love. The E-Street Band sound great - imparting a real energy, which has been so lacking from Brucie's stuff recently. And I'm sure these songs will go down very well in concert.<br />And now the bad points - or rather point. Brucie in general just doesn't have the tunes he used to have. There are too many simple three-chord ideas without originality - and no amount of effort (which is there in abundance) can cover it up. For me over half the songs fall into this category - and that's too many pushes of the fast-forwards button. <br />In conclusion - The Rising is a must-buy for Brucie diehards like me - but I fear it will be gathering dust alongside Lucky Town in three months time - while I turn once again to the classics.
B00005JL3A|5.0|the visuals rock. it is very scary. the music is perfect for it. this is possibly the scariest movie ever made. i jumped many times.  it was better than i expected. i think  everyone should watch it plus michelle rodriguez is freaking hott.
B000002U8G|5.0|This 6-track masterpiece is very underrated.  Usually when you mention this album, everybody says \\"Echoes is on there.\\"  There are 5 other tracks that are definitely worth mentioning:  <br />\\"One of These Days\\" is a great opener. Spooky. Rating: 5/5<br />\\"A Pillow of Winds\\" is a very beautiful song.  Great for a rainy day. This should of been placed before \\"Echoes.\\" 5/5<br />\\"Fearless\\" is a great optimistic song.  Good for curing depression. 5/5<br />\\"San Tropez\\" is a cool jazzy song.  One of Pink Floyd's most underrated songs. 5/5<br />\\"Seamus\\" might seem like a filler but is a cool song that features a dog named Seamus.  Should of been placed away from \\"Echoes\\" though. 4/5<br />\\"Echoes\\" is a really cool song.  It is better than \\"Shine On\\" in my opinion.  It is spooky and has many mood changes.  All 23 minutes of this song are worth listening.  This song is the alone reason to buy this album.  7/5<br />So you have an album that ranks up there with \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Animals.\\"  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!
0312265859|5.0|I have a hard time getting into books but the whole Stephanie Plum Series got me reading 8 books in 2 weeks. more than I read in the year 2001. Hard eight is a great follow up from 7up. When you read the book it's not like you are reading. It's like you are watching everything happen. She is descriptive and has a great way with words. I recoment this book to everyone. You can also check out the first two chapters to all the books on Evanovich.com. Though once you read the excerps you are going to want to read the books.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is Pink Floyd best CD. Forget about The Wall and Dark Side for a minute, this is Pink's best work. I bought this early this year and I can't seem to put it down. I even own a vinyl copy. This is even better than majestic Wish You Were Here.  Despite it having long songs (3 songs over 10 minutes) I found it easy to penetrate and I fell in love with it on the first lesson.<br />The CD opens and closes with \\"Pigs On The Wing,\\" a great opening and closing to this but the three track between are Pink Floyds best. \\"Dogs\\" is a 17 minute adventure with lots of mood changes. It's a beautiful song. \\"Pigs\\" is another great song. It's another 11 minute journey and, not to mention, is a great tune for driving road trips. \\"Sheep\\" is the last part of this album. It's another 10 minute song and there is not one bad minute of it. A great closing.<br />Whenever I hear these 5 songs, I get a chill because they are such powerful songs. If length of songs doesn't matter to you, this is THE album. If you do not like long songs, try Dark Side first, if you don't already have it.<br />The most UNDERRATED album ever.

B000069HKH|5.0|The music on this disk is some of the greatest ever produced by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The Rising can hold its own when compared to such classic recordings as Darkness On The Edge Of Town and Born To Run. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are one of the few groups that have the ability to uplift and heal one's soal through the power of rock 'n roll - and The Rising is no different.
B000069HKH|5.0|Not a song in the album that misses the mark, a true rarety these days, I cannot recommend &quot;The Rising&quot; more. Not a Springsteen fanatic, I had doubts that anyone could pull off writing/singing about 9/11 and capture the true emotions of that day and its aftermath, clearly Springsteen has gone out on that fine line and succeeded wonderfully. The emotional pull of songs like &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and &quot;Empty Sky&quot; is especially strong and direct.

B000003S0K|5.0|I discovered this album about eight years after it's original release,purchasing it the year I got out of high school;it instantly became a favorite of mine and many friends. Warm Jets kick starts with Phil Manzanera's razor like rhythm guitar on \\"Needles In The Camel's Eye\\". \\"Baby's On Fire\\" features a ferocious guitar solo from Robert Fripp which some think is his best ever. \\"Driving Me Backwards\\" actually manages to sound like it's almost \\"backwards\\". Side 2 is more musically thematic with all the pieces seguing into one another. The transition from the dreamy \\"On Some Farraway Beach\\" to \\"Blank Frank\\" will jolt you out of your seat. This has got to be one of the top ten most essential albums of the 70's.

B00005YW4H|4.0|After reading most of the reviews, I would have to say that there are more positive ones than negative ones.  I myself, have listened to the album, and have found that Norah's voice is refreshing. She reminds me of several singers, but that's all it is. I'm not comparing her to jazz singers left and right because it doesn't do justice to the work that she has culminated on this album. I know that some reveiws criticize her as not being enough jazz. Well...she's not, because she is Norah Jones. We should appreciate the fact that her album a genre all on it's own. I don't think she's trying to imitate anyone, but rather her songs and her voice are influenced by artists she admires. I know there are hardcore jazz people out there, but I think we should appreciate this album for what it is.  Her smooth smokey, yet sensual voice complements her songwriting on the title track, and for the other songs as well, specifically &quot;Lonestar.&quot; I can't wait for her next album!
B00000K31Q|3.0|The movie is a cute, funny teen movie with a great cast. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies like She's All That, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, etc.<br />I don't know if it's worth the extra money to buy the DVD. It has very few extras. <br />All in all, the movie is great, the DVD is so-so.
0312265859|3.0|I've read all of the previous books in this series and found it to be not as fresh. There were still some good spots of humor.  But for the most part, instead of being the imperfectly lovable and hysterically funny character, Stephanie Plum, Bounty Hunter, comes across as unbelievably dumb.  Does Stephanie have to make so many decisions where she ends in the same situations that are all too predictable or even worse, reliving the same events (with only slight variations) from previous books in the series?  Part of the charm and incredible humor of Stephanie is the unpredictable wackiness of her character.  The main story is original but all the events occuring as the plot advances feel very much like a retread, leaving the story flat and less humorous.  First time readers of Stephanie Plum may still find Hard Eight enjoyable, despite the character problems.  This is not Janet Evanovich's best effort - don't judge the series on this one.  Instead, try one of her earlier ones - any of her first seven are well worth reading!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Let's leave aside the fact that &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of the best films of the past 10 years, it is the reason I bought a DVD player. Disc one is the movie in all it's glory, with several commentaries that are very worth listening too. I truly enjoy the banter that goes on between Pitt and Fincher, similar to the commentary in &quot;Se7en&quot; (another stellar DVD...). The second disc is a varitable candy store for fans of this movie. As a girl, I was told that I was going to hate this movie, or like it just because of Brad Pitt shirtless (but in all honesty I am much more a Norton fan!), but I have proved them wrong. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a movie for a lost generation. The cast is stellar, the filming is dark and moody- perfect for the film, and the script translates the idea of the book to the screne admirably. The book, on that thought, is also really wonderful. Though the movie differs from the book slightly, if you enjoy one you'll undoubtably enjoy the other. Buy this DVD and put aside a few hours to explore it....and be quite content doing it!

It is one of the most  &quot;true to the book&quot; movie based movie that I'd ever seen.  The other  DVD is cool also.  It has tons of extras.  My only complaint is, is that it's rediculously long.  Man!   I wouldn't reccomend this movie to kids who ccan't stay still.  May be 10 and up.  This is a very well done fantasy film worth noting.  Go out and get Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone today!

Oh, and that brings up another reason to buy this album (Randy Rhoads) Imagine If he wouldn't have died March 19, 1982 what could have given us?!?  In my mind Randy Rhoads is the greatest guitarist that ever lived!!!!! I highly recommend this album to any Ozzy Fan!!!!! Ozzy Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!

074322454X|5.0|Stephen Ambrose has proven again and again that he is the best WWII author since Ernie Pyle.  As a historian and soldier, I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in military history, WWII, basic leadership, or the common bond gained between those in stressful situations.  As a leader of soldiers and former combat qualified proven paratrooper myself, Ambrose captures the essence and exact profile required by strong leaders under fire.  His painstaking research, extensive interviews, and the trust he gained by the surviving members led to the development of one of the best example of historical writings I've ever read.  There are few books today that I, as a patriot and grateful American, would recommend to be mandatory in every high school classroom, but Band of Brothers is certainly one of them.
B00005V1Z0|5.0|This movie rocks!  That's all I need to say.
0871137380|5.0|Blackhawk Down is the first readable war story of my generation.  I've followed the development of Mark Bowden's book since his first publication of the story in the Philadelphia newspaper.  A few years prior to the battle of Mogadishu, I was myself a member of the 3rd Ranger Battalion.  At the age of 19, I was a sent to invade Panama as a member of this unit and was fortunate to know several of the men in this book.  As a former Ranger, I will tell you that Bowden left nothing out about how these elite units fight, survive, and think.  Every moment of the book is the real, gut-wrenching, dirt filled, in your face brutal truth of what it's like to be of this generation and in combat.  He accurately and vividly describes the failures of the US administration, the intelligence community, and the soldiers themselves.  Bowden also recreates the success brought about in these units through preparation, tough training, discipline, and dedication to your fellow soldiers.  Folks, if you ever wanted to know why your tax money goes to fund military training, then read this book.  If you ever doubted the military and thought its harsh, disciplined lifestyle was unnecessarily brutal and unkind, then read this book.  If you've ever thought about joining the military just for the college money, thinking that you'll never have to fight, then read this book.  This one will slap you in the face with the reality of today's elite military units.
B0000524CY|5.0|I keep my reviews short and blunt.<BR> theres a reason everyone was freaked out by this movie as a kid. Plain fact is it is scary. Very realistic portrayal of a possesion. The whole movie has a very creepy feeling and sense of dread to it. Classic horror which relies more on tension then blood.
B000063S6Z|4.0|Moby is a smart man. His newest release, \\"18,\\" comes a few years after what was arguably the most successful and surprising album of 1999, his masterpiece \\"Play.\\" Following up an album of such magnitude requires a lot of planning; artists tend to fall into the \\"if I make another just like it, just as many people will buy it\\" trap--which, in turn, tends to *backfire*. Moby, however, includes in \\"18\\" enough of \\"Play\\"'s mystique while maintaining through its music that \\"18\\" is very, very different.<br /> \\"18\\"'s main source of musical inspiration, instead of the Delta Blues style made so popular by \\"Play,\\" is the use of engaging gospel hooks and a wide array of female singers. \\"In My Heart\\" has soaring, religious vocals footed by a great beat and a piano that is suggestive of the old Moby gem, \\"God Moving Over the Face of the Waters.\\" Sylvia Robinson, her sigh of a voice sounding like Billie Holiday's or Eartha Kitt's, laments a departed lover in the haunting \\"Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday).\\" \\"In This World\\" and \\"One Of These Mornings\\" sound similar, but are both made worthy by the quality of their powerful vocals. Moby can mold this--namely, the quality of the songs or artists he samples--to craft a unique and memorable product.<br />What makes him the musical powerhouse that he is, though, is that he can serve just as ably as a singer-songwriter as he can a producer. \\"18\\" showcases just three of his trademark moody instrumentals, which shifts the focus to his songs with lyrics. Of these, three stand out. \\"Signs of Love\\" is a beautiful piece with a complex arrangement: pessimism, it seems, laid over an optimistic soundscape. \\"Extreme Ways\\" rocks hard like the album's opener, \\"We Are All Made of Stars,\\" although it is more enticing and worthier of the replay button. But \\"Sleep Alone\\" should evoke the most response in the listener. Its soothing, almost startling sexiness is downplayed as the song stands as an eerie reminder of 9/11, with lyrics like, \\"A city once full of people / Desolate / Is desolate / We look back in / To the ruins where we played . . .\\"<br />All of these experiments on \\"18,\\" plus many more, demonstrate Moby's still-unfolding path through genres and lyricism. It does not let up on what he realized he could do after the release of \\"Play.\\" Still, \\"18\\" is not as good as \\"Play\\"--but then again, that probably was never Moby's intention.
B00005RYLE|2.0|this movie is too stupid for any true horror fan to enjoy.
B000069HKH|5.0|With the array of crummy boy bands and all-to-do pop divas out there in the music industry today, it's a pleasure to see such an incredible album come to the forefront. &quot;The Rising&quot; shines with tracks like &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and not to mention &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;.  The Boss shows us once again why he's a legend in his own right.  I have never considered myself much of a Springsteen fan, but this album speaks for itself.  Do yourself a favor and show the big-wigs at the record companies that yes, more sophisticated people who are not teenie-boppers buy music.
0767819543|5.0|Central Station is a favorite film of mine.  It's very thoughtful and moving because the main characters are so sincere.  As a result, the viewer becomes attached to the main characters, Dora (the lonely retired school-teacher) and Josue (the mother-less boy looking for his father).  She battles with her moral conscience as she holds the boy's uncertain future in her hands, but she eventually finds redemption through her love for him.  Their unlikely bond cements itself as they undertake a journey through Brazil that seems to be a test of their endurance as well as their trust in each other.  I also enjoyed the film because it introduced me to a culture in which I was unfamiliar.  The film begins in the busy Central Station of Rio de Janeiro, where masses of commuters intermingle with sales-people and others trying to make a living.  Amongst all the bustle, a thief is tackled and shot by the railroad tracks.  The latter part of the film is a journey to more remote regions of Brazil, where native culture is prominent and religious pilgrimages are a common sight.  This is a very rich film that incorporates all the elements that make it an outstanding work of art.
B000002H72|5.0|First let me say that I hated this album when I first heard it some 12 years ago. I thought it was the worst [crud] I had ever heard and I was pretty mad at my friend for making me waste 45 minutes of my life. But a funny thing happened later that week. I could not stop thinking about the songs. The sound was just so alien to me at the time (gee, I was in college so we were probably listening to Bon Jovi and Rush or something) that I just could not wrap my head around it while I listened to it. I had mistaken its originality for lack of (traditional) talent. When I finally got hold of the cd again, I probably listened to it 20 times in a row, and now they are certainly one of my 5 favorite bands of all time, if not #1.<br />It wasn't until years later that I found out how many of the great songwriters and bands of the last decade name the Pixies as one of their prime influences and inspirations. There's so much stuff mixed and twisted around in here (punk, rock, country, surf, metal, electronic, pop) that, hearing it described, it's hard to not imagine it as an aural train wreck. Somehow they not only make it work, but this music is simply timeless and it's totally dissolved in my blood now. It's amazing to me that to this day, most people have never even heard of the Pixies, never mind like them.<br />You would be doing yourself a great disservice by not at least TRYING this album (which, along with \\"Bossanova\\" is what I would recommend). First find out if a friend happens to have it, or download some of the songs (\\"Wave of Mutilation\\", \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven\\", \\"No. 13 Baby\\"), because as I said it's very difficult to like right away. Keep these songs around a while and listen to them a few times while you clip your toenails. It's not for everyone. If you're a big Britney Spears or Celine Dion or even Rolling Stones fan, then beware. There might be some vomiting and there's even an outside chance your head might just explode on the spot.<br />Anyway the point is toget past the weirdness of it and appreciate its utter originality. I've never heard anyone accuse the Pixies of copying or imitating or ripping anyone else off, which is something you could say about very few bands of any kind. They play chords you've never heard before and that probably don't appear in any chord book at your local music school. Sounds out of tune? Yep...intentionally. Time signatures change up all over the place, but yet it works. The vocals go from screamingly raw to haunting to playful. Black Francis truly has one of the most unique voices you will ever hear.<br />Enough blabber, just buy it already. It's a classic modern album that I'm quite sure I'll still be listening to when I'm 70 years old and once the Pixies lull you into their web of enlightenment, you will be too!
B00003CXCQ|1.0|I am very much against this movie, for many reasons. Why it has gone down in history as a children's classic, I will never understand. I mean, come on--a jealous witch-stepmother trying to have her stepdaughter killed by a hunter? Telling the hunter to bring Snow White's heart back in a box? Turning yourself into a pathetic old beggar and poisoning an innocent girl with an apple? Not very wholesome in my eyes; it's almost kind of sad that something like this was made for a child's viewing and enjoyment. In reality, this is anything but child material.<br />I will not deny the DVD. It is good--very good. But I hate this movie, and I'm sure that some of you may dislike me for saying that, but it surprises me that people don't see what a horrible film this really is. If you're going to make a horror movie, that's fine, but don't coat it with animation, stick in some \\"good guys\\" (in this case, the dwarfs) and call it a children's movie. There are some action films that are more kid-friendly than this. To me, \\"Snow White\\" is just too much. It's vulgar, crude, and just altogether violent. Not the kind of Disney movie you need a big, lengthy DVD for. Pick a better quality Disney movie for that.<br />You might completely disagree with me--and please know that I respect your opinion--but I will never be a fan of this movie. Sure, I saw it quite a few times in my day, but the more I realize what it's all made of, the more I resent it. I am sorry, but this is just not a children's movie. It simply isn't. I would regard it as a film for anyone over 10 years old, and that's not the age level that Disney wants for its movies. Again, I respect your opinion if you love the story of Snow White, but I am one of those few who will avoid it at all costs.
B000000W6F|5.0|I love how raw and hard this album is. It's absolutely my favorite album to listen to after a long day fighting the forces of white corporate opression -- and I mean LOUD. If there is an album to crank up your stereo to, this is it. It's not as polished as Siamese Dream, or as mature as Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, but it is undeniably Pumpkin, and has more energy per ounce than any of their albums. Some of the guitar and drum \\"soloettes\\" may make your ears bleed -- in the best possible way. The softer songs still hold some tension and have a tranquil, hypnotizing quality. Lie on the floor and close your eyes while you listen and you will see what I mean. Fnally, I think this album has great staying power; it really holds up well a decade later. This album is overlooked by many Pumpkins fans and it's a shame. If you like Siamese Dream, I don't think you could be unhappy with this CD.
B00004TH83|5.0|So there I was, watching some random VHS recording of some random singer that my sister had recorded off some random PBS program.  Watching is not the right word, as I actually couldn't see anything be moving static on the TV.  But I was eating lunch at the time, so all I really needed was background music.  Oddly enough, this lousy recording had really clear sound, and wow, what sound it was!  This female singer (or singing static, really) could sing in English, Spanish, and French.  And she could REALLY sing!  I was left with the distinct impression that here was someone who was a better and more sincere young singer than current divas like Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston.  It was rather angonizing then, as her name was never mentioned on the program and I couldn't see who she was!  But I did the smart thing - I remembered the title of one of the songs, went to the Internet, and looked up all corresponding artists.  50 of them - ouch.  But I was determined and perservered, and voila - Lara Fabian!  I went through a lot of trouble to find out who she was, and you can bet I'm going to buy her CD!  If you are looking for a new voice in music, try Lara Fabian. You may be as pleasantly surprised as I was!
B000002IWQ|5.0|I have a confession to make: it literally took me years to decide I liked this disc.  I bought it shortly after it was released because I loved &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; and I liked its single, &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot;.  Caveat emptor:  this disc is nothing like RTB musically, and the acoustic ballad &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; is really not representative of anything else on &quot;Counterparts&quot;.  Disappointed, I put it on the shelf and rarely listened to it over the next few years.  But one by one, the songs on it gradually got their hooks into me, and now it is one of my favorite Rush releases.<br />Seen in retrospect, I think this disc represents a turning point for Rush, beginning a musical direction that has continued with &quot;Test for Echo&quot; and &quot;Vapor Trails&quot;.  The music rocks harder, with less reliance on keyboards, and the lyrics are less abstractly intellectual and more personal and emotional.  A lot has already been written about the musical style of this disc, most of which I agree with; I'd like to focus more on the lyrics.<BR>The album title appears to refer to the inevitable duality of human behavior, but the most affecting songs on the disk deal with male-female relationships, a subject not often addressed by Rush's songs.  Most of us spend most of our lives somewhere between the joy and ecstasy of newfound love and the grief and bitterness of love lost, yet not too many pop songwriters spend much time considering this grey area.  Lyricist/drummer Neil Peart attacks this challenge with his usual intensity, with songs about the struggle to resolve the different viewpoints of men and women (&quot;Animate&quot;), the difficulty of keeping passion alive in a long-term relationship (&quot;The Speed of Love&quot;), and the awkwardness of the inevitable &quot;But is this serious?&quot; conversation that every couple has (my favorite song on the disk, the ironic &quot;Cold Fire&quot;).  His words speak with the conviction of someone who's been there and knows what he's talking about, and the infectious melodies and powerful musical arrangements that surround them ensure the messages stay with you.<br />This is rock and roll for grownups, and it's brilliant.  Buy the disc--if you play it and don't care for it, put it away until your fortieth birthday or fifteenth wedding anniversary, and you may find it speaks to you then in a way that you never could have imagined.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|First of all,I'm not one to enjoy pop,but I really like this CD.<BR>   The Nature Boy songs are quite dull compared to the rest of the music.David Bowie has no magic on those songs.<BR>   Lady Marmalade was quite clever.You hear these to-be diva's at they're best.<BR>   Because We Can is very upbeat,almost powerful song.It grabs you in a violent,pulsating way.<BR>   Sparkling Diamonds is a slight disappointment.It combines Diamonds and the Elephant scene.Don't get me wrong.It's a good song.It's Nicole Kidmans best song.<BR>   Rhythm of the night is not pointless.But,it doesn't have the real Moulin Rouge feel that Hindi and Marmalade have.If you disconnect the knowledge from your mind that it's from Moulin,it'll be better.<BR>   Your Song is brilliant.This is Ewan McGregors song.No one could do it better.Elton must be proud.<BR>   Children of the Revolution repeats \\"you can't fool the children of the revolution\\" allot.But,it captures the racy rock feeling that makes Moulin Rouge.<BR>   One Day I'll Fly Away is beautiful and inspirational.It displays Kidmans amazing voice.The Sparkling Diamond of the whole album.<BR>   Diamond Dogs brings the sexy can-can girls into focus.A great song.<BR>   Come What May is a lovely song.Well done.<BR>Complamente De La Butte is french and sensuous.<BR>   Hindi Sad Diamonds is great.A little rock like.<BR>All and all,this is a good CD.I strongly suggest this and the second edition.The second album has,Pitch,The Show Must Go On.Songs that this album didn't include.
B00004R99F|5.0|Wow, this is truly one of my favorite movies and fave Disney fliks ever, i am a disney lover.<br />This is about Goofy's son &quot; Max&quot; who wants to impress his girlfriend &quot; Roxanne&quot; by going to a special concert in Los Angeles played by his favorite sinfger &quot; Powerline&quot; ( who is sort of like a Goofy version of Prince), unknown to Goofy, Goof is actually taking Max on a fishing trip but Max decides to change everything so that he can impress her.<br />A highly entertaining, heartwarming and meaningful animated feature full of laughs, insight gags, good animation, great soundtrack and a important lesson about Fathers and Son.<br />If you're a disney fan, i suggest owning this movie on DVD and you won't be disappointed :)
B000069HKH|5.0|If you're a fan and look back over Springsteen's past decade, you'll see several disappointments: _Lucky Town_ and _Human Touch_ (two albums when one pared-down album combining songs from both would have sufficed); _Tracks_ (which for all of its \\"comprehensiveness\\" didn't include one of the most bootlegged songs in Springsteen's catalogue, \\"The Fever\\"); and _More Tracks_ (which finally gave you the friggin' song, for an extra thirteen or fourteen bucks, AFTER you'd already spent the fifty or so buying the box...). If you were like me, those disappointments probably made you come damned close to saying, \\"enough's enough!\\"<br />Then 9/11 happened, and Bruce was there...with a simple song.<br />And now Bruce is here...with an entire albums of simple songs.<br />Sure: these could be songs specifically about 9/11, but they could also be songs about loss and dealing with it (no contradiction there) in general. Or this album could be a throwback to the lyrical intensity (that often leads to catchy, almost anthem-like hooks) he showed us on _The River_ and _Born in the USA_: there's an incredibly (almost painfully so at times, especially on a songs like \\"Into the Fire\\" or \\"You're Missing\\") personal element to these songs that might lead one to believe Springsteen is trying to work through all our feelings of fear and betrayal and reconciliation (\\"Sometimes the truth just ain't enough in times like this / Let's throw the truth away, we'll find it in this / In your skin upon my skin...\\"), separation and loss (\\"Children are asking if it's alright / Will you be in our arms tonight?\\"), and anger (\\"I want an eye for an eye / I woke up this morning to an empty sky\\") for us and through us here.<br />And then you come across a neato little track like \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" with a classic Springsteen verse, \\"Without you, I'm workin' with the rain fallin' down / I'm half a party in a one dog town,\\" and you'd swear no time has passed, and the world still feels the same as it did whenyou heard \\"Hungry Heart\\" or \\"Out in the Street\\" for the first time. <br />Okay: maybe E Street IS a bit thin in places here, almost an afterthought on some tracks; but that's a danger of trying to expand and grow as an artist. Having said that, though, when you hear Danny Federici's organs on \\"You're Missing\\" (that song's haunting me right now!), or Clarence Clemons' saxophone on \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" or  \\"Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin),\\" it still carries the old E Steet magic. <br />Of course, grammarians are going to have a field day with \\"Further On (Up the Road)\\" because it shoulda been \\"farther.\\" But that's a quibble. <br />This is a fun, and solid, album. And even the title track (which I didn't particularly care for the first time I heard it on the radio) starts to grow on you; there's no denying Springsteen's ability to write \\"catchy\\" tunes that draw you in (and where's the crime in that? it's more a testament to his ability to capture in vivid images the emotions that we're all experiencing).<br />If you're upset about the \\"hype\\" surrounding the album, turn off your television or your radio. This may be the most solid album Springsteen's released since _The River_ (or maybe _Born in the USA_); why not give it a listen? It's sure to at least make you remember where you were the first time you heard those albums.
B000068QY7|2.0|This is definately the worst album by Oasis.  The fact that two of their members have been replaced is painfully obvious.  On this album the band has changed its most basic style so that it sounds like a stranger rather than the friend it has become over the years.  I respect the fact that they are attempting to try new things, however I must draw the line somewhere.  It doesn't feel the same to have people other than Noel writing the songs.  Liam I can handle, but for a replacement to be writing a song seems crazy.  This new style they tried on the new album sounds nothing like Oasis.  On several songs the only thing that sounded like the Oasis was Liam's vocals.  Even that has changed on this album.  Noel takes lead vocals on several of the songs.  I do like Noel's voice, as it is not as hard on the ears as Liam's can sometimes be when he is at his croakiest.  However, it began to feel strange to have Noel as lead singer on so many of the songs.  Overall the cd is ok.  It lacks the spirit of the band.  It also lacks the great sound of albums such as Morning Glory.  There are a few good songs, but overall it is a musical failure.  If you are an Oasis fan you will want to buy it, if only to complete your Oasis collection.  If you are not a huge Oasis fan I would definately not suggest wasting your money on such a travesty.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Although released by the venerable jazz label Blue Note,  Norah Jones is not a jazz singer.  I would catagorize her style as more of an adult contemporary/ballad.  That being said, it is a likable CD.  The mix of songs is a weak point.  Her compositions lack something expecially compared to the classics included on the CD
B000000HZZ|5.0|Its been a long time since the first listen of this classic from the 1980's New Romatic hey day. But New Romantic, it never really was.... if you consider it's longevity.<BR>Over 20 years later, and still it stands the test of time.<BR>Mature crafted pop songs, with well thought out arrangments. It is clear they spent a long time putting together each track, to capture exactley what was best for the song.<BR>The singles \\"Gentlemen Take Polariods\\", and \\"Swing\\" open the album, and the further you dig, the more drawn in you'll become. \\"Burning Bridges\\", and \\"New Career\\" are two milestones tracks which pave the way for the rest of the album.<BR>The rest of the album goes by as smoothly as it began, including the ballad \\"Nightporter\\"........ a small piece of songwriting history.<BR>A bonus on this album is the collaboration with Ryuichi Sakamoto on the closing track, \\"Taking Islands In Africa\\".<br />If your after well written, and thoughtfully put together songs, this is for you.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I &quot;met&quot; Diana Krall on &quot; When I Look in your eyes&quot;... I own now all of her cd's. Her voice is amazingly beautiful and her performance completely captivating. <BR>Almost everybody sang &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; but not in this so sensual way... It will replay in your head over and over again !<BR>&quot;The Look of Love&quot; is &quot;S'Wonderful&quot; : we can all be &quot;Dancing in the dark&quot; and find &quot;Love letters&quot; in the end...
B000002H97|5.0|Let's clear this up first: No it's not their best, Master of puppets gets that title. But This record along with Live sh-t binge and purge mark Metallica's last go-around with greatness. Bob Rock's production is top-notch. Song's like Holier than thou and Nothing else matters sound fresh over a decade later. The sell-out tag shouldn't apply until the follow-up to this album Load, with that Metallica declined into trend inspired Mediocrity.
B00004XOWM|5.0|They beats keep your head banging, the high paced lyrics raise your adreniline and the yelling and aggression makes you want to slam your head through a wall, there isnt anything like it.
0156012197|5.0|This story is a classic.  I cry every time I read it.  It deals with the most mysterious things in life: friendship and death. I personnaly have only read the old, more poetic translation.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD does have less skill in the instrumentals all except DJ Lethal who burns it up at the turntable. Durst still keeps up his high paced agressional lyrics that won't leave youyr head and really does make you want to break something.
B00005R87Q|3.0|Brazen, young cop infiltrates an underground gang to solve daring robberies, falls for gang leaders gal [sister], must eventually choose between new family and career.  Sound familiar?  Yes, so clich&eacute;d that it could be read straight out of Point Break among other things it manages to barely find its own shallow identity.  Despite the obvious parallels, Vin Diesel = Patrick Swayze [now 50, btw, yikes] I found F&amp;F an amusing, speed pumped view.  Of course this film isn't about plot, or character development, everyone is just along to set up the race and robbery scenes.  Played at that level it works well, and gives voice and visions to every fan boy strapping on a coffee can to their exhaust and adding stickers to the windows of their beaters.  I suppose we could fault it for contributing to some abominations seen on the streets lately, but as a simple action flick it's passable now that it's playing free on premium channels.
B00004XONN|5.0|As I read some reviews for Kid A I realize that some people are very stupid. If people say Kid A is no good that only because they dont get it. Kid A is a album in which you can not highlight any one song. That is why there are no singles. It is somthing you have to listen to as a whole. Thom shows us in this album that there are no boundres to music music can be anything thats why he breaks past the rock genre. The album shows alot of Thoms vocal range and the pure talent of the band. The total mesage of the album in at least my mind is very positive. So what I have to say to all the non likers is that if you cant grow with the band listen to pop music!
B00003CXI1|4.0|An 11 year old boy living a banal existence, kept in a cupboard under the stairs by nasty step-caregivers [calling to mind a bit of James and the Giant Peach], learns he is actually the son of accomplished wizards.  Traveling to a mystical academy in a pseudo-parallel universe he meets friends, has adventures, and saves the day [Willy Wonka redux?].  Based on the line of successful books, the movie was a nice albeit condensed introduction to the Potter mythos.  I felt it was lively, with some great performances by seminal figures in British film/stage. Some of the CG effects were a bit unpolished, like the giant troll or the three headed dog, but they were more than made up for in the sprawling set designs and clever scenery.  The hunting around in dank dark attics, or dungeons called to mind the exploring, treasure hunting `Goonies'. Targeted towards the younger set, it still made for a nice viewing.  Wide-screen version, recommended.
6301643410|2.0|If ever a movie personifies the stereotype of the arrogant,self absorbed \\"Ugly American\\" this is it.<br />I frankly could not believe the way that Micheal Douglas carried on in this film yelling, cusing and throwing his weight around. Essentially acting like a loud mouth. Why the Japanese did not cart him back to the US within the first hour was beyond me. They certainly did not have to put up with his tirades and temper tantrums. He just became more obnoxious by the minute.<br />As for the movie itself it was dry and forumulaic with not much suspense beyond the usual violence. I also found it annyoing that with the exception of a few scenes there were no subtitles where the Japanse spoke and I had not a clue what was going on.<br />A very disapointing film.
B00005YUNY|3.0|Once again, the music on this is SUPERB!!!  Jon Anderson, while being quite flaky, still has an awe-inspiring voice.  Chris Squire is back on the game.  Stev Howe's guitar tone was a little on the thin side but his playing is on par to his best.<br />I didn't like the flow of the DVD, though.  The cuts were yo quick and at times sensless.  I mean, during a guitar solo, you'll get a cut to a girl playing timpani or during a \\"rocking\\" passage, you'll get a shot of the guys twirling their franch horns.  Not to mention the constant cutting between the band members.  It makes my stomach a little ill to watch.  I would have loved a wide angle shot of the band with \\"occasional\\" cuts or close-ups to make it more like a concert experience.  <br />And the extra disc was superfluous.  The video was trite and the documentary (which could have been very interesting) was very unsatisfying!<br />So three stars for the excellent music!
B00005UOXN|5.0|I am a huge Billy Idol fan and this is one of his very best colections of songs.   Must have for all of his fans.
B000069CWE|5.0|I love Linkin Park.  They are such awesome musicians, and songwriters.  Reanimation is basically Hybrid Theory, with a twist.  It has all the Hybrid tracks with little recordings of people talking in between, and three tracks not yet on an album.  My December, High Voltage and X-ecutioner Style are remixes of great songs, maybe you haven't heard.  Basically it is an awsome twist on the same old songs you love on Hybrid.  I reccomend it highly!  It is a great mix of Linkin Park and hip hop a little more.  I love it and it will certainly tide you over until the new album is released.  So do yourself a favor and buy reanimation, it is worth it!!
B00005UOXN|5.0|I have recently become a fan of Billy Idol and now must have all of his recordings.   Not all of these songs are huge hits, but it does include about 4 that I really like and play repeatedly.   Very happy with this CD and I always look at Amazon.com offerings before I think of buying anywhere else.
B00006G8LB|5.0|...The special effects are absolutely superb, while sometimes they do over-exaggerate on them, they are nonetheless overwhelming.  I'm a moderate fan of Spider-Man, owning two Playstation games, and soon this video, but if you're a fan of Stan Lee's excellent comic book, web-slinging super hero, you definitely should look into this.  I personally believe that they followed the original story almost 100%, and give an excellent performance.  Other than the somewhat 'over-exaggereated' graphics or special effects, this movie was an extremely cool beginning.
0345413377|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is brilliantly written so that it keeps you reading till the end.  Pullman makes all the parts in this book either scary, romantic, adventurous, sad, or joyful.  People die and there are important battles.  I won't give anything away so you can find out yourself about everything, but there are many differences between this and the first two books.
B000002JAX|5.0|Absolutely loved it. I must have played it 25 times in three weeks. I am wondering where I can find more of her singing. This album was produced in '96; that is six years ago. What has she done since? I thought I was hearing Billie Holliday when I first heard her in someone else's home.
0151003084|5.0|I stumbled across this beautiful little book almost a year ago and I still can't put it down.  Edward Gorey has a brilliantly gothic imagination and his poetry is filled with the bleak and shadowed imagery we all have come to expect.  &quot;The Gashlycrumb Tinies&quot; is an expertly crafted book of the alphabetical deaths of 26 small children.  Each child, as innocent as the next, is knocked off in the most humorous ways.  &quot;O is for Olive run through with an Awl&quot; depicts a young pony-tailed girl throwing a sharpened awl in the air; Olive is one of my personal favourites.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone.  If you enjoy laughing about the darker things in life this book is definitely for you.
0345451325|5.0|The game is 1000% more enjoyable once you've read the book. I played the game and beat it several times before I even knew about the book. When browsing the shelves of GameStop I found The Fall of Reach and had to have it. Even if just for the sake of having it.<br />I got around to reading it a few days after and I couldn't put it down. The writing style was a bit childish compared to what I'm used to, but a great story nonetheless. Nylund's only job was to add flesh and muscle to an already created skeleton (a la bungie).<br />Then, when you go back and play the game, you're going to go &quot;Ohhh... so that's what it meant... I seee....&quot; It's worth the 7 bucks. Buy this book now.

B000063JDE|5.0|In what one could regard now as a precursor to TWIN PEAKS, David Lynch explores his primary fascination, the possibly seedy under-belly that may or may not exist in Middle America. <br />Jeffrey(Kyle Maclachlan) lives in an idealic small town. It's picturesque, everybody knows everybody, and the doors are left unlocked at night. However, evil is lurking. Jeffrey discovers this one day as he walks through a remote field, he finds a human ear. Jeff takes the ear to a local Police Detective, who thanks him and then asks him to stay away from the case. But Jeff, with the Hardy Boy inside getting the better of him, does no such thing, and with the help of the Detective's Daughter(Laura Dern) he decides to investigate. His snooping eventually leads him to a mysterious and seemingly disturbed night club singer, Dorothy(Isabella Rossellini), who Jeffrey is uncontrollably intruiged by and attracted to. In fact, it is only when Jeffrey meets Dorothy's derranged tormentor Frank Booth(Dennis Hopper at his twisted best) that he starts to realize that he just might be in way over his head.<br />Bizarre, captivating, hypnotic, and haunting. You've heard these words describe BLUE VELVET before. But that's because these descriptions are very accurate. This is David Lynch's brilliant painted portrait of what might lie beneath. It's violent, it's comedic at times, it's disturbing at others. It's a film that Lynch fans will love, and that non-Lynch fans will find pointless and boring.<br />But then again, that's true of all of Lynch's work. His films are definately an acquirred taste. Here's the best way to describe it. All the mystery aside, it's about a young man who loses his innocence on his way to adulthood. That's BLUE VELVET in a nutshell. In way it's one of Lynch's most straight forward stories(THE STRAIGHT STORY being an exception).<br />So to all Lynch fans to have yet to see BLUE VELVET for themselves, log off your computers, run to your nearest Blockbuster, check out this masterpiece, and be prepared to pay some major late fees. Because this is one film you will want to experience over and over again.<br />Thanks for reading my review.
B00005U4UV|3.0|If you've read Lovecraft's Re-Animator and are looking for the film to be terrifying like the story, you might be a little let down at first by this movie.  I bought the Millenium Ed DVD  because the video stores in my town didn't carry the movie, popped it in my DVD player late last night hopin for a good scare.  While that didn't happen I still like this movie just because it's so outrageous.  Some of the best parts were West's 'cat dead, details later' line and when Dr. Hill's bloody mess of a head gets thrown clear out of the operating room, splatters against the wall, and that security guard is just like 'what the __!'  I haven't looked at the second disk yet so I can't say anything about it, but as far as the movie goes it's great for what it is, but reconsider renting it if you're looking for a 'real' horror show.  This is more a comedy/gross out movie.
B00005U18E|5.0|This is the most perfect, flawless movie ever made!  Everything about it is perfect -- the casting, the timing, the flow, the friends, the feelings, the family, the parties, the directing, the facial expressions, the music, the humor, the dialogue -- just EVERYTHING!!!!  I am in love with the \\"English\\" language now and am contemplating a move across the pond.  The first time I rented BJD, I had to watch it six more times because I couldn't believe how perfect it was!  I don't think you could ever top its magnificence and I believe it has been overlooked by all the other awards that it did not receive.  I highly recommend that everyone watch it.  Kudos to all involved in its making!
B000046PVN|5.0|This CD contains the authentic movie soundtrack - and then some. From the tense opening through the triumphant theme song, to Krypton, baby Kal-El's flight to Earth, his awakening in Kansas and to his magnificent first appearance - one of moviedom's classic scenes - the rescue of Lois Lane while catching a doomed helicopter - this CD conveys every sense of the movie.<br />Inspirational, to say the least. Then again, what else would you expect from John Williams...
6304078102|5.0|Mr. Holland is an average person with average talent for composing, in summary a simple guy with highs and lows in life.  His best opus however is that because of his passion for music, touches and improves the lives of everyone in that high school.  I think that there are many positive messages around this film that make it an extraordinary one.  Mr. Hollands improvement and maturation as an individual is very positive, no matter if there are stereotypes or whatever.  I was deeply moved when i saw it for the first time and everytime i can have the oportunity to see it again. Its very good to have it and review to appreciate those hidden details that are discovered only by repeating the experience of seeing a film.

In &quot;First Contact&quot;, the NG crew gets to shine on their own, and do they.<br />The plot, action and characterizations are all first-rate. Combining the NG crew's arch-enemy, the Borg, plus mankind's first warp drive space venture, as well as time travel, makes for a solid adventure.<br />Picard, Worf and Data, perhaps the NG crew's most interesting members, are given ample time to shine in this movie. Guest stars James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard provide top-notch Earth-bound support.<br />A MUST for all Trek fans!
B00004XONN|3.0|For a 'rock' band to change over time and release an album like this is truly amazing. Radiohead have definitely re-written expectations for themselves and many other bands of their like. After the sucess of OK Computer, Kid A seems like a logical extention. First, it was easy to hear the band moving in this direction as far back as the mid-90's. Second, this disc relieved them-to some extent-of the pressure of making a OK Computer part two, by destroying the nice little alternative, 4/4 time signiture, guitar-driven box into which they had been placed by fans and the media. After Kid A was released it became clear that, with Radiohead, all bets are off. One never knows what they will do next.<br />This disc, more than any other perhaps, reveals the deep interest the band has in the ambient and electronic soundscapes of Brian Eno, Bjork, and numerous DJ artists. The keyboard is the predominate force on this disc. Only on rare occasions do we get anything sounding like Radiohead of old (\\"The National Anthem & \\"Morning Bell\\") For all its' strangeness, this album works, though the listener may feel somewhat unsatisfied as it comes to a close. It is melancholy for sure, and one is never quite sure what Yorke is singing about, but it all seems to flow nicely from the OK Computer sound, attitude, and outlook. The first track is a beauty as is \\"Morning Bell\\". Some of the tracks in the middle are less distinctive-even forgetful, but the overall effect is powerful.<br />Recommended.
B00005JKEC|4.0|Training Day is a movie that makes you think about the life of an under cover Narc.  There seems to be such a fine line between the criminal and the police officer here and this is shown very well in the movie.  As usual Denzel Washington gives a magnificent performance as one who plays by his own set of rules.  Ethan Hawke is fine in a supporting role as well.<br />The twists and turns in the story keep you pretty much hooked as the end result is a bit surprising.  The violence is a little much in spots and there are a few moments when realistically the story goes astray.  Nonetheless, this is very good movie for those fans of action movies and Denzel Washington.
B000069HKH|3.0|Big choruses, walls of guitars, a stylistic history lesson in rock'n'roll -- all the tried-and-true Boss ingredients are here.  Only this time, once you strip away the topicality, the end result doesn't add up to the avalanche of pop smarts and rock heart that characterized Springsteen's best earlier work.  Nonetheless, the critics are going berserk with praise.  Fair warning: they're wrong.<br />Now a question -- how is it that Bruce left the name of the E Street Band off the album cover?  Certainly he's played the reunion card hard for publicity reasons.  He knows that's what has jazzed the public.  Yet the band doesn't warrant a cover mention?  Why is it that when Diana Ross or Barbra Streisand pull a seemingly ego-inflated stunt like that, they get demolished, but Bruce doesn't even have to field the question?
B000062Y98|1.0|Firstly, it must be said that Blind Guardian's last album, \\"Nightfall on Middle Earth,\\" was one of the best I have ever heard. It saw them rise above the crowd of mediocre European bands with such quality of production, and interesting, memorable song-writing.  That album was a 4 or maybe 5 star album, but their latest effort \\"Night at the Opera\\" is anything but that.<br />Blind Guardian are not Stratovarius, Nightwish, or Iron Maiden.  Each one of those bands is so completely different that they can't be compared.  There are two main problems with Blind Guardian on this album: the first is the vocals, and secondly the song-writing.<br />What first strikes you is the sheer number of the backing vocal layers - far too many and overpowering - which is not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but one of the main problems with this album is Hansi Kurch's extremely bad singing.  He has only 2 modes on this CD - shouting and talking - he doesn't actually SING.  Well, he does sing on the \\"bonus track\\" which somehow comes as a relief after the heavy vocal pounding you have to endure beforehand.  But because of the lack of melodic singing, the layered vocal choruses throughout the CD sound more like a drunken, disordered, rowdy crowd (like that on the cover), rather than anything resembling ideal \\"Queen-like\\" layered vocals.  All you get to hear is shouting vocals, vocals, and more vocals, and the entire album seems to have been an exercise in studio production for Hansi to cram as many vocal layers as he can into every sentence.<br />The vocals, in general, drown out the music - sometimes it's like a wall of sound, with the guitars and everything merging together and no distinction between instruments.  The guitar work, it must be said, is extremely disappointing after the \\"Nightfall...\\" CD - there is no creativity or melody, and a tedious, annoying over-reliance on repetitive note-playing to back (or fight with) the vocalist.<br />The next major problem, and this is the mostimportant, is the song-writing - there isn't a single well-written song on this CD, not a single song that is appealing enough to make you want to listen to it again.  There's such a massive lack of melody on this CD that you wonder what the band was thinking when they wrote this stuff, with Biblical references dotted about here and there, and it's so incredible that this can happen after \\"Nightfall...\\" which was full of great melodies.  Where has your melody gone, Blind Guardian?  Most of the songs don't have a defining feature about them to distinguish them from the others, they are just not MEMORABLE.<br />The cover artwork and inside pages sum up this CD, it's a joke.  <br />It's messy and boring, with no distinction between songs, badly written, poorly performed, and thoroughly deserving of a one-star rating (if not less).  \\"Nightfall on Middle Earth\\" must have been, as some may have suspected, a one-off, as Blind Guardian seem to have lost the plot and abandoned their one-time winning formula.
B004ZN9YNC|3.0|In the world of rock, anti-war is always \\"in.\\" Unfortunately, there have been few pieces of work in the past few decades that have provided anything new to the anti-war sentiment, most of them repeating the basic thought that \\"war is bad.\\" Culture Club's 'The War Song' is about as bad as Green Day's cliched '21 Guns,' with even intricate efforts like Bob Dylan's 'Masters of War' echoing the same complaint.<br />Pink Floyd's 1983 release \\"The Final Cut\\" is a notable exception. Bassist Roger Waters was ruling the band with an iron fist by now, even having edged out founding keyboardist Rick Wright during the sessions for \\"The Wall.\\" Wright's departure was only one of the detrimental changes affecting \\"The Final Cut,\\" as the album was barely musical except in a few places, with Waters' teary vocals providing the forefront to scantly, weakly arranged musical textures. But what the album lacked in the classic Pink Floyd sound, and in musical quality in general, \\"The Final Cut\\" more than made up for by containing some of Waters' most effective lyrics, addressing war and inhumanity with a poetic brilliance since - or before - unmatched in rock n' roll.<br />The personal status of Pink Floyd was in shambles, and almost non-existent. Master guitarist David Gilmour lent his ferocious vocals to only one track, 'Not Now John,' and disagreed so fervently with the musical direction of the album, or lack thereof, he asked that his production credit be removed. Aside from the aforementioned song and the title track, founding drummer Nick Mason appears in mere cameos, adding a few sudden drum parts here and there, and in some cases not at all; his role in the band had been so squashed by Roger Waters that, despite his work on sound effects for the album - even recording many of them in person - whatever he contributed would be listed as \\"just drumming,\\" and consequently paid for only such work (according to Mason's autobiography \\"Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd\\").<br />So with Waters firmly in control of his solo album, released under the pseudonym Pink Floyd, and aided musically by Michael Kamen, \\"The Final Cut\\" progressed from a collection of outtakes from their previous album, the blockbuster \\"The Wall,\\" and became Waters' personal document to express his anguish at the death of his father at the Battle of Anzio, and his disdain for the loss of human life in conflict, sparked by then-recent military action in the Falklands.<br />Waters expanded the scheme to include terrorism (touching on the acts of the IRA in Ireland in 'The Gunner's Dream'), exploitation in film (the stunningly raucous - for Pink Floyd anyway - 'Not Now John,' the album's only UK Top 30 entry), and general disillusionment with post-World War II Britain ('The Post War Dream'). And of course, the typical '80s nuclear war fears are addressed in the album's closer 'Two Suns in the Sunset,' on which Nick Mason was replaced altogether. The theme of the human cost of war is strayed from in the personal reflection 'Paranoid Eyes' and the emotional title track, though in shorter songs 'Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert' and 'Southampton Dock,' Waters' distinctly British wit and weariness are starkly evident and address the anti-war theme with poignancy and succinctness, as does nearly the whole of the album, something absent from most other \\"war-is-bad\\" efforts from major musicians.<br />One of Pink Floyd's most identifiable attributes had always been their \\"facelessness,\\" the ability of the band members to remain obscured by the music, which to the record-buying public was somehow greater than those making it. With \\"The Final Cut\\" however, a bit of the anonymity was lost; though the record sleeve contained no photographs of the remaining three Floyds, Roger Waters' deeply personal expressions seemed to present the bassist as a tortured artist, almost resembling the character \\"Pink\\" from \\"The Wall.\\" Fortunately, Pink Floyd would go on a four-year hiatus, presumed to have no longer been a working entity at least in Waters' eyes, and return with Rick Wright on board, slowly re-establishing the classic Floyd sound in the late 80s into the mid 90s.<br />Unfortunately, for Waters, he would continue to relentlessly express his anti-war views in his solo work, alienating many fans who flocked back to Floyd when his former bandmates reunited. His work has since become dated and out of touch, with today's younger fans unable to identify with his frustration with the policies of Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, or with Cold War bitterness, or indeed unable to tell anyone who Margaret Thatcher is without Wikipedia assistance. Not withstanding, \\"The Final Cut\\" is actually a strong statement, stark and bold, and quite a candidate for one of rock's greatest anti-war pieces.o have no longer been a working entity at least in Waters' eyes, and return with Rick Wright on board, slowly re-establishing the classic Floyd sound in the late 80s into the mid 90s.<br />Unfortunately, for Waters, he would continue to relentlessly express his anti-war views in his solo work, alienating many fans who flocked back to Floyd when his former bandmates reunited.

6304712936|1.0|When I bought this DVD I thought I was buying the whole movie of Amadeus as I remember it from 1984. Instead the original movie was cut drastically, and many scenes I remember, including sample scenes from Mozart's operas, especially Don Giovanni, were missing, and only the bare bones of Salieri's &quot;plot&quot; was depicted.<br />Please tell me, what happened to the rest of the movie?<br />Or did I miss something? <br />I tried the various options on the opening menu and could find no evidence that any more footage from the original, other than what I saw, was on the DVD. If I am wrong I would gladly keep the DVD.
B000002JNN|5.0|Prior to \\"The Razor's Edge,\\" AC/DC's first album of the 1990's, and throughout a good deal of the 80's, the band had found itself being gradually overshadowed by a musical world of glam-pop and synthesizers, of hairspray and power ballads, but amazingly they never once negotiated their rock-n-roll prowess. And now the near-twenty year veterans of rock were entering the early '90's--the days of Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, and a movement of wannabe punk bands from Seattle angry at nothing. If AC/DC's first offering of this decade failed to hit the Top Twenty, it certainly wouldn't be a surprise to many--however, with the accomplished \\"The Razor's Edge\\" AC/DC found themselves in the Billboard Top Ten (this set hit #2) for the first time in nearly seven years.<br />\\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a marvelous set of twelve finely crafted songs, all of them holding a delightful sneer, notably the classic opener 'Thunderstruck,' 'Are You Ready,' and the title track (which could be one of AC/DC's most adept songs ever). 'Moneytalks' shows Brian Johnson's vocal ability going beyond its former limits (though the album's absence of his lyrics is puzzling) while the blue collar salute 'Goodbye and Good Riddance to Bad Luck' goes great with the rest of the album's songs.<br />Yielding a superior recording quality and fine arrangements and productions, \\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a fundamental element in the lexicon of a band who refused to compromise their traditional yet unique brand of hard rock.
B000002JSP|5.0|While I understand -and largely agree with - many people in here who believe the Led Zeppelin's ASCENDING peak stopped at 1975's 'Physical Graffiti',to disregard and dub 'In Through The Out Door' as they're \\"worst\\" album is...<br />1.)Not exactly true (that \\"honor\\" goes to '76's 'Presence' album. Fine recording,backs-against-the-wall-and-kicking-their-ways-back-out again performances.. Just lacking -compared to every other Zep album (save for 1982's posthumous 'Coda' odds and sods collection/album...)- ...'Presence' lacked solid,great songs; track to track. Hey; all's forgiven. Let's how any of us would do if your singer (Robert Plant) was in a wheelchair singing his parts and you're all collectively apprehensive -and naturally so- about your singer healing up and being ok again..<br />and:<br />2.)Very cruel. Some people don't want to see people grow musically and go different places and extend the palette,as it were. Robert Plant: I'll tip my hat to that man any day for Not Only carrying on after weathering an insurmountable blow by losing a young child suddenly (his five-year-old son to a sudden viral infection),but by ALSO gaining layers of vocal subtlety and range emotion-wise. Pretty impressive stuff considering how great a singer he's been throughout Led Zeppelin's tenure. <br />    Anyone who's familiar-enough with Led Zeppelin knows it's The Variety that keeps Led Zeppelin alive. 'In Through The Out Door' ,unfortunately,wound up being Led Zeppelin's final salvo due to (drummer) John Bonham's accidental alcohol overdose in Sept. 1980.. But,it remains a strong,graceful,fascinating and SOLID collection of songs,performances and production. They Grew! Everyone wants Pagey to be heavy,don't they? And Robert Plant to be singing (faking it,as he would've been here...) as if he's squeezing lemons again. Well,life is as life does: and Led Zeppelin rolled with the punches and whipped up this beautiful record,'ITTOD'. There's things on this record that Zep never touched upon before on any of their previous seven studio records,and That Alone is worth the price of admission:<br />\\"In The Evening\\" (as eerie,surreal and atmospheric as anything they ever conjured up.); the healing/rollicking funtime of \\"South Bound Saurez\\" and the vidibly-in-joke song \\"Hot Dog\\".. The band work-out of \\"Fool In The Rain\\"... As well as what may very well be Robert Plant's Best Non-Twenty-Octave Vocal Performance in Led Zeppelin: the amazing \\"All My Love\\"(which was inspired by Robert losing his son). One of the most genuinely sadly-beautiful,touching and graceful songs ever in the Zep canon. Curiously,written by only Robert and John Paul Jones,who was the glue during this Zep studio period. It's nice to see someone else shape the picture for a change rather than it being Jimmy Page. It's a testament to Jimmy's humility as a mate/musician that he just went with it and played for the songs and kept the overall vision at the time in mind. <br />Led Zeppelin -by default- wound down one amazing active career by bowing out with dignity and graces intact. 'In Through The Out Door' also happened to spark a Zep-related resurgence at the time of it's 1979 release. All eight Zep studio albums back in the charts. The synthesizer usage by John Paul Jones underlines the heartbreak and chill encountered by the band after a series of life-related setbacks from 1975-1978.. Oh yeah; 'In Through The Out Door' also SOLD A TON OF COPIES! More so than 'Presence' and this album possesses melodies and grace that's rather unlike the previous Zep albums. 'In Through The Out Door' is a record made by guys who still had 'It' while going into it,but also tempered 'That' by Being Real and infusing the record overall with that in mind: they kept stretching,and as a swan song to a fine career,it's a beaut. A fine epitaph as well as a springboard to other periods of Zeppelin as,again as I've said,it's The VARIETY that keeps Led Zeppelin alive. Zeppelin had more to do and say,but that was squelched by Bonzo dying as he did (R.I.P. forever John) . Mystique,wonderful songs and more presence throughout that the actual 'Presence' album,which is intense by anyone else's standards,but \\"average\\" by Zeppelin's. And that's saying something,isn't it?<br />Besides,there's a reason why \\"All My Love\\",\\"Fool In The Rain\\" and \\"In The Evening\\" remain FM radio staples. It's a bit too fa5r in the game to play the band out of sypmathy. Think about it. 'In Through The Out Door' is a fine,fine album. Make up your own mind and enjoy all of Led Zeppelin open-mindedly,as you will. Led Zeppelin is a 'whole deal' endeavor. And 'In Through The Out Door' is one apt,beautiful document of - somewhat presciently- anticipating the end and going out with style. End as a beginning: the great songs will keep people drawn into 'ITTOD'. If people want Zep doing the heavier stuff,then play the old albums. If you want to continue on album to album and see how the journey progressed,than check this record out. It stands on it's own merits any band would give their family jewels to have the gems that make up this album collectively and individually. Thank you.<br />Have a good day.
B000068FXX|5.0|Recorded in the thin-air mountains of Colorado (the band had to keep oxygen bottles with them), \\"Even in the Quietest Moments\\" is the album that best demonstrates the ties that bind Supertramp's elegant prog-rock/classical music influences and FM radio pop intentions. This is the second of two albumss (the other being \\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\") the English quintet recorded between their breakthrough \\"Crime of the Century\\" and their smash mega-hit \\"Breakfast in America.\\" The two lost classics are often looked upon as being \\"lesser\\" works due to being unpredictable in content, but each has an important role in Supertramp's musical tapestry.<br />The first song, the radio hit 'Give A Little Bit' preludes the textbook-perfect pop that the band would soon be identified with, featuring some of the glossiest acoustic guitar ever recorded, but it's the more progressive rock-flavored songs that define the album. The gorgeous title track embodies Roger Hodgson's delicate vocals, which take on an idea of youthful unrest and wandering, its interesting arrangement always building up to something clamactic, but never does. Even the simple FM radio subject matter of 'Lover Boy' is placed into an extravagant arrangement as Rick Davies sings his heart out, warning girls about a prototypical Supertramp character, while the struggling musician's anthem 'From Now On' is just as grandiose. The vocalist does well in more subdued places as well; 'Downstream' consists only of Davies' wonderfully odd voice and a piano (and maybe an overdubbed second piano here and there). 'Babaji' is another forefront to \\"Breakfast In America,\\" but with a twist; while the song is so infectious it could make you dance, it's a complicated form of spiritual faith that Supertramp is expressing, not some teenage love. The album's closing ten-minute epic 'Fool's Overture' is the definitive song, a social statement featuring classic prog-rock elements like sound effects (a recording of a speech by Winston Churchill), and a dramatic, winding classical movement that goes from frenetic synthesizer hooks to simple, pleading piano-and-vocals by Hodgson. Supertramp would later use this blueprint for later epics like 'Brother Where You Bound?' in 1985 (with Ronald Reagan and other 80s Cold War figures replacing Churchill).<br />Aside from being an intriguing, often exciting, look at the connections between prog, classical, and pop tastes, \\"Even in the Quietest Moments\\" also set an ethic that Supertramp would always follow; despite the ultra-sleek, ultra-polished production, the emotive side still glimmers like the Colorado snow in the sun.nd a dramatic, winding classical movement that goes from frenetic synthesizer hooks to simple, pleading piano-and-vocals by Hodgson.

B000002GB2|5.0|Styx's first album with A&amp;M, 1975's &quot;Equinox&quot; marked the beginning of the band's musical progression (not to say that their previous combination of classical movements and mystic rock and roll had lost its flame).<br />&quot;Equinox&quot; shows the first major departure from their trademark mixture of classical arrangements and hard rock, but still represented here with the enigmatic 'Prelude 12' but most notably, the magnificent epic 'Suite Madame Blue,' boasting John Curulewski's blistering yet graceful guitar work and Dennis DeYoung's lyrics blending poetry with politics (just in time for America's upcoming bicentennial the following year). 'Midnight Ride' is a dazzling arrangement, full of Styx's musical imagination, while 'Lorelei' introduced Styx fans to their unique brand of artistic pomp tunes, with a pop-like melody, combining folk legends and romance.<br />&quot;Equinox&quot; proved Styx's progression and musical horizons, revealing their synthesized world of guitars, keyboards, and pure arena-style magic.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|While lonely widow Burstyn goes on a downward spiral to hell after becoming addicted to television and diet pills, her son, along with his friend and girlfriend suffer the same treatment through their addictions to heroine. Starts off with the flimsy hollowness of a sophisticated soap opera, then becomes nothing more than one long, heavy-handed, unwatchable drug trip, focusing more on creating heinously grotesque visuals rather than actually adding any new insight to the topic except \\"drugs ruin your life\\". Although this was celebrated by many, some may strike this as being Aronofsky's unforgivable excuse for making a purely ugly, shock-fest. Drug addiction depicted as bombastic and visualistic without creating any sense of true realism. Watch at own risk.
B000068FWC|5.0|Throughout the '70's, it was inevitable that Supertramp would gradually get more and more popular until they were fully embraced by the mainstream. And now it was 1979, an era of disco and burgeoning punk. But leave it to Supertramp, one of the most innovative pop bands of all time, to close the '70's by bursting into the mainstream with \\"Breakfast in America,\\" their best selling album to date, yielding four hit singles and going platinum.<br />The record contains all of Supertramp's trademark musical features--studio-perfected rock, rhythm and blues grace, symphonic stylings, and a faceless magic all their own. However, \\"Breakfast in America\\" is also touched up with a surprisingly high quality of mock-pop, taking a hint of disco (in the keyboard tune of the catchy high schooler's ballad 'The Logical Song'), funky tunes ('Take the Long Way Home'), inspired creoles ('Lord is it Mine') and playful yet serious songs like 'Gone Hollywood,' while the title track is naively poignant song.<br />\\"Breakfast in America\\" is a classy and flawless album that confirmed Supertramp's popularity was based not only on word of mouth, but also by musical merit. By avoiding gimmicks, self-indulgence, and arrogance of their critical acclaim, Supertramp remains one of the most uncompromising bands of the era, and if you doubt this, just listen to one of their many masterpieces, \\"Breakfast in America.\\"
B000069HKH|4.0|If one does not view Springsteen's &quot;The Rising&quot; as music's 9/11 inspirational/mournful catharsis, one could enjoy and appreciate the superb craftmanship of Springsteen's work here and realize that it is a great pop record. Assigning this CD to the 9/11 pidgeonhole only leads to the inevitable letdown- nothing can express the pain and tragedy of that day in a way that would completely satisfy, avenge, and release the enormity of the heartbreak and of the pent up emotion. <br />I truly feel that any 9/11 music would be an anti-climax at this point in time. Had this CD been released a month or two after the tragedy, I might view this record in a different light. But, almost a year later, after the country and the world are well along in the healing process, the songs cannot possibly have the same impact they once might have had. <br />I choose not to view this fine album through the tunnel vision of 9/11. Since these songs have universal themes of loss, loneliness and hope, I can admire the infectious melodies of &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, &quot;Waitin On a Sunny Day&quot; and Empty Sky&quot;. I can get lost in the folkish &quot;Paradise&quot; and get caught up in the energy of &quot;Let's Be Friends&quot; and &quot;Mary Place&quot;. Undoubtedly, in the back of my mind I will think of 9/11 when I hear songs like &quot;City of Ruins&quot; or &quot;You're Missing&quot;, but mostly, I will hum the melodies and admire a well produced, well crafted pop record.

B00000J7J4|5.0|Santana's spirituality comes through on this album in the form of great rhythms, lyrics, and an over-arching musicality made possible by a host of contributing artists.  His best ever.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I have come to expect a lot from The Flaming Lips.  &quot;Yoshimi&quot;'s predecessor, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; is nothing short of one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Needless to say I listened to &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots&quot; with high expectations and cannot be more pleased.  While different from &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; and a world away from their early albums, The Lips are one of a handful of bands (include Radiohead, Spiritualized)that continue to evolve and constantly try new things. The album opens with the amazing &quot;Flight test&quot; and never lets up from there.  It is a pleasure to see commercial aspirations take a back seat to the sheer love of making great music. <br />Also worth checking out - Polyphonic Spree's debut album &quot;The Beginning Stages of...&quot;.
B000066NW0|3.0|I bought this CD on the strength of &quot;Complicated&quot; which is one of those perfect pop summer songs.  I must admit that the song is already starting to wear on me a bit.  So I was quite surprised to find out that the rest of the CD is really good.  Is this a 'punk' CD?  Relative to Britney/Pink/Boy Bands and almost everything TRL-related this has a uniqueness and certain independent charm that is in a way 'punk'.  Sad to say but that is about as punk as things get these days in pop music.  Overall:  Very catchy tunes but short shelf-life as the songs are pretty straightforward arrangements.
B00001NFCY|5.0|\\"My Own Prison\\" was very good, but this builds on it to give Creed a more distinctive and clearer sound.  Mark Tremonti came out wih all guns blazing to craft a hard-edged, yet melodic sound with his guitar that is the focal point of the album.  For some of the songs, Tremonti compiles intricate songwriting, much like Alex Liefson does for Rush.  As for Creed's rythym section, they are in fine form with bassist Brian Marshall banging the 4-string well and drummer Scott Phillips creates more of his own style from his influences of Living Colour and Led Zepplin.  And lyrically, Scott Stapp pens some outsanding words and sings them with equivelent furvor.<br />   Stand outs on this 11-song outing would have to be the the rock hard \\"What If,\\" the wonderful tracks \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Say I,\\" and espiescially the soul-stirring \\"Higher,\\" even if it is over-played.  Other excellent tracks are the beautiful \\"With Arms Wide Open,\\" the haunting \\"Wash Away Those Years,\\" and the middle-eastern tinged \\"Faceless Man.\\"  Though every song is very good and I enjoy them all, those are the best and they make this album more than worth while.  If you like your rock hard with lush overtones and melodism, this is the record for you.  And even if you are just curious, I highly recommend this album.
B000005IRG|5.0|Now I'll admit, when I first heard Television, I was not all that impressed.  Like some others who posted reviews on here, I said to myself, &quot;This guy can't sing at all!  This is so irritating!&quot;  At this point in my life, I can't imagine how I ever felt that way.  Maybe the singing grew on me, or maybe my mind has opened a lot since my younger days.  Either way, I absolutely love every bit of this album.  It contains some of the most well-crafted songs I've ever heard in my life, with some amazingly creative guitar work.  <BR>In my opinion, this is by far the best debut from all the mid-70's NYC bands.  Every song on this album is strong, which can't be said for the debuts of the Ramones, Talking Heads, Blondie, Richard Hell, or any of the others.  <BR>Certainly not for everyone, but for those who appreciate great, interesting guitar work, and just all around good, artistic music, this is recommended.  Move forward with an open-mind--the rewards are well worth the effort it takes to break into this.
0195145925|1.0|I read a variety of books on Physics, Astronomy and other topics. This book is rambling, and poorly written. There should be something a reader can take away from a book but this book has little real content.  I hung on to the end to find out what the bottom line would yield. It wasn't worth it. I tossed it in the trash as soon as I finished.
1577311523|5.0|...<br />The book seems to be a way of avoiding mental illness in that it gives people methods in which to view their own state of mind.  If you know what state your mind is in, you are not identified with it, you can help it, or you can just let it be as it is.  I can't think of anything better for someone with an illness. <br />...<br />Personally, I have found this book to be very understandable, but of course there are some things that I don't really get.  It can sometimes get tiring continually watching oneself, but I think I have become a lot more truthful with myself and others, and I have a greatly improved knowledge of what is going on in my self...
0441003257|3.0|\\"Good Omens\\", which occurs mainly in the UK, follows a dozen or so eccentric characters as they all prepare for Armageddon. The book starts on a Wednesday and edges slowly toward Saturday, the day in which the world will end. It's up to two angels--well, one angel (Aziraphale, who is also a part-time book dealer) and one demon (Crowley, \\"who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards\\")--to try and sway the 11-year-old Antichrist (Adam Young) to one respective side--either Heaven's or Hell's.<br />There are so many characters and mini plots in this book, it's hard to get attached to just one, but my favorite would have to be Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell. He was an absolute kook and, at times, very funny. The rest of the book is amusing and entertaining at parts, but it wasn't as funny as I had expected. Probably the two humorous bits that do come to mind are the author biographies and the caveat on one of the first few pages: \\"Kids! Bringing about Armageddon can be dangerous. Do not attempt it in your own home.\\"<br />\\"Good Omens\\" was also, in my opinion, too long and verbose and could have had 100 pages or so removed and still have served its purpose. This isn't a book I'd necessarily recommend, but if you're an avid fan of one or both of the writers, then you might like this sci fi spoof on the Apocalypse. And for those who did enjoy the book, you'll be happy to know \\"Good Omens\\" is being made into a movie sometime next year.
B00006690G|5.0|I am a huge eminem fan.  I love this album.  I love his past albums as well.  This guy tells it like it is;  the hard facts of his life and the impact it's made with exceptional lyrics and beats.  I've memorized a lot of his songs from the previous CDs, and these new tracks are more exciting.  In my opinion the best are: 3.Business, 4. Cleaning out my closet, 10. Without me, 14. Hailie's song, 17. Til I collapse.  Although \\"Without Me\\" sounds surprisingly similar to \\"Real Slim Shady\\", buy this album to listen to his new stuff... these tracks reveal more about Marshall and his love for Hailie.
B000069CWE|1.0|Linkin Park had the perfect combonation of rock and rap, this album is entirely rap.  I like the first couple songs on the CD, but I sure hope their next album will have the balance that made them so successfull to begin with.

B000065V1V|4.0|Believe me - I tried to resist.  Yet after many spins against varying backdrops (work, driving, gym, lazing), David Bowie's Heathen revealed itself as a remarkable return to form.  Correction.  It's a return to many forms.  Heathen is the portable Bowie.  With one eye still on the future, he looks back long enough to crib from his various personas:  the Diamond Dog (\\"Sunday\\"), Ziggy Stardust (\\"Cactus\\"), the Hunky Dory singer-songwriter (\\"Slip Away\\"), the Berlin provocateur (\\"Slow Burn\\"), Major Tom (\\"I Took a Trip On a Gemini Spaceship\\"), the latter day electronic-ist (\\"I Would Be Your Slave\\").  In seeking out past triumphs, he refreshes himself yet again, without a moment to spare.  It's been 22 years since his last good album (Scary Monsters) and don't think the man doesn't know it.  Though he makes it seem effortless on Heathen, you can practically hear him breathing a sigh of relief.
B000069HKH|5.0|Having been a fan since Wild and Innocent... I honestly expected to be disappointed.  I have been waiting for a replacement for Darkness on the Edge of Town in my favorite stack for a long time.  The first listen or two, I found myself jumping around looking for the old E Street sound.  By the fourth listen, I was sold.  This CD has something for all, from the darkest acoustic ala Nebraska to the Arena rocking sound of Lonesome Day.  I laughed when I first listened to Mary's Place, it sounded Like a sit-com theme song.  But I Like it.  It is as another review mentioned, as fun as Rosalita.  Bottom line...If you like any of the Boss's music, buy this.  It will grow on you fast.
B00000I8UD|5.0|I have been a Sylvian fan since forever, but he has exceeded even my very high expectations with this offering. I am only reviewing this now, after I've given it more than a year of listening. It takes time to age on you. I guess not everybody will like this, but if they all would, that would be strange indeed. &quot;Dead Bees on a Cake&quot; has become one of my all-time favourites, alongside Brian Eno's &quot;Ambient 4&quot; and &quot;Apollo Atmospheres Soundtrack&quot;, Joy Division's &quot;Closer&quot;, and just a couple of others. Definitely something to bring along to a desert island, or to listen to on a deathbed. Strong words indeed, but that's what it does to me.
B000002AEN|5.0|Something I like to do when checking the reviews here is to get a standard--see if these folks like the same things I do. Well...there are several astute evaluators here. So I bought it.<br />And was thrilled. These songs are played with an immediacy and verve that is delightful. Those of us who know John only from those late Newport recordings will be exhilarated to hear that same guitar and same voice, only 35 years younger.<br />The man could play. And the recordings are exquisite--clear and clean with only a slight hiss. A winner.....and a bargain too.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I have to admit, I thought going in that it was going to be like X-Men and they were going to change everything. I felt like beating myself up afterwards. That is the best superhero movie of all time!!  <BR>Before I thought Tobey Maguire was going to be the worst Peter Parker ever, but if it wasn't him then it would have been a lot worse. I think that another reason it was so good was that Stan Lee helped make it. I can't wait to get the DVD!!!
B000066F6H|3.0|There hasn't been so much hard sell in the press since the coming of Nirvana.  With the advent of The Strokes, The White Stripes, etc., the music machine is in hyperdrive with hyperbole.  Perhaps the most written about of them all, The Hives come from Sweden to these shores with the odds stacked against them.  They're revered in Europe.  They write short, punky tunes that have never really been in (or out) of favor.  (Green Day and Blink 182 do not make a movement.)  They've got a wildman lead singer, Howlin' Pelle Almqvist, who's a passionate screamer on record and a deadpan joker in the press.  And on Veni Vidi Vicious, they've got 's of a great release.  Lucky for them, they've also got the single and video of the summer in \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\".  Above all, they've got passion, which counts for everything in three-chord raves of such directness and simplicity.  Let's see if they have longevity.  With hype this deafening, it's hard to hear.
0316666343|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I read it in one day.  Could not put it down.  I highly recommend it.
6305169187|2.0|Movies are a chance to lose yourself and escape reality for a while, so I'm usually willing to let a few implausible ideas slip by.  But in Armageddon, there are so many major flaws that it becomes unforgivable.  The premise of the movie involves a huge asteriod--the size of Texas, implying a few hundred miles in diameter--which is heading towards earth.  To stop it, NASA has decided to detonate a nuclear weapon after landing on it and drilling down to...800 feet? Futhermore, this powerful blast is going to blow the asteroid into exactly two pieces, both of which will just miss earth provided the weapon is detonated In Time.<br />Since a highly trained team of astronauts apparently can't learn to drill a hole, NASA instead is convinced to let a drilling crew learn a crash course in being astronauts.  Bruce Willis leads the crew, challenged for authority constantly by Ben Affleck, who is dating Bruce's daughter played by Liv Tyler.  The crew land on the astronaut, where they encounter hazards galore.  Here is where the reality suspension really occurs.  After an explosion, one astronaut is sent spaceward by the lack of gravity; yet, another astronaut is able to grab them and pull them back to the surface.  The asteroid's surface is \\"iron ferrite\\", which if it existed would be a compound between iron and...iron.  Things continue at this pace for the duration of the movie, leaving me wondering if Jerry Bruckheimer was absent the day they taught science in science class.  This movie was featured on the web site, \\"Insultingly Stupid Movie Physics\\", if that gives you an idea of the degree of bloopers.<br />The movie is of course full of edge-of-your-seat action, with the race to get the hole drilled In Time.  The action is intense, and there are some scenes that stir the emotions.  But the emotion is cheap, as is the story itself.  In the end, it is a totally mindless action movie that requires complete suspension of logic and realism.
B000002GXX|5.0|The obvious hits are One Of These Nights, Lyin' Eyes and Take It To The Limit. But they're just part of the story. I feel the best songs are the album tracks. Songs like Too Many Hands, Hollywood Waltz, Visions, After The Thrill Is Gone and I Wish You Peace show the Eagles at their creative best. When I play this CD I skip the hits and listen to the other songs. Sadly this was Bernie Leadon's last album with the Eagles. He quit the group after this album.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Wow! This is a really scary, and very disgusting and gory movie. I love it. The only movie scarier is The Exorcist. The last 5 minutes of this movie thogh, have very terrible special effects, but this was very low-budget. Funny how all these low-budget horror movies, usually end up being the scarier ones. A little bit of humor, lots of authentic scares, and some cheap thrills, lots of blood, demon posession, and really creepy feel to the film are just the beginning. Rent, no buy The Evil Dead if you want to be scared! (When I say that this is a horror film I don't mean Scream, this is the TRUE HORROR FILM!)
0140120416|5.0|I picked up this book at the library on a whim, and was so quickly drawn in that I decided to purchase the living language course with CDs to be able to continue learning Russian on my own when the book was due.  I found, though, that while the CDs are helpful for pronunciation and aural comprehension, the Penguin course has been most helpful overall.  I plan to purchase it now, and highly recommend it for any beginning (self-taught) Russian student.
0446608955|5.0|Like it says in the book &quot;first you will smile, and then you will cry- don't say you haven't been warned.&quot;, it was exactly like this with me when I read it. It's a sweet, honest love story; a book great for any age.
B000066796|3.0|Leopold (Hugh Jackman) is a duke from 1876 who is on the verge of marrying for money.  Through a reality-suspending twist of fate, he follows a man into a portal to the 21st century.  That man is Stuart (Liev Schrieber), ex-boyfriend to Kate (Meg Ryan).  When Stuart is involved in an accident, Leopold is left to fend for himself.<br />Kate is unbelieving of Stuart's story and sends Leopold out into the city, leading to all of the expected fish-out-of-water adventures.  This first portion of the movie is completely unorginal and provides little humor.  Eventually, the 19th century charm is unleashed, and Leopold and Kate find themselves falling in love (as always happens when Meg Ryan is around, it seems).  Kate is trying to climb the corporate ladder, yet Leopold leads her to quesion her motives and her desires.  <br />While the romantic portion is predictable, it is also reasonably enjoyable.  And since the audience is probably familiar with the typical Meg Ryan movie formula, the lack of originality is forgivable.  It is neither a terrific movie nor a horrible one.
0553212737|5.0|While doing research for a high school paper on Pride and Prejudice, I often came across the statement that Emma was Austen's masterpiece.  Having practically memorized P&P and Persuasion as a child, I found this near impossible to believe, especially as I couldn't get into Emma's dense text.  Well, it's been 7 years hence and I'm eating my words.  Emma is by far Austen's greatest literary achievement.  The style and language and overall concept display her restraint and command as an author.  Every word is perfectly chosen and placed - a brilliant feat that doesn't excite, but soothes the soul.  The work isn't quite as plot-driven as P&P, or even S&S, and everything revolves around the ingenue, Emma Woodhouse.  If there was such a thing as an epic about one simple person, Emma would be it.<br />Love her or hate her, Emma is quite a creation.  She's somehow both the heroine and anti-heroine, sincerely generous and wildly selfish, preternaturally poised and childishly weak.  While Emma is not spared when she is wrong, it's very clear that Austen loves her - the sharpness of her satiric voice is soften by the overall tone of complacency and fondness.  Never do you worry that Emma will turn out badly.  <br />In addition to the remarkably controlled and polished language and structure, Austen's voice is more in evidence here than in any other novel, much to her credit.  The lack of a precise plot, makes the author's tone much more important - you feel with Emma, while also being able to judge her.  Austen inhabits Emma's head, giving you her particular slant on things (with remarkable nonchalance and neutrality), but also looks at the world of Highbury at large, giving you the chance to also see things as they actually are (and gently laughing at Emma's egocentricity).  Emma isn't the darling Elizabeth Bennet is, but neither is she so nearly one-dimensional.  Elizabeth is a latter-day Emma - too right, too cool, too witty.  Emma is more graceful, but human, conflicted,young.  Sometimes seeing a character's gradual growth is a worth more than watching her get from Point A to Point B.<br />The lesser characters set off Emma as the heroine more than her own actions do.  They are seen as the typical flawed humans, who will stay irredeemably mediocre.  Emma isn't really as perfect as she thinks she is, but she can and will grow beyond her immaturity.  It's abundantly clear that Elton, Mrs. E, and even Harriet will never do so.  As for the character who spouts off the mind-numbing chatter in all Austen's works, Miss Bates is the best of the bunch.  What is amazing is how logically it all flows together.  Genius.<br />Emma is a princess, a do-gooder, a child-woman becoming a woman.  While Emma is a bit hard to love, she is Austen's ideal: warm, sincere, graceful, teachable, and thinking.  Her counterpart in her metamorphosis is Mr. Knightley.  He's the everyman version of Darcy's integrity and presence, but approachable, wise, eloquent, and practical.  His semi-role as Emma's teacher bothers some readers, but given their difference in age and experience, it's only natural.  After all, he can't still be learning life's lessons at his age, unlike the young group in P&P.  All in all, Emma will be appreciated by readers who care about authorial voice and respect her more mature grasp of language.  It's really quite impossible to compare P&P and Emma - so to avoid disappointment, I don't recommend fixating on a rehash of a boy-meets-girl plot.  This story is richly told and is most definitely about the girl.
0446605409|4.0|Actually, I quite enjoyed Plum Island. Fun read, interesting premise, reasonable plot. The thing for me about mystery novels is the hero. If they don't have an interesting personality, forget it. Well, De Mille seemed to be writing this book specifically for a Bruce Willis movie. At least that is what stuck in my head as I read it. I could just see the wry facial twists as I worked through the dialogue. Good enough, even if the plot failed to surprise.<br />Now, for comparison, check out The Fractal Murders, by Mark Cohen. This guy knows how to create a character. Plus a plot that whaps you on the head at the end. Great read!
B00005JL3A|5.0|This is my first review written here, and perhaps some of you old timers might hear me out.  Resident Evil is an amazing movie, brought together from the minds of gamers and psychological nit-pickers alike.  The movie is meant to be left a bit confusing, only to add to the mystery the characters are themselves experiencing.  As said in the commentary, the characters that have suffered from slight memory loss are very helpless and vulnerable, and the audience is made to feel all the same.  \\"Hot\\" actresses make up the childish tang of the movie, which is meant to portray innocence and fresh-to-the-world mindsets.  Of course the mini skirt complements this, as does Michelle Rodriguez's (Rain) baggy commando uniform.  Shoulda used her knife more!<BR>  Anyway, I must admit that I haven't liked a movie as I do this one for some time.  Event Horizon is perhaps one of my favorite films, only because of its whole eerie feeling, and Resident Evil does about double of what I would have expected off of E.H.  The director does the perfect job with this film - he makes the most important thing the \\"here\\" and \\"now\\".  Of course the characters may seem to the critics as undefined and two dimensional, but then they wouldn't be critics if they didn't have something bad to say!  The point of this background-less approach is to make the audience forget about everything else not happening at the current moment.  The characters were not given the luxury of gathering their thoughts before they were plummeted into The Hive, and once they were in, they had no need to remember how they felt about last Christmas.  This is called the mood.  <BR> Some people associate Marilyn Manson's presence in the credits with unthinkable ways of life, and though that may be true to whatever extent, he is only there for the music.  He has put scoring into another category for me; I feel now that the difference between song writing and scoring is merely the artist.  Manson does an absolutely amazing job placing lurking sounds and treading effects over menacing bass lines and intense melodies.  Manson demanded much of himself on this job, and places into the Resident Evil world feelings and anticipations that would have otherwise not been present.  He took a scene's feel and atmosphere personally, and spent time composing tracks that did not merely fit with the set and plot, but instead meshed into the landscape right before the viewers' eyes.  If anyone wants to discuss this, download his track \\"Seizure of Power\\" that was written to, not for, the movie.  <BR>       Now, as some say that it is not a creditable movie to the game, one must realize that it was not based on the game's actual play.  The creators imaged the Resident Evil world, and its feelings and manners, and created something from the middle of this.  Half of the characters had no idea what was going on for most of the time, and only wished to see the commando mission achieved and their own lives saved.  More and more is explained as the movie goes on, as it should be.  The game has its own succession of events, as does the movie.  Resident Evil the game throws around different challenges and events, while the movie's producers have a line that follows the best of these.  The game is meant to be interacted with, as the movie is meant to be experienced.  Those who have played the games already know what will happen in order to succeed, anyway...  Why just act that out?<BR> The producers did slip in a few places, but they did their best with their budget.  The most obvious mistake is the note reading something about \\"today all your dreams will come true\\".  It's shown twice in the movie, though in different handwritings!  During the commentary, they even admit to it!  Ah well; no harm done.  Again, they were given a very limited budget, and they did their best using what they had.  A pretty funny point was in their admitting that most of the large doors in the movie were in fact the same one, just painted everytime!  Smart!  Again, the characters were left short and thin because that was the entire point.  We do not get enough to anticipate their actions, which leave even more to be expected.  The character \\"Alice\\" even spends a few moments here and there remembering her own skills, which were taught to her as an inner company operative, though she doesn't realize it.  The dog scene mainly brings these qualities to the surface, and I can't complain about watching her easily drop kick both zombie and un-dead poochie alike.  The firearm usage right after reveals even more to her character, though perhaps it revealed more to her than the audience.  Also, she definitely does not come out of the movie just as pristine as she had entered it; she did all of her own stunts, and all of the bruises and scratches that were on her at the end of the movie were real.  In fact, they had to add a little make-up to improve her appearance for different scenes!  Lastly on this note, why would any company reliant on an underground research lab construct the lab's controlling computer to be accessible from the outside of the complex.  Matter of fact, it's the same reason why I have a firewall on my computer!  How is this something wrong with the movie, as some say?     <BR> Overall, I can't see this movie enough.  I think it amazing that the director and producer could have worked out a totally workable situation for the actors to be stuck in, and forced to find their way out of!  The sequel will bring more of a story to the Umbrella Company, as well.  \\"Alice\\" has already spent a good time slaying the un-dead, and next will look into just what went wrong, and what can be done to fix it.  Of course, I anticipate a good amount of trouble to present itself, but then, what would a good movie be without a little difficulty?  ...
B00005JKGK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time because of several reasons:  1) It came out at a time when I desperately wanted to see Hollywood make an Asian-American film.  2) The American stories totally brought back my childhood.  I almost felt like I was watching my life story.  3) It is a very well produced film - it just looks gorgeous.  4) It makes me cry every time I see it.  I admit though, it's not a perfect movie.  The acting was only okay.  Rosalind Chao and Lauren Tom were very good, but Ming-Na Wen was only decent (she's gotten better through the years) and Tamalyn Tomita was kind of awful.  The mothers were pretty good overall, with France Nguyen being the most memorable.  The best acted scenes were the ones in China - or maybe it just seemed better because it was in Chinese.  The script was also shamelessly cheesy at times - &quot;You take worse quality crab because ... you have best quality heart!&quot;.  Okay so that made me cry the first time, but that doesn't make it good writing. :)  Still, despite it's flaws, this movie will always have a certain place in Hollywood history and it will continue to make me cry everytime I see it.  As for the DVD version, it looks great but no Chinese subtitles?!?!?!  That's just wrong.
B00000ILDF|4.0|I like this movie for the most part.  In fact the only thing I didn't like about it were a few of the special effects shots where the alien looked really out of place.  Which ended up breaking the all important 'suspesion of disbelief'.  Too bad because the rest of the film is great.  Directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven, etc.)  Great sets, and action.  Moody lighting and music.  Overall a great movie.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is certainly a talented artist, but does not appeal to parents like mine. However this album is very good, with a lot of great rap, and even some rock styles mixed in the middle. One of my favorite songs is Sing for the Moment and of course, the lovable Without Me. In this album, he delves deeper into the hatred of his parents, his turbulent relationship with his wife, and the love for his daughter, Hailie. The whole album is very good, and is possibly one of the best rap albums ever made, produced by the king of rap, Dr. Dre. Another five star album from Eminem! ...
B00005QENZ|5.0|I recently bought Aerosmith Greatest hits, because it's got \\"Walk this way\\" \\"Same old song and dance\\" \\"Back in the saddle again\\" \\"Sweet emotion\\" and other great songs.<BR>That reminded me of the year that \\"get a grip\\" came out.<BR>I friend of mine had \\"get a grip\\" in tape and I loved that tape so much, we played it over and over again, until somebody stole it.<br />Now I am listening to the Cd version and believe me, is the best album by Aerosmith yet!<br />If you buy Aerosmith greatest hits, and this one, you'll have  a decent compilation of Aerosmith songs.<br />Really Rockin' great!
0671024256|5.0|This is a great book for the hobbyist writer to get movin' with their writing.  King outlines his childhood through his unique writing style in the first half of the book.  The second half of the book is dedicated to his take on the writing process.  If you are a writer in search of some insight, advice, and inspiration, this is a must-read.  I wish I had bought it sooner so I could have entered the writing contest he added in the middle of the book.
0804106304|5.0|Most everyone has heard of The Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan; that is rare for a literary novel. Many readers searching for their first literary experience may choose it, reasoning that it must be one of the more accessible examples of \\"literary\\" because it is so popular.  I worry that if an inveterate romance, crime or science fiction reader picks up this book, she's not going to try literary again.<br />If, in fact the difference between a \\"literary\\" novel and genre fiction is that literary is character-driven and not plot-driven then this book is, indeed, literary.  However, many literary novels focus on character and still have plots that carry the reader in rapt attention from beginning to end.<br />Joy Luck will not do this.  It is beautifully written.  The voice is superb.  There may (arguably) be no other book that gives its reader a sense of the Chinese culture in America, of the oriental mindset of many of our Asian sisters as well as this one does.  It also tells stirring stories and therein lies the problem, it tells several of them.<br />In fact it might have been better billed as a collection of stories.  There is a thread between them, but so is there in many short story collections. The thread in \\"Joy Luck\\" is not linear and it will take a conscientious reader to track the relationships between the story tellers in each chapter.  If a reader unfamiliar with \\"literary\\" works should take this book as the norm, she sadly may turn away from others.<br />Those seeking a poignant afternoon or two of reading should consider this book.  Those who might want to test literary waters might do better with a book that is more consciously aware of pacing, that leans more toward traditional narrative, say Anna Karinina by Tolstoy.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"
B000068QY7|4.0|All great songs except for Force Of Nature and She Is Love.   Amazing lyrics on Born on a Different Cloud.  I have only one knock on this album; songs on the album does not  really mesh or come together as a whole, might be due to production.  Expanded horizons for Liam as a songwriter.  Overall, fantastic album.
6304140711|4.0|i'm looking for the music soundtrack of the movie \\"fear\\" with mark kholberg. does anyone know where i can get it? if so please email me at ...BR>thanks.
B0000648WZ|1.0|My friends and I couldn't wait to see this movie when it came out, but left the theater vastly disappointed.<br />My biggest criticism is of the way the military of the future is portrayed so wimpily:  We're invading another world, and what equipment does our hi-tech army of the future possess?  Machine guns.  More machine guns.  And that's about it.  (Except for the occasional large bomb overratingly-called a \\"mini-nuke\\").  What is missing?  Let's see: No tanks, no rocket launchers, no futuristic weapons, virturally no air support, almost nothing besides soldiers with pathetic small-caliber weapons getting overrun by the bugs.  The military of today would put up a far better fight than this miltary of the future.<br />The thing is, there's no tanks, fighters, etc in the Starship Troopers novel, either, but that's because all the soldiers wore power armor that essentially removed the need for tanks, fighters, etc.  Where the heck's the power armor in the movie? Missing for some reason, perhaps so they can show the actor's pretty faces, or save money on production costs.<br />I like Robocap a LOT.  But while Heinlein's political agenda in the book is somewhat of a fat target for parody, this story is not well served by the Robocop-like treatment, which gives me the feeling that Verhoeven didn't have much respect for the source material, or maybe just not for the genre in general.  Which brings me to my next complaint, which of course is the much-hated 90210-teen heartthob story stuff.  Was this really necessary?<br />Honestly, imagine if this movie had been done seriously, it could have been a fantastic hardcore action movie with marines in power armor fighting for their lives, facing off against the bugs.  Think \\"Aliens\\" times 1000.  Instead we get a semi-funny movie with lame action and 90210-like teen whining that essentially parodies the book it is based on.  I know which movie I'd prefer.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Well No Doubt does it again. They have put out 4 full length albums and all 4 of them has a completly different style of music on it. I don't know how they pull it off but they do and I personally think its great. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; has a new wave sound to it unlike the previous 3 albums which were; Ska, Pop Rock and a little punk, and Alternative Rock. <br />I really wouldn't call this No Doubt's best album. &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; still has to be their best work. However, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; does have some pretty cool tracks on it. &quot;Hella Good&quot; was awesome at first but it really got played out and I'm pretty tired of it now, and I feel the same way about &quot;Hey Baby&quot;. Their new single &quot;Underneath it all&quot; takes No Doubt back to their Ska and Reggae roots. It has a great beat to it and meaningful lyrics. <br />However, I am disapointed that No Doubt has yet to release &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;. This is obviously the best track on the album, produced by &quot;The Cars&quot; frontman, &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; presents a new wave sounding track unlike anything I have ever heard before. It kind of reminds me of the early 80's, which can be a good thing but bad as well. Aside from those 4 tracks I think the album is rather weak, but not terrible. If your a hardcore No Doubt fan then buy this, but if your feeling unsure about the album then don't go for it, because more than likely its not for you.
B00005MAM2|3.0|I bought this DVD because I have owned the VHS version of Akira for many years and it is an amazing film. However, after watching just ten or fifteen minutes of the DVD I realised that although the animation and music is fantastic, what really made the original so good was the script. The ORIGINAL script. I don't know what made the producers of the DVD think they could do a better job of the script or get any better actors. True, the picture and sound quality is far better on the DVD but the acting just lacks the roar realism and naturalism that was present on the original. I've tried and tried to like this DVD as much as the original but really, it's nearly a different film. The script sounds far too tacky and cliched. It's far less intelligent and funny. And the line &quot;Get it? Goats eat hay? Pretty funny huh?&quot; is no longer there. And that was just such a good line. Aaaah the hours that I spent shouting that across the class room. But that's another story. I just hope people new to Akira who are watching the DVD before the VHS will only believe me that the VHS version is SO much better. I know the characters in the film are meant to be teenagers but on the DVD they sound far too timid for violent bike-punks.<BR>Still. Never mind. The box is nice. Just buy the original VHS version.<BR>Oh yeah, and the second disc is nothing special.
0671027344|5.0|This was an awesome book.  I could understand where Charlie was coming from so well at certain parts, it was scary.  There were certain points where I laughed out loud, raised my eyebrows, or physically smacked my forehead because of something he said or did. P>Anyone at any point will find something to relate to Charlie with.  He's deep and poignant, and selfless to the point where he's no longer being honest with anyone, especially himself.  His experimentation with drugs and sex is hilarious and frightening all at once, and while he grows so much throughout the book, he seems to stay so innocent at the same time.  <br />This is an awesome book.  For those of you who love dramatic things and teenage drama, you won't be wasting your money.
B0000640VO|5.0|I must say that this movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a VERY long time. The cintematography is amazing and the story is sweet. I could just watch the movie without any sound, but really and the movie would still be captivating. The settings, the props, the clothing..... everything, down to the tiniest detail was important to the people working on this film and it shows. There is absoltley nothing gratuitus about this movie. I have heard people say they have turned it off within the first few minutes because of this, and I must say they are wrong. There is absolutely nothing bad in this film. There is one scene which mentions orgasms.... but come on, exactly what is the problem with this? The story is about life, love and how the little things matter.  <BR>The only problem with the American DVD version at least is that the translation is very wrong at certain points. I can't understand how some of them were made, but it is not a major problem.<BR>If you like Amelie, you would probably like L'argent de Poche(translated as Small Change, even though, again, I don't agree with the translation........ I sound very uppity, sorry reader).
B000069CWE|1.0|I thought that this CD would be as great as the Hybird Theory.It def is not.I loved the Hybird Theory CD but I think this CD ruins all the songs,the remixs are very weird and ruin all the songs.Its def not as good as hybird theory.I can't wait for Linkin Park to come out with something brand new not just a new CD with remixs of there songs that are on Hybird Theory CD.I am very disappointed in this CD.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Right. Just try and forget all that Tom Waits has done before. Treat this like the only album of his you've ever heard. Maybe even the only album he's done. Now. Just think about how amazing an album it really is. Everyone has a tendenct to say &quot;Aaah it's not as good as Rain Dogs or Swordfishtrombones&quot;. It is as good. It's just different. I've listened to a lot of Tom Waits stuff and this has got to be one of his most unique albums. People say that all the songs take from his earlier work. This may well be, BUT, regardless of how he did it, he has managed to produce songs that are completely unique. Well that's just what I think. It's one of my favourite Tom Waits albums.
B00000JCOV|5.0|If you're looking for something to listen to with max volume to drown out the sounds of your life and the world, Slipknot's self-titled album is perfect.  People think less of them because they scream and rave, but everyone expresses themselves in different ways and this is Slipknot's.  And damn, it's awesome.  Plus, they have to get extra brownie points for pulling off a nine man band.<br />In my opinion, the best song on the album BY FAR is &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot;.  Corey's mixture of singing and screaming is haunting and leaves you begging for more as he tells the story of a man who wakes up from a nightmare in which he slashed his wrists to realize that it wasn't a nightmare at all; it was reality.  Then of course, there's &quot;Surfacing&quot;.  The lyrics are stupid but if you listen to them when you're angry, you realize that it's what you've been thinking all along.<br />There are so many other songs on this album that are awesome for so many different reasons, but I don't have the space to explain it all.  Just rest assured that if you're a KoRn fan and you don't mind screaming, go for this album.  It rules.
B000050XEI|5.0|I don't know about you, but it's tough for me to find music this relaxing that has real musical value, so I'm thrilled with this release. I know everybody says it's short, but that's the way it goes. i'd rather short with quality than long with junk.<BR>The only other stuff I've found that's as relaxing is W h i s per by some girl named Genie.
B00005YXZH|2.0|I was not very familiar with the band Wilco (aside from some of their singles) before I bought &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;. I decided to jump in after reading rave reviews for YHF. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. If you can get over the fact that this album sounds like &quot;Pavement Does Space Rock Volume 1&quot;, (with special guests Urge Overkill on &quot;Kamera&quot;, &quot;War on War&quot;, &quot;Tea Kettle Black&quot; and Bob Dylan on &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot;) *apologies if I just ruined those songs for you* - then it's palatable. Surely, &quot;Wilco's best album&quot; is probably fairly accurate. However, much of Wilco's fanbase are simply being introduced to  new musical styles that they are not familiar with. For those who do not find Wilco's sound on YHF fresh and innovative, it is a simply mediocre album, not worth listening to more than a couple of times.
0671799320|5.0|To start with it's a GREAT BOOK, will written, will documented, informing, though full of dates, numbers, and names, that's some times confusing, I would say that if you are interested to know what makes the world moving, by whom and why. Its this book, it takes you from the early days of discovering oil until the gulf war, passing by how this commodity caused wars and how it became a strategic one.
B00005QDW1|3.0|&quot;Rock Steady&quot; was a real let down for me at first.  I was never very attached to &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; but &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; sat in my CD player for a month straight because I could understand just where Gwen was coming from in her lyrics.  I was expecting something just as awesome and deep in &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and unfortunately I didn't get it.  &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, I think, is a cool album...for when you're HAPPY.  Like, really bubbly happy.  At least, that's when I listen to it (and that's the only time I listen to it).  Some songs are pretty cool like &quot;Underneath it All&quot; and &quot;In My Head&quot;, but there are other songs that make me feel as though I'm trapped in the middle of a Game Boy game and can't get out because of all of the techno beeps and boops and etc.  <br />So overall, if you're looking for something totally outside of No Doubt's style, something happy and techno-ish, buy this and you'll love it forever.  If you're looking for something from No Doubt's earlier days, something deep, go for &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;.  <br />I'm glad Gwen and the guys had fun during this album and that they could experiment with new styles.  I'm just not glad that I spent money on this thing when I was expecting something I could listen to ALL the time.
6305308659|2.0|Pleasantville is well-done from a strictly visual point of view, but it doesn't make a good case for its main conceit: that a &quot;pleasantly&quot; stable life is an unfulfilling one. I kept watching the movie thinking, why is this such a bad thing? <br />Not that I favor all the details about the caricatures presented; I have no interest in seeing mothers cooped up in the kitchen, for instance, especially since I'd rather cook for myself. And the town's implied racism certainly has appeal for me. <br />But the movie's theme has more to do with tone, rather than specifics. Pleasantville would have you believe that a pleasant life is bad, but generally speaking, the atmosphere of the town portrayed in the movie seemed very appealing to me. I can't figure out why that kind of overall climate is bad, details notwithstanding. And if you can't buy into the film's premise, you can't enjoy this movie.
B000002B7M|5.0|This has to be a classic album.Here are my track reviews.<br />1. I Don't Know - brilliant song,one of my favourites...95%<BR>2. Crazy Train - classic song, ozzy at his best... 95%<BR>3. Goodbye To Romance - One of the softer ozzy songs, it still deserves...85%<BR>4.

Mr. Crowley - Also a heavy song, not as good as Suicide Solution,still  it gets a good 80%<BR>7. No Bone Movies - blistering track, enough said...90%<BR>8. Revelation (Mother Earth) - Not a bad track, not in the same league as crazy train but still it gets...80%<BR>9. Steal Away (The Night) - A great track ,not heavy but its great in its own right...80%<br />Overall,a great album that easily gets 90%+.<BR>Buy it and you wont be disapointed.
B00000K19E|4.0|The message is hidden so deep.It's too hard to understand it.<BR>People just see the amazing pictures.But the real idea is failed to be deliverd.
B000069CWE|2.0|I'm sorry - I can't agree with what has been said here.  Admittedly, I bought the CD blind.  I had no clue what the jewel case contained within.  All I knew was Linkin Park had come out with a new CD and I HAD TO HAVE IT.  I absolutely LOVED Hybrid Theory and was expecting something along those lines - incredible melodies, strong vocals, and FRESH MATERIAL.<br />What I got was a complete re-hash of Hybrid Theory, but the MUSIC is gone and replaced with rap.  It's almost as if Fred Durst had hijacked my beloved Linkin Park and forced them to follow his talentless lead.  Listening to Reanimation I felt the same hollowness and betrayal as when I first listened to Significant Other - I just blew [price] on a POC CD.<br />Save your money and wait until Linkin Park is FREED from this drivel.  I resent paying money for a place-holder.  The same effect can be had by putting Hybrid Theory in your CD player and hitting the >> button at random.<br />Your mileage may vary.
B00005RFAI|1.0|Well, I can't see what people like about this cd really. It sounds like some wanna be ghetto girl acting cool. What do people see in rediculous lyrics and stupid radio songs like &quot;Get this party started?&quot;  There is absolutely no depth to these songs at all. Some variation would have been nice.  There is nothing to be mizunderstood about my review: this cd is pointless and irritating. Pink is on her way to Tiffanyland, if you catch my drift.

B000069HKH|5.0|I have never been much of a Springsteen fan.  I'm 39 and have never purchased and of his recordings, though I enjoyed a few of his videos - until now.<br />Bored at work last Friday, I was surfing and found the tune &quot;The Rising&quot; as a download on Rolling Stone.  It wasn't 10 minutes later that I had listened to it 3 times.  Go check it out.<br />It was a great tune, and like many great tunes - came packed with a ripping guitar solo.  Say what you want, but Bruce can lay out an awesome guitar solo.  Sure, it's not a lot of flash, just pure grit containing only the most essential notes.<br />I headed right out to the record store when the link failed, because I figured the CD was worth it just for that on tune.  How many songs can you say that about?<br />Over the weekend, The Rising was in heavy rotation on my CD player, and by Monday I had it memorized. While the CD is a little heavy on anthems, they are all well crafted and deal with different subject matter in very compelling ways.<br />But the really great material on this CD are the ballads and dance tunes.  &quot;Your Missing&quot; and &quot;Into the Fire&quot; are simply breathtaking in their stark vision of the loss people endured on Spetember 11th.  And when it gets too heavy to bear, Bruce drops in &quot;Let's Be Freinds&quot; a grooving upbeat cheerful tune.<br />In this day of too-long-full-of-filler CDs, it's kind of amazing that Bruce can lay down 15 tracks that entertain from start to finish.
B000069CWE|5.0|Ok, the main theme of this cd is a &quot;Reanimated&quot; one.  As you will notice, on the front of Hybrid Theory there is a soldier.  Now, on the cover of Reanimation there is a robot.  Also, the songs have new names such as &quot;Enth E nd&quot; and &quot;Krwlng&quot;.  In my opinion the whole point of this is that the songs are &quot;Reanimated&quot;, the names are &quot;Reanimated&quot;, and the artwork is &quot;Reanimated&quot;.  The songs are remixes of the songs on Hybrid Theory, plus High Voltage and My December.  My personal favorites are &quot;1stp Klosr&quot; and &quot;Wth&gt;You&quot;.  These new remixed songs feature some of the top artists from rock and rap such as, Jonathan Davis, Jay Gordon, Chali 2na, and Aaron Lewis. And also some of the best unknown artists such as, Aceyalone and Rasco. This album is wonderful and the music is very interesting an layered, but as you all know, it was very hard to make an album after Hybrid Theory, but Linkin Park did very well, better then you would think.
0783228317|2.0|I thought I would love this movie but I didn't.  After two hours of watching two druggies on vacation in Las Vegas, I felt as if I was the only sober person at a party.  It is a movie best viewed when stoned.
B00005QXDD|4.0|These guys are very funny and suprisingly musically talented. They remind me of the late, great Frank Zappa. Only the music is not near as complex. This Disc contains some great riffs though. Jack Black is great and brings the crowd some excellent humor on the screen and now into our stereos. I am happy to have purchased this disc!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This is the worst rewrite of history in the past thirty years!  And it is amazing that Hollywood considers Ben Affleck an actor.  Good Gracious, where are the Van Johnsons' and Gregory Pecks'of our time gone?  Can you believe Alec Baldwin playing Colonel Jimmy Doolittle?  That my friends, is an insult.  Don't waste your dollars.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Really, I tried to understand the hidden meaning or even the obvious meaning of this movie. I twisted it and turned it in my mind to try to figure it out. I kept on thinking that I'd figure it out when the movie ended. I actually pondered the movie for a week without a single clue. Finally, the wonderful readers of my Amazon review helped me with their e-mails.  Evidently, as you're watching the movie, you should think of the first part as a dream and the second part as reality.  This is not enough to spoil the movie for you.  In fact, the movie is left wide open for interpretation on purpose.  Just when you think you've \\"got it\\", it's got you.
B000069HKH|5.0|It's sad to me that some people can't recognize a true 5-star record when they hear it.  You should take note the tag lines and e-mail addresses of the people who rated this CD 1 or 2 stars, because they cannot be trusted.  There's a reason Rolling Stone made this their first 5-star album of the 2002.  There's also a reason some people are hired to write reviews for Rolling Stone and others are relagated to Amazon.com consumer reviews.  It has to do with one's ability to listen to something without preconceived notions about what it should sound like.  Any review that unfavorably compares Bruce's latest CD to his early work is missing the mark entirely.  This is a remarkable album, not only for the quality of the songs but for what it says to those of us who are truly able to listen.  Well done, Boss.
0786867973|5.0|I bought this book, along with How to eat which is also brilliant, after watching Nigella Bites.  And all I can say is for someone who loves good food but didn't even own a mixing bowl (of course now I have the works!) before, this book is a godsent.  I have made the pavlova, several choc pudding/cakes and even the tarte tatin which to me was always gourmet chef land with a surprisingly high succes rate! Her recipes are easy to follow, fun to read and most of all, inspires you to get into that kitchen and start baking.  I've even started to bake my own danish pastries, which in my pre-domestic goddess days would be unthinkable!! though I must warn you, I went through 6 sticks of butter in one weekend of domestic goddess-frenzied baking (bacon pie, steamed syrup pudding, roast chicken with stuffing, etc and tarte tatin, and yes, my husband thought I had gone mad too!) So if you're trying to lose weight don't even think of opening those pages, just looking at the luscious photos will add calories! otherwise this and 'How to Eat' are the only two cookbooks you will ever need ... until the new 'Nigella Bites' is published of course.
0380788624|5.0|Although some of the implications of plot twists were a little far fetched, at all times I found the actions of the individuals believable.  This demonstration of writing ability is something of note in a novel that also presents actual Perl code, graphs, and contains an appendix explaining an actual crypto system used in the story.  Combine all the elements of a cyberpunk novel with many apt analogies and cynical humor about the current state of the world, throw in some historical context too, and you end up with a wonderful read.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie sends a call to all those watching, saying, &quot;Wake up!&quot;.  It seems that most of the people that love this movie can also appreciate the profoundness of life.  Who else could *possibly* have played this role other than Spacey??  This was his movie.  Personally, the passion I hold for this movie is phenomenal.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Entertainment Weekly hit the nail on the head comparing Radiohead to Yes in the 70's.  This is a band that, after OK Computer, has abandoned traditional rock constraints of song structure and melody.  There's a place for this -- challenging &quot;art rock&quot; music has always had a market, and the positive reviews here point that out -- but if you caught on to Radiohead with The Bends or OK Computer, I'll bet the odds are higher that you'll feel put off by this CD.<br />That said, Pyramid Song is a glorious exception on this CD.  Had that song been representative of the direction they took with this album, this might have been Radiohead's second masterpiece.  As it is, in ten years, nobody will remember this CD.
B000002GAF|5.0|Gino and his brother Joe really know how it is done.....Well done to say the least......I saw this tour in Indianapolis and was AWESTRUCK!

A friend of mine turned me on to gino at a very young age....and I'm glad he did...I'm glad i was musically inclined to grasp it all...growing up in the 70's we listened to all types of music...mostly ROCK...However Gino's music was a breath of fresh air! Can't say enough about all his music! IT'S ALL GOOD! By it up while you can and listen to a great sound you don't hear much of in today's music arena! You'll Love it!
B00005J6UP|4.0|Great movie, and nice of the studio to invite all the kids back for a commentary.  But what in the world happened to Sean Astin during the commentary?  He just up and left.  Because he's now in Lord O' The Rings, everyone else isn't 'good enough' for his company?  Can anyone clarify?
0684800713|4.0|People told me that I would not like Hemingway's style.  To be honest it took quite a few chapters to get into the story because in the beginning Hemingway wrote about a group of expatriates flitting around Paris continuously getting drunk (can anyone REALLY drink as much as these people did in the novel?) This seemed to go on and on. A reader of this book really needs to understand the context of the times before reading this because you would simply think that these people are stupid.  Understanding that this book was written after the horror of the Great War one can really begin to see what this &quot;Lost Generation&quot; was all about.<br />The book really picked up for me when the group goes to Pamplona for the fiesta.  I think that bullfighting is disgusting but the way Hemingway wrote about the bullfights was amazing.  The detail puts you right there next to Jake and Brett.<br />I do like the writing style of Hemingway. No fluff, just lay it out how it is. Take it or leave it.
B000002NJS|5.0|This album is SOOOO good. It`s definetly Madonna`s best album. All the songs are good but especially I love Ray of Light and Frozen. These are my all-time favourites. So if you want to hear good music buy this CD now and you won`t be disappointed.

B000068PQ0|5.0|The flaming lips have achieved a quite rare achievement.  Radiohead created a new world with the lusch soundscapes of &quot;Kid A&quot;.  A year later, Bjork took a haunting journey exploring through that world.  And now here we have the flaming lips, with this CD, &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;, have gone to that world once again on a psychadelic quest, making rainbows and planting flowers along the way.  I dont think ive ever called a record &quot;psychadelic&quot;, but if there is one album in 2002 that defines that- this is it.  Most of the songs on this CD are irresitibly catchy, and trippy.  There are great song arrangements, some of the best you are going to find all year.  I wont go into a song- by- song analysis, as there have probably been alot of reviews doing that.  But there are also some pretty foolish lyrics on the CD, that you probably will question at first,so be warned.  But get this CD.
B000069HKH|5.0|Love this CD! The strings give the songs much more depth. Some old sounds and some new sounds. My favorite cut is Waiting On A Sunny Day. The band just keeps getting better.Bruce is at his best here.
B000053VAF|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  If all the Christian groups during this film's release bothered to actually watch the thing, they'll realize that is is very faith-affirming.  I admit, casting Alanis Morisette as Christ and Chris Rock as the 13th apostle may seem a little wrong, but you really have to watch the movie to understand Kevin Smith's message.  One of the deleted scenes on this DVD is a monologue by Jason Lee, who explains that Hell used to be merely the absence of God -- which, if you had ever been in God's presence, would be the worst kind of punishment to endure.  I think that one idea summarizes Smith's movie very well.
B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park brought in other remix artists to &quot;spice up&quot; there songs and gave them a new edge. Among some of the best are: &quot;Pushing me away&quot; &quot;Papercut&quot; &quot;With you&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot; The CD at first may seem ackward but you may like myself some to enjoy it!

B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising, Bruce Springsteen's first album with the E Street Band since the 1984 landmark album Born in the USA, is a blazing return to form. His vocals are pure, intense, and emotional, sounding better than they have in years. The E streeters have fallen directly back in step with Bruce seeming to have not skipped a beat in their decade and a half away from Mr. Springsteen. It is easy to see the maturity of the band, as they have evolved their sound for a new musical climate without forgetting the elements that defined their sound when they first got together over 25 years ago. The album showcases very solid guitar work, including some incredibly roaring solos and leads from Bruce himself, wailing away on his Telecaster. There are a wide variety of songs represented here, as well as many different musical styles. There are straight up rockers, more laid back ballads, some excellent slide guitars, and even some middle eastern sounds reminiscent of recent work by Sting. Some of my personal favorites are Lonesome Day, Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin), Further on up the Road, and The Rising. The album is filled with songs of loss and redemption, friendships and hardships. This skillful blending of emotions fills the music with added sense of reality that makes it that much more meaningful. This is a real man with real emotions that people can relate to. While watching VH1 recently, a Michael Jackson fan said that there were two types of rock stars: those like Springsteen who are very approachable people that often go out to local clubs and meet with everyday people, and those like Jackson, who seem like untouchable people that lead very guarded lives, on a completely different level than you and me. He said that is &quot;untouchable&quot; status was what drew him to Jackson. Springsteen's approachable nature, t-shirt and jeans appearance, and abilty to relate to the feeling of everyday people are what draw myself and many others to listen to his music. Give this albuma try. It is one of the most powerful statements in this post 9/11 world (not to sound to cliched, but I really do think it's a powerful album from a man who realizes that our world has changed). Hope you enjoy listening to this album as much as I do. I already posted this review under for limited edition (the version I own) For those of you who are wondering, the limited edition is a bound cardboard booklet containing about 45 pages of handwritten lyrics and pictures. It's not absolutely essential for everyone, but if you're a Springsteen fan, the handwritten lyrics are a very nice touch.
B000063JZQ|5.0|With no fanfare, Roman Polanski's \\"MACBETH\\" -- his first film after the murder of his wife Sharon Tate and her friends by the Manson gang -- has quietly appeared on retail shelves.<br /><br />Shakespeare's notoriously bloody \\"Scottish play\\" is perfectly captured by the equally notorious director in what has widely been viewed as a venting of his personal rage.<br /><br />Many have also noted in this bravura piece of moviemaking that incoporates Shakespeare's blatant themes of witchcraft, rampant paranoia, spousal manipulation and finally evil triumphant a continuation of Polanski's \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\"  A metaphorical sequel of sorts.<br /><br />The bleak exteriors shot almost exclusively in the \\"golden hours\\" of dawn and twilight add immeasurably to the overall feel of authenticity.  The great locations and sets, with their terrific attention to detail, give a sense of immediacy to the homicidal happenings.  Blades slash and blood spurts as the dirty deeds of misbegotten power usurped are played out.<br /><br />Polanski has an intuitive gift for staging, and he is at his best in giving a literal interpretation to Shakespeare's many will-known metaphors.  The \\"Is this a dagger I see before me?\\" scene is a standout as is the visit of Macbeth to the witches den where he sees his future.  This is perhaps the director's most visually spellbinding work.<br /><br />Jon Finch is effective as a morose Macbeth with great, emotive diction. In contrast, Francesca Annis is a pale, pathetic nymphet of a wife.  It is tempting to interpret elements of the director's own life in portrayal of the power of young women over much stronger, driven men.  But it's where their sick pathologies meet that most interests Shakespeare -- and no doubt Polanski.<br />This is a great film and would have been an even greater DVD if the powers that be had arranged for a director's commentary.<br /><br />Hugh Hefner was the producer -- even a commentary by him would have been most interesting given his closeness to Polanski.

B00005YUNY|2.0|This DVD is not that bad, but it's not that good either. Lacks any real energy. Even Chris seems bored by the whole thing. And Steve Howe's guitar playing has never been so messy. Quick, get the banana peel off his guitar neck! Trevor, where are you? YES needs you!
006109594X|1.0|Somehow, I don't know how or why, I finished this book. With such a lame story line, and with characters so thin they would undoubtedly blow off the deck of the aircraft carrier referred to in the title, I just have one request of the publisher: please compensate me for the time I wasted reading this book. I'll accept a cash or store credit.<BR>Every aspect of this book was so obvious and uninteresting that the most defining characteristic of the story is just how irritating it is. The romantic element made me want to retch, but so did many of the other characters...on second thought, maybe the horrible romantic scenes fit just perfectly.<BR>If you read this book, you're doing yourself (and the literature industry) as dis-service.

B00006690F|5.0|I honestly didn't want to buy this CD. My knee-jerk reaction was to not be like everyone else and condemn this CD. But I got over it, put my money down and gave The Eminem Show a chance. I can honestly say that I have no regrets. I own Eminem's other two albums, and although they are good albums, you get the sense that Eminem is still struggling to find his niche. The subject on matter on those CD's are a little uneven, having depressing tracks following the bouncy singles. With the Eminem Show, Marshall shows that he is not just a flash in the pan, a pop-star for rap fans or simply a shock rapper. Aside from a few humorous tracks, this CD is serious business. Eminem shows he has a serious side, and let's it all pour out through this CD. The main thing I love about this CD is it's variety. The first time I listened to it, I didn't know what to expect from track to track. The album starts off with the intense \\"White America\\" and never lets up until the humorous ending of \\"Curtains Close\\" which features the return of, you guessed it, Ken Kaniff. There are so many great songs to acknowlegde on this album. \\"Hailie's Song\\" was surprising. When I heard that he was going to actually sing on the album, I thought one of two things would happen: It would work and sound great, or it would be completely horrible and corny. Well, it works, and it works well. \\"Sing For The Moment\\" is definetly my favorite song on here. Most people will notice it samples Aerosmith's \\"Dream On.\\" It's one of the softer songs, but more powerful than anything else on the album. It also has a slew of great lines (They say music can alter moods and talk to you/But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?). Other noteworthy tracks include \\"Cleaning Out My Closet,\\" \\"Superman,\\" \\"Business,\\" \\"Square Dance,\\" and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy,\\" where Eminem doesn't miss the opportunity to poke fun at R. Kelly. Overall, this is an extremely well done and surprisingly great album. I suggest that even if you didn't like Eminem before that you give this album a chance. Look past \\"Without Me\\" and you will find this CD will have many rotations in your CD player.Eminem before that you give this album a chance.

0316666343|3.0|What do I really think Heaven is like?  This is the question I have been asking myself since reading The Lovely Bones, narrated by Susie Salmon, a murdered teenage girl residing in her own version of Heaven.<br />Susie lives in a perfect place surrounded by coveted objects from her most vivid imaginings, yet she is still aware of and emotionally involved in the lives of the friends and family she left behind.  She is omni-present and is able to facilitate the unfolding plot from a ubiquitous perspective.<br />Her loved ones' lives are shattered as a result of her death, and, try as she might, she can do nothing to intercede. She is left to see the harsh unraveling that she incidentally caused.<br />The Lovely Bones is a thought-provoking effort from a first-time author; however, I feel the resolution of the story (without giving it away) is too forced and inconsistent with the rest of the novel.  Overall, though, this book left me asking myself some great questions, which makes it worth the read.
B000003TA4|5.0|Everyone in the world has an opinion on Nirvana. It's basically split down the middle: Either you love them or you hate them. Regardless of how you feel about Nirvana, one thing is certain: Nevermind has been the subject of over-analyzation by music critics for years.<br />You've heard the story millions of times. Nevermind came out at a time when music was in a very sorry state. The 90's had just begun and the world was trying to move away from all the hair-metal bands of the nineties that had become such a stale cliche (Much like the nu-metal bands of late). Indeed, Nevermind completely changed the story of music and paved the way for countless bands of the 90's to follow and started a style that today, still refuses to die. But everyone blabbers on about how thoughtful and insightful this album is and about how Kurt Cobain was this great poet. Nothing could be shorter of the truth. The true beauty behind Nevermind is in it's simplicity. People realized that you can just have great stripped down music without all the dramatics. Don't think for a minute I am diminising the quality of this album. I'm just simply saying, everyone loves it for all the wrong reasons. The bottom line is, good music is good music. If it sounds good, it is good, nothing more to it, and Nevermind is an album that confirms that.<br />I think it is obvious that this album has and will continue to stand the test of time. I myself have bought 3 copies of it since it's release (My first cassette tape of it, a CD that got worn out, and the copy I now own). Pretty much 1 out of every 5 people in the country own this. You can't throw a cat in a room full of people and not hit an owner of this album. It's effected so many people and has definetly earned it's \\"Essential Recording\\" label.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This was my 2nd dvd purchase, and I am ever so glad.  I own the Video and Laser disc version, but combined they don't hold a candle to DVD.  The tour thru the library of Disney Artist drawings is so awesome!  The animation of that alone is breathtaking, and the rendering of \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" By Barbra Streisand herself, WOW.  I hoped it would be her in the flesh singing, but they dubbed her voice over clips of Snow White, but thats OK by me, they did a great job.  I saw the Theater Version and they did a excellent job of clean-up on the print.  Buy This Version!  Befor it goes back in the VAULT for 10 years!!!!!
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption easily ranks among the best prison films I have ever seen. And is a running contender for one of the best dramas I have ever seen. For those of you who don't know, the film is about Tim Robbins character getting sent to Shawshank prison for murder and the events that happen to him there. Including the people he meets, friendships he forges and tribulations he endures. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman absolutely shine and is easily one of the best movies in both of their long line of film credits. <br />The movie really brings a message of hope and friendship and a good understanding of life behind bars. (at least in that time period of 1940's - 1960's) An excellent movie with an excellent message. One of those \\"take what you can from it\\" films that really stands out. 4 1/2 stars.<br />The dvd is ok but I think they could have done a little better with it. The picture is exceptable but the audio is a little subdued I think. The extras are few and the menus are simple and basic. Oh well, maybe a SE on the horizon?<br />Pick this one up and see two very talented actors at their very best.
B00003CX8N|4.0|It's nice to see a simple story told well and beautifully acted. There are no explosions or audience-baiting Hollywood touches in this quiet film--unless you account Bancroft's throwing a copy of Pepys diary across the room because it was \\"only excerpts, not the real thing.\\" The only liberty I felt the filmmakers took with Helene Hanff's collection of personal correspondence with a British bookstore was to imply that she was carrying a torch for her primary correspondent, Frank Doel (played by Hopkins). While any relationship can be see as tinged with erotic tensions of some sort, I always felt from the book that Helene had a good grasp on reality (an opinionated and driven New Yorker, yes, but one that I doubt would ever have seriously endeavored to cross the Atlantic in hopes of busting up Frank's marriage.) In fact, Hanff never reveals much about her personal life in the book. (Perhaps she married but the fact was never documented in her correspondence.) The movie has her surrounded by numerous coupled friends, perhaps unintentionally supporting the stereotype that bookish women are asexual and unlovable. But Bancroft resists this stereotype and presents Helene as a vital and engaging personality. There is nothing pathetic about her.<br />One amusing moment in the film was seeing Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Judy Dench as Mr. and Mrs. Doel watching the coronation of Elizabeth II on their black and white television...the very queen who would one day bestow titles on these two accomplished actors.<br />Although it would have been nice if the film had been put on DVD in widescreen format, it probably doesn't matter that much. There are no sweeping vistas here, nor are there many scenes of two characters sitting across a table and conversing with one another. (In fact, they have the entire Atlantic Ocean between them.) Pan and scan works just fine.<br />This film will not be everyone's cup of tea, but for anyone who enjoys watching a couple of veteran actors playing everyday people with great subtlety, this makes for a very pleasant 100 minutes.everyday people with great subtlety, this makes for a very pleasant 100 minutes.
0380977788|4.0|I go into all of Neil Gaiman's books expecting to be blown away, and every single time it seems as though I'm going to be disappointed.  Then, out of nowhere, something will come rising up out of the books and just bash me, forcing me to read more and more and more, as quickly as I can, to find out what will happen next.<br />It was the same with this one.  I didn't think I was into it until I realized that I was speed-reading it in a frantic effort to find out what would happen next as fast as possible.<br />At the age of 19, I didn't find myself terrified by this book... but, had I read it between the ages f 6-10, I'm sure I would now have a terrible fear of waking up to find that my eyes had become buttons.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Why would anyone want to own this awful movie? It failed as both history and art. And the long bombing sequence just looked like a video game effect. Get Tora! Tora! Tora! instead.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I am truly greatful that the producers of this double-DVD set committed themselves to the preservation of the original print. Their passion for the man and the film are evident in this flawlessly packaged collection. Welles' one and only masterpiece is displayed in all of its original glory. The classic three-act story structure coupled with revolutionary cinematic technique and brilliant performances certainly qualifies it as the gretaest film ever made. To think that Orson Welles was only 25 years old when he co-wrote, directed, and starred in this epic only adds to the euphoria surrounding the film's greatness. All cinemaphiles should make this collection required screening.
B00005LC3Y|5.0|Forget about &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; and &quot;Casualties of War&quot;.  While all of these Nam war movies are entertaining at times, few of them can match Kubrick's treatment of the dark Nam dystopic genre.  Modine is quite brilliant as the smarmy, smart allecky Joker.  D'Onofrio is haunting as the delayed, affected, and ultimately psychopathic Pyle.  But it is the bellowing R. Lee Ermey that makes the film stand out from its peers--the performance of a lifetime.<br />R. Lee's ability to infuse his character with realism--based on Ermey's actual life lived as both a Marine and a Drill Sergeant in the USMC--makes the first half of the film riveting in the utmost.  Many critics point to FMJ as a scathing indictment of the military mind and the USMC in particular, as if the first half of the film is criticizing the methods of the USMC with Ermey as a willing participant.  This is patently false.  While the latter half of the film is certainly a dark gaze into the murk of the Viet Nam experience, the Boot Camp half is almost a commercial for the Marines and R. Lee carries it the whole way.<br />I've never been in the military, and shudder to imagine what going through Marine training must be like.  But having seen FMJ and R. Lee at work when I was a teenager, I was damned near ready to sign up!  R. Lee is THAT compelling.<br />If you have never heard of R. Lee or if you wonder how this modest ex-Marine, retired after wounds received in the Service, won acclaim as one of Hollywood's most authentic soldier-characters of all time, then you need to see this film.  They should play the first half of FMJ on the buss to Paris Island for all the recruits as a sort of Airline Attendant safety video, preparing them for the crucible that is ahead of them.<br />Without R. Lee Ermey, this movie would be nothing.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Mary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) is a sweet, charming wedding planner with aspirations of being a partner in the firm she works for.  On the job she is hard-working, extremely capable and always has the right solution to every problem that could possibly occur in a large, lavish wedding.  In her private life, she borders on being obsessive-compulsive and has come to terms with the fact that she will probably never marry (which is why she is a wedding planner).  While walking across the street one day, she gets her new Gucci shoe stuck in a drain cover and stoops down to retrieve it.  Meanwhile, a cab has just hit a dumpster that has sent it rolling down the street heading straight for Mary.  Mary sees the oncoming dumpster but refuses to budge without her precious shoe.  Dr. Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey) sees the dumpster rolling toward Mary and, realizing she isn't going to move out of the way, hurls himself at her which sends both of them out of harm's way.  She faints and awakens in the children's ward of St. Vincent's Hospital where Dr. Steve is a pediatrician.  They become acquainted and Mary starts to fall in love with the handsome doctor.  What she doesn't know, but will come to find out, is that Steve is the groom in the largest wedding she has ever planned.  Mary is hired by Francine Donelly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) to plan her wedding.  Mary soon discovers that Fran is engaged to Steve.  She keeps her feelings to herself and continues to plan Steve's and Fran's wedding.  While this is going on, Mary's father (Alex Rocco) makes plans to marry his daughter to her childhood friend, Massimo (Justin Chambers) who, after seeing Mary all grown up, is more than willing to comply.  At first Mary is very cool to the idea of this arranged marriage but realizes that the love of her life is marrying another and this may be the only chance she will have to marry.  She accepts and makes plans for her own wedding.  Steve and Fran are supposed to get married the same dayas Mary and Massimo.  Everyone is where they are supposed to be on the big day and there is a surprising twist that may effect the outcome of both weddings.<br />This is one of my favorite movies!  Is there anything that Jennifer Lopez can't do?  She's beautiful, is an incredible singer, a great dancer, and a good actress as well.  She proves that she can do comedy in this movie and you will fall in love with her character.  As with most romantic comedies, you will pretty much be able to figure out the ending.  However, it's all the funny moments getting there that really makes this movie a winner.  The only fault I can find with the movie is the awful Italian accent that Alex Rocco uses in portraying Mary's father (as the editorial review states).  As a final note, I really like Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Lopez together - I think they have good chemistry.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a really great movie. I watched it a couple of times, and it gets better every time. The movie is pure magic. It's sad that they didn't do a voice-over of it. It's hard to concentrate when you have to read all time and can't really enjoy the wonderfull images of this film.<br />There is one thing more I have to say. There are a lot of people complaining about the \\"sexual\\" content of this movie, and I'm shocked, that it is rated R. Why? You wanna know something? Here in Germany, the movie is rated \\"6\\", that means that everyone from the age of 6 can watch it!! Come on! Don't be so prude! Our children are not walking sex-monsters because of it! ;-)
0790731452|3.0|Tim Burton's halarious cheesy 50's B-moie Sci Fi satire is one of his most abstract and weirdest films since Beetlejuice. Playing like a who's who of Hollywood, the top-notch cast all do the weird thing with their roles, and the invasion of earth by the \\"Ack! Ack!\\" aliens is suitably spectacular. It does have it's moments of slow pacing and some seriously un-funny moments, but it makes up for it simply because of it's frenetic action and wacky humour. Jack Nicholson is the standout guy here, playing the \\"all American\\" President, and Pierce Brosnan shows that he can do something else than Bond, although it sometimes seems like he's wishing he wasn't here. Danny Elfman's terrific score is a clever homage to the old \\"woOoOo\\" music of the old alien invasion films. While it's far from perfect, there are enough genuinley funny moments to make it worth your while. No extras on the DVD.
B000001E21|5.0|Retro active, Def Leppard's compilation album of B-sides totally rocks, the songs are really heavy and the ballads are perfect, Desert song is an awesome opening song with an amazing guitar solo by Steve Clark and cool chorus, the song mostly tells a story about a person trapped in the desert. Fracured love the second song starts off soft but then gets really heavy, really cool song.  Action is a song by a band called Sweet and leppard did a cover version and the song really stands out.  Two Steps Behind is a really nice acoustic ballad that makes you want to sing along with the chorus.  She's Too Tough is another song the band covered and is a fast rocker.  Miss u In a Heartbeat is another really nice piano ballad and there is 3 versions of it on the album, GOD WHY SO MUCH!.  Only After Dark is another cover song the band did, originally recorded by Mick Ronson it is a catchy melodic song. Ride into the Sun is a epic tune on the album, it was the first song the band ever committed to vinyl on their first ep, all they did was change some of the lyrics,but a really hard driving rock song.  From the inside is a folky ballad telling about the pitfalls of herione use, probably the softest song on the album.  Ring of fire is a cool heavy rock song with a really awesome guitar riff, (I wonder if the band got the title from Johny Cash?) I Wanna Be Your Hero is a ballad and a rock song mixed in one, alot like Too Late For Love.  The last two songs on the album are electric versions of Two Steps Behind and Miss u in a heartbeat,both sound great.  Listen for the piano only version of Miss U In a Heartbeat stuck at the very end.
B00001MXXH|4.0|John Hughes' delightful 80s teen comedy is as charming and funny as it was when it was originally released. The story centres around Ferris Bueller, a studnet who decides it's too nice a day to go to school. So he fakes being sick and his friends go off for a big adventure in the city. But the nervy Edward R. Rooney starts to suspect Bueller is faking it, and starts to investigate. Matthew Broderick is excellent as Ferris, portraying a laid-back teenager to superb effect. Nice touches include a Star Wars homage and Ferris' spontaneous musical number in the city, reminiscant of FAME. Aso look out for a Charlie Sheen cameo as a drug guy at the police station. One of the great teen comedies.

B00004Z459|5.0|This cd has easily become one of my favorite cd's. Linkin Park is a very talented band, in any way you look at it. They have not one, but TWO awesome vocalists, one with an eerie and sometimes depressing, but very real voice, and the other with a mix of rock and hip-hop that many bands are adopting these days. Their band is also extremely good, creating the raw and loud sound that this band is all about. I don't dislike one song on this album, not even #11, which is no vocals, just some DJ-like music. The best songs on the CD are Crawling, One Step Closer, and #10, i forget what that song is called. If anyone likes metal, punk, or just plain rock, then I suggest you get this CD...now!

0066620996|1.0|This is another in a long line of  overly simplistic books which purport to identify what all management books purport to identify, namely, what is great management? The conceptual errors here legion:<BR>    Firstly, if such a thing could be put in a little book all companies would be great. <BR>    Secondly, the author starts by singling out and dealing only with the magic 11 fortune 500 companies his huge staff could identify based on earnings growth over the last 15 years, but \\"best\\" really has no meaning in this context. For example, he starts with fortune 500 companies which automatically means they are all the best to begin with given they are the largest companies to have survived among the millions that come and go each year. Don't all fortune 500 companies have tremendous growth of some kind oven some 15 year period in their history? <BR>     Who can say that the magic 11 have great management and GM does not even though GM is huge compared to any of the magic 11? Did Mr. Collins do an experiment to prove his thesis? Without access to the earning numbers can he identify a great company from the million of choices? This guy should be making his money in the stock market rather than by selling books.<BR>     GM is a mature company in a mature market with moddest earning growth, but are they better or worse managers than Microsoft which has enjoyed tremendous earning growth largely because they got into a business they didn't even want (operating systems) that fortunately provided a base on which huge earnings grew. In fact it is a business school axiom that the companies who are the most successful lose to their own arrogance in the end. This is how IBM missed small computers and how GE & RCA missed big computers. <BR>     The team's findings about the importance of good leadership, of choosing the right people, of staying focused on a simple message seems laughable. Had the previous wisdom been that bad leadership was the path the higher earnings?  <br />The author talks about making a commitment, and having passion toward what you are doing in the context of describing how Kimberly Clark turned heroically away from some of its businesses toward what they were passionate about: Kleenex. It clearly seemed that the author could not understand that real passion does not exist toward Kleenex or that you could not attract and motivate talent if you required a passion for Kleenex. Money, prestige, and competence are more likely to motivate managers.<BR>   The research team's findings about the importance of good leadership, of choosing the right people, of staying focused on a simple message seem even worse as the author feebly tries to explain Walgreen's success versus Eckerts, CVS Rite Aid, and the 100s of others that have tried to put simple cookie cutter drug stores on every corner. Didn't the also-rans see what Walgreen was doing? Didn't they hire Walgreen Management, didn't they copy them, and try harder and harder as they desperately sank to 2nd and 3rd and then into bankruptcy? Figuring out why Walgreen won may be a little like figuring why the Beatles won? Perhaps because Paul was so cute, and Walgreens name, logo, colors, and ads were just a tiny bit cuter than the competition. We don't know and never will.<BR>   Circuit City is one of the Magic 11. But, its stock is off 66% so far this year. Who wants to bet it will be included in the next management guru book? IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid were all hailed has having great long term management but they all died (well, almost) because they happened on great products, not great managements. While their products were great, book entrepreneurs made a fortune talking about their managements.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Whenever Dracula in film is discussed, Bela Lugosi's name is mentioned first (rightly, as he first defined the character), but for three generations of viewers, Christopher Lee has been the definitive Count, and this film marked his debut, and best performance!<br />The story is the basic legend; the vampire comes to England and wreaks havoc on two families, until his final confrontation with Van Helsing (Peter Cushing, in one of his greatest Hammer Films portrayals). The cat-and-mouse game between the two leads is brilliant, as Cushing spends most of the film one step behind Lee, trying to repair the damage while pursuing the Prince of Darkness. Lee, himself, is spectacular, his blood-glazed eyes defiant, his lust of flesh and blood insatiable! The film has liberal quantities of 1950's sex and titillation, and truly paved the way for the Vampire film of today.<br />Worth noting is the supporting cast of Hammer Film regulars, particularly Michael Gough (who would achieve fame years later as 'Alfred' in the 'Batman' films), as Arthur Holmwood, who incredulously watches his wife become one of the Undead, and spouts dialogue like \\"How could you SUGGEST such a thing??!!\\" when Van Helsing tells him a stake through the heart is the only option left for her. Campy, yes, but CLASSIC camp!<br />This is one DVD that should be an essential for any Lee, Cushing, or Hammer Film fan, and it is a cause for celebration that it has finally been released in this format.<br />Don't miss it!
B0000640VN|5.0|This movie is incredibly fantastic.  It is a movie you can never get tired of.  Meg Ryan is such a great actress.  It is a movie for ladies and gentlemen.  Hugh Jackman plays a suave, debanair, charming, gentlemen looking for a wife.  Meg Ryan plays a business executive who is single.  The story line is where Leopold lands into the 21st Century and stays with Kate's ex-boyfriend.  Leopold somehow runs into Kate.  Then the love story infolds.  It is such a beautiful movie. After you see this movie you wish that you had a man like Leopold.  (You can go to the Kate and Leopold website to see if your man is a Leopold.)  I would recommend to see this movie!!
B000002GYI|5.0|One of the truly most innovative bands of the last and probably this century. If you did not grow up in the  80's you may find this a bit rough around the edges, but put it in persepctive with what the mainstream was back then, it was either Disco, or Soft Pop...not much of a difference really. <br />Put this on, listen to \\"Pocket Calculator\\" and try to imagine what the world was like when the radio airwaves were full of Donna Summer, REO Speedwagon  and Air Supply. you will begin to feel a bit anxious, but fear not, this is only the beginning! <br />Move on from this one to all essential new wave and industrial..without these quirky, stiff Germans, we may still be hearing \\"You Light Up My Life\\" ..GADS!
B00000AFWW|1.0|THis album should have been called &quot;SHALLOW SKIN&quot;, so false and shallow it is. HOLE was never a band, just the greedy Courtney Love trying (and obtaining!!) more money to her bank account. CELEBRITY SKIN is even wrose than LIVE THROUGH THIS (if that was possible!!)<BR>No wonder the band closed its operations recently. It already fullfilled its purposes: fast money.
B0000214F0|1.0|Some movies are deliberately bad. Some are so deliberately bad that they are funny. This movie is most emphatically not one of them. This movie is execrable, but not deliberately so, and that is the most depressing thing of all. Someone actually thought it was good enough to warrant expending a lot of effort and money. Why else would they go to the trouble of hiring such actors as O'Toole and McDowell? I used to have some respect for Malcolm McDowell before I saw him in this crock of toxic waste. That's safely gone now, of course, but still I wonder why he accepted this role. Was he hard up for cash, or does he simply have no dignity? Or are both true? Either way, it was money ill spent. The acting is a mess, the plot is incomprehensible, the composer is a ... , whoever adapted the screenplay is an incompetent, and there are actually two directors, but all that does is give me one extra person to loathe. The fact that this movie is available on DVD is a testament to something so bad, the word to describe it has yet to be invented.<br />Why was this movie made? There are actually people who bother coming up with intellectual rationalizations for it - id est, \\"Yeah, but this is the way things REALLY WERE!\\" Nonsense. Softcore pornographer Tinto Brass and hardcore pornographer Bob Guccione did not come together one day and decide to direct a realistic historical epic. No, the right answer is the most obvious one and the most difficult one to face - they actually thought this horrible, horrible movie would titillate someone. Let me repeat that to let the horror sink in - they actually thought people would be titillated by a movie which contains a scene in which a man's genitals are severed and thrown to a pair of hounds (and if you think I'm making this up, I only wish I was as naive as yourself). They actually thought people would find eroticism in a movie in which there is not only none of it, but also no pleasure, no joy, in fact not a single human emotion whatsoeveraside from a sort of smug self-satisfaction at one's own disgusting vileness. Not only did they fail as directors, artists and creators, but they failed as human beings. Their movie will be forever appreciated by those who are too creatively, mentally and emotionally bankrupt to find any amusement or pleasure in anything higher than smug, bloated maliciousness, but that still does not justify its having been made.<br />Tragically, their assumption wasn't too far off the mark. For me, the absolute worst came from having to watch this movie with other people. I'm not making any of this up: people around me actually _cheered loudly_ during the rectal fisting scene. Even wilder was their merriment during the scene in which two whores urinate on the corpse of a man who was just tortured to death (which you will also please believe that I am not making up). \\"Cretinous\\" is too weak a word to describe such reactions. Having to watch someone I love be genuinely entertained by this catalogue of disease was one of the most saddening and enraging events that I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing.<br />I can forgive audiences who paid to see this in 1980. Back then, no one yet knew what an atrocity this movie is. But twenty-odd years have passed since then. Now no one has any shred of an excuse to see this movie. As you read this, it is entirely within your power to exercise a very small amount of effort and purchase _any_ other movie. If you pass up the chance to do this, and use your money to buy Caligula instead, I hope I never meet you.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Well, this is trulhy a heavy metal masterpiece. This one, from 1983, is from the time when Maiden did not trapped himself in a self-imposed formula and lost all spontainety and energy. THis is from the time the band recorded a whole bunch of stalwart records, standar classics of heavy metal. The nine tracks here are killers, altough SUN AND STEEL and QUEST FOR FIRE sound as fillers. THis is the debut from Nicko McBrain, a very goo drummer whom, contrary to ex-drummer Clive Burr, never wrote any song for Maidens repertory.
B000002J1X|2.0|Time and a Word is a serviceable rock album, and it's worth a listen if only to see where Yes came from.  However, Time and a Word features Peter Banks on guitar and Tony Kaye on keyboards (as opposed to Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman), and it lacks what made Yes's later albums great (it is also interesting to note that both Banks and Kaye have subsequently either bashed the band's later efforts [Banks] or sued the band [Kaye]).  I bought TAAW hoping to get one or two gems, but I don't think I've listened to it in years.
0517122707|5.0|I loved this book. My reasons? Too many to get into; besides, others have covered them. A work of genius--and that's exactly what the author John Kennedy Toole was in my humble opinion. Too bad he isn't around to see how many people admire and respect this incredible creation of his. His name lives on in his work. As far as the rare negative response here and there:I say too bad for them, because they just don't get it, the same way some people don't get jazz (the greatest music ever invented). It's their loss. Pick up a copy, or give one to a friend. I had to give it five stars. 'Nuff said, as Stan &quot;The Man&quot; Lee used to say.
B00005JKNF|3.0|This movie was very enjoyable even though not much happened until half way through the movie, but that's why Altman directed it and noone else.  Excellent dialouge, excellent cast and one of the best period pieces I have ever seen.  And what about that detective?  Was it just me or was he channeling a little bit of Graham Chapman's Monty Python detective character?
6302924839|5.0|The best acting that Mr. Heston has ever accomplished.  The character of El Cid came alive on the screen with such excitement and realism.  He put his heart in this character, and the result was magic.  A time, a place and a great hero was honored by the choice of Mr. Heston to play this role.  The role was made for him and echoes his own personality amd strength.
B000069HKH|3.0|For all of us springsteen fans upset with the &quot;sound&quot; of the album (i.e. the missing saxophone of Clarence, and the practically nonexistant Bittan on piano) just wait until the tour.  I feel that what is missing on the album will come back to life through the E Street Band's live performance, a sad fact attributable to Brendan O'Brien's horrific overproduction of this album.  How many times can we listen to songs with 10 second intros and then explosions of drum and guitar?  I feel like every song on the Rising does just that.  <br />However, Bruce, in a lyrical sense is at top form... and only two songs on this album I can say are talking totally about September 11.  So why was this album treated as though it were a &quot;Septemeber 11th&quot; album?  <br />All in all, I am not dissapointed, but I am also not overly impressed.
0688170528|5.0|This is the third book I have read by Jody Picoult and she is certainly my favorite author now.  The first was &quot;The Plain Truth&quot;, the second which I could not put down was &quot;Keeping Faith&quot; and now &quot;The Pact&quot;.  All of her books are so completely different, not like some of the same &quot;been there..done that&quot; type book where you can guess the ending.  Her books keep you thinking about the characters and especially the way she ends each of her books.<BR>When I was growing up my mother always told me that in a relationship there is always one person who loves more.  In this book I kept thinking of that when it came to Chris.  This is not a book I will forget quickly.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I don't care if these guys are public school-educated, are dating Amanda de Cadenet, have frizzy 'retro' afros, have rich fathers, live in New York or are the rock and roll saviours of 2002.<BR>I bought this album after listening to 'Soma' and 'Trying Your Luck' in a workmate's MP3 collection. I liked them, listened to them again, then bought the album.<BR>Apart from the aforementioned two tracks, only 'Last Nite' and 'Someday' stand out. And when only four songs stand out in a collection of a mere 40 minute's worth of music, terms like 'rock and roll saviours' only reflect the stagnant state of contemporary music. <BR>But don't get me wrong, the Strokes do what they do in a workmanlike fashion, drums Lust for Lifing, guitars squealing and Casablancas shouting himself hoarse.<br />-=sean=-
B00005JKLZ|3.0|This remake of the classic 1960's film works best when it pays homage to the original H.G. Wells classic and when it delves into the motivations of the hero (played very well by Guy Pearce).  However, some of the more original directions of this flick don't always work.  The leader of the Morlocks, played by Jeffrey Irons in whiteface and fright wig, seems more silly than sinister, while the actors playing the Eloi are pretty much on the blah side in the acting department.  Alan Young, who played the original Filby in the first film, makes a nice little cameo, while Orlando Jones makes the most of his limited screen time.  The special effects are top notch, while alone make this flick an amiable time waster.
0385503954|5.0|This novel is a work of art. The author knows what he's doing. He's created memorable characters, riveting descriptions, a very good plot, and has thoroughly entertained the reader. Strongly recommended. The novel lives!
0517189542|5.0|I've only read it fifty or more times. At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.<br />I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.<br />I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...<br />I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.<br />I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered. But if you've gotten the idea that I love and recommend this book, it serves its purpose.
B000023VR6|4.0|This is a very good album by Dr. Dre with help from his well known friend Snoop Doggy Dog, and Eminem.<BR>The album is extremely good until Eminem comes in and ruin the whole cd. It really is a shame.<BR>But the Cd is a must have in your rap collection.<BR>Enjoy!

B000053VAF|5.0|Entertainment Weekly calls it 1 of the best 10 movies of 1999. I loved this movie. The best movie in the New Jersey Chronicles(Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Clerks Uncensored the animated series, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) all of which were written by Kevin Smith.This movie also has a star cast of Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Florentino, Salma Hayek, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock, and Kevin Smith.<BR>Ok now to give you the plot.  Long ago Bartelby and Loki(Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) talked back to God and were banished to Wisconsin.  Someone has sent them a newspaper clipping in the mail pointing them in the direction of a loop hole to get back in Heaven.  By going into back into Heaven they prove God wrong which would unmake existance.  Bethany(Linda Florentino) a women who works at an abortion clinic and has lost her faith is the only person who can stop them.  The voice of god(Alan Rickman) appears at Bethanys house and tells her she must stop 2 renegade angels and will meet 2 profits.  One of them doesnt speak much but the one that does will mention he is a profit.  There are many other interesting characters that she will meet on her journey.   Now you are wondering, Will Bethany stop them? Who sent the newspaper clipping to the angels? and, Why doesnt God take care of this his/herself?  If you want to find out rent this movie. After seeing it once you know you will want to buy it and watch all the time.  Don't miss out on one of the funniest movies ever made.
B000069HKH|3.0|To coin a phrase made popular by General Motors in their advertising campaign to attract new and younger buyers to their Oldsmobile line of fine cars, &quot;This Is Not Your Fathers Oldsmobile&quot; - &quot;The Rising&quot; is &quot;Not Your Fathers Springsteen Record&quot;.<br />Yes, the E Street Band is back, but you'd never know it if someone didn't tell you. E Street Band songs from the past were full of life and energy. Clarence's saxophone lifted songs of the past into the stratosphere. The songs from &quot;The Rising&quot; are the exact opposite, Dead on Arrival. Where oh where is Clarence's infamous sax playing? Somewhere deep in the background. In fact, it sounds like he's in the closet.<br />&quot;The Rising&quot; is also just too melancholy. Yes, September 11th was a sad day for America, but there is also much to celebrate as well. All those firefighters went up the stairs with STRENGTH, went up the stairs with FAITH, went up the stairs with HOPE, and went up the stairs with LOVE. All of which Springsteen writes lyrics of, but surely such acts of heroism are deserving of a more upbeat song than what &quot;INTO THE FIRE&quot; delivers.<br />I'd rather have &quot;My Fathers Oldsmobile&quot; and I'd rather listen to &quot;My Fathers Springsteen Records&quot;, &quot;GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK&quot;, &quot;THE WILD, THE INNOCENT, AND THE E STREET SHUFFLE&quot;, &quot;BORN TO RUN&quot;, &quot;DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN&quot;, they were all great!<br />&quot;The Rising&quot; is worth a listen, but that's about all it's worth. It's not a very good E Street Band recording. It's not a very good Bruce Springsteen composition. It's not a very good dedication to 9/11. In fact, about the only thing it's good for is making the listener depressed.<br />I've had the opportunity to help rebuild the damaged subway system that is scheduled to re-open by 9/11/2002 and am very proud of the efforts put forth to move forward. If the New Yorkers can do it, why shouldn't Bruce.The time has come to rebuild and preservere, not dwell in Bruce Springsteens house he calls &quot;The Rising&quot;!<br />SORRY! That's what I think.

[Oh Yeah, It's Christmas Eve and the grand high POOBAH of Packaging has to zip off to another place to fix a shipping center. Hey, if you ain't fixed it by now much less by Dec 1, you are in deep, deeep Doodoo.]<BR>I nominate this movie for the WWTT award... What WERE They Thinking.

0451528018|5.0|And I can't thing of any higher praise to give this superb story.  It is without a doubt the greatst detective mystery story ever told.  The characters are memorable, it is Sherlock Holmes after all, and Watson.  But the images are magical, the Moores are just so mysterious in their descriptions and their mystery is overhwleming when someone looks out over them, peering through a thick fog, listening for the howl of the hound.  A masterpiece that gets my highest recommedation.
0783225970|5.0|This film is about the rise and fall of Cuban refugee Tony Montana who came to Miami in the early 80's. Pacino is great, as are all the actors. The film is shot in typical 80's style. The film keeps you interested from beginning to the end. The finish where Montana comes to his end perhaps can be considered one of the best filmed endings amongst gangster films.

6305232660|5.0|First things first. If you want action, don't see this movie. Go rent Armageddon with it's static characters and predictable plot.<br />To tell the truth this is the most moving disastor movie I've ever seen. It seems every charachter gives a powerhouse performance. This was a relief after watching the charachters in Armageddon make jokes just when Earth was supposed to be destroyed. The cast includes the ever-great Morgan Freeman, superb Robert Duvall, newcomer Tea Leoni, and screen favorite Vanessa Redgrave. A lot of movies try too crowd too many good actors into a story line, with awful results. Somehow this one works. All the characters are believable. And you care about them. Morgan Freeman is painful to watch at times, he performs so well.<br />People die in this movie. But you feel though through their sacrifice, hope will prevail. It different from Armaggedon. I felt that they killed charachters off in that movie to either keep the plot going, or because they had already served their purpose. Deep Impact is more realistic though, I gurantee that by the time it's over, there won't be a dry eye in the house.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Room For Squares has got to be one of the best albums released in the last few years.  The catchy tunes are topped off with neat lyrics which make John Mayer stand out from modern lyricists.  He gives his best in this record and after a few listens the songs seem very familiar: the signs of a great songwriter.  The music is crafted for the song is not over the top at all.  In fact, in a few parts he seems to be holding back from telling the whole story both musically and lyrically.  This makes the CD's listenablilty unique, especially compared to other similar pop artists.  To get the full story of John Mayer, seem him live.  The CD is nice but his live performance is awesome.  Either way, the way at which Room For Squares was crafted is something special that everyone can appreciate.
B00003CWN3|5.0|The film is shocking. It's uncomfortable to watch because all during the film we know of Brandon's oncoming fate. And when it comes we see her courage, as we witness one of the disturbing and unbearable scenes ever filmed. All the actors are wonderful. Especially Hillary Swank who actually becomes Brandon in an un-apologetic performance. It is one of the best acting jobs ever. Cheers to the director for not trying to explain the complexities of why Brandon is the way she is. Also cheers for not making the movie sappy, or sympathetic. Instead we get a brutal, un-flinching look at a true story, and a movie that as time passes by will be considered among the most powerful ever made.
B00006690G|5.0|Well,  ..., a local radio station played it for us two weeks before its release, allowing me to have a full copy in advance.  I was amazed at this cd.  Better than expected~ highly recommend.2), and Superman (track 13).  However, the whole CD is worth listening to, or, dare I say, purchasing?ich I say \\"bull feathers\\". Sure, there's the occasional mandatory cliche-filled sex ballad, but they're still done humorously. Don't think the whole CD's about the same things as before just because you heard the first single and first couple tracks. Really, the only thing I didn't like was the skits. Ken Kaniff's appearance was nowhere near as funny as it should have been, since his skits on the first two CD's are gut-bustingly hilarious and he was missing on D-12's album. \\"The Kiss\\" is pretty funny but should have been a whole song, like \\"Kim\\". If it would have replaced the only track I skip, (Say What You Say...blah, Dre is boring even if he helped Eminem get where he is now) this would be a 5-star CD.
0316666343|5.0|Coming of age stories have long been considered poignant and heart breaking leaving the readers with messages far greater than those found in books about adult experiences.  Consider the following older titles, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Catcher in the Rye, The Temple of Gold by William Goldman or more recently Ellen Foster, Durable Goods and Bastard Out of Carolina.  Now consider the eloquent first novel, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold who introduces us to the character of Susie Salmon.  Susie, a 14 year old, was raped and murdered and in one of the most innovative plots in recent years narrates her story from heaven.  And before you say, Oh no, this book sounds morbid and not for me, let me be the first to say I never thought I would read this book, let alone enjoy it.  And now that Ive finished this title, I cant wait to let some time elapse and then rereading it for more thoughts on this book.<br />Susie Salmon is the oldest of three children living in a suburban Pennsylvania community.  Somewhat of a loner, before her death, Susie dreams that high school will change her life measurably. Susie is bright beyond her years and exhibits a unique curiosity and great wit even while relating incidents about her family from heaven.  Walking home from school one day, Susie is lured away by someone she knows and then meets her violent death.  From this point on till the end of the book, Susie relates the effect her death has on her parents, siblings and grandmother.  She watches as her parents cope with the preliminary news and then ensuing investigation while Susies body is never found.  We watch along with Susie as their lonely neighbor, Mr. Harvey is scrutinized and questioned although never arrested or charged.  We observe Susies friends, Paul the shy Indian student initially accused of the murder and Ruth who is able to communicate with Susie.  And our hearts ache as Susies younger sister Lindsey finds friendship and ultimately love during the years after this event, their brother Buckley grows up never really knowing Susie and their grandmother becomes a vital part of a family she hardly knew.  But most of all we cry as Susies father never gives up trying to find out what happened to Susie and her mother who most leave the family in order to rejoin them at a later time.<br />Sebolds writing is candid, poignant and heart rendering.  There are passages that took my breath, found me sighing away and reduced me to tears particularly the last two pages.  And her sense of irony at the end is more than worth the journey.  I truly think this is a must be read book.  The author, herself a rape victim has the rare gift of exploring what must be one of the most difficult events in a famiilys life making it enticing and ultimately a most rewarding read.uring the years after this event, their brother Buckley grows up never really knowing Susie and their grandmother becomes a vital part of a family she hardly knew.

038533558X|5.0|I first became acquainted with the name Harlan Coben when I  signed onto an Internet book list several years ago.  At that time many of the readers were touting Coben's series, which featured Myron Bolitar, the feisty sports agent/private investigator. Although I never read any of these books, it was the premise of Coben's recent stand alone book, Tell No One, which interested me enough to read.  Literally gulping down this book, I looked forward to either reading the first book in the Bolitar series or another stand alone by this author.  And suddenly there was news of a new book, Gone for Good, which found me snatching it from the shelves the first day it appeared.  Now, I consider Harlan Coben one of my favorite thriller/mystery author and I do look forward to making the acquaintance of Myrom Bolitar shortly.<br />Gone for Good is set in and around Manhattan and the suburban community of Livingston, NJ.  Life in Livingston is presumably idyllic where children grow up thinking the world is theirs.  But this isn't the case for the ----------family.  Eleven years ago the oldest son Ken was accused of brutally murdering Julie Rogers, a neighbor and his brother's one time girlfriend.  Feeling from the scene and his family, and while there have been unconfirmed sightings of him in different countries the family chooses to believe he is dead.  That is until Sunny, Ken' smother dying from cancer tells her son Will that Ken is still very much alive.  With nothing more than these words and then a revealing photo and also realizing that Sunny was on heavy medication before her death, Will decides this might be just enough to find out in fact if his brother is till alive.  And while the plot certainly takes off from here, it certainly escalates when Will's girlfriend leaves him a cryptic note and then disappears leaving reader's to wonder if there is any connection between Sheila and Ken. And now the twist and turns come so fast and furiously that as you rush through the pages, you need to pay serious attention to the plot to keep up.<br />For all of the reasons I really enjoyed this book, not the least of them are Coben's wonderful characters.  Beginning with Will and his family, we meet Ken's two old school buddies The Ghost and Phil McGuane, both violent men who will stop at nothing to protect themselves or their interests.  We also meet Squares, a one time racist now turned Yoga guru who is more brother to Will than friend.  From the seamier side of Manhattan, we meet Wanda, a transvestite who leads Will to Sheilah's former boss, Louis Castleman, an unsavory man who is now a quadriplegic and is care for by Wanda.  And as we meet these characters We walk the mean streets of Manhattan and the tree lined streets of Livingston where Will and his father spend time reminiscing about Little League games, Ken and their family life.<br />This book is a hair-raising roller coaster of a read, which never lets up or disappoints the reader.  Imbued with family values the book also explores the themes of friendship, loyalty and betrayal.<br />The ending can best be described as both shocking and poignant. From the first page to the last, you will be riveted and when the book ends you'll wish you were starting it for the first time.<br />Sorry I must hurry but I must get to the bookstore to pick up Deal Breaker, the first book in the Bolitar series.  Writing this review has left me with a yearning to return to the books by Harlan Coben.pages, you need to pay serious attention to the plot to keep up.<br />For all of the reasons I really enjoyed this book, not the least of them are Coben's wonderful characters.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|Blade 2 was diffenetly a movie that shot down the theory that sequels are worse then the first movie.  Again Snipes went above and beyond during the fight scenes in this movie.  It was interesting to see how the directors were able to establish moves from the wwf(or now, the wwe, and bring those moves into blade.  I thought the bad guys in this movie were the best, and my hat comes off to the make-up artists.  All in all, Blade 2 was a great movie, with awesome action scenes, tight bad guys, and a good plot.
0767817478|5.0|...For you readers who have any common sense or dignity left in their bodies, I highly reccomend this movie. The characters are funny, and VERY WELL ESTABLISHED. The acting is very good, so is the animation. And there is plot- a fairly detailed one! If anyone doesn't like it, then I suggest you people stop watching movies and go get a life!! Sorry, but this is a great film. It features a very well written script and excellent character interaction. The music is also very, very well done. This beats the heck out of the old movies- although the old movies did introduce the concept. What I can't understand is why Godzilla 2000 came out. Ok, I know you like to stick to the classic stuff, but in today's day and age it looks like [stuff]!<BR>By the way they are planning on a sequel, I don't know when filming is going to begin though.
B000069HKH|5.0|It's been a long time between Classic Springsteen Albums; there seems to be something missing when he doesn't have his crew (The E-street Band) behind him.<br />But he certainly delivers with this one. A few of the tracks (Let's Be Friends + My City Of Ruins) have a haunting feeling about them and two tracks (Countin' On A Miracle + Further On) just Cook!!!<br />With a new producer, Brendan O'Brien (Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine), we can credit his collaborator with speeding up of the Bosses recording process.<br />I hope you all enjoy this Album as Much as I have, and I cannot wait till he hits the road and comes \\"Down Under\\".
B000069HKH|5.0|This is a fantastic album put together by a band that just doesn't quit. Of course it is tied together with the lyrical genius of Mr. Springsteen (pronounced Boss, once again), whose delivery of the same in anthemic fashion, provides serious music that makes for an engaging listening experience. The first three tracks provide for a view of the album as a whole in that they progress through the whole spectrum of both pace and intensity of the music. Although the album harkens back to \\"Born in the U.S.A.,\\" this album stands out, particularly because of underlying tribute to 9/11. The E-Street Band brings it all in this effort, and you won't be disappointed with the purchase. Buy it and enjoy.
0385501560|5.0|This book, like the three titles that preceeded it, is a master work of sarcasm and darkness.  While my least favorite of his four books, Choke stands out as the most shocking and the most real.  More than ever, Palahniuk's characters feel as though they could exist in the real world and are forced to deal with society.  Through hate, sex, and insanity, he explores the question, \\"What would Jesus not do?\\"<BR>Amazing book, certainly a MUST READ.
6302989787|4.0|this is a pretty good movie that revolves around a Secret Service man who is haunted down by an assassin out to get the President of the United States. Eastwood's character was a Secret Service agent that was there the day JFK was killed, but he did nothing, and how Malchovich is trying to kill the President and leave Eastwood as the only Secret Service man to be involved in the death's of 2 Presidents.<br />good overall movie, but then the last half hour or so just gets to corny and it almost ruins the movie. you already know what is going to happen, but in the matter or way that it happens is corny.<br />still a good movie.
0140177396|4.0|This little gem of a book should be the de facto standard for a novel. Conscise yet detailed, moving and profound. Nobody makes me sappy eyed like Steinbeck. Definately 3.5 kleenex out of 5. For more kleenex mileage, try Grapes of Wrath.

B00005JG6Q|2.0|I watched this film based mostly on the glowing... reviews of it.  As a huge sci-fi fan, but with minimal exposure to Japanese anime, I was prepared to really enjoy it.  I thought.<br />The fact is I just never found the hook with this film.  There were a lot of individual moments that I enjoyed, but I did not find an appeal in the film as an overall composition.  The motorcycle chases were great, as was the idea of Neo-Tokyo.  However, the characterization was somewhat two dimensional.  I did not find myself really caring too much about many of the characters.  And both the female and male characters mostly looked like boys.<br />I think if the film had stuck to the motorcycle gang storyline without moving to the mutant children / Akira line it might have held my interest further.  I just found the Akira story line to be too ambiguous and, frankly, corny.<br />It's not my intention to \\"burn\\" this film with this review.  I just think anime may not be for me.  The truth is that I don't really care for the animation style all that much.  Based on very slight exposure, I think the genre is given to high action content storylines involving supernatural/fantasy elements that one either loves or doesn't love.<br />I didn't hate this film.  But I have little desire to ever see it again.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this album! At first, I didn't care for Avril's song Complicated. But then, after hearing it over and over again. I started to like it more and more. Then, this is what it led me too. Buying this cd, and man, was I happy with it! <br /> Losing Grip- 9.5/10 Has a catchy chorus, rock!<br /> Complicated- 9/10 An awesome song that you can't get tired of, rock!<br /> Skaer Boi- 10/10 The best song on the album. If Blink 182 had done it, it would still be good! Mind you, this is pretty simple guitar! Still, a catchy tune, rock song!<br /> I'm With You- 9/10 She really shows off her talented voice in this one, good effort, pop!<br /> Mobile- 9/10 A great song, catchy and upbeat, rock!<br /> Unwanted- 8.5/10 Sounds like Alanis Morissette(who is one of my least favourite singers), but the chorus is so catchy, that I don't mind listening to this, rock!<br /> Tomorrow- 9.5/10 A great slow song, she knows what she's doing here, pop.<br /> Anything But Ordinary- 9/10 Well, what can I say? She's anything but ordinary, a great song. is it enough? lol, rock<br /> Things I'll Never Say- 9.5/10 One of my all time favourites, so catchy! I love it!! pop<br /> My World- 10/10 Great song! About her, obviously! Grew up in 5,000 population town, now that's small! Rock<br /> Nobody's Fool- 10/10 Wow! I love the verses to this song! there awesome, it's not rap! How's that rap? More like talking to me, but it's awesome! The chorus ain't so great, but, what can you do! Punk<br /> Too Much Too Ask- 9/10 Well, pretty good effort! pop<br /> Naked- 9/10 Great song!<br /> Well, overall, I was happy with this album! Songs like Skaer Boi, My World and Things I'll Never Say, are some of the best songs I've heard in my life. Plus, Nobody's Fool and the one and only Complicated, are great songs! So, buy this cd! You'll enjoy it! It's due to be the best album of 2002, out of my opinion!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is angry,sad,self defeating,self boasting,very <BR>moody and brilliant.Stan,Kim,Under The Influence,Amityville,<BR>Kill You,Who Knew  and Criminal are as rewarding as they are <BR>disturbing and infuriating to listen to.Thats what makes <BR>Eminem a true artist he makes you feel like he is actually <BR>singing from your point of view instead of his.<BR>The music is brilliant and Eminem is the real deal.He<BR>defends the 1st ammendment and is very entertaining as well<BR>as very disturbing and even at times irritating.A must hear.
0064471837|5.0|this book is amazing.  Every page has something on.  There is not one boring page to skip in the entire book.  I thought the descriptions were wonderful and the story extremely tense.  Normally this kind of book would have gagged me and I wouldn't have read it--I mean walking dead?  It's just not my kind of thing to read but this book was overwhelming with its beauty even though some of the subject stuff was creepy.
B00005NWM3|4.0|So this band isn't original... who cares? Sorry to inform you all but pretty much everything has been done before. Theres no mix of metal, grunge, blues or anything else left; unless you want to start a country-rap band, then be my guest. I'm sure it will sound great....<br />Anyway, like I said, this is a good cd, plain and simple. Some of the tracks are quite grungy, which is good in my opinion. My favorite tracks are &quot;Look What Your Money Bought&quot;, &quot;Just For&quot;, and &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot;.
B000060P79|5.0|i think simple plan rocks! they are much better then blink and more original then new found glory. They have more of a unique sound then other punk rock bands and im absoloutly obsessed with them!!
B000068PQ0|4.0|I find it amusing that so many of the negative reviews provide reasons such as:  no guitars, drum programming, its soft - no noise, etc..  I would also surmise that these folks believe themselves to be truly open minded (they *are* Lips fans, aren't they?).  Open-minded these people are not and nor do they provide solid reasons for less consideration of this music.  <br />This album is unbelievably melodic, dense, layered, and interesting.  Listen to it with headphones - you will be amazed.<br />It doesn't matter how the music is made or with what tools.  It only matters that it is great music.  Open-up yourself to this album.  <br />Cheers!
B000069HKH|5.0|Almost a year post 9/11, I needed this music.  The Rising, in Bruce's poetic voice, helps me to process the horror, shock, and utter sense of loss I feel in our &quot;never-will-be the same&quot; world.<BR>I love the way he merges different voices(the departed heroes, the loved ones left behind, and even the suicide bombers.) As I listen, I cry once again, but these are tears that bring a catharsis.  Thanks,Bruce for the tone of hope, recovery, and rising above. This the essence of the American spirit: we can be at our best in the worst of situations.
B000007T1M|4.0|I don't typically like nu metal bands because I really don't feel like all that beat'n rap'n scream'n is music but as for this cd. These guys pull of this wonderful energy and dynamic time signature change and they do this wierd high pitched-to-heavy thing where they play the riff really high and then shift the same notes over to heavy as hell axe work higher up on the neck. Its all definately worth a look even if they are besieged by teens and lumped in the same pile with stink'n park.

0897500482|4.0|whether your art is karate, kung fu, or even shoot fighting, this will be a helpful tool.  The philosophy in this book is brilliant.  Principles and concepts of jeet kune do will enhance any art from tae kwon do to vale tudo.  I was a bit disappointed that very little of the book was dedicated to grappling and the book's principles on grappling aren't as helpful, but besides that this book is a hell of a buy.  If you want my opinion though, you shouldn't use this book as a full training guide, but rather, as a supplement to your art.  If you don't study a martial art yet then look at jeet kune do as....well, street fighting but with form.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I saw this movie months ago, and I couldn't help instantly fell in love with it.<BR>Billy Elliot, a young talented boy, has the love in ballet, although couldn't obtain his father's support but he still keeps the faith. This is something in the reality people used to lack of. We have a goal, but confront with obstacles, and we give it up. I really learned a lot from Billy Elliot.<BR>In addition, Billy's father although seems to be a callous man, but in fact we can eventually know that he loves his little boy so deeply, that he's willing to do any sacrifice to give Billy the opportunity.<BR>And the teacher, Julie Walters, does her job so well, keen to give Billy a good training, meanwhile can also listen to Billy's heart, give Billy not only ballet skills, but also a tender and warm care.<BR>I was really moved by this hardly seen very nice movie, and I know you must will also love it. Its music is also a masterpiece, I even bought its OST, and listen to it over and over again.<BR>Buy this DVD, it will not waste any penny you give!
B00005ASGG|5.0|The 'man' who shot Liberty Valance indeed. A man who lived a lie and reaped all the benefits and esteem, much like Bill Clinton and the Kennedy family. The great John Wayne lost the girl, his ranch, and his manhood by allowing a nerdy little Jimmy Stewart to survive a shotout with dead shot Lee Marvin.<br />Jimmy plays the geek to the max. \\"You were gonna shoot him! And you were going to shoot him! Over one measly steak! I'll pick it up!!\\" He's just a gangly lanky lawyer boy from back east who's convinced he can conquer the West single handedly with a law book and a fancy law degree.<br />The fat sheriff is a pathetic John Madden lookalike. I feel so sorry for him. His buffoonery and incompetance drips all over him like the sweat pouring out of his fat head and belly.<br />The chick is pretty hot. She works at the restaurant where her Swedish parents spend their days filling the ranch hand bellies full of steak. Of course the fat sherriff get's his 'off the cuff'.<br />The true star and hero of this movie is of course Lee Marvin. All he wanted to do was make the West a better place for big ranches and rich landowners. So what if he had to kill, rob, and steal in the street. He was only trying to make a living. He wanted to run as a representative for the territory, but the town wouldn't allow him to follow his dreams of public service.<br />I say God Bless Liberty Valance. He was a good man, a strong man, a man who didn't deserve to die in the street, and have Jimmy take the credit.<br />.....and remember, this could get worse than the sheep wars!!!!!
038533348X|5.0|If you like the writing style of Kurt Vonnegut, then this is the book for you.  It is very light and quirky with some deep underlying social commentary.<br />If you have never read Mr. Vonnegut's works beofre, this is a great one to get started with.  It is short and is very interesting - it will definately keep you reading.<br />If you're new to Kurt Vonnegut, this is the one to start with.<BR>Other great reads by Kurt Vonnegut include &quot;Siren's on Titan&quot; and &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; - Check those out next.
0679722610|3.0|Despite what Europeans say, Americans do have a culture all their own. This is proven by the existence of our own myths, legends, tall tales, archtypes. One of our most repeated myths which you will see repeated in fictions of all kinds, be it films or books, is that of the law coming to tame an uncivilized society. It is merely a shadow of that oldest of myths, namely, of gods giving laws to humans. In Red Harvest, a detective known as the Continental Op is the law, and much like Gods of old, he punishes those who transgress. <br />The Continental Op has been summoned to Personville (also known as Poisonville to those in the know) but when he gets there his client has been murdered. His client's father, a local business bigwig named Elihu Willsson, hires him to clean up the town. You see, to prevent unionization of his companies, he called in all sorts of criminal elements to brutally supress them, whether through hook or crook, or just plain murder. But after doing their job, Elihu cannot just politely ask them to leave. So he offers the Op money to get rid of them any way he can. Out of a sense of outrage, justice, or just plain bloodlust, the Op accepts. <br />This novel almost seems a horror novel to me. There's a lot of blood, lots of murder, and the characters are all creepy and grotesque. For example, one character is described as \\"a bow-legged man with a long jaw like a hog's\\". At one point in the bloodshed, the Op talks about \\"going out to feed\\" as though he is a vampire who feeds on violence. It reminds me of the demonic descriptions of Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon. There's something very unsettling in Dashiell Hammett's books. Like H.P. Lovecraft's stories, you always sense some monster moving underneath the prose that might burn your eyes out if you saw it full on. <br />Having said this, except for that feeling of disturbance, Hammett is not the great writer that he is cracked up to be. From the 3 works I have read of his, he's not that much betteror worse than the typical contemporary crime writer. His characters seem pretty blank and empty but this actually helps out the stories which usually involve the most animalistic motives. It is an interesting experience to read his books, but I don't know if it's a rewarding or entertaining one. I guess if you want to feel unsettled, ill at ease, check his work out. If you like Red Harvest, there are two other books featuring the same character, The Continental Op, and The Dain Curse. In the end I am more impressed by this author's influence on American myth than the actual bones of his writing.
B00005OAIE|4.0|If I can put it in a nutshell, this guy is unique.  He is just being himself and not what the industry wants him to be.  This is the quality I like about him...<br />&quot;No Such Thing&quot; caught me early one Saturday morning when I fell asleep in front of VH1.  The melody and the chorus is what really stirred me.  His guitar licks get you going in gear.  Imagine that waking you up on Saturday morning...<br />&quot;Room for Squares&quot; will be a classic...
B000002MIB|3.0|The album is a fun listen if you're ready to rock in a not-too-serious fashion.  The production is big, reverb-heavy arena rock style.  I'd like to hear the band put out some live stuff with a more \\"intimate\\" feel and, yes, such things are quite possible even if the band is playing arenas.  It's not like they distant mic these live recordings or anything.<br />The setlist is WAAYYYY too heavy on the For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge album.  As in, all but 2/3 songs of the album are played!  I know they were supporting that album, but how about a nicer mix of material?  And the DLR years are, not too surprisingly, given just a parting glance - just three songs off of only two albums.<br />The band does play well though.  Sammy sounds as good as ever.  I'm not his biggest fan, but he delivers on this album.  I could've done without the \\"I want some P***Y!!!!\\" scream during \\"Finish What You Started,\\" though.  It's great to hear Eddie play and Michael and Alex sound great too.<br />All in all, a fun album that you can pick up VERY CHEAP used.  Go ahead.  It's not perhaps what it could have been, but it's good anyway.
B0000047EC|3.0|If you like quiet, introspective, slow, airy, brooding, precisely constructed bass and guitar duets, then you'll love this album. If, on the other hand, you prefer music with joie de vivre, then this baby will put you to sleep.<br />I received \\"Missouri Sky\\" as a gift, and dutifully listened to it a half-dozen times, pretending it was satisfying in some way, but finally admitted I was bored and traded it in.<br />The recent Haden/Rubalcaba collaboration, \\"Nocturne,\\" is similarly subdued, but much more interesting.
0446608955|4.0|I bought this book before going to see the movie. So I could conpare the two, and I'd have a clue as to what's going on during the film. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It's a very easy to follow book that I really enjoyed reading. It's a bitter-sweet love story. I've read this book several times, and I love it so much that I can actually sit down, and read it within a days time. I recommend this book if you enjoy reading about love.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie was great.  The best part about it?  The emphasis was on the story, not the special effects.  I have loved Spiderman since my youth and this was a great film adaptation.  It didn't vary much off the real thing, something that annoyed me about the X-MEN movie.  The biggest change, and I think something that improved Spiderman, was the idea of letting Peter have web that came out of himself just like a real spider.  That has always been the most annoying thing about the comic.  \\"Oops, I ran out of web.\\"<br />I can hardly wait until the DVD is released and until the next movie.
B000067CPX|5.0|Aiiight, so lemme break it down for you.  I was an avid fan of Alt. Rock back in the day and the Peppers were definitely one of my fav. bands.  BSSM blew me away!  I then switched genres... getting into UG hiphop, electronica, reggae, etc.  Then, this gem came along.  This is one of those albums that makes me excited once again about rock music.  Each and every song left me saying yeah, gimme more!  After BSSM, the Peppers then went on to release 2 more fair albums... One Hot Minute and Californication which had some good cuts, but they were by no means solid albums.  Now, 2002... the Peppers sound good as ever, this is as good as BSSM and that's saying a lot!  Anthony sounds sooo good on this album, this is truly his album to shine as a vocalist.  He uses his voice so well to ride along the melodies.  To pick out a favorite is VERY difficult as this SOLID album has lots of moments but I gotta say it has to be &quot;Don't Forget Me&quot; which I truly believe is one of the best rock songs ever written.  Don't sleep on this!  Rock is alive and well... thanks guys!
6304698658|5.0|This DVD is wonderful!  This past weekend, my husband and I  watched it, and even though we had seen it before on television, seeing it unedited brought on even more gales of laughter.
B000069HKH|3.0|After reading Kurt Loder's RS review, I was really pumped for this album.  I guess when you consider that 99% of the new releases these day are complete garbage, this does stand out.  Though, this release does not compare on the same level as Born In the USA, Darkenss at the Edge of Town, or The River.  I really wanted to make this album a steady listen, but it's not going to happen.  I'm not a huge enough fan to think at every note is pure genius.  I sincerely hope there will be a true BS & The E-Street Band released in the future.
B00000295A|4.0|This is not Jamiroquai's best CD.  The 2 best Jamiroquai CD's are Travelling Without Moving and Return of the Space Cowboy.  I just bought this so I could say I own every Jamiroquai CD.  There are some solid songs on here though.  \\"If I Like It, I Do It\\" is good, and so is \\"Too Young To Die\\".  \\"When You Gonna Learn\\" and the title track are both okay songs too.  This is really for of a jazz album, while the rest of Jamiroquai's album are sort of a mix between R&B/funk/disco/soul.  Basically, if you're looking for the usual Jamiroquai sound, you will probably be disappointed with this.  If you just want some smooth music though, definitely consider this album.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is an excellent movie...It as great animation, funny jokes and keeps you entertained there was really no flaws in the movie.....I absolutley love it.
B000056K04|2.0|In an article from Rolling Stone magazine, Carter Beauford said this about Everyday:<br />&quot;My creativity, my expertise, as well as that of the other guys in the band, was smothered. The record didn't need us.&quot;<br />I couldn't agree more.  This album lacks the jam sessions and creative stick/sax/violin work that the band is known for.  It's basically just an overpowering Dave Matthews on electric guitar.  Over the last couple of years I have desperately tried to like this album, but to no avail.  There are, however, a couple of exceptions.  &quot;When the World Ends&quot; is a real cool song, and if it hadn't been for 9/11 would have been a big radio hit.  The title track &quot;Everyday&quot; is a knock-off of #36, otherwise known as &quot;Honey, Honey&quot; (or for the diehard fan, the song was originally &quot;Hani, Hani&quot;).  But the rest of the album is nothing more than dirty pop and thrives on the term &quot;sell-out&quot;.
B00005JLDW|2.0|That one word just about sums up the whole movie. Christian Bale did some excellent acting and Matthew McConaughey looked good, but that's also about all there is to say. The director or writer, or whomever was in charge, could have done so much and gone in so many directions, but they did not. I thought, while watching the film, WOW, what will happen next?! Unfortunetly though, the movie was predictable and the plot went nowhere.<br />The few good things I can say, are that the special effects were amazing, and like I said, Christian Bale did an OUTSTANDING job acting.<br />So please, save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD or video.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld is the greatest show ever, bar none. Just think of the number of phrases it has added into our everyday lives, phrases like yada yada, high talker, fast talker, low talker, regifter, master of my domain, etc. The extras that could be added on, outtakes, commentary, etc, along with the outstanding quality of the show itself could make a Seinfeld DVD set one of the greatest TV-DVD transfers ever.
6305169187|5.0|\\"Armageddon\\", featuring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Steve Buscemi, and Billy Bob Thornton, deals with a runaway asteroid that is on a collision course with earth.  The only way to destroy the asteroid is to drill down into it and plant a nuclear warhead inside to blow it up.  Enter Willis, the owner of an offshore drilling rig, Tyler, his daughter, and Affleck, an employee of Willis' who is in love with Tyler, much to the disgust of Willis.  Willis is regarded as the best offshore driller in the world.  Thus, he is summoned by Thornton to help destroy the rogue asteroid.  Willis and his band of misfits are sent to NASA to undergo space training in preparation for liftoff into space aboard 2 space shuttles.  The object is to land on the asteroid itself, drill the hole, plant the bomb, and escape before it detonates.  One shuttle is lost, but Willis and his crew manage to land on the asteroid and drill the hole.  However, there is a malfunction with the bomb, and the only way to detonate it is manually, so someone must stay behind and sacrifice themselves for the good of the earth.<br />There are some neat moments in the film, such as the group singing \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane\\" and the actual space scenes are good as well. Steve Buscemi's character was my favorite.  I enjoyed his wise-cracking remarks and cynical views throughout the film. This is a good action packed, fun film to watch more than once.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|When Enrique Iglesias released his first album, I simply thought he was taking advantage of his father's celebrity to earn a success he did not actually deserve. Therefore, I systematically refused to listen to any of his songs (which was hard considering his singles were continuously on the radio). In fact, one could say that not liking his music was like a precept for me.<BR>However, last year, I was listening to the radio and the single \\"Hero\\" started playing. Although I knew he was the one singing it, it simply moved me in a way I could not avoid. So, after almost four months trying to fight it, I finally decided to buy the cd, telling myself that I would only listen to that one song... and that's what I did... until, last month, I decided to give the rest of the album a try. I was really impressed. Even in the cd's by artists I really love, I usually have to skip at least half of the songs in order to get to the ones I actually enjoy... Not with \\"Escape\\". I love every single song. The sensuality of Enrique Iglesias's voice, in perfect concordance with the words, in my opinion, lead this artist to have a unique style. I really don't understand those who compare him to artists like Marc Anthony and Ricky Martin. In fact, I actually see him more as an American than as a Latin singer. Yet, there is a Latin touch in every song (except \\"Hero\\") that gives his work a very special character. <BR>I would definitely recommend you to give this album a try. You won't be disappointed.
B000040OBS|5.0|What an incredible piece of work this is: absolutely unique, unprecendented and terrifying, without any pretensions or sense of compromise. For a band merely consisting of a singer and a guy with a beat-up old keyboard plugged into a few distortion pedals, Suicide in 1977 truly made one of rock'n'roll's all-time essential albums.<br />Released at the height of the NYC punk explosion of the late '70s (though the band - Alan Vega and Martin Rev - pre-dated it by a good 5 years), &quot;Suicide&quot; made many stroke their heads in confusion, though won over just as many with its bizarre, minimalist take on punk rock'n'roll, seemingly a mixture of whiter-than-white Velvets/Stooges rock churn, Taylor/Monk avant-garde jazz and the two-note repetitive glory of LaMonte Young and Terry Riley.<br />Much to its credit, &quot;Suicide&quot; is more than just noise and screaming; what stands out here are the SONGS. &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; is the ultimate slab of white-line-fever trance-rock; &quot;Cheree&quot; is almost like a punker update on '50s doo-wop weepies; &quot;Johnny&quot; is pure electro-Elvis; and the epic &quot;Frankie Teardrop&quot; is a chilling ride through a hopeless life I hope not to experience. What made Suicide so special was their ability to melt technology with a totally HUMAN aesthetic, allowing even boring &quot;rock purists&quot; to enjoy their keyboard-driven sounds.<br />To cut a long story short, this excellent reissue (nice info-filled booklet and all) features two essential bonuses: six songs recorded live at CBGBs ca. 1977, and the infamous &quot;23 Minutes Over Brussells&quot; show from '78, a riot-inducing spectacular of frightening proportions.<br />Suicide strangely developed a strong following amongst foppish UK lightweights like Depeche Mode, OMD and Human League, though to get a more accurate picture of where they were coming from, let's put it this way: if you're at all partial to the likes of worthy racketeers like the Stooges, ThrobbingGristle, Neu!, Albert Ayler or Lou Reed ca. &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;, then Suicide's first album is just about the most sensible purchase you could possibly make.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out because I really liked the song &quot;Get the Party Started.&quot; I also have her first cd and loved it so I figured I would try this one out as well.  When I heard the rest of the cd, WOW, it is amazing.  I think it is so awesome that a 22 year old can write such personal stuff and put it on a cd.  To me it is something I can relate to.  Now I am addiceted to Pink and will continue to listen and buy her cd's for as long as she is a singer.  Pink you rock!

0767817478|5.0|\\"Godzilla\\" is basically your average summer action film, like \\"Armagedon\\", \\"Independence Day\\", and \\"Jurassic Park.\\"  It plays like a tribute to monster movies of the 1950's.  It's combines the awe of \\"Jurassic Park\\" with the intensity of \\"Aliens.\\"  However opinions of this movie are often mixed, typical viewers will like it, but fussier viewers may have trouble accepting it's simple plot.
B000069HKH|5.0|I love this cd. I love all of Bruce's work.... this disc is even sweeter since the E street band is back. The only problems I have with \\"The Rising\\" is the rerecording of \\"my city of ruins\\" I think there was more emotion in the 1st version. I wish he would have put the other version on this disc. I believe (I'll be corrected if I'm wrong) \\"You're missing\\" is a revamped version of a song Bruce did for the Sean Penn movie \\"The Crossing Guard\\" which was titled \\"Missing\\". If \\"You're Missing\\" is a revamped version of \\"missing\\"...... He should have put \\"Missing\\" on this disc. For me it's an emotion thing why mess with perfection? But other than those to complaints the disc is solid. My favorite tracks are: Lonesome Day, Waiting on a Sunny Day, and  Lets be friends(skin to skin).
B000069CWE|3.0|i am a diehard fan of linkin park. there 1st cd was amazing, i love every track with the exception of trk 10.  but there new album, reanimation has me really disappointed.  i bought it thinking the cd would be mostly new material like my december but like many other fans i found myself listening to remixes.  luckily i was introduced to this band through there 1st cd which made me a fan, so i can tolerate reanimation until lp comes out with a better album.  if you never heard linkin park before then buy hybrid theory, you won't regret you did.
B00005JLEX|5.0|What the hell are they waiting for??  Seinfeld is one of the greatest shows ever to appear on tv, the only better show in my opinion is the Simpsons, and they are on their second season.  Come on, they HAVE to release this and support the Seinfeld cast members, maybe give them a little extra dough to prevent disasters like \\"Bob Patterson.\\"  Seinfeld should be the master of the DVD domain, this show is definitely spongeworthy, so hurry up!

B000063S6Z|5.0|Moby's latest audio product follows closely in the footsteps of his previous work, &quot;PLAY&quot;, but with more flow and evenness of tempo.  While &quot;PLAY&quot; came across as a kid experimenting with his new electronic toys, &quot;18&quot; has a more austere flavor to it, as if Moby planned to deviate, if only slightly.  While &quot;18&quot; is beautiful with a certain sense of melancholy to it, it holds up as an incredible piece of pop art.  With gospel samples intact and ethereal vocals, &quot;18&quot; is destined to become a sought after success!
0671042734|1.0|I just finished this book and feel that I need to warn others.<br />Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy just never interested me at all, not one page. Sometimes a book can be bad and still have some good parts that reward you occasionally. Not this book.<br />I dreaded reading it and almost gave up and threw it away several times. However, I am not one to quit reading a book once I start since there will always be the question as to what happened or did I give up right before it got good.<br />It was strange to me that every time I picked this book up I could not rememeber what I had read before or what was going on. I would have to review back several pages and sometimes chapters. It was frustrating.<br />I have decided, now that I have completed it, that the book was just so dull that while I was reading I was thinking about other things, like maybe much washing and ironing I needed to do. I was just reading words with my eyes glazing over and my mind elsewhere. I flat out was bored silly. Without question this was a long, long 369 pages.<br />I am so glad it is over! Now I can get my sanity back and move on to something that is more worthly of my time.<br />As always your helpful votes are appreciated so that I can get the fame and recognition that I so justly deserve.
B00005QDW1|2.0|No Doubt's old stuff was really good, but its obvious all ND cares about is being all over MTV and have a sucessful record then playing the music they want to play. This is horrible the drum beats are very simple u can hardly hear the bass riffs and have u seen the video for &quot;Hey Baby&quot; the guitarist isnt playing a guitar!! He's playing one of those weird piano things. I dont like labeling bands and im not too critical of that whole &quot;sell out&quot; thing but its gotten to a point where the guitarist isnt even playing a guitar it sounds like a hip hop track. The only song i like on the record is &quot;underneath It All&quot; thats a very good song, but the rest is horrible.
B000002KCI|4.0|Admittedly, i'll love anything from Mr Young, but this is honestly a very fine album.<br />Mr Young has such a tallent for writting beautifully coherent albums. <br />The songs range from cruisy, through rockin', to mellow and through to epic.<br />If you could divide up this album and assign the songs to popular modern bands (eg weezer, pavement, pearl jam...) they'd almost all, in my oppinion, make great radio singles.  (except cotez the killer and danger bird, which are both too long and in addition, should not be performed by anyone except Mr Young himself.<br />If you like cruised-out (and unpredictably epic) rock and roll, buy this album.

B0000024JN|5.0|Alrighty, this CD is absolutly THE BEASTIEST CD EVER.  Only so often can you find a CD that you can stand to listen to the whole way through, where every song becomes one of your favorites...well, this is one of those CDs.  From Girls, Fight For Your Right, Brass Monkey, Paul Revere and the News Style, Beasite Boys rock and rap it like nobody else.  You cannot say that you like the Beastie Boys and NOT own this album.  If you don't have it, BUY IT.  BUY IT NOW!
B00005N9CV|2.0|I admire Diana as a(n)(ex) Jazz pianist/singer, who was discovered by Ray Brown who wrote the liner note on her excellent debut album &quot;Stepping Out&quot; with accomplists John Clayton and Jeff Hamilton.  It was an excellent Jazz album with great piano playing and tasteful singing from Diana Krall.<br />Material in The Look of Love is not bad music, but is not what she is capable of.  I am not sure what people who liked her original style think, to me this is muzak, passable but so is Kenny G.<br />Besides,after hearing Dusty Springfield's haunting &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, Diana just does not do it for me.
B000069HKH|3.0|I feel like I want to like this record more than I actually do because it is a serious piece of work, authentic in the era of Britney Spears and has a couple of moments of greatness.  Several listenable but mediocre cuts -- Waiting on a Sunny Day, Mary's Place -- two or three very good -- Lonesome Day, the Rising, World's Apart -- and one cut so extraordinary -- My City of Ruins -- that it ranks with the best songs Springsteen has ever written.  Doesn't compare favorably to Born to Run or Darkness on the Edge of Town, but what ever could?  I still need to try it my car.  My guess is if you thought Born in the USA was great, you'll love this too.
0312265859|5.0|The wacky, maniacal world of New Jersey's favorite bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum, is back and crazier than ever.  Janet Evanovich has outdone herself again with the eighth book in this excellent series.<br />Evelyn Soder and her daughter have taken off, leaving an already in debt ex-husband, Steven, who wishes to collect on a child custody bond that will evict Evelyn's grandmother out of her home.  Making matters worse, the grandmother, Mabel Markowitz, happens to be her parents next door neighbor.  The stakes are high and the handcuffs are a plenty (literally) in this fast-paced adventure.<br />All of the regular characters are back, including the hilarious,  scene-stealing Grandma Mazur, who is chock full of one-liners.  Her views on cybersex are laugh out loud funny, and that alone should be worthy of the price of this book.  The most interesting love triangle in the history of novels is also back in full force, with Stephanie still lingering between the hunk of a cop, Joe Morelli, and her secretive partner in crime, Ranger.  Stephanie's sister Valerie also has a more prominent role in this book, not to mention the introduction of a sweet, yet pathetic new character, who a real \\"clown\\" of a lawyer.  <br />HARD EIGHT is still loaded with Evanovich's humor and intrigue, yet there is a slightly darker undertone to the writing, which makes for different, yet enjoyable read.  This novel has enough mystery, romance, and humor to satisfy all of the regular Stephanie Plum readers, while also capturing a whole new breed of reader.  <br />Overall, this was a rip-roaring, page-turning novel that was a pleasure to read.  HARD EIGHT will not dissappoint.
0920668364|5.0|My grandma had this book laying around and I happened to read it while visiting her (several years before I had a child).  It was the sweetest, most touching book I'd ever read.  Robert Munsch has managed to capture the true spirit of unconditional love.  I bought this when I was pregnant for our daughter's library, and had a good cry all over again when I read it after bringing it home.  I still can't read it (especially out loud!) without crying.  I bought this for my best friend when she found out she was expecting, and she loves it, too.  Everyone -  old, young, parents, grandparents, even single people - should own this book.
B000069HKH|2.0|First off, I must say I am a Springsteen fan. I have all of Bruce's albums/CD's except one. I also live in New York City. So I was enthusiastic when I learned of the inspiration behind Mr. Springsteen's new album. I have to say that after listening to it twice, I'm very dissapointed. Maybe this is Bruce's tribute to NYC and the recent tragic events, but it cetainly wouldn't be my tribute to NYC. I found this album stagnant, noisy, heavy, and (within each track), repetitious. Only tracks 7 and 8, which are lighter, seem to avoid the heavy repetition. Several years ago, Billy Joel, another performer who I greatly admire, released &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot;. Like &quot;The Rising&quot;, it was heavy and depressing. Billy Joel's next album, after he met Kristy Brinkly, was, in my opinion, his best. I can only hope that Bruce Springsteen can follow in these shoes.
B000069HKH|2.0|First of all, where is the E Street Band. This murky sounding mess has none of the great sax, guitar and piano play of the great E Street albums. It sounds like just studio musicians from the Human Touch era. If you want great classic Bruce, get the &quot;Live in NYC&quot; cd where the E Street Band does its thing.<BR>I was not expecting &quot;Born to Run&quot; (we'll never get that again)<BR>but it sure would be nice if Bruce would sing about things like  barefoot girls sitting on the hood of a Dodge rather than big worldly events. Its Bruce and therefore better than most, but not great Bruce.
B00003CX9E|5.0|These two discs tells the story of three men William Randolph Hearst, Orson Welles, and Charles Foster Kane. The film stands alone as the greatest film barring maybe Casablanca.  With commentaries by critic Roger Ebert and filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich, You will begin to understand the importance and brilliance of Citizen Kane.  The other disc includes a brutally honest look at the lives of Welles and Hearst.  After watching &quot;The Battle Over Citizen Kane,&quot; you will notice interesting paralells not only between Kane and Hearst, but even Kane and Welles such as their childhoods and tempers.  Buy it and do not be afraid to learn too.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch this show on HBO &amp; LOVED it.  But, then we acquire a DVD Player &amp; this was the very 1st DVD we purchased.  Have had it less than a week &amp; played it over &amp; over.  No way can you tire of hearing their songs, watching the performance which is much better than HBO gave you, &amp; letting it all take you back to when you could truly enjoy music &amp; the meaning of the songs.  The Tribute to Andy is beautiful &amp; Celion Dion is an extra added touch plus their new song &quot;Still Waters&quot; is another beautiful creation of their talent.
0790732203|3.0|The early 80's are known for their hokey-yet-classic teen movies. Of these, \\"Risky Business\\" has the most original plot and the most accurate representation of teenagers yet it still falls flat.<br />Known more for pre-scrubby Tom Cruise dancing in his ... than for its plot, the story revolves around a dorky high schooler (Cruise) who becomes a lot more \\"worldly\\" due to his week with a prostitute (eventually turning his own home into a ...). The point of this film should be enjoyment, except it's really not all that much fun to watch Cruise make mistake after mistake. More humor would have done this film some good because it shouldn't expect to be an Oscar-winner. In addition, the movie is rather gratuitous, becoming a tame ... at parts.<br />But still the film does have its strongpoints. Watching a pre-cool Cruise is amusing (How old was he in this film?). The film does move briskly along with an interesting plotline. It's not your typical gross-out teen movie either, a teen movie that actually has depth. But perhaps this depth is a little too much and the fun a little too light because \\"Risky Business\\" still comes in as a very average (and forgettable) film indeed.
6305313687|5.0|This movie deserves every bit of the praise that it has ever received.  It works on so many levels that one can't help but be impressed.  The subject is not one that is original, and the movie isn't likely to change your mind about the personal beliefs that you held before you watched, but I can assure you that it will leave you speachless and deep in thought.  <br />The first time I watched the film I remember being repulsed by some of the language and one scene of particularly intense violence (anyone who has seen the film knows what part I'm talking about).  But I also remember the credits scrolling past my eyes and the tape stopping and re-winding while I was still staring blankly at the tv screen.  The ending is mind-blowing and not your typical Hollywood ending (one of the things that makes the film so amazing).<br />It's unfortunate that the language of the film will likely keep it from ever being a film that is taken into serious consideration in the academic world, because it is a film that every person should watch no matter what their race and their personal feelings on race.<br />Quite simply, Edward Norton puts in the performance of a lifetime, one that nothing he ever does after this could possibly top for its intensity and power.  Edward Furlong plays his role extremely well, though his performance is greatly overshadowed by the more elder of the Edwards.  The cinematography is excellent, as is the sound and the editing.  <br />As it stands, I couldn't point to a single element of this film that I could call a weakness--there's nothing but strengths.
B000002TQB|5.0|What is there left to say about the album that spawned Britpop, new laddism, some of the greatest singles of the decade (girls &amp; boys, end of the century, to the end) and took indie into the mainstream in a way the stone roses and the smiths had never quite managed. a brilliantly diverse sometimes infuriating epic that damon and the boys and indeed every other british bands in the 90s would try but fail to equal.
B000069HKH|2.0|There comes a time when all artists must admit they no longer have the capacity to reach their audience and fans.  Bruce, it seems to me with this album, has taken an irreversible step in that direction.  Overall, the album lacks that inimitable Springsteen grit and covers the listener with glitz, which is not really Bruce.  This has to be his poorest effort yet.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I am a No Doubt fan and have been since the release of their third album 'Tragic Kingdom'. I have to admit that when I first heard 'Rock Steady' I was slightly taken aback by the dance-hall sound of the album, as it is unlike anything No Doubt has ever done before. However, I find it seriously disconcerting to hear No Doubt fans calling them 'sell-outs' for dropping their signature 'ska' sound. A real No Doubt fan would realize that the most important, most praised and only real 'signature' of No Doubt's music is the fact that they cannot be crammed into one specific genre. Even their most most ska-inspired stuff is not pure ska and goes as far as including hip-hop and even disco beats. While some people refer to 'Rock Steady' as part of a carefully planned sell-out conspiracy, I say the contrary!! This album is PURE No Doubt, simply for it's ecclectism and originality! No Doubt is not using it as a vehicle to reach the top of the pop charts as much as they are using it as an expression of their diverse musical talents. I really enjoy the upbeat and original sound of 'Rock Steady' and believe it establishes No Doubt as a confident, daring and artistically maturing group willing, unlike so many bands afraid of fans' response, to express themselves in new, exciting ways. I seriously encourage fans and non-fans alike to open their ears (and their minds) and try to enjoy this awesome collection of music.

0812550706|5.0|Wow. This amazing sci-fi novel of Andrew Wiggin (nicknamed 'Ender' by his older sister, Valentine) leaves you stunned! I just couldn't stop reading, when I pick up the book, I know to get ready for a terrific 'ride'. Ender is a 'Third', or the third child born breaking the two children rule unless approved by the government. Ender was supposed to be the perfect commander, according to the International Fleet. When Ender was only six, he was taken to Battle School, where they train children to fight in the war against the aliens called Formics, or Buggers for slang. Ender was thought to have never made it, but quickly goes up ranks. From launchy to soldier, from soldier to commander. Soon enough Ender is knowen of all over Battle School. And when the time comes, Ender eventually faces a very serious realization that I won't spoil it for you! At the end you'll be baffled and wishing so more! So don't forget to pick up the rest of the series!
B00003CX8J|4.0|I have been a comic book fan for a long time, escpecially Marvel Comics fan and I love X-Men. I love the characters and the basic plot and everything. I was very excited also about the movie... really excited! When I saw it in theatres, I loved it. It's one of my favorite movies but the movie does have flaws and things that shouldv'e been taken out and put in. In my opinion, I thought that the movie was too short. 1 hour 30 min is not enought for a movie like this. I was disappointed on that part. But what disappointed me also was the amount of bad guys. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants shouldn't have had only four bad guys: Magneto (of course you need him), Toad (I'm not a fan of him), Sabretooth (he's cool), and Mystique (totally cool). They shouldv'e added in maybe the Juggernaut or even the Blob. But what was overdone in the movie was the amount of attention focused on Wolverine. I think they put WAY TOO MUCH attention on Wolverine. And about the action and fight coordinating; I think they could've done some for fight scenes and better action, maybe between Jean Grey and Mystique, or more Wolverine and Sabretooth. Same goes for the music. The music kind of [stinks] being energetic classical. They should've chosen Danny Elfman to do the music or Don Davis who did the Matrix (that would be perfect). And the use of Senator Kelly was bogus. Senator Kelly isn't cool nor is he significent in anyway. They should've either had it been Senator Kelly or the Sentinels. I'd choose the Sentinels. But in any way, \\"X-Men\\" is a great movie. \\"X-Men\\" is a well-made and X-tremely cool movie. <br />Worth the money!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Being a great Star Wars fan most of my short life, this movie was a real let down.  The special effects were good, but that's about where it ends.  The characters needed some major developement work.  The plot didn't have any reason for being.  Compared to the early works of George Lucas, this was ....  Even so, if you are a true Star Wars fan, it's a must see, even if it ruins some of your ideals.

B000069HKH|5.0|With &quot;The Rising&quot;, Springsteen has crafted a fine rock 'n roll album that people will listen to 10 or 20 years from now when they look to gain some insight into the national reaction to the events of September 11, 2001.  As in all good writing though, the 9/11 references are not done in a heavy-handed way.  Is &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; a survivor's song whose loved one died on 9/11, or is it merely the voice of a lover scorned?  You tell me. But it's also that ambiguity that allows you to listen to the album over and over.<br />For long-time fans, the production may take a few listens to get used to.  It's very clean and fresh sounding, and Bruce's voice is open and fluid.  The overdubbing is a bit more processed-sounding, but in the end, Bruce makes it all his.<br />I just read an article relating a story of how a women widowed in the 9/11 attack ran into Bruce several months ago and told him, &quot;Bruce, we need you NOW.&quot;  Even with that sort of expectation placed on him, and with the generally-accepted opinion that Springsteen is the only American songwriter in the position to tackle this subject matter, he doesn't flinch one bit, stays true to his heart, and delivers a classic rock and roll album for the ages.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I love how Shakira uses spanish and arabic influences in her music-she is the real deal...she can sing, dance, play her own instruments, and write her own songs.  She is also very pretty in a refreshingly exotic way(some might be interested to know that she is only 4'11 tall!).  This album is just so different and cool...it has such a distinctive sound to it and Shakira is in full command of her vocals.  Unlike the Britneys and Mandys, there is no electronic manipulation of her voice.  The reason why I give this cd four stars is because her voice can become too much after awhile, and sometimes I wonder whether she is hurting it.  But all in all, a very good cd.
B000001FP8|3.0|This is the fourth Bon Jovi's album. The tittle is very good, a nice tribute to New Jersey, the place where they were born.<BR>     There are wonderful ballads, as \\"Living in Sin\\", \\"I'll Be There For you\\" and \\"Wild Is The Wind\\".<BR>     \\"Ride Cowboy Ride\\" is a little song, but even so it's a beautiful song. It's one of my faves in this album. \\"Love For Sale\\" is very funny too, with their acoustic guitars.<BR>     \\"Blood on Blood\\" is my favourite too. Musically it sounds very good, and the lyrics are wonderful, talking `bout the time when you are teen and you are learning things not so good, but things that made part of our own lives. This is a good song for you think about your life, your childhood, the wonder years that will never come back. <BR>     \\"Lay Your Hands On Me\\", \\"Bad Medicine\\" and \\"Born  To Be My Baby\\" are great hard rock songs. You have to check these on! Everybody that likes rock and roll has to have this album on his CD's collection!<BR>     Bon Jovi rocks forever! They are coming back with BOUNCE!
B00005V1Z0|2.0|If you play tomb raider video games, then this movie will be a disappointment for you. They had Lara Croft together all the way in look, but failed to work on script and plot. This movie had the potential to be good, but didn't come out that way.It seemed like it was thrown together. Should of been longer.<br />If you like tomb raider video games, then don't except this movie to be really good.
B00005J73X|5.0|This is the first Bon Jovi Live's  album  and it sounds very good! It has a Neil Young's cover, \\"Keep on Rocking in the Free World\\" and it's the best cover for this song I listened.<BR>     My favorite song is \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\". In some chorus, Jon and Richie make a duet and the way they sing is wonderful! The whole album  is good, but this song in special touches me emotionally.<BR>     There are another version for \\"One Wild Night\\" and it's very funny and easy to listen.<BR>     There are songs as \\"Runaway\\" and \\"In and Out of Love\\", those were recorded in 1985 and it's very interesting to see how were the band, how they played and how they sang 17 years ago. <BR>     This album is a good way to see how is Bon Jovi  on the stage, the energy changed between the band  and the assistance. It's a magical album and  you if you close your eyes, you will feel like you are on the stage with them! It's amazing!<BR>     I'm very anxious to listen Bounce, the new Bon Jovi's album!
B00004Z459|5.0|Alas we have a new band that ushers us into a Emo/Punk/Rock/Techno age.  Can we say that Linkin' Park is good?  No!  Linkin' Park is one of the best new bands out there and I would love to know the guys and say thank you to them for giving us deep and meaningful songs and even a little insight into what a life can be and what you can really do if you follow your dreams, and thank you Nicki and Ally for introducing me to the Park Craze and driving me to the Place For My Head in a little place called Forgotten where everything seems to just be Crawling by and deny the Points of Authority who control it all right down to every little Papercut which has no Cure For The Itch...but please rememeber that you wouldn't want to Push Me Away, cause I am really One Step Close to the edge, and With You guys I can find out why the hell I really just want to Runaway and be By Myself.  But In The End, does that really matter?
0609610570|2.0|Let me start by saying that I really wanted to like this book. The subject matter is critically important and the quality of Larry Bossidy's career would give a reader every reason to believe that this book would be the real deal. The unfortunate reality, however, is that the writing is impenetrable and the book's organization is non-existent. One can only wonder about the extent of Bossidy's involvement; it's difficult to believe that it was more than cursory. I mean, how could someone so renowned for execution fail so spectacularly to execute the task of writing a coherent book?<br />I won't catalog all of the book's faults since these reviews are limited to 1,000 words. A particularly irksome one, however, is the repeated, blatantly self-promotional references from and about the co-author that were bludgeoned into the manuscript. Almost as annoying is the abysmal quality of the writing. I've written a couple of business books myself, so I'm somewhat familiar with the process. It is amazing to me that this mush made it through any sort of editing process.<br />Finally, let me just observe that it is unbelievable to me that anyone could be so humorless and/or clueless as to write a book titled &quot;Execution&quot; and not reference the classic quote on the subject from the late John McKay, former head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. (If you've never heard it, email me and I'd be happy to share it with you.)<br />Business readers are usually confronted with their own unique version of Hobbes' choice: You can choose an author who is knowledgeable but boring, or you can pick a buffoon like Tom Peters who is engaging and entertaining but has no idea what he's talking about. There's no question that Bossidy knows what he's talking about. Unfortunately, you'd be hard pressed to wade through the morass of this book's dense and unfocussed prose to find out what he has to say.
B000068FXR|5.0|Ex-`Tramp Roger Hodgson calls \\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\" the Supertramp album he listens to most often, because of it's \\"rawness,\\" at Hodgson puts it. The album was indeed devised while the band was under pressure to put forth another album and tour in the wake of their breakthrough third album \\"Crime of the Century,\\" which may be why the ex-vocalist finds the finished product more raw when compared to other Supertramp albums. But for an album that was planned and recorded while the band was under stress to keep the momentum going, \\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\" is an elaborate suite of songs, making it a crushing shame that the album will almost never appear on any big-time 100 Greatest Albums of Rock & Roll lists.<br />The dignified pop of Supertramp always sounded clinical and studio-polished, but not because of any Steely Dan-like studio isolation. That's just the way it was (ironically it translated well onto stage, as captured on the 1980 live album \\"Paris\\"). This album isn't exactly \\"raw\\" but it is certainly a bit more freewheeling and often less tightly wound as Supertramp's other albums. The album also allows a bit more space for Hodgson's guitars, which he often replaced with keyboards. Even though the quintet was under pressure to release another album, many spots on the album suggest that the band was having some fun, shown in the positive opener `Easy Does It,' `Lady,' and `Another Man's Woman.' There is however at least one genuinely raw song, the heavy schizophrenic `Ain't Nobody But Me.' But there are also plenty of tracks to confirm Supertramp's ability to create pure, flawless, and sophisticated pop songs like `Sister Moonshine' and `A Soapbox Opera.'. The world-weary `Just A Normal Day' is balanced by the more optimistic and catchy `The Meaning.' The innocent `Poor Boy' is a delight, and speaking of innocent, the closing `Two Of Us' is as elegant a three-and-a-half-minutes as any `Tramp fan could ask for.<br />\\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\" connected perfectly with \\"Crime of the Century,\\" and though its chart peak in the US was just a few spots below its predecessor, many of its songs were becoming staples of FM radio, establishing Supertramp as a serious, dignified attraction. And there was more where this came from; maybe it wasn't such a \\"Crisis\\" after all.f the Century,\\" and though its chart peak in the US was just a few spots below its predecessor, many of its songs were becoming staples of FM radio, establishing Supertramp as a serious, dignified attraction. And there was more where this came from; maybe it wasn't such a \\"Crisis\\" after all.
0679601686|5.0|One thing I have learned form reading this book and then reading some reviews, is that one can either hate it or love it.  Or love it and hate it at the same time.<br />In my case, I loved the tale, it is one of must-read classics, and who ever enjoys romantic novels of any sort will fall in love with the story.<br />Jane Austen, a great author, certainly has captured my heart making this tale to remind me of love when everthing else doesn't.
B000069CWE|5.0|I usually don't listen to remixes, but as Hybrid Theory was one of my most played CDs, I figured I should give it a try.  Anyway, when I put it in, I was surprised at the different styles spread throughout the CD.  My favorite track is the last one, Aaron Lewis' remix of Crawling, or Krwlng.  His opening of something vaguely classical and trilly sound of the instruments makes this track well worth waiting until the end.  Anyway, I am saying BUY THIS ALBUM!!!  IT IS GREAT!!!
B000066I6N|4.0|Plant's voice is not ruined as many would like to believe but is deep, rich and smooth. His versions of &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, &quot;Morning Dew&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe&quot; deserve recantion because they are beautiful and perfect. But all in all the album has such a bare old feel that almost seems like it was recorded in the 70's. &quot;Funny In My Mind&quot; sounds exactly like a zeppeling on page/plant song. Well the concept and album are work are perfect. the music is three stars, concept 1 star= 4 stars. Worth the money yes..
B000069HKH|5.0|It's really a shame that The Rising -- Bruce Springsteen's first studio album since 1995's The Ghost Of Tom Joad, and his first with the great E Street Band band since 1984's Born In The U.S.A -- has been pegged as a \\"9/11 album,\\" because it's so much more than that.  In the past, Bruce has vivdly portrayed such characters as the \\"Highway Patrolman\\" who can't turn in his criminal brother, the young working-class couple in \\"The River,\\" the angry Vietnam veteran in \\"Born in the U.S.A.,\\" and the AIDS patient in \\"Streets of Philadelphia.\\"  On The Rising, he does the same for grieving survivors (\\"Empty Sky,\\" \\"You're Missing,\\" \\"Countin' on a Miracle,\\" \\"My City of Ruins\\"), rescue workers (\\"Into the Fire,\\" \\"Nothing Man\\"), a casualty (\\"The Rising\\"), even a suicide bomber (the poetic \\"Paradise\\").  But will these mostly September 11th-inspired tracks hold up?  Yes, and for three good reasons:<br />     1)  Springsteen's lyrics are mature enough to avoid kick-butt jingoism, but they're detailed enough to stir real emotion and avoid becoming too sentimental.  For example, the suddenly widowed narrator of \\"You're Missing\\" says, \\"The evening falls, I got too much room in my bed, too many phone calls, 'How's everything?'\\", while the one in \\"Empty Sky\\" offers, \\"I woke up this morning, I could barely breathe, just an empty impression in the bed where you used to be;\\"<br />     2)  subject matter aside, the album is NOT a relentless bummer.  Words such as \\"faith,\\" \\"strength,\\" \\"hope,\\" \\"love,\\" and \\"rise\\" appear far more frequently than the motifs of \\"blood,\\" \\"fire,\\" and \\"rain.\\"  Also, many tracks offer words of hope and optimism, such as \\"This storm'll blow through ... this too shall pass\\" (\\"Lonesome Day\\") and \\"Everything'll be okay ... Don't worry, we're gonna find a way\\" (\\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\");<br />     3)  like U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind and Elvis Costello's When I Was Cruel, The Rising is musically a return to form without slavishly imitating past sounds (the sole exception being \\"Mary's Place,\\" a throwback to such early Springsteen classics as \\"Thunder Road\\" and \\"Rosalita\\").  Also, Bruce's tunes -- whether joyously upbeat (\\"Lonesome Day\\") or achingly pretty (\\"Nothing Man\\") -- are as catchy as ever, and the E Street Band provide solid backing.  I must also mention such nice touches as strings (on many of the tracks) and a Pakistani choir (on \\"Worlds Apart\\").<br />Bruce Springsteen is a master storyteller at the top of his game here, and he and his band have crafted a pure rock 'n' roll album of real substance.  Born in the U.S.A. and 1982's Nebraska are still my favorite Springsteen albums, but I believe The Rising is nearly as good as they are.
B00004U2G4|5.0|This album in its entirety is one of the greatest album's I've ever heard. Rod Stewart's vocals are amazing, and at times rival Robert Plant. I admit he is no Robert Plant, but amazing none the less. Ron Wood's bass lines are incredible and it makes you wonder why the Stone's didn't get rid of Bill Wyman sooner and have Ron Wood on bass. Mickey Waller's drumming is something to be reckoned with. The drum solo at the end of &quot;I Ain't Superstisious&quot; will reverberate in your head for at least the next couple days. And then of course there's Jeff Beck, who in his prime, which he always is, may be better than Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, and yes, even Jimi Hendrix. His guitar solos always leave you wanting more, and the dynamics of his guitar in any song is just amazing. Listen to &quot;Beck's Bolero,&quot; and try to disagree. The track list is phenomenal, with a nice mix of blues and rock. Using some odd song choices adds a lot to the originality in this album, like playing &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; is great especially with Keith Moon's use on the timpani. and then in the middle when it gets a little repetative there's &quot;Greensleeves&quot; an acoustic guitar number resembling something Led Zeppelin did a few years later. This album has everything to be a perfect album, and that's the Truth.
B000069CWE|4.0|the first day got this cd i hated it but then after a day or two of listening to it it started to grow on me and now i think that is a pretty good cd altough i think they kind of screwed up IN THE END and CRAWLING.  all in all this is a good cd but not as good as Hybrid Theory.
B00004YRQA|5.0|This is the official and the only properly working ps2 memory card out there. The others may have more memory, but ull regret buying anything but this card because the files erase easily on any other memory card. Memory cards are overpriced though. Its 25 dollars, but after buying a ps2 with 5 games for 500 bucks, 25 isnt much. BUY IT
B0000640VN|3.0|I was so looking forward to seeing this movie and while it was worth the cost to see a stunningly handsome and realistic Hugh Jackman as a 19th century lord transported to modern-day New York, I have to say the rest of the movie is a let-down.  I just did not buy Meg Ryan in her role (this type supposedly being her forte).  I found her annoying and unbelievable.  And forgive me, but when did the great love happen?  Did I miss something?  Overall, it was a cute story idea and Hugh Jackman as well as the other castmembers (excluding Ryan) were quite good.  I just didn't buy this particular fairy tale.
B00004XMV6|5.0|[Another] reviewer... missed the entire point of this movie, more than I've ever seen before!<br />He calls it a \\"smutty film about a bad sexual relationship\\" which it is not. He says it is \\"an above-average erotic film\\", and it's not even \\"erotic\\". It is, but that's secondary.<br />He says \\"Rourke is just honing his scumbag, bad-boy persona; but it doesn't overwhelm.\\" He is perfect for the role and he missed the whole point of the characters pyschological state.<br />I'm not even going to indulge this reviewer by explaining the movie to him. It's not too hard to grasp but he sure missed it.<br />One of the rare works of art to come out of Hollywood.
B000069CWE|5.0|I'm a long standing fan of Linking Park, their Hybrid Theory cd is one of my most prized albums, I love it.  They posess a unique sound that blends a skilled agressive rock band with hip hop in a very real fusion, Mr. Hahn and Mike Shinoda brining true elements, not a poppy combination geared toward making money.  This newest insallment in the aural assault arsenal of Linkin Park is heavy artillery... The cameos are astounding: Kutmasta Kurt, Motion Man, and Black Thought to name my favorites on the hip hop side, and Jonathan Davis and Aaron Lewis (The reanimation of Crawling is an emotional barrage... it's beautiful)  This is a furtherance of their fusion on a very true to the roots level on par with the track they did with the renouned turntablist gods, the X-men (X-ecutioners).  From start to finish, very very solid.  I can't stress how highly reccomended this comes from me, a conniseur and enthusiast of music and hip-hop culture.
B000021Y77|1.0|I did not get it. She is just running and running and again running. No philosophical idea. No point. The movie is telling us the same story in three different versions. Why? Boring...
B000069HKH|5.0|Someone earlier sated that this album shouln't be seen as a psychotherapeautic rememdy to the 9/11 crisis. i agree. Having said that, no other artist could adress this issue with the clarity and eloquence as Springsteen. <br />Always a voice for the American man, and what it means to be a man, father, husband, worker, patriot, and lover, and coming through it all with dreams and hopes intact, one can again turn to Springsteen who quietly tells us, &quot; i know, i know, i know.&quot;<br />Twenty years ago, he sang for me....today, he still sings for me, somehow knowing that things change, hair turns grey, drinking with the boys on a saturday night gives way to your son falling asleep on your chest. <br />Although some have criticized his songwriting as hasty, often repeating verses over and over. This is part of that reassurance. Just like patting your son on his back when he wakes up from a nightmare, he whispers to us, &quot;shhh, shhh, shhh, i know, i know, it'll be ok.&quot;<br />Anyway.....do i think its a great album? You bet. His best since Tunnel of Love. His best? Not quite. But how many artist have to live up to Springsteen's resume?
B000063DHL|5.0|First Iron Maiden CD I ever bought.  I was told to buy Powerslave and I listened to a demo of Powerslave at the store.  I thought it was allright, but then I picked up Somewhere In Time for curiosity, and fell in love with what I heard so I bought it instead.  Powerslave is an excellent CD, I eventually bought it and I'm listening to Flash of the Blade as I write this.  Title track to this album is actually my favorite.  Love the intro and the riff.  The solo in this song deserves more credit though.  This has complete virtuoso style guitaring in the solo, and should be ranked with NOTB's solo, and solos of other songs, such as Metallica's One &amp; Fade to Black, Pantera's Cemetery Gates, Ozzy's Mr. Crowley just to name a few.  Title track goes to show that Dave Murray and Adrian Smith are complete virtuosos.  Wasted Years another great track that opens up your eyes to your own life.  Sea of Madness has a great riff and a great chorus.  Very heavy actually.  Heaven Can Wait is soft, but very powerful and memorable and good to listen to.  Long Distance Runner is one of my favorites.  Again, another virtuoso style masterpiece.  Excellent guitaring.  Music done 100%.  A perfect epic.  Stranger In A Strange Land is a very good song drenched with a good chorus and riff.  Deja Vu is my second favorite besides title track.  The riff, the vocals, the power, the emotion.  It sends chills down your spine.  The keyboards, however awkward, are put to great use and sound perfect.  Deja Vu is a tremendously great song.  Alexander the Great is a song that shows Iron Maiden are great story tellers.  Its an epic masterpiece and just shows the irony of history.  This CD is worth every penny.  And if you are automatically turned off by learning that keyboards are used in this CD, give it a chance.  10:1 says youll enjoy it if you are a real Maiden fan.  They may use keyboards, but they know how to use them good.  Worth every penny.  Buy it if you can.
6305546789|5.0|This is what I call a scary movie. Some people believe it is the scariest movie ever. I disagree, but if you like it your okay with me. It isn't as scary as The Boogeyman or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it is much better than Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. 90% of america think The Exorcist is the scariest film ever made. People that don't like popular movies tend to say The Evil Dead is the scariest, but for people that just don't believe in the terror of the devil's existence, then they think this is the scariest. Well choose for yourself. This is a great scary movie, but The Exorcist remains supreme.
B00005NB0H|2.0|The music is great, oh, it's so wonderful to finally have the whole thing, the sound is so good blah blah blah etc. etc. etc.<br />Well, first, yes, the music is awesome. It's the Who after all. Would you really expect anything less from one of the world's most powerful live acts?<br />Second, no, the concert here is not complete. There is still plenty of stage banter that's been cut, not to mention edits in the songs, still. The concert is simply not complete.<br />But the third, oh the THIRD offense is the most drastic. Do you people *really* think that this sounds good?!?! Okay, disc 1 sounds *similar* to the 1995 Live at Leeds but not exact. But DISC 2?! It does *NOT* sound good by any means. Are you trying to tell me that you can't hear the over application of noise reduction? *That*, in case you don't know, is what caused the entirety of disc 2 to sound like it was recorded in a tin can. Literally! It doesn't sound thin, it *really* *honestly* *truly* DOES sound like it was recorded in a tin can, like it was drenched in metallic sound effects, not to mention the pointless noise reduction has also left the music sounding like it's been flanged. Listen to it through a good pair of headphones. Or even still, ANY headphones. The drums don't sound natural (they sound like they've been blanketed in a light flange the entire disc through). You can hear the results of the noise reduction best during the stage banter. It sounds incredibly processed, because it *IS*. Please, please, please, DO NOT buy this if you have any respect for your hearing or respect for classic music, because the Jon Astley's mastering has ruined great music.<br />Listen to it before you buy it, to see what I mean. And I don't mean listen to the sound samples, I mean listen to an entire song encoded at a high bitrate so you can hear what it sounds like without the additional distortion that results from high compression mp3's.<br />WHY must great music be ruined?!
B00005UKKF|3.0|I dont know, i dind't like this performance at all.  The thing is that she tried being too \\"sexy\\" and it limit her as an artist. She was lipsyncing the whole time, If i wanted to hear her sing like that, i would just put her cd on and listened to it .  Also what's up with the weird costumes and the walking around?  She use to dance in unison with her dancers instead of standing around feeling on herself.  Big disappointment!
B0000683DH|5.0|\\"The Wrath of Kahn\\" is by far one of the best \\"Star Trek\\" films ever made.<br />The film begins at Star Fleet Academy where a young Vulcan officer, Lt. Saavik, undergoes the no-win \\"Kobiyashi Maru\\" test. As expected, she fails the test, but learns (over the course of the film) the meaning of the test. She also finds out that Kirk is the only Star Fleet graduate that ever won the no-win scenario.<br />The film progresses to the planet Seti-Alpha 6 (or so they thought) where Chekov & Capt. Terrell from the starship Reliant are investigating the possibility of using the planet for the \\"Genesis Project\\". To their dismay, they find that they are on the wrong planet when they come across the survivors of the genetically-enhanced super-humans who had been marooned there by Kirk years earlier. Their leader, Khan Noonien Singh, wants revenge on Kirk.<br />Kahn and his followers capture the starship Reliant so that Kahn can find and destory Kirk. Kahn also wants all information and materials for the \\"Genesis Project\\". He attacks the space station whose commander was a former lover of Kirk--Dr. Carol Marcus. Their son, Dr. David Marcus, is also involved.<br />The U.S.S. Enterprise, under the command of Capt. Spock, is on a training mission. When the space station is attacked, it is the closest starship to the station. Admiral Kirk assumes command to find out who attacked the space station. When he arrives, he is in for a very big surprise!<br />The fighting between Kirk and Kahn is intense and results in the death of a very major \\"Star Trek\\" character.<br />This film is a must have for any \\"Star Trek\\" fan!<br />The second DVD included with the Director's Cut contains interviews with original cast members (Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley) as well as Gene Roddenberry and other people that contributed directly to the Star Trek's on-going legacy.  Again, it's a very worthwhile item that any Star Trek fan will enjoy having for years to come!
B000003S0P|5.0|For some of the reviews I have written, I have gone entirely on my own and then devoured the reviews by other fans after. With Red, because I find it a very difficult disc to describe, as another reviewer mentioned, I needed to look at the previous commentary, much of which was helpful.<br />Reading album notes and articles on the group, one learns that this is a very important King Crimson release, marking the end of an era. Wetton's vocal style is similar to that of Greg Lake, a rather lovely and mournful approach which Belew really cannot (and needs not) reproduce on subsequent King Crimson releases.<br />I learned from another review that Ian McDonald plays the great saxophone here, and that of course ties this record right back to the beginning of KC. The finale, Starless and Bible Black, is impossible for us fans not to interpret as a wistful goodbye to the first phase of this interesting concept, the common denominator of manifestations of which is Fripp, who is obviously some sort of genius.<br />Much has been made of the fact that KC was very severely reduced by the time of this record, but the guest saxophone and violin make the recording seem much richer. Still, the overall impression is basic, uncompromising rock, with a rough, minimalist texture.<br />As the average rating indicates, this is one of the most highly regarded KC recordings, and indeed it is high on my list too. I think the reason, however, lies not in its historical importance with respect to Fripp's lifetime of musical projects, but instead because the melodies and harmonies are finely crafted, enjoyable and challenging all at once.<br />I read several negative comments about the eight minute Providence that begins side 2 of the album. Well, to be fair, it certainly isn't very interesting during the first five minutes, just sort of not there (ah yes, we all remember Moonchild). The last three, however, are really quite good. It's a shame that they did not expand that excellent section to occupy more of the piece. Still, it's challenging and enjoyable listening.<br />I am leaving the best for last. The finale, and the preceding improvisation from side two are fine, but side one, consisting of three songs, is extremely addictive. The first song is real spare, just guitar, bass, and drums, with lots of processing and electronics. No vocals. It's fuzzy and driving with an ascending motif, in a procession of minor keys, and divided ABA. Very disciplined. Under all the distortion in the fuzz of the guitars, there is a Fripp developing his strange style, technique, and melodic focus. It really is a break with the past, except in the sense that the first ascending melody which also ends the piece is regal in bearing.<br />The second piece, reminiscent of previous KC ballads, evokes innocence and lightness in narrating the childhood of the Fallen Angel, and as his life falls apart, a series of descending chords leads to a choral dirge, very King Crimson, but with super fuzzed-out guitar.<br />Side one ends with One More Red Nightmare, the third of this extraordinary trio of songs. The percussion features a whipsaw sound that echos, lots of drums, an insistent, rocking vocal, but this second section is short, just over two minutes, and rather abruptly we are introduced to an extended guitar solo with saxophone, bass, and drum. Wetton returns for one minute to sing a last verse, and the song ends with a jazzy, active, edgy performance by guitars, bass, sax, keyboard, and drums for another two minutes. I think this is 7 minutes of some of the greatest KC playing ever. It all ends in the sound being swallowed out of thin air.to occupy more of the piece.

I think this is 7 minutes of some of the greatest KC playing ever. It all ends in the sound being swallowed out of thin air.
0099418533|5.0|This is my all time favourite Georgette Heyer story. The storyline is filled with happy surprises and the characters are incredibly entertaining. I must have read this book at least 100 times and I never grow tired of following the antics of Kitty. The interplay between the characters is hilarious and the end result of Kitty's misguided attempt to teach everyone a lesson is highly satisfactory. A must read for those who appreciate a Regency romance with flair and wit.
078322706X|5.0|What a wonderful movie!  Despite it's length, this movie is FILLED with a great story, great performances, and tons of emotion!  Even though it's such an amazing movie, I could only watch it once because it had me crying my eyes out and I NEVER cry at movies!
B0000687L5|5.0|I don't cry at movies--ever.  But this one brought me to tears.  There are no great tragedies, no huge twists of fate, no massive deus ex machina to put everything right or smite anyone down.  It's just a fairy tale of sorts, the simple yet extraordinary story of a man who could play piano like a god, but never quite figured out where he fit into life.  This film proves beyond a doubt Tim Roth's talent and versatility as an actor; he is outstanding.  By turns hilarious and heartbreaking, &quot;The Legend of 1900&quot; is well worth anyone's time.  It is simply incredible.
B00004RFFI|5.0|When &quot;Twister&quot; was released in 1996, it was panned by many film critics; but not everyone agrees.  &quot;Twister&quot; takes place in America's heartland where tornadoes are common and where residents live in fear of destruction any time a very dark cloud looms overhead.<br />The film depicts the desires of the scientist, Dr. JoAnne Thornton-Harding (Helen Hunt), to get a tornado to swallow up hundreds of sensors so that scientists can analyze their data and obtain a better understanding of tornado dynamics.  Her soon-to-be-divorced husband, William 'Bill' Harding (Bill Paxton), plans to marry a very urban psychologist, Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz), as soon as JoAnne signs the divorce papers.  Bill brings the divorce papers out to JoAnne, but she's too busy with her sensors and the discovery of a nearby funnel cloud.  JoAnne and her crew hurry off to chase the funnel cloud with Bill &amp; Melissa along for the ride.<br />Over the course of the film, Melissa disovers what Bill really likes to do and that he still has a lot of feelings for JoAnne.  She also realizes that she hates being in very close proximity to tornadoes.<br />The special effects and constant action in the film keep the audience at the edge of their seats!<br />If you want to &quot;get blown away&quot;, this is a great film to own!

B000069HKH|4.0|I've just turned 21, and as far as discovering Bruce Springsteen goes, I've had a little catching up to do! Many albums later, I'm glad to say that I'm there now!<br />The Rising will probably seem different to what you might have expected but in my opinion, that's surely a good thing? Although, tracks such as, \\"Mary's Place\\" recapture all the magic from where the Bruce and E-Street band left off in their earliest days. \\"Mary's Place\\" is an incredible song, and a beautiful resonance, grabbing at everything that is Bruce and the E-Street band.<br />What I love when I hear this album (obviously besides their musical talents) are the voices of the E-Street band and Patti Scialfa is frequently turned full-on, and with a voice that is as powerful as it is beautiful such a presence really does something special to those songs.<br />What has disappointed me about \\"The Rising\\" is the absence of two songs, \\"American Skin\\" and \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\" I had heard that the two tracks were going to be recorded for the album? In my opinion \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\" is quite possibly the best song Bruce has ever written. It just seems to sum-up everything about where we are, and where we want to be. \\"The Rising\\" is about hope, and that particular track would have made the album complete. (But of course you can still hear \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\" on the \\"Live In NYC\\" package.) Sometimes, the lyrics arent as deep, and can repeat. And the songs that do rock, dont always do so with the classic Bruce and The E-Street band \\"bells and whistles\\". But, I still really like what I hear!<br />I can't really describe what I feel when I play the \\"The Rising\\", but it is an extremely uplifting and often, spiritual experience. And yes, it is at times, quite gospel. \\"The Rising\\" is an album for our times, but more so, an album that I will cherish forever. I think it will grow on you.<br />The piano closing a more moving version of \\"My City Of Ruins\\" is just one more thing that, regardless of everything else, makes \\"The Rising\\" a beautiful recording. Not as good as I expected, but defentley one you need to own - especially for \\"Mary's Place!\\"
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is a true story. Ron Howard did a superb job of bringing this one out. You really get into the characters. They are so believable.<br />Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connely and Ed Harris! They are awesome. So believable. The true story doesn't come out until nearly half way through the movie.<br />This one needs to be watched twice. Once you understand the story, you have to go back and see what was really going on. My wife and I watched it the other night. We would stop it every 15 minutes or so to talk about what we thought was going on. This one makes you sit back and think.<br />Russell Crowe was great! He was very into this character. Very believable. Wow!<br />The second DVD full of extras was great. We watched all the pieces. Wow!
B00003CXCT|5.0|The original \\"Star Wars\\" is, to this day, one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time! When it was released in 1977, no other sci-fi film came close in comparison to the quality and advancement in special effects technology that this film presented. \\"Star Wars\\" set the standard by which all other sci-fi films are judged to this day.<br />As for the plot, many critics like to say that people continue to watch and enjoy \\"Star Wars\\" to recapture lost youth. They're wrong! Because we remain young at heart and idealistic about the future, we love films such as \\"Star Wars\\" that promote the hope of a better tomorrow when so many other things in real life have failed. Films such as \\"Star Wars\\" ignite the imagination and encourage mankind to reach for the stars! Maybe it's the critics who need to recapture their youth and idealism, both of which appear to be dead and forgotten.<br />My thanks to George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guiness and the many other cast and crew that brought this remarkable film to life for countless generations to enjoy!
B000066NW0|3.0|First off, let me just say that Da Peace Dogg has lots of respect for this new artist - nuthin' but luv.  I've seen her perform on t.v. live a few times, and I can't believe a girl that young can already be so talented.  Having said that, though, I also must say that Avril Lavigne gots a long way to go 'till she matches the status of Britney Spears.  Britney's latest has sold 3.8 million units, well on its way to 4 million copies!!  And what's this one sold?  Maybe 500,000 units.  Big deal, it's a gold record.  In order to make it in da biz, you gots to sell those records, doggz....Also, to match the status of Spears, you gots to lay down phat beats and dance a little more, plus sing lots of naughty-styled lyrics that come from da heart.  This chick just ain't as genuine and troo as my girl Britney, but give her time cuz she could someday be on level with Ms. Spears.<br />She's pretty talented!!
B000002U8G|5.0|This was the 5th addition to my Pink Floyd catalog after Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and Atom Heart Mother. I had heard and read good things about it but I had no idea it was as good (if not better) than all the albums just mentioned. This CD is THE most relaxing CD I have ever heard. It, like all Floyd albums, has incredibly deep/intelligent lyrics and music throughout. Here is my track by track analysis:<br />One of These Days - The wind howling at the beginning of the song sets the dreamy mood for the entire CD.  The song starts with a thumping bass line that keeps throughout the entire song.  Pure psychedelica ensues with the entrance of Gilmour's slide guitar, Wright's electronic tweaks, and Mason's pounding beat.  Mason's lyrics (his only in any Floyd song) are, \\"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces.\\"  This is one of Floyd's hardest rockers ever.<br />Pillow of Winds - The winds that began the raucaus One of These Days end that song and segue it into one of Floyd's most etherial/chilled songs ever, Pillow of Winds.  The lyrics are beautiful and their vivid imagery take my mind off any problems I have and transcend me out of this world.<br />Fearless - One of the most ispiring songs I've ever heard. <BR>\\"You say the hill's to steep to climb,<BR>Climb it!<BR>You say you'd like to see me try,<BR>Climb it!<BR>You pick the place and I'll choose the time,<BR>and I'll climb that hill in my own way,<BR>just wait a while for the right day,<BR>And as I rise above the treelines and the clouds<BR>I look down and hear the sound of the things you said today\\"<BR>Truly beautiful.  Musically, the song's guitar riff lifts me and is just as moving as the lyrics.<br />San Tropez - A happy jazz diddy. This song really bounces. Try not smiling during this song.<br />Seamus - This is the slowest and shortest song on the album at only 2:15. It's an interesting attempt at blues from the Floyd.  It's been voted Floyd's worst song ever. While I do think it's the weakest song on this album, I think that label is wrong.  Take any song of Ummagumma studio for that crown.<br />Echoes - The epitome of acid rock. This song is a true audio hallucination. While streaming through 36 movements and 23 minutes, this song touches just about every genre of music and every realm of human emotion. From the \\"jammy\\"/happy parts early on, to the spacey/scary wind howling (remember one of these days)in the middle, to the song's climax which is more orgasmic than any song I have ever heard, this song truly captures Floyd's musical genius. This song foreshadowes Floyd's greatness which followed in the next few years after this album.<BR>The bonus to this track is it's synch with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Just like Dark Side of the Moon and The Wizard of Oz, Echoes synchs up with Kubrick's classic perfectly (better than DSotM and WoZ).  Either download it off the internet or do it manually by starting Echoes at the black screen near the end of 2001 where the screen says \\"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.\\" Floyd wanted to write the score for 2001 (Waters talks about this in the book \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\") but Kubrick didn't choose the Floyd to write it so they did it in their own incredible way. You will understand the song so much more after seeing it. A must see!...<br />This album is Floyd's most underrated. I can't choose a favorite song on it since they are all so great. Stop depraving yourself and go buy this CD now!
B000069CWE|5.0|This is a great album, which is what I expected from LinkiN Park. Here are a few comments on some of the remixes:<BR>In the End: not as good as the original, but still good.<BR>Pts. of Athurity: Probably my favorite song on the album. this one is great.<BR>My December: good, but a bit faster than the original. if you havent heard the origianl, you should download it online. its really good.<BR>i havent heard the rest... yet. but ive heard its good/. great.
B000002J0B|5.0|People often question why Led Zeppelin is worshipped by so many people of differing generations, both male and female.  They did everything right: great opening album that only got better, breaking up just before they started to fade, the dark magic and mystic, oozing sexuality, and talent at every instrument.  But that's only the beginning, if you want more reasons, look at this album.  Not their best, but it does show something about the band.  The first song, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is a mixture of a number of pop influences to create an original, though not too spectacular sound.  The next song is essentially a ballad though it doesn't have much of a story.  It does last an unballad-like 7 minutes too.  Following is Over The Hills... which is a folk tune that breaks into a hard rock crunch.  Dancing Days has a dance rhythem, No Quarters is prog rock, D'yer M'ker is raggae, and The Ocean is metal.  The Crunge... well that's just [weak].  So to recap the album's influences: pop, ballad, folk, dance, prog, raggae, metal, and of course hard rock runs throughout.  Not only does it tap these influences, however, but it also uses them to create songs that are better than anything else in those genres.  Take most modern bands, like Limp Bizkit or Korn.  Who are they influenced by?  Rap and metal (Well Led Zeppelin too but it's not their fault these bands exist).  But I'd like to see either of these bands make a folk song or a raggae influenced song that sounds amazingly good as Zeppelin did.  Oh, Zeppelin were also amazing lyricists, which is saying more than most modern bands could.
B000002ILG|5.0|Rock would not be what it is today without the sheer force that this White Lion record unveiled upon the world.  And their next two records weren't bad, either!!  This effort was unfortunately released in 1987, the same huge year that Leppard's \\"Hysteria\\" and G + R's \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" were released, two very overrated and commercial albums.  If not for those two metal releases, I truly believe White Lion's \\"Pride\\" would have been even huger than it was.  Whereas the aforementioned bands either mired themselves in a glossy studio sheen (Leppard), or delved into the hard-partying lifestyle that can break a band (G + R), White Lion wrote sensitive ballads with an eye towards a life larger than themselves.  In other words, they weren't your typical 80's metal band; they wrote about social issues, and their love ballads were more than just about sex (Leppard), or using women (G + R).  No, the boys from Lion aimed a little higher than your average 80's metal filth.  Take, for instance, the heartwrenching ballad entitled \\"When the Children Cry,\\" a tune that still brings tears to my eyes in 2002.  When others wrote about lust, drugs and partyin' all night, White Lion wrote a tender ballad that came from the meek child's point of view, as on this special song.  How many metal bands...no, check that, how many bands in general would ever even dream of writing from the meek child's perspective, except perhaps the lover of \\"all the children of the world,\\" Michael Jackson - The King of Pop.  Except for perhaps a hymnal song in church, folks, you ain't gonna' find this kind of love for the world.<br />Though they were a platinum selling act, White Lion did not get the props they deserved.  They should have been the Zeppelin of the 80's, not the Peter Frampton of the 70's.  Anyways, for true metal, check out \\"Pride\\" by Lion.
B000063USY|3.0|The director captures the cars in this movie in some enjoyable high-speed action.  Fast, tricked-out cars are everywhere in this movie.  However, the screenplay and acting are absent.  If you are into street racing, this is a fun film to watch.  It could be to street racing what Quadrophenia is to fans of Italian motor scooters.  If you aren't really into fast cars and racing, this movie is not of any interest.  If you follow what little plot there is, you will be hoping that Brian and Dom both die a deserved death by the time they are doing their last race.

B000069HKH|5.0|This is one of the best CDs in a long, long time, maybe ever.  Every cut is superb.  The passion and feeling of the Boss about 9/11 comes through in a way that is so telling.  Everyone should have this CD.
0684800713|3.0|Being a novel by Hemingway, I was optimistically expecting an enjoyable read.  However, I found the subject matter of the text to be exhausting.  The text repeatedly describes having meals, then wine, then more wine with ample whining.  All of the main players exhibit self-pity and complete absence of self-esteem (whether it be externally and/or internally presented).  <br />If you read this, be prepared to be bored out of your wits.  However, also be prepared to continue reading through until the end anticipating some climax.  Although not necessarily &quot;enjoyable&quot;, it is still an influential novel that is worth reading.
044100590X|5.0|I won't waste your time with a long review.  This is the most engaging novel I have ever read.  Read it!
0385720920|5.0|Novels. I hate reading...Haven't been able to pick up a book since those days in high school when we had to read these meaningless rags the called novels. I saw the film &quot;Fight Club&quot; a few years back, and today it remains one of my favourites! I jut happend to pick this book up in a book store and flipped through its pages. What I found on those pages was something I had not expected from a novel. I bought the book, and read it in five days.  The same guy that took two months to read &quot;Johnathan Livingston's Seagul&quot;. I couldn't put &quot;CHOKE&quot; down....it is disturbing, hilarious, and filled with beautiful sentences. You will laugh out loud on one page...and be angry the next. Buy this book....it is what every kid whose ever thought that society doesn't care about him should read. Bring it on!
B00005JLDW|5.0|The most wonderfully created dragons ever seen.  Bale is completely a different person from any others.  Great and lovely performance of his.  You'll come to love both QUINN and the DRAGONS.  Great action scenes of battles between dragons and humans.  Cool!
B000000ORE|5.0|I'm not your typical Tesla fan. I don't have a mullet, I prefer martinis over Budweiser and the closest other album that you might find in my CD collection would be Appetite for Destruction. My favorite band is Janes Addiction, I love classical music, fusion, trance, hip hop and some other genres as well. I'm all over the place, but I know good music when I hear it. I listened to Tesla when I was 14 or so, gave it up for a while, and after I saw them play live on their Replugged tour a decade later, I had such an amazing time I had to get into them again. I'm not on the latest emo-indie-minimalist wave, I'm listening to music that makes me feel good, and Tesla has been a staple for the last 2 years. This album is simply classic-great structure, dynamic emotions, killer chops from all the members, great solos and counterpoint between Frank and Tommy and just an overall sense of passion and power. Spinal Tap may joke about glam bands calling themselves \\"blues-jazz\\" to avoid embarrassment, but Tesla truly belongs in this genre. Troy's funky drum fills turn the rhythm section into something special. \\"Lazy Days Crazy Nights\\" has a menacing, mysterious ambiance to it, \\"Love Song\\" truly is a gorgeous song, \\"Party's Over\\" has superb harmonizing from the guitars, and even the semi-cheesy 80's songs are presented in a serious way. This is an essential 80's album, I will protect and support this band to the end. They're fantastic guys, down to earth and write amazing rock songs. Go Tesla!
B00005JKNF|5.0|I finally got around to watching Gosford Park on DVD, which was important for two reasons.  First, I could turn on the sub-titles because I was having a hard time following what everybody was saying (a point on which I observe I am not alone).  Second, the only thing I remembered about the movie was that we only see the rich folks when the servants are around.  This latter point was more important because it meant I did not really remember that the film was about and since I was not the one that picked up the DVD at the store, I did not see the cover with the rather subtle clue as to what would be going on eventually in this tale.<br />Aside: I was going to see this film in the theater after it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture, but you see I live in a town where after the nominations came out last year TWO OF THE MOVIES LEFT TOWN.  But then, I suppose we should just be grateful they came here at all (\\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" only came to the local \\"art\\" theater).<br />Actually I was enjoying watching the film without worrying what it was about.  The cast was weaving their little tapestry, but all those bottles of poison I kept seeing lying around seemed a bit foreboding.  No for me it was a pleasant surprise when it turned into a whodunit rather than a character study.  Yet clearly this is a quirky whodunit, since the investigating inspector does not get to finish a sentence for about a half hour during the proceedings.  He also seems to make a point of not looking at the clues, but that turns out alright because none of the clues are the real clues anyhow.<br />Besides, it is hard not to figure out whodunit, or at least half of it, which should lead to you figuring it all out, but you are never quite sure.  What delighted me about this film was that having figured out not only the \\"who\\" but what I thought was the \\"why,\\" I was pleasantly surprised to find another twist that made for a wholly satisfying conclusion in my opinion.<br />The cast, of course, is impeccable, which you can tell by the fact that Derek Jacobi is wasted in a small role; he must have wanted to work with Altman.  Maggie Smith is at the point where she can play parts like this in her sleep and while her Oscar nomination was a given, I would like to point out that Helen Mirren, the other Oscar nominated Supporting Actress from this film, is probably as good as Judi Dench but has not had the show stopping roles of Dame Judi.  Emily Watson and Kelly Macdonald end up being the most sympathetic figures in the bunch, especially since each becomes, in their own way, the center of the storm.<br />Finally, director Robert Altman's strength in this film is that he stays out of the way of what is going on.  After an initial shot where we see Lady Constance's maid waiting by the side of the car in the pouring rain for her Ladyship to get into the car first, I do not think there was another specific shot where it was obvious to me that the director was making me see something.  \\"Gosford Park\\" is an actors's film and that has usually been the primary constant in Altman's film.<br />This is not a great film (i.e., one I want to watch again and again), but it is a very good film (rare enough in these times).  It may not be your cup of tea, but certainly a film that looks unflinchingly at class distinctions would be well aware that there are two types of people in the world.

B00005JKLZ|1.0|okay, I own this DVD. And I am sorry. except for the absolutely superb special effects.  And Jeremy Irons doing his Edgar Winters impression as the smartest Warlock I've ever seen.<br />This movie starts out so perfect, and the effects are INCREDIBLE, but the film dies upon Guy Pierce waking among the Eloi, where the Old Language just happens to be perfect English. No learning curve. PUHLEASE!<br />So what would you do upon waking in the future? ASK WHERE YOUR DAMN MACHINE IS!!!! He doesn't. Instead, he melds with the Eloi.<br />And then, the movie grabs me with the absolutely perfect warlock graphics!<br />Perhaps I am too emerged in the greatness of the original Rod Taylor classic, but I have to say rent tis movie. If for nothing else, for Jeremy Irons. He deserves a supporting actor award here.<br />But to be real, don't buy it. rent it.<br />This review does not go into the plot. If you don't know about the Time Machine from H.G. Wells, you are a hermit.
B00005JLDW|2.0|Great FX and good acting plus a promising scenario bring the light to this movie, but it was ultimately only so-so.  Since I expected it to [stink] thanks to word-of-mouth, I was actually a little surprised I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Too many editing chops in this!  The scene where Van Zan finishes off the crashed dragon cuts too early.  The scene where he dies is too abrupt, and almost gives a cheap laugh instead of being heroic - all because it was edited too hastily.  I blinked at that scene and had to ask 'what happend to Van Zan?  Was he eaten or did he fall?'  The chopper pilot had bricks falling on her from like 20 meters, then in the next scene she's just limping.  WTF happened?  They should have had better editing and continuity.<br /><br />Also, the archangels scene, I think, should have been a success so we get a feeling for how good these guys and gals are.  It was kind of a letdown to see them bounce and fail instead of take down the dragon.  Otherwise, that was a great scene.  And what was with the triangulation on motorcycles?  It basically only provided a reason for the hero to ride out there on his horse.  They could have used the radar system they had to track the helicopter.<br /><br />Speaking of radar, the dragons would have been toast in the real world, if we assume they are mortal, as portrayed and described by Van Zam in the movie: \\"They have a heart, a brain, a liver.\\"  We could have used radar-directed anti-aircraft artillery like Russian ZSU-23, or the US Navy PHALANX CWIS - a weapon system that would rip a flesh-and-blood dragon the size of a fighter jet into a spray of blood, or shoulder-fired missiles to take out the 1,600 pound dragons, to say nothing of the capabilities of the fighter jets in the world's air forces.  The movie could have had a world that underwent a phase shift of types, in which our technology is rendered useless while the realm of magic comes alive - a world in which dragons are the ultimate embodiment of power.  But they had a mixed world in which dragons are supposed to be able to conquer us despite our technology, and this didn't really makes sense to me.<br /><br />Also, Van Zam either totally underestimated the strength of the main dragon, or he was dumb to have his column lined up so it would be completely consumed by one dragon strike.<br /><br />The dragons looked pretty good in this.  There were some good moments of action and humor.  It's just sad that this wasn't a greater movie.  It had all the elements of a great, intelligent action movie, but something got lost in the mix.  Hell, the hero didn't even get a kiss from the heroine in the end.  And what happened to all the female dragons?  Did they just dive into the sea out of despair when the one male was killed?<br /><br />Definitely wait for this to come out on TV, unless you just can't wait to see dragons, in which case it's worth DVD, I guess, but not theater.  Maybe the .99 cent theater, or a super cheap matinee.  On the light side, this movie will probably be good for kids under 14 who haven't seen so many movies and aren't particularly concerned with plot holes and missed opportunities.<br /><br />-- JJ Timminsof power.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|Herein lie the Beatle's number one chart toppers from the band's debut to disintegration.  It pretty much stands as a yardstick by which all of the pop music for the past 40 years can be measured, with no end in sight.  The Beatles' profound ability to make fun, purely enjoyable music is best represented by this collection.<br /><br />It's not a deep exploration of the Beatles' abilities and vision, but it's a great collection of fun, fun, fun songs to listen to and sing along with.  The Beatles' simple songs are packed with incredible rhythm, lyrics, and great instrument playing.  Overall, definitely a good purchase, though if you just collect all the Beatle's albums and rip the number ones off them and compile them on one disk you'd get the same effect...
B00000099Y|5.0|This is one cd you'll have trouble getting out of your cd player. It is one of the best hard rock cds to come out in the 90's. All of the songs are interesting and just plain great! But beware this cd isn't for everyone, most people who listen to main stream music probably just wouldn't &quot;get&quot; what is so great about this cd.
0684847817|5.0|This book has beautiful artwork, from intriguing and wonderfully dark at times, to bright and pretty.  I find it to not only be nice to look at, but an excellent visual for working with Fae in meditation or magick. The books I have used to far that explain how to work with the Fae don't provide the visual support, so its the perfect companion with, for example, Edain Mc Coy's guide to working with Faery Folk.  And once again, its BEAUTIFUL.  I can't wait to get the Oracle cards as well.
0316666343|4.0|This book was a great surprise for many reasons; I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did. People should definitely read this book, especially if you've recently lost someone regardless of how they died. This book has helped give me a new view on what the \\"afterlife\\" might possibly be like and made my mother's death more bearable.
B00003CXDB|5.0|The Last Emperor? What the hell was that? How did that win best picture of 1987? You are looking at the &quot;real best picture of 1987&quot; This is an all-around wonderful movie. With a great plot and even better characters. This has to be one of the most gripping and poignant movies that defined 1980's cinema and also characterized big business in Regan's America.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|... The acting, directing and screenwriting were stellar.  The only disappointment for me was that the movie was a whitewashed type of feel good vehicle for Ron Howard to do his typical (and typically well done) \\"triumph of the human spirit\\" silliness.  That doesn't cut down on the enjoyment factor, but it does mislead viewers into believing that John Nash, the subject of the movie, was a more wholesome person than history tells us he was.  The movie leaves out all of the unsavory moments in Nash's life, from his alleged torturing of animals as a child to his prior marriage and adultery (and some worse).  As a result, the audience learns to sympathize with a person who may not at all be sympathetic in real life.  As I said, it makes for a great movie, but don't go believing it.
B000066C6Z|5.0|I was sitting in my Algebra II class in 1984 (backrow) when the guy next to me starts telling me about the funniest movie he's ever seen playing in the movie theater. We ended up disrupting the whole class as he described various scenes:  Flaming Hog something-or-others, who Omar likes in the Virginia Slims Tournament, Nick adding the solder's name to the Montgomery Wards mailing list...oh, and the sight gags!! My favorite is Hillary measuring her long lost love.  According to her measuring tape, Nigel is QUITE a man! And Chocolate Moose...oh, don't get me started!<br />This is the best slapstick movie of all time. Too bad for the Zuckers, since it was all downhill from here. Val Kilmer is totally funny.
B00005JL3A|4.0|when i first saw this adaptaion of Capcom's Awesome game series, i  was left questioning; \\"where were the major characters like Chris (redfield) Jill, barry, wesker etc...but i realized that this movie was basically a prequel to the RE series. i guess that makes more sense. but as a whole i thought the movie wasn't as bad as i first thought, after seeing it over it's even better. paul anderson's latest game to movie attempt surpasses his movie adaptation of mortal kombaT. <br />The actors didn't really stand out enough for me except michelle rodrigquez (a hottie even with the tomb raideresque tomboy shorts) and this colin salmon guy who played commando leader one.<BR>too bad the producers offed him after the first 20 or so minutes.<br />the score was a combination of metal and syncronization  the best computerized horror/sci fi soundtrack sine john carpenter's escape from ny.<br />my fav moments had to be the dog scene,  red queen's warning and esp[ecially the last 10 minutes which i won't give it away for those who haven't seen it. i can't wait for the sequel.<br />hmm with resident evil,blade and now spiderman, sci/fi comic movies are making a big comeback mainstream 2002 will be best remembered for a trio of all too cool flicks which no doubt i'll own on DVD.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I know what people are thinking - \\"another DVD of this movie?\\" and if you already own a copy there really isn't a whole lot to recommend it beyond the creepy skin covered book that the DVD comes packaged in. If, however, you haven't purchased a copy of this film, this is the version you should put your money on. The DVD includes some interesting documentary features and really cool extras - while the book of the dead has some nice illustrations that are pretty creepy. If you haven't seen the film - what are you waiting for. You really need to read more reviews to be sure? Buy this movie already!
B000069CWE|5.0|Even though my name is hiphopforlife, I am also a rock fan , and one of my favorite bands is Linkin Park. I thought Hybrid Theory was somewhat original in mixing rap and rock and also electronica and some techno,and was a great album. I picked up Reanimation and was blown away! This is not only the best remix album out now, this is the greatest remix album of all time! (And as a longtime rap fan, I've heard a LOT of remix albums). Rather than do their hits over, they redid the whole album again,and completely different than than first, with a hip hop feel to it.And unlike the other wack remix albums, that feature wack producers like the Neptunes and weak rappers like P. Diddy, they got some of the underground's finest like Pharoahe Monch, the Roots Black Thought, Evidence of Dilated Peoples amd Chali 2Na of the Jurassic 5.The rock fan won't be dissapointed as alternative rock and metal's best frontmen show up like Staind's Aaron Lewis, Korn's Johnathan Davis and Orgy's Jay Gordon. this is fantastic work,and any hip hop, rock or music fan should have this. Bravo, Linkin Park!
B000009QPQ|3.0|In my opinion the best of the Jayhawks album, but the energy of the first three songs slowly wears out over the course of the album and never really comes back. I guess with some artists you just have to be a fan - and I'm, not the biggest Jayhawks fan,...
0345448898|3.0|Though the characters are captivating, and the world Pullman creates is vivid and rich, this series of books is NOT for readers under 15. Parents should be prepared to read the books with their children and engage in fairly complicated discussions about parental violence, the nature of God, and even budding sexual feelings.
6305841861|5.0|Okay, so this isn't a sequel - its basically a remake of the first film and it's better in many ways. The production is much sleeker than the first and it seems that the cast and crew were in on the joke and having a good time making the film - something that actually comes through while you watch. Bruce Campbell mugs and grins his way through a film that is gorier and funnier than the first and plays well in repeated viewings. Probably the best film in the series and a horror classic in its own right. They don't make them like this anymore. Heck, Sam Raimi certainly doesn't.
B00006690G|5.0|On this disc Eminem shares his views on everything from race to how much he loves his daughter. On the whole, the entire CD is a very good buy with consistent song quality. The skit interludes are a bit annoying after the first listen, but they also procide interesting commentary on society if you take the time to listen to them. The three best tracks on this CD are \\"White America\\" \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Sing for the Moment\\". The first two have been relased as singles and are typial of Eminem. The third, \\"Sing for the Moment\\" is an unexpected gem, commenting on music's influence on people in a slightly slower beat with more guitar than most Eminem songs. Here Em really shows himself, that even the king of controversy cares about something.  All the other songs on this album are worth listening to, but aren't as noteworthy as those three. On the whole, a good buy if you like any Eminem you might have heard, or if you're just curious. (And the \\"explicit lyrics\\" really aren't that bad, unless you listen really closely you won't notice it too much)
B00005JL3A|3.0|Here's the problem. The filmmaker - one Paul Anderson - discards the whole survival horror premise in exchange for a straight action shoot-em-up film. The result - the fun of the game is lost. The film is at its best when the characters come up against hordes of zombies - including a really cool homage to both Day and Dawn of the dead involving intestines. But there is absoloutely no wit to the film - it wants to take itself too seriously. And that is the biggest problem. This film should have been fun, campy, and have absoloutely no regard for itself as a serious film. Instead, it tries to scare with the subtlety of a smack on the back of the head - and fails.
B000069CWE|5.0|While certainly not a new album, this remix of the original Linkin Park disc, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; comes off well. The CD as a whole has a much stronger rap feel, although the rock element is stil there. Some songs, disappointingly are hardly changed and sound not different but worse than the originals. This however, does not detract from the overall quality of the CD as none of the tracks are truly &quot;bad&quot;. My personal favorite track on the album, and the reason I bought it in the first place, is &quot;MY&lt;DSMBR&quot;, a lonely, truly beautiful song, not on the original &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; release. The remix of &quot;KRWLNG&quot; also comes off well, the song becomes more mellow with some violin added at the beginning, the whole thing aquires a more introspective, soul searching air. Other good remixes are &quot;RNW@Y&quot; and &quot;FRGT/10&quot;. A good buy for any fan of Linkin Park, with the same level of quality found in &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;.
1558803602|5.0|I find it interesting that anyone would say this is a low point in Speilberg's career.  This movie is well thought out and there is a ton of attention to detail in it.  Anyone who thinks about everyday life and some of its difficulties will get this movie.  It's wonderful.
B00005R8GU|5.0|This is CD is awesome!!! Muddy Waters (the greatest blues singer of all time) is amazing, and the band rocks! Paul Butterfield plays the meanest harmonica you'll ever hear, Michael Bloomfield is a blues guitar MASTER, and Otis Spann is THE blues pianist. The songs are rerecordings of Muddy's earlier singles, but they are wonderful, even better than the originals. Any one who likes Muddy Waters or blues in general must own this album. It's possibly one of the finest blues albums ever recorded and the best collaboration between a blues singer and white rock musicians. Buy it!!
B000002KDG|4.0|I've been a huge Neil Young fan for over 30 years in all of his configurations -- Buffalo Springfield, CSNY, Crazy Horse, Solo etc. -- and have always been confused over the dichotomy of this album and the superior Live Rust.  Released only months apart and with the identical band, the two albums seem to mirror one another. However, Live Rust is much more comprehensive and captures Neil Young at the absolute height of his powers.  With the brilliant acoustic set (including Comes a Time and After the Gold Rush)and the incendiary electric set (including the definitive Like a Hurricane), Live Rust is simply a better and more complete album then Rust Never Sleeps Live.  If you want Neil Young and Crazy Horse live and at their pinnacle singing Neil's greatest songs - get Live Rust.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|It's pretty good for the most part. But I like how flawed it is as well. I like flawed films. You will probably like it.
B00005JKWJ|1.0|Nothing in this movie redeemed its deplorable violence.  The first Blade was original, interesting, and uber-cool.  Blade II is a shadow of the first; it is empty, cynical movie making, pandering to the dregs of (male) society.  There was nothing surprising about this movie; there was no story in this movie. It tried to make up for this by filling time with the most horrific, violent, bloody, disgusting scenes I have ever witnessed, but it didn't work.  It was violent without reason or cause.  All of the fight scenes looked staged, and all the technology, which was so ahead of its time in the first movie, looked dated and out of place.  Save your money and buy a genuine action movie -not a mimicry of one.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is their best album yet. Like women and wine these guys get better with age. The mood is chill and relaxing while still managing to maintain that slap funk energy they are so common for. Anyone with an open mind will love this. Those who haven't evolved might disagree. This is good stuff!
B00004SCX6|4.0|This album is typical Britney.  I mean, if you don't like her music, you won't like this album.  That's just the way it goes.  But for Britney lovers, this is way better than the first album.  The songs have good beats, and the slower songs aren't bad.  Even though some of the songs have a tendency to sound the same, so what?  That style works for her so she's obviously going to keep doing it.  But overall, I really liked this album.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater at the 12:01am showing the day it came out. :)  I love Harry Potter... I'm not a kid, just a kid at heart.  I probably can't say more about this movie than EVERYONE ELSE DID, (although waiting for the next one)...<BR><br /><BR>One thing I will add is that Amazon did a good job on the release and pricing of this movie.  I preordered the movie, at what I thought was a reasonable discount.  Then, when the movie came out, in many of my local store ads, it appeared for a lower price.  I was dissapointed, but figured there was nothing I could  do.  Low and behold, Amazon came through, and emailed me letting me know that they had reduced the price online, and were giving me a credit on my account.  This sorta turned out to be an Amazon review, more than a Harry Potter review, oh well.  They did well in my book.
B00000K0DK|5.0|Simply the greatest film ever made.  The use of the camera is absolutely stunning.  Genius at every turn.  Cameras moving through furniture, spectacular deep focus photography, interesting angles, the camera coming in through a sky light, alot of the movie is an illusion using drawings in lieu of actual sets, but who would know?  Look for brilliant compositions at every turn, particularly when the young Kane is taken from his home by Thatcher and in the night club where Susan Alexander performs.  My least favorite part of the movie:  Kane dancing and singing at the party w/ the greatest newspaper men.  This seems to be Welles wanting to show that he can dance and that he's the master of his domain.  Brilliant transition:<BR>&quot;Merry Xmas Charles&quot;, 20 years pass, &quot;and a happy New Year&quot;.  Note the use of lighting to highlight or de-highlight a character and make them seem mysterious/obscure.
0316666343|4.0|When Susie is murdered in the beginning of the novel LOVELY BONES, you don't know what to think.  It is an unusual beginning to read, and I found it interesting and curious.  Like Susie, I had little emotion at the beginning of her final moments on earth, because the way the novel expressed this didn't build up the arc of intensity in that manner.  It was only later, when I began to learn more, that I felt more.<br />I do not like books which are sensationalistic, and this is not like that. I do not like books which are overly sentimental even more, and this is not like that, either.  This is a novel of turns not taken, potentential not realized yet fulfilled anyway: through others...through others who continue to live.<br />It really is a fine novel.<br />I liked the slow fulfillment of the characters qualities--the humanity here is so palpable.  Small incidents are beautifully etched because of this.  I believe that the murdered girl, Susie, could be likened to a spokesperson for a \\"Small Town\\" type scenario.  Becuase she can see everything from her heaven, and can grasp certain things which people are feeling, the beauty that is transient life is expressed in an odd, yet fascinating and unique way.  Worth reading.  thanks, jean
0783229321|5.0|In my opinion, the funniest movie ever made.  John Belushi is absolutely hysterical, particularly as he makes his way through the cafeteria.  Classic line:  \\"What we need is an incredibly stupid gesture on somebody's part\\" .... \\"and we're just the ones to do it\\".
B00003CXI0|2.0|I, like most other people who have read the Harry Potter books loved them, their imagination, their unpredictability and their originality.  This film however, with the exeption of one or two scenes (such as the very well done quidditch scene), is nowhere near the quality of any of the books, even though some of the actors do in fact look as their characters are meant to, not many of the actors can actually act very well in my opinion and often seem false.  Mind you with books like the Harry Potter series, your imagination and the picture you have in your mind will always be much better than what they can show on the screen, therefore stick with the books!
0316776963|5.0|I first heard David Sedaris on public radio and found his essays to be extremely funny and insightful.  This book continues that tradition very well.<br />Sedaris is an autobiographer, a social satirist and a wit.  In some ways, however, he reminds me of the Jerry character on Seinfeld:  He is funny on his own, but is funniest when he is the straight man for the genuinely eccentric people in his life.  His family--from his beautiful sister who makes herself ugly to his foul-mouthed redneck brother to his sly, understated mother and his father, a screamingly funny IBM engineer with the strangest eating habits -- are the real stars here.  Even his partner, who gets relatively little play in this book, is great fun.<br />Each essay has something to recommend it.  While I thought the essays from France were more insightful and less humorous than the essays about his growing up, they all worked.  And several were so funny I was unable to read them to my wife because I was laughing too hard to get the words out.<br />Read this book for the humor and you will happily reflect later on some keen social commentary.  <br />(Note to earlier reviewer:  Sedaris is much funnier than Bryson, and for much longer stretches.)
0930289234|5.0|Simply Moore's best work that I have seen.  From the very first panel to the stunning opening pages of the final chapter, this work touched me deeply.  Read it, then read it again, then read it again.  By the fifth or sixth time you read it, you may have caught on to all the referencing involved.  If there is one graphic novel you are to be buried with when you die, rest your head on this.  Some may not appreciate the artwork, in that it is a little dated (being published in the mid-eighties), but the subtle nuances of the artist wholly capture the tense mood of the characters involved.  Please, do yourself the ultimate favour and purchase this, and just remember that we're all in this together.  Take something positive away from the experience of reading this beautiful piece of art.
6305313687|5.0|I hardly knew what this movie was about when we rented the DVD, but Norton's powerful performance quickly drew me in. As he preaches to his people he can nearly make you believe what he is saying. For the 1st time in my 33 years I began to understand why the Germans were swayed towards Hitler's twisted thinking. Norton's build and his tatoos only added to his character's power.On the night of the murders when he turns around with his hands up and stares at his brother you too become hypnotized by those eyes. The shower scene in prison is compelling although difficult to watch. Norton's change of heart is totally believable.This is a wonderful movie, an important movie which has a message. Maybe at this time in America we need to listen to it.
B00003000M|5.0|I understand why this album has been getting a lot of gruff from you devout Bob fans out there. I understand this because I am one as well. Beyond this, I believe that this is a smashing CD well worth buying. This CD is a very smooth blend of hip-hop and reggae music that flows so well that it just sounds, and feels right, as if it was originally intended to sound this way. A few exceptions to this are \\"Roots, Rock, Reggae\\" feat. Steven Tyler and Joe Perry in which the vocals are not Bob and the peace suffers from it, also Kinky Reggae\\" feat. The Marly Brothers and The Ghetto Youths Crew, which is just too much obnoxious hip-hop and it buries the original rasta sound. Other than that, this is one great CD. BUY IT NOW!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Like alot of people, I get turned off by commercial radio. Even more so, I get bothered when legitimate artists get misused and misrepresented by their radio singles. John Mayer is one of the artists. I just saw John at the Fox Theatre on August 3rd, and I think if ANYONE saw him play live they would be totally blown away by his talent, and being in the very front of the venue you could see the emotion on his face as he played, especially when he walked over to our section. But most people thought he was just another sell-out commercial artist, but they are sadly mistaken.                     <br /> When I bought \\"Room For Squares\\", I was really not knowing what to expect, because I bought his CD cause it was realitively cheap and the bonus disc had cover songs that were extremely respectable. I honestly had never heard of him, and I think it's fun to buy an artist based on curiousity, liked I did with Pete Yorn (which turned out to end up being one of my favorite CD's. John Mayer's lyrics and music hit me like a ton of bricks, cause he really said what was on my mind, and his music was just amazing as his talent as a lyricist. From the amazing acoustic opening tracks like \\"Why Georgia\\" and \\"My Stupid Mouth\\", the songs really talk about issues that we have a dealt with, and thoughts that have crossed your mind from time to time. The ballads are heart-tugging too, like \\"St.Patricks Day\\" and \\"Not Myself\\". There is a sort of gravity to these songs, and his honesty is what makes the songs so charming. <br />    His talent on the electric guitar is sparingly displayed on songs like \\"Neon\\" (which is an amazing live song) and \\"City Love\\", but the songs are still outstanding nonetheless. This album is definitely worth checking out, and it will become an essential part of record collection. If you like John Mayer, check out Jack Johnson and Martin Sexton (which he is on tour with right now). John Mayer is absolutely stunning live, and his electric guitar work is just downright crazy. His songs are undeniably catchy, but there is susbstance behind the sugar too. #1 on my top Albums of 2001.
B000066796|3.0|Director James Mangold tries mightily to create a romantic time travel movie whose focus is on love, not the paradoxes inherent in most time travel films.  In KATE & LEOPOLD, Mangold instead creates a much less amusing movie than what he undoubtedly intended.  First, Nicholas Meyer in TIME AFTER TIME did a much better job of plucking a Victorian gentleman out of the 19th century to find romance in the technological 20th century with a hip American woman.  Now, I have no particular qualms about borrowing ideas from past successes, but at some point in the updated version, the director must do something original.  Unfortunately, Mangold is content to let Meg Ryan, who has made a career of playing the ditsy cute blond, reprise a multitude of roles as Kate McKay, a modern career woman who begins the film in a way guaranteed to make the audience see her as a woman with serious romantic issues.  Kate has just dumped her long-standing boyfriend Stuart (Liev Schreiber), but disconcertingly keeps calling him and bothering him for petty reasons.  Into this falls (literally) a Victorian gentleman, Leopold, Duke of Albany (Hugh Jackman) who has time travelled from a 'portal' of time in 1876 to modern day Manhattan.  Stuart is a time traveler who is visiting 1876 Manhattan and unexpectedly brings Leopold back with him to now.  Nearly all of the charm of this film resides in Jackman, rather than in Ryan.  Jackman's Leopold sets to rest the often quoted canard that most women only say that they want a gentlemen, but really want a 'bad boy' to degrade them with oafish behavior.  Leopold is the quintessential gentleman who looks and acts the part.  He stands up when a lady enters the room.  He is unflaggingly polite.  He even uses words in a way that can charm a fluttering feminine heart.  With a man who apparently can have a variety of women, Mangold would have us believe that Leopold falls immediately in love with a woman who sees him only as the answer to a marketing problem fromher job.  I would have appreciated a softening of Kate's character to make the illusion of romance seem more seamless than it was.  It is not Jackman's fault that he cannot carry the movie on his broad shoulders, though he comes close.  Rather, when a romance flounders, the culprit is usually a miscasting of one of the leads or a clumsy hand on the director's part.  It would have taken more courage than Mangold had to choose another female to play Kate. Perhaps a better choice would have been to swap roles  with Kate's secretary (Natasha Lyonne), whose own goo-goo eyes at Leopold might have generated more chemistry.  Further, Mangold overlooks a chink in Leopold's chivalry.  During his return to 1876, Leopold is urged by his family to retrieve the family's finances by marriage with a wealthy, but clearly dorky-looking Miss Tree (Kristen Schaal).  They dance while his uncle announces that Leopold will soon claim an unknown bride, apparently the unglamorous Miss Tree.  When Kate swoops back into Leopold's time, we can see that she is being prepped as the receipient of his betrothal.  As soon as Leopold sees Kate, he illogically falls out of character by dismissing Miss Tree without so much as a by your leave. <BR>       At best, KATE & LEOPOLD is a mildly entertaining update of earlier and similar efforts.  I doubt if too many viewers connected more to Meg Ryan than to Hugh Jackman, who now proves that he is more than just a warmed-over update of Hugh Grant.  About the best thing that Mangold did was to avoid cluttering the movie with paradoxes of time travel.  Still, if he wants to become a force in directing, he must learn more about what makes his characters attractive both to each other and to the audience.
B000065U1N|5.0|Firstly let me just state that I have never been in combat. However this movie more than any other made me feel as if I was in a battle. Its grittly realism allows one to feel just how dirty, dangerous, mind-numbing, confusing, chaotic and scary a real battle must be. Sure there wasn't much character development but this is not a love story. I for one was not interested in the characters and their personalities. I was more interested in what actually happened and how it felt to be there and this film really achieved that. This movie is almost like a documentary. It also showed that the US Rangers were a little to gung-ho and they paid the price. The more professional DELTA clearly knew what they were talking about and one didn't see them taking out the ceramic plates of their combat jackets or leaving nightvision goggles and extra water behind. Overall the music, sound and visual effects are the best ever in a war movie. This DVD is just superb. I take my hat off to the producers and director. Well done.
B000002GVO|4.0|..., I just listened the thing to death...Because on this album were tremendously catchy songs played extremely well by Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh and the rest of the guys in the band...<br />My favorite songs fall into two main categories.  There are songs that really rock here...These include the song \\"Hotel California\\", \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\" and \\"Victim of Love\\" all of which I love for the biting lyrics and great guitar work.  Then there are the more sensitive songs which soothe like sweet summer evening breezes, songs such as \\"New Kid In Town\\" and the pretty \\"The Last Resort\\" and my favorite song on the album, \\"Try And Love Again\\" with its beautiful guitar duet - guitars playing parallel lines, but in lovely harmony with each other.  Then there's the beautiful environmental lament \\"The Last Resort\\" which is one of Don Henley's nicer preachy songs...<br />I suppose there are many who would consider this album a masterpiece.  For me, it's lost a little bit of its luster in the many repeated listenings over the years...However, it is still a very good album, definitely worth 4 stars.  A VERY GOOD ALBUM - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B00005JKHP|5.0|Like many Star Trek fans when Star Trek - The Motion Picture hit theaters in 1979 I was thrilled, amazed, excited . . . and just a wee bit disappointed.  The visuals were stunning, the Enterprise was unbelievably gorgeous (and has never looked better since) and the score blew me away.  Yet, the movie was clearly flawed: long, dark and surprisingly cold for a Star Trek adventure.  This new Director's Edition goes a long way toward fixing those problems.<BR>    The changes, though numerous, are mostly small: The addition of a moving star field to the overture, the cutting of Kirk's stilted and rather embarrassing \\"Oh, my god!\\" reaction to the transporter accident, the subtle cutting and shortening of the V'ger fly-over sequence.  But there are big changes too.  The asteroid explosion inside the wormhole was completely redone and greatly improved.  Through CGI digital magic we finally get to see the Vulcan landscape the way it was originally intended to be shown.  And when it's time for Kirk and company to leave the ship and meet V'ger itself, it's shown from an entirely different angle (using a combination of new CG and some original blue screen work that was never used), and we get to actually see the hexagonal block walkway being \\"constructed.\\"  And again, this is the way the scene was originally intended to be shown.  In fact, all of the added effects were based on original storyboards.<BR>Oh, yes, and they added lots and lots of sound.<BR>    As others have said, this edition does not fix all the problems-after all, Wise had to work with the live footage he had-but it is still a vast improvement.  I'm generally a little leery of \\"Director's Cuts\\" and special editions.  Lucas' reworking of the first three Star Wars movies seemed utterly pointless, and did more harm than good.  But STTMP is a movie that was crying out for retooling.  The movie was rushed through production, and Wise was never even given the chance to run the film by test audiences before the final cut.  This special edition is a real and overdue improvement: the pace of the film has been picked up (despite being about 5 minutes longer than the theatrical release) and the characters given just a bit more focus.  Even the additional sound effects seem to lift the movie from its dark and quiet hole and into the 23rd century.<BR>    And once you've watched the movie a few times, be sure to check out the extras.  One of the best features of this disk is the commentary.  Turn on the commentary and sit back and watch and listen as Robert Wise, Doug Trumbull, John Dykstra, Jerry Goldsmith and even Stephen Collins enlighten and provide new and intriguing insights into the making of STTMP.  This may be the best running commentary feature ever. Very, very interesting.  There are some great little documentaries on disk 2 as well, including \\"Redirecting the Future\\" about the work that went into producing this special edition.<BR>    If you are a Star Trek fan, buy this disk!  If you are someone who sorta-kinda liked this movie (but would never admit it in public) buy this disk.  Ah, heck.  Just buy it anyway.  If you've read this far you're obviously interested. You won't be disappointed.
0312966199|5.0|As not only an animal lover, but (hopefully) an up and coming veterinarian, James Herriots books seemed like a great thing to look into.<br />Herriot's books bring the Yorkshire countryside directly into your home. He brings the world of hard work, late nights, confusing symptoms, and the unknown of a vets life into the readers heart, but at the same time he also shows the thrill of pulling an animal back from the brink of death or bringing another life into the world.<br />This wonderful combination starts off when Herriot leaves for the RAF to fight in World War II, but as he goes through basic training his mind (and the book) wanders back to his days in Darrowby doing what he loves best.
B000001FMX|5.0|The New York Dolls' debut in 1973 is one of those rare albums that perfectly captures and expresses a rock'n'roll vision. Each song is composed and performed with a barely-contained chaos, an energy and ferocity that fairly bursts from your stereo--it sounds like it was recorded five minutes ago.<br /><br />Taking the new trend of \\"glam rock\\" to the extreme, the five members of the Dolls were ugly guys in drag who came off like slutty 16-year-old girls. This is not the sleek androgyny of a Bowie or the goofy goodtimes of Sweet, but dangerous, nasty, drunk guys who walked the mean streets of New York in women's clothes at a time when that was simply illegal. The Dolls outdid everybody, especially the bands that ripped them off and outsold them (I mean Kiss and Aerosmith).<br /><br />Every song here is a vicious slab of New York street 'tude, a spitting Bronx cheer, a cherry bomb lobbed into the music scene of the time. While contemporaneous bands like the Stooges and the Dictators also pursued similar approaches, the Dolls had their ace-in-the-hole: David Johansen.<br /><br />Johansen's gutterbum's Mick Jagger swagger and big-lipped smarm  and especially his lyrical bon-mots are what really make the Dolls. His lyrics are at once hilarious and deadly serious--none of the apocalyptic monosyllabic dumbness of Iggy (Disclaimer--I love the Stooges), none of the retardo-\\"Mad\\" magazine embarrassments of the Dictators here:<br /><br />\\"Well everyone's gone to your house<br />To shoot up in your room<br />But most of them are beautiful<br />And so obsessed with gloom<br />I aint' gonna be here when you all get home<br />They're always pickin' on me<br />They won't leave me alone\\"<br /><br />It's also captures everything about the Dolls' world that made them great: a celebration of the gritty urban life, the beauty and madness of the mean streets, the confusion and inferiority young people feel, as well as the drug-infested culture they were a part of. The opening song, \\"Personality Crisis\\" is exhilirating, Johansen screaming and the guitars blister the walls. The unformed personality of the protagonist is melting under the strain of the modern world: \\"Wondering how celebrities ever meet? Lookin' fine on television!\\"<br /><br />Other songs sting in equal measure: \\"Frankenstein\\" is a raging, 6-minute paean to teenage angst and sexual confusion--\\"Do ya think that you could make it with Frankenstein?\\" The end of \\"Vietnamese Baby\\" in its crescendo of futility and accusation: \\"Whatcha gonna do/Now that it's over?\\" has always seemed to me the inspiration behind the climax of the Sex Pistols' \\"God Save the Queen.\\"<br /><br />\\"Subway Train,\\" \\"Pills\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\" are remnants from a lost period of rock'n'roll: unabashed rave-ups, all hyper energy and guitar slashings. \\"Jet Boy\\" concludes this work of genius, and here Johansen reveals he's not the rock'n'roll stud, but Jet Boy: Jet Boy stole his baby! He admires the guy from afar, \\"flying around New York City so high.\\" In this last song you'll also get the greatest work from guitarists Sylvain Sylvain and Johnny Thunders--I've got a video of them performing this live and it is stunning. I think every glam/metal/hard rock duo copped all their moves from these two. (Thunders' post-Dolls band the Heartbreakers put out the sloppy classic \\"L.A.M.F\\" a few years later).<br /><br />This is a trashy, filthy, raunchy, funny rock'n'roll gem with nary a misstep that rivals anything else from the genre. Its air of urgency, teenage anxiety, and sheer abandonment keeps it in my Top 5 of greatest rock albums.tars blister the walls.

6304578482|5.0|I'd seen this movie on tv years ago, and what stayed in my memory most was the beautiful dance scene with Alan Cumming, Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!  It was so breathtaking!  Then a friend loaned us her copy which we saw last evening.  I still love the dance scene!  I'm determined now to buy my own copy so I can watch it over and over.  Oh, and the story is pure fun, and Lisa and Mira are cute, adorable and sexy.  Janeane Garafalo was terrific in this.  I just wish Mira could have done a more convincing job when she was in the office with Ramon crying out his name.  I think it would have been funnier if she'd done it the way Meg Ryan did it in \\"When Harry Met Sally\\".
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Obviously, this movie served no purpose other than to capitalize on the success of the video game and to excite prepubescent males who find Angelina Jolie attractive.  The fact that much of the publicity surrounding this movie involved the need for Jolie to wear breast enhancements in order to look more like the unrealistically-endowed Lara Croft - and that those enhancements made it more difficult for her to do stuntwork - says it all.  The script was awful; Jolie's acting (particularly her accent and sneering demeanor) was awful; the movie was awful.  If you're a fan of the game or have the hots for Jolie, this movie probably is worth renting, but it's certainly not worth owning.
0316666343|4.0|I picked this book up after all the great reviews on it. A lovely bone is beautifully written but the story skips. I found myself enjoying a chapter and wanting more but it ends so abruptly. I really truly enjoyed it until the end. Not enough closure. You find yourself going well what happen to so and so and were is so and so. If you like making the end than this is the book for you. Don't get me wrong it's a great book. But were is the good ending?
B000002J1I|4.0|Tormato is another Yes album often panned by critics and fans.  To some extent it's not as progressive as Yes's earlier material, but there's no denying that this is Yes.  The band was going through internal strife at the time, and that may have affected the writing, but the material is still top notch.  Don't Kill the Whale, Release Release and On the Silent Wings of Freedom are excellent songs.  Circus of Heaven is a wierd, but interesting, song.  Certainly not the album to start with, but definitely a must own.
B00005JL3A|2.0|This one should have been \\"The Night of the Living Dead\\" of the new millenium. Instead, we get a Matrix-like movie with amateurish directing, an incredibly irritating techno soundtrack and a mistalented cast. Ironically, Paul W.S. Anderson was also the director of 1995's \\"Mortal Kombat\\" ; perhaps the ONLY good videogame turned movie in cinema history. The success of this film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished, that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot that \\"Resident Evil\\" is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see the dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we get is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending.<br />And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and [mad]at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch \\"The Fast and the Furious\\". It was a great pleasure seeing her changed into a zombie at the end, at least we can all hope she will not be in the sequel.<br />It's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks to her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing of their product. The same thing can be said to \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\".<br />TRIVIA QUESTION: Try and count the number of microphones that mistakenly pop out at the top of the screen throughout the movie; you'll be surprised. Another vivid proof of a half-hearted attempt to bring a popular videogame franchise to the big screen.oft: Tomb Raider\\".<br />TRIVIA QUESTION: Try and count the number of microphones that mistakenly pop out at the top of the screen throughout the movie; you'll be surprised.

B000002J23|4.0|Drama often gets short shrift among Yes albums because it's the only Yes album without Jon Anderson.  However, Trevor Horn does a good job on the vocals.  Geoff Downes was not the keyboard wizard that Rick Wakeman was (who is), but he does a good job also.  The songs are a little heavier than most Yes songs, but they still are true to Yes's progressive roots, and Yes was headed in a more mainstream direction with the prior release, Tormato, anyway.  Tempus Fugit is one of Yes's best \\"short\\" songs, and Into the Lens and Machine Messiah are excellent as well.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I couldn't disagree more with the first review of this well<BR> crafted and down right fun cd. First of all,&quot; No Such Thing&quot; is such a breath of fresh air, compared to most of the mindless drivel on pop radio today. And while I am a fan of Dave Matthews<BR>I think comparisons are unfair. I think Mayer's sound is Unique<BR>and stands on its own merit. The songs are pop for sure but there<BR>is great guitar work and his lyrics are more insightful and certainly more understandable than some. Great guitar riffs and<BR>hooks and just plain good songs. Certainly a welcome sound in Todays era of Technopop and Boy Bands.
B000063NPX|4.0|... but for reasons other than recreational. You see, Beauty and the Beast is the ultimate metaphor for abusive relationships. Belle, of course, has been raised in a quaint, provincial village. She thinks she knows about men ( she keeps away from Gaston, of course ) but is dragged into the Beast's dangerous game. Belle feels that it is her duty to bring out the Prince Charming in the Beast, and so agrees to stay with him and hopefully change him. The household appliances ( clock, candle ) are various symbols of the Beast's anger management problem <BR>( the fire burning within him that makes him so beastly and the clock representing time in general ) and it goes on like that. The Forbidden West Wing represents men's power in society. The west wing is, of course, the wing from which American politics are run from. Belle, as a woman, is forbidden to go there. Eventually, however, she makes nice with the beast, deluding herself that she can indeed change him (\\"There's something sweet/and almost kind/but he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined ). And then there's the title song, sung by the teapot ( that boils over so frequently ). The title song includes lyrics such as, \\"Barely even friends/Then somebody bends/Unexpectedly\\". The somebody bending would be Belle, who has to change herself in order to please the Beast. The song continues with such lyrics as, \\"Just a little change/Small to say the least/Both a little scared/Neither one prepared/Beauty and the Beast.\\" This represents every girl's ultimate fantasy. One little change, and suddenly she and her man are together forever in their roles assigned by society: beauty and the beast. Finally, there's, <BR>\\"Tale as old as time/Song as old as rhyme/Beauty and the beast\\". Man has always been dominant over women in society, ever since Adam and Eve ( thus the tale as old as time would be the Holy Bible ) and the song as old as rhyme would be the \\"tune\\" every woman has to play to please her man.<BR>Are these little \\"dropped hints\\" intentionally placed ? Well, it's up to the viewer to decide.
B00003CXI1|3.0|This movie would be good---If u were into that sorta thing. I personally don't believe in witchcraft or wizardry, but it was an interesting movie. It's funny at times, and scary at times. It kinda makes me wonder when it's no longer a new release in the rental store---what section it would belong in. All in all, it was okay.
B000065U1N|4.0|I saw this movie the night that it opened, in a crowded theatre.  The sound, video and camera work were amazing. But i could not tell who was who.  everybody looked the same throughout the entire movie.  And then i realized, wasn't that the point? Do we not give soldiers uniforms to make them look similar?  Anyways, after watching the movie a few times, I can finaly follow each character, and it makes the movie easier to understand. Now i don't want to seem like a sadistic war freak, but i love watching this movie.  Pay attention to the use of camera angles, sounds and background colors.  You will be amazed by how Ridly Scott uses these simple composition tricks to creat a visual masterpiece.  Overall, it is a good movie. good story and GREAT visuals.  Now on to my pro's and con's<br />      PRO's<BR> * Great cinamatography<BR> * Good Acting<BR> * Realistic action<br />      CON's<BR> * Hard to follow story<BR> * slow at some points<BR> * Lack of character development
B00005Y228|4.0|Kylie's Fever is a great album if you want pop-py, dance music.  I love the song \\"Dancefloor\\" and her current hit single \\"Love At First Sight\\" is a wonderful song and has gotten a lot of airplay.  Hopefully Kylie will stun us again with another great album!
B00005YXZH|2.0|Don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible album, but as a professional musician and songwriter, I don't hear the &quot;greatness&quot; in this album, that so many people seem to proclaim. It's interesting and has some innovative approaches to some of the songs, but overall it doesn't hold up. You can definitely hear the Jay Bennett influence versus the Jeff Tweedy sections. I have to agree with the Warner execs who said that the album wasn't commercial,but I'll go further and say it isn't particularly good. In a year or two this copies of this album will infest the used CD bins, and in five years the few people who remember this album, will wonder what the big fuss was about.
B0000542D2|1.0|I don't see why anyone would want to listen or watch the Beatles. Let's go over the reasons why they they will never be considered a great pop act.<BR>1) Their songs aren't on top 40 radio stations! How can you possibly trust anything that isn't on top 40 radio stations or trumpted by rick dees or Jacor?<BR>2) P-Diddy didn't do any remixes of their songs. Everyone knows if your music is preconceived before 1990 and if Bad Boy records didn't incorporate it into some type of remix, it's irrelevant. I mean... come on people!<BR>3) They played their own instruments. ok, N'sync, the end all and be all of pop music don't play instruments. All of todays top acts needn't concern themselves with lesser things. <BR>4) They wrote their own music. this is laughable. again, why not capitalize on the great talent of \\"professional\\" song writers to do the lesser things? i don't get this.<BR>5) They weren't a pre-constructed like today's great bands. everyone knows that this is a long outdated process. how can you trust a process if it doesn't involve Simon Cowell or Lou Pearlman, whom as far as I'm concerned, define what the last word on what talent is!<BR>6) Finally, how can your music possibly be relevent, if your videos weren't \\"MTV Buzz\\" videos or made my McG? How would you know if the music's any good?
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I bought the 8-track of this back in the day and played it constantly. At the time my 8-track was beginning to die and in doing so started eating away my tape collection, so I would just take the tapes back and have them replaced at the record store. I quickly gave up on replacing the rest of my collection but I must have replaced this tape 15 times. (Of course the number increases with time) It's simply one of my favorite albums of all time so now having a remastered version with 2 extra songs isn't going to change my mind. It captures UFO at their very peak. Michael Schenker has always been one of my favorite rock guitarists and I've always felt he's been somewhat overlooked. (Perhaps due to his attitude?) I was out to lunch as far as catching them live (even though I saw just about every other big act that year) but this is the next best thing. If you like UFO at all, this has to become part of your collection.
B000066F6H|5.0|Not since \\"Dookie\\" and perhaps even all the way back to \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" or \\"Nevermind\\" has an album spent so much time in my CD player without being taken out.  I'll save all the comparisons to other current bands for other reviewers to cover.  All I'll say is that if you are as sick and tired of purchasing albums with only one or two good songs on them as I was, then this album is the one that you have been waiting for.
B000002HPT|5.0|From what I've read in reviews and in statements by bandmembers themselves, FII seems to be widely regarded as the band's &quot;Black Sheep&quot; release... Personally, I don't understand why it has inspired so much contempt and I certainly don't agree with the sentiment.<br />To me, Falling Into Infinity proves something that has been mostly lost in their work since... that Dream Theater are very well capable of playing technically complex music while still creating moving and melodic music - and are damn good at it. Every song is not an exercise in playing as many odd time-signatures as they can as quickly as as they can.. simply because they can. There is definite structure, restraint and solid songwriting contained on this CD.<br />What is very evident on FII is that the songs were written around phrasing, not time signatures. Whether this is by design or by chance, I don't know. But it works. What results is a work of music that flows but remains interesting. I really appreciate and enjoy this kind of writing.<br />A good example of phrasing over meter is &quot;Losing It&quot; by Rush, on their Signals album. &quot;Losing It&quot;, is mostly in 5/8, with bits in 4/4 and a middle part that is in alternating 5/8 and 6/8.. Yet because of the way the music is written and phrased across those meters, it's not &quot;in your face&quot; and the song actually has a lilting feel.. almost like it's swing time. <br />Another big complaint is that some of the songs are too &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;commercial&quot;.. To those who find fault with this I ask.. &quot;So what?&quot; Who, exactly, is to say that a Progressive band can't write a ballad or two? If some of the music on FII is to be considered DT's most commercial or &quot;worst&quot;, then I say that it *still* stands head and shoulders above the unoriginal, uninspired and uninteresting drivel out there today. Hey.. does anyone complain that Rush wrote &quot;Tears&quot; or &quot;Different Strings&quot;? I've neverheard any gripes.<br />Though many have complained about them, Songs like Anna Lee and Take Away My Pain are, to me, excellent, emotional and moving songs. No, they're not in 5/16 time or whatever.. but there's  some excellent vocal melodies and harmonies layered into those pieces and, all in all, they are very strong pieces. And that, to me, is paramount to playing in odd time.. I don't care how well you play in 7/8, if the resulting music isn't good... the song is ruined. However, a song written in 4/4 (apparently the bane of progressive music) that is well written, phrased, constructed and layered can be an incredibly moving piece of music. I believe Dream Theater has proven this on FII and, additionally, that they are well capable of pulling it off.<br />All in all, I think FII is an excellent album, with some strong song-writing that runs the gamut - from heavy and grinding, to grooving, to melodic and a hundred points in-between - and stands firmly in all respects. I give FII a solid 5 stars.

0385335482|2.0|I love to shop as much as the next gal, but the main character in this book was simply ridiculous.  She was incredibly irresponsible.  Dealing with stress and problems by spending money she really didn't have, then hoping some rich man would swoop in and save her?!  Please.  Like young women don't already have enough enough difficulty being independent and respected?! Grow up already.  Readers should grow up too, and stop encouraging this sexist drivel.  <br />Very disappointing.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Giving five stars to records like &quot;Tourist&quot; is a no-brainer.  Here is an album that stands in a class of its own.  There's no hype machine, no belly-baring vocalists, and none of the songs are ridiculously overproduced.  It's a winning basket of jazzed-up midtempo grooves with mild, electronic touches.  My first exposure to Saint Germain was the mid-tempo &quot;Sure Thing,&quot; which appears on a couple chillout compilations I own.  The beats slightly lean towards hip hop, coupled with bluesey guitars and a repetitive, yet seductive, vocal.  Other jams follow the same route, offering either laid back beats or mellowed-out house such as the track &quot;Pont des Arts.&quot;  If you need a good disc to relax to, or if you're looking to impress that first date, this is the disc to play.  It's one of the smartest, hippest CDs I own.
6305878323|1.0|This is a 5-star movie crammed into a 1-star DVD. If you're renting a movie, you only plan on seeing it once... when you buy a movie, you have bought the right to see it whenever you please for as long as you want.  This DVD has FORCED COMMERCIALS! You can not skip them and you are forced to fast-forward through them.  Instead of endearing you to the movies featured in the trailers, you eventually get so mad that the thought of those films makes your blood boil... especially if you already have purchased those films on DVD and you don't need to be coerced into buying them in the first place.<br />There is no excuse for this. Disney should offer refunds and/or replacement discs to those who purchased them on good faith.<br />In addition to the forced commercials, the tech specs are misleading and plain wrong. While the film is widescreen, it is NOT anamorphic as is claimed... this means that while it is in letterbox format, it is not in proper proportion and the images are slightly distorted.<br />Just throwing a movie on a round disk does not a DVD make and this is proof.<br />The movie is fantastic despite these shortcomings... but as the title of this review states - this is a DVD review, not the film. I'd advise waiting until a collector's edition comes out. A collector's edition is likely to contain more features such as interviews with the cast, out-takes and scenes from the Oscars for that year... and (one can only pray) no forced commercials.
B00004XMS0|3.0|The film version of BATMAN saw director Tim Burton ditch the campy 60s \\"KAPOW!\\" action and outrageous villians and go much deeper and darker. Michael Keaton IS Batman, evoking the same troubled character from the DC comics, and of course, Jack Nicholson as The Joker, a great character played brilliantly. Burton, master of the bizzare, was the perfect man to bring the legendary comic book to the screen, and he does it wonderfully. Danny Elfman's excellent score is another added plus, and the action is well done. The look of Gotham City is inventive and fascinating, creating a nuance of comic book-styled-action and dark storytelling.<br /><br />BATMAN RETURNS is much darker than the first film, yet still satisfying, popcorn-munching fun, with an apt blend of comic book action and trademark Burton weirdness. With Michael Keaton returning as the bat, Danny DeVito as the creepy pengiun and Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy Catwoman, Batman Returns has everything fans could want. The styilised look of Gotham City is fantastic. Danny Elfman's exciting yet creepy score fits perfectly with the film's tone. The only thing slightly amiss is the plot, but that hardly matters when it's Burton at the helm, and a sharp script and some witty one-liners make up for it's flaws.<br />BATMAN FOREVER has it's flaws, but it's still a solid entry into the franchise. Val Kilmer takes over the role of Bruce Wayne, and while he's not as good as Michael Keaton, he manages to portray the character well. Joining Kilmer is Chris O'Donnell as Robin, and the bad guys; Tommy Lee Jones as the disfigured \\"Two Face\\" and the suitably manic Jim Carrey as the crazed Riddler.  There are problems; the action takes over most of the time, leaving little in the way of exposition or plot for that matter. And the vertigo-inducing camera angles and frenetic pacing leaves the audience wanting something perhaps a little more grounded.<br />And then BATMAN AND ROBIN came along and killed the franchise. One of the worst movies ever made. Joel Schumacher owes me two hours of my life back!es ever made. Joel Schumacher owes me two hours of my life back!
B000063COX|4.0|This album is fantastic and it simply does not grow old!! For example, an Iron Maiden fan will seldom listen to 1987s SOMEWHERE IN TIME, for example. But he will always find himself listening to their debut.<BR>There are a few weak tracks here, like RUNNING FREE and IRON MAIDEN (they play it live until nowadays, dont what for)
B00005JL3A|5.0|Excelent soundtrack, plot following the games spirits and excellent special effects. This movie just plagues myself!<BR>Ok, so the movie doesn't give that Resident Evil game, feeling...so? who cares? If you want to see a movie that has gaming feeling just go play a game, movies are not games.<BR>This movie is excellent, the special effects are beatifull and even better, it has my favorite actress, Michelle Rodriguez!<BR>Personaly I wasn't a fan of Resident Evil games, but after watching the movie, I began to have that feeling of wanting to play every game. The soundtrack is something never seen before.... Simply excelent! I don't care if you blame me, because this movie just plagues myself!!!! \m/

B00000K19E|5.0|I view movies primarily to be entertained.  The Matrix is packed with action and visual effects that had me gasping. <br />There are four truly outstanding, memorable performances by the actors:  Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is erie and casts just the right tone of a man who has seen it all.  Carrie-Anne Moss is so right for the part of Trinity.  Hugo Weaving takes evil to a whole new level as the dead-pan Agent Smith.  And Gloria Foster as the Oracle steals the scene with that little twinkle and the cookies.<br />The details of the plot are only as complicated as they need to be to frame the story and allow for the action to take place.  Because, in the end, THAT is what drives the movie forward.  The viewer is invited along for the ride.  And what a Fun House ride it is!!<br />From the opening sequence where Trinity is trapped by local police, then runs (over rooftops), leaps through air for a flight-long tumble down steps and finally dashes into a phone booth about to be smashed by a huge trash truck, this viewer was left breathless and in awe of the power of this scene.  Why is she being chased?  What crime has she committed?  Who are the guys in the dark glasses and black suits?<br />After this, the action never really stops.  Gradually, we are given answers to the Why, What and Who as Keanu Reeves is recruited into an organization dedicated to giving the earth back to it's human batteries.<br />Sure, it's an outlandish plot, but I'm looking for entertainment in this movie, not great literature.  It's a fun movie and one that I have watched more than once.  So it was a good choice to add to our DVD collection.
B000062Y98|2.0|First of all, I think it´s absurd for a band to release an album featuring a title identical to Queen´s absolute masterpiece, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.<br />Second, even liking Blind Guardian a lot, I had enough of Hansi Kursch harsh adn full of acent vocals. It´s simply unbearable for me nowadays.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Where else are we ever going to see Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick and Tim Curry (three fine actors) camping it up in quite the same way?<br />There is a definite reason that this became a huge cult classic and still fills a theatre house with the faithful several times each week in many parts of the country.  (and here's a little clue) It's NOT the tightly plotted script or the quality of the acting.<br />I adore this very silly movie and regularly sing along with the songs, call out the best lines of dialog with the actors.  I do however refrain from toasting bread (&quot;a toast!&quot;) and refuse to shout the more vulgar insults that my kids told me about from their theatre days.  And, yes, I am unfortunately still a &quot;virgin&quot;.  I could never get up the nerve to go and now that I am braver, no theatre in Kansas City still shows it.  <br />Oh well, I have my own DVD, so I'm covered anytime that I want to see Doctor Frank-N-Furter descending once again from the La-bor-atory.

0380977788|5.0|As soon as I found out Neil Gaiman had a new book coming out, I started wriggling in anticipation.  When I found out it was a kids' book, I wasn't quite so excited.  Although I really like The Day I Swapped My Dad For 2 Goldfish, it was a bit skimpy on words.  I'm a quick reader, and I like my literary delving to take a while.<br />Coraline was a nice compromise.  It doesn't have the bulk of Neverwhere, but it's significantly longer than a short story.<br />The only quibble I have with the book is the portrayal of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's dogs.  At the onset, they're referred to as Highland Terriers (a white breed of dog), and later on, they're described as something completely different.  The editor missed that.  Ah well.  It's a minor quibble, and I wouldn't have noticed it if my grandmother hadn't had a Highland Terrier.<br />Like in Roald Dahl's books, high self-esteem isn't a typical characteristic of protagonists, and Coraline is no exception.  She's a bit unsure of herself, but comes into her own throughout the course of the book.<br />Dahl isn't the only author I'm reminded of, here.  The cat bears an uncanny similarity to Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat in attitude and surreality.  There are also shades of the Addams Family, with a certain perambulatory body part.  The sheer fabulist nature calls to mind scores of fairy tales:  the creepier ones, by authors like the Brothers Grimm and Perrault.<br />With its distorted mirror image world and button-eyed \\"other\\" mother, Coraline is a great book for any creepy kid or grownup.
B000063DIH|1.0|This was the last straw for Bruce Dickinson, who left the band soon after the tour of the album, because he knew things were not going to develop.<BR>FEAR OF THE DARK could be a great album, had it not be for some unebeliavable trash songs they included here: WEEKEND WARRIOR and THE APPARITION are the worst songs Maiden ever wrote up to that point. FROM HERE TO ETERNITY clones the very same chords and sequence from HOLY SMOKE (from the No Prayer for The Dying album).WASTED LOVE is a disastrous ballad, not because it tries to be a ballad, but just because it´s a BAD ballad.<br />AS for Janick´playing, I´m suspect to talk about it, because I think the guy just can´t compose a worthwhile guitar solo, he´s a mediocre guitar player at best, altough he has lots of energy.<br />Well, I bought all Maiden albums up till VIRTUAL ELEVEN, then sold all of them recorded in the nineties (from No Prayer for The dying onwards). Now I´ve bought BRAVE NEW WORLD, and did not sell it.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix, a film masterpiece for the 21st century.  There are many reasons to own, watch, or rent the Matrix, and I will give you a few of the most important.<br />1)  The special effects &amp; sound are like no other movie to date.  This movie blew me away.  I had the privelege of viewing this movie on a very large screen with digital sound in Washington, D.C.  The small screen does not really do this movie justice, but it can suffice if need be.  The sound is so crisp, and when the scenes go in slow-motion, it is like nothing you have ever seen before.<br />2)  Keanu is actually tolerable.  Reeves does a good job of being the main character, Neo, and it seems like the role was written for him.  He shines with the interplay between him and Larry Fishburn, and with the Special Agents who are trying to destroy him.<br />3)  The themes!  Is this our future?  Will computers rule the world?  Have we lost our soul?  What is real?  Will you swallow a blue or a red pill?  All issues you will be drawn into and have to digest as your view the Matrix.<br />Those are just a few, but all important reasons to see this generations new anthem of malaise and questioning.  The matrix is a movie, you just have to see.

0790729377|3.0|I'm curious to know if anyone has read the play.  Because, I want to know what they think of the ending in the movie version.  It completly changes the tone and subject of the movie!  Let me tell you something: this play was supposed to be about Blanche's tragedy.  Changing the ending takes that element away.  You can no longer call it a tragedy, and all of the sudden now the movie is about Stella.<br />Coming from someone who absolutely LOVED reading the play, I think this new ending is a complete cop out.  Well, it is.  I know it was forced on the studio from people who didn't think the original ending was &quot;appropriate.&quot;<br />My advice: read the play.  It's better.  Actually, the movie is also really good as well....except when it gets to the ending.<br />All in all, I was really disappointed with how it ended.  Should've stuck to the original ending that was in the play.  I would've given it 5 stars had it not been for the ridiculous &quot;forced&quot; ending.<br />But that's just one man's opinion.
B000069HKH|3.0|I have no doubt that Springsteen will ultimately redeem his standing as one of the greats, just as Dylan has. But this effort, when viewed through the long lense of time, will come to be regarded in the same class as Lucky Town. There is some good new material here - I especially like Mary's Place, You're Missing and Lonesome Day - but much of the rest of the album is forced with some awefully trite lyrics. If you want to remind yourself of what the man is capable of, I strongly recommend the first two discs of the recent box set, Tracks. <br />The hardest part of listening to each new effort from some of our old favorites is letting go of the past - artists reach their zenith and decline, just like all of us. Springsteen will rise again. We're just waiting for that sunny day.
1559409010|5.0|British humor is not something just anybody enjoys...but among the best stuff to savor or get started with is anything even vaguely Monty Python. I loved Brian because it's delightfully absurd, slightly offensive, and just plain wicked (in the British slang sense). All Monty Python films must be viewed ad nauseum to fully appreciate every little nuance, every subtle move, every damn line until it's fully etched into your weary little brain and can be recited at a moment's notice in the presence of those people you've probably seen before chattering on about Big Noses and such without realising they were communicating via their nerdy little Python fantasies...but I digress. You can't watch this once. It isn't possible. You shan't appreciate it until it's in your blood. Not for overly religious types or the feint of Faith. Good, bloody fun. Thou shalt purchase Life Of Brian and so mote it be!
B00005LQ04|3.0|Having seen reviewers that compared Dario Argento to Alfred Hitchcock and Kafka, I rented \\"Suspiria\\" and settled down for what I hoped would be a great movie experience.  Having watched it twice now, I'm STILL not sure what to think of it!!!<br />Hmmm...I think that if Dario Argento purposefully wanted to focus more attention on psychological terror, and less on story, I think he should have gone ALL the way with it.  It's a stylish, freaky film, but there are STILL boring moments of exposition and plot (I mean, really, who cares about the dance school?!).  I thought that the first 10 minutes or so of the movie were fantastic...from the atmospheric shots in the airport, the cab ride in the rain, to the first couple of murders, all accompanied by that insane music...absolutely ground-breaking and great.  But then after that, it all slows down.  There's the silly dressing-room scene (\\"people with names that begin with 's' are really snakes\\"), the dance practice scenes, the getting-to-know-the-staff scenes, etc.  Pretty boring.     <br />Either make the plot better, or GO FOR IT, and abandon plot exposition entirely.  Go all the way with the surrealism, or learn how to write a better script and story.  That's my view.<br />But I should say that I'm intrigued now, not only by this film, but by all the hype that surrounds Argento, his movies, and even his daughter.  Looking at reviews for his other \\"masterpieces,\\" I see frequent disclaimers about his convoluted and poorly executed plots, but he's still called the \\"Lovecraft of horror films.\\"  I saw his \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and was shocked at how ridiculously HORRIBLE it was.  I mean, really pathetic.  I haven't seen \\"Deep Red\\" or \\"Inferno\\" yet, but they've GOT to be better than that!  <br />In the end, \\"Suspiria\\" doesn't strike me as a \\"beautiful\\" \\"art\\" film...it's a supernatural slasher flick!  But the music, strange sets, and weird, colored lighting do add up to a strangely satisfying horror experience, far more interesting than any of the \\"Friday The 13th\\" sorts of movies.
6305546797|5.0|During the early 1980s horror films were steadily becoming very popular among moviegoers. Movies such as: Friday the 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street and Evil Dead to name a few were growing a frenzy fanbase. But none of them would have been made had it not been for the film \\"Halloween\\" which was released in 1978. All of the aforementioned movies were greatly and mostly inspired by Halloween. Halloween was the most successful independent movie made for its time with a budget of only $300,000, a very modest budget by Hollywood standards, no doubt.<br />The setting takes place in a nice little quiet town called Haddonfield. The plot revolves around a teenager named Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysitting a couple of kids on Halloween night. Little does she realize that this is one particular Halloween night that she will soon not forget. A deranged psychotic killer named Michael Myers (Nick Castle) just broke from a mental hospital and is on the loose in Haddonfield, who has a very committed task of doing some Halloween carving, with Laurie as his main target. Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode is outstanding as the lead, considering that this film was her very first, at the tender age of 18. She plays the role with a sense of vunerability and naiveness. Her next-door portrayal greatly receives the audiences's appeal and sympathy. Her friends, Linda (P.J. Soles) the bubblehead cheerleader, Annie (Nancy Loomis) the cynical and head-on-her shoulders girl, also give memoriable performances. Nick Caste as Michael Myers is to be commended for his performance as he moves with such scariness and determination. And finally, veteran stage and film actor Donald Pleasance is solid gold as the heroic Dr. Sam Loomis, who is desperately searching for his patient Michael Myers with intentions of recapturing him and locking him up for good, or killing him if necessary. Mr. Pleasance plays the role with a degree of authority and subtlety.<br /><br />Director John Carpenter does an excellent job of creating a very creepy and dark atmosphere within a typical American surburban town. Mr. Carpenter shows his mastery of the camera by providing scary shots such as dark spaces and ominious camera movements, coupled by some sound effects known as \\"stingers\\" and \\"alarms\\", along with blue-light backgrounds that greatly enhances the scary tone of the film. In addition, Mr. Carpenter also wrote the music for Halloween. The Halloween theme is played on a piano synthesizer in a staccato-like rhythm, which signifies terror, tension and an impending sense of doom. The film is well-made and contains in-joke references for film buffs.<br />As for the DVD quality, it is top notch. It contains widescreen presentation, as well as full-frame presentation reformatted to fit the tv screen. In addition, it has original theatrical trailers, television spots, radio spots, talent bios, still and poster gallery, behind-the-scenes still gallery, a documentary, and the DVD Halloween television version. An interesting note here about the television version. In 1980, NBC acquired the rights to the original Halloween film but was unable to air it on network television due to the fact that it was way under two hours. NBC insisted to John Carpenter and his people (using the crew of the Halloween 2 production team) to shoot 12 minutes of additional footage, in order to complete the 2 hour time slot (coupled with commericals, of course). Aside from that, there really is not much of a big difference, except that in the tv version, there is a scene where it is revealed that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis)is the sister of Michael Myers, something that was never featured in the theatrical release. So, go ahead and rent it, or better yet, buy it because it's a classic and is considered a worthy successor to the original \\"Psycho\\". To prove that, co-writers John Carpenter and Debra Hill used the name of Dr. Sam Loomis from Psycho, the character of Janet Leigh's boyfriend played by John Gavin. You'll get a good scare out of it, even if you're not a horror fan.John Gavin. You'll get a good scare out of it, even if you're not a horror fan.
B000069HKH|5.0|When I first heard that Bruce Springsteen was coming out with a new album, I was skepical.  I figured that it would be fairly solid but still lacking the greatness of his earlier albums.  Once I popped in the CD I was quickly proven wrong.  The album is incredible and if you are a Bruce Springsteen fan, don't be surprised if you get goose bumps the first couple of times you listen to it.  The E-street band clearly adds the lost element some of his more recent CD's have been missing.  Songs on the album range from catchy and radio friendly to deep and filled with meaning from 9/11.  Go out and get this CD now!!
B000002H97|4.0|Don't listen to the people who say this album was a sell-out by Metallica. There's still quite a lot of good material on this disc, among the highlights are \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Holier Than Thou\\", and one of my personal favorites \\"The Struggle Within\\", which is somewhat similar to an earlier song \\"Battery\\". <br />1. Enter Sandman- 10/10. A great way to kick off the Black Album, it's well paced and well written.<br />2. Sad But True- 7/10. A bit slower but still a pretty good song.<br />3. Holier Than Thou- 9/10. Metallica comes right back with a fast beat, up tempo song, and one of the album's finest moments.<br />4. The Unforgiven- 8/10. Well it's not quite as slow-paced as Nothing Else Matters this is nevertheless a deep, haunting song.<br />5. Wherever I May Roam- 6/10. Some may like it more than I do, but after a great beginning it runs out of gas near the end.<br />6. Don't Tread on Me- 6/10. Decent, but some lousy lyrics hurt it a bit; still, it's worth a couple spins anyway.<br />7. Through the Never- 8/10. Catchy beats, great guitars, and good lyrics. This one that will probably be stuck in your head for a while.<br />8. Nothing Else Matters- 8/10. This track caught me by surprise, as Metallica shows growth and maturity here. This song is steady and quiet and definitely worth a listen.<br />9. Of Wolf and Man- 7/10. Somewhat of a lame opening but it gets much better as it progresses, very eccentric for sure.<br />10. God That Failed- 8/10. Not a blazingly fast track but one that's entertaining throughout every minute and a terrific chorus.<br />11. My Friend of Misery- 7/10. Could have been shortened by a minute or two but another solid track, I especially liked the middle sequence even as it tails off towards the end.<br />12. Struggle Within- 10/10. Best song on the disc hands down, one of my top three Metallica songs along with \\"One\\" and \\"Battery\\". Lyrics are a standout and it's breakneck speed never let's up. The Black Album is one that every Metallica fanshould own, there's enough quality song writing here to satisfy the majority of metalheads.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is agreably Rush's strongest work. It is also unfortunatly the one album that received the most air play, giving great classics like Tom sawyer, Limelight or Red Barchetta the same fate of say Stairway to Heaven. Luckily, the entire album has tunes as good or better that are not so called radio hits.<br />If you have other albums by his artist, this one combinds the  heavy guitars of their early stuff and bridging sound of their later work. Moving Pictures is admittedly Rush's preceeding album , Permanat Waves, done much better. It also marks the end of that style. The next sudio album, Signals, has much more of the 80's synth sound, yet rockin' enough to keep a loyal fan base.<br />You will like every track on this CD. It may even cause you to purchase others. A warning, Thay have 20 + albums, making Rush an expensive but excellent collection to have.<br />Enjoy<br />...
0790732203|4.0|Despite the fact that this movie is roundly referred to (perhaps inaccurately) as a \\"coming-of-age\\" movie, it is also very much a movie for its time...by the time the 1980's were in full swing, materialism and the drive for success had already taken ahold of a surprisingly large number of teenagers who weren't merely interested in sex, drugs, and rock & roll (at least, not until they got their off-campus housing straightened out in time for the first semester of their Freshman year)...no, it was imperative that the important thing was to obtain a degree in Business Administration and to live happily ever after as a character in a Bret Easton Ellis novel.<br />><br />As such we have Joel Goodson (Tom Cruise) and his pals, a group of red-blooded American youths who stress over the usual teen angst but with a distinctly '80's flair...how can the future be so bright when you do NOT get to the (Ivy League) school of your choice?  Whatever will become of your life if, God forbid, you actually have to enter a publicly funded university?<br />><br />Everything else seems mildly incidental...there is a hint of \\"Ferriss Beuller\\" in that you just KNOW the main character will find a way out of all the bizarre situations that come his way, and like most of John Hughes movies from the same time period, the lifestyle portrayed onscreen may be lost to those of us of middle (or lower middle) class backgrounds, but the slick production, moody photography and fantastic soundtrack make it easy to appreciate regardless...in many ways this is like an extended \\"Miami Vice\\" episode...but without the gunplay.
B000060OWV|5.0|This is a great Robben Ford disc. It has seemed like he's been a bit unfocused lately, but this disc gets back to his roots and just kicks. Great guitar sound, great songs, great backing musicians. It's great to hear Robben with Roscoe Beck again. He's one of the few guys to play blues/rock with intelligence and virtuoso chops. He certainly doesn't play blues because it's the only thing he can do; his jazz fusion material from the '70's shows that. A must have...
B000065U1N|4.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a tremendous movie (all the more amazing when considering that about half the actors are either English, Scottish, or Australian...good job with the accents, mates!) that details the horror of close engagement in a manner that most people will (and in fact SHOULD) find to be very disturbing; as Clint Eastwood said in \\"Unforgiven\\", \\"It's a helluva thing, killing a man...\\" and with most modern, shoot-'em-up action movies that sense of death is never developed...victims are faceless extras whose only purpose is the same as that of the moribund red-shirted expendable crewman form the old \\"Star Trek\\" TV shows. A flash of light, a scream, some blood (maybe), and that person is sanitarily dismissed, never to be given a second thought for the rest of the movie.<br />><br />The violence in this movie SHOULD stick with the viewer...a person SHOULD understand the finality and the brutality by which a person's flesh is ripped from the body...because that is the reality of the event.<br />><br />Additionally, the supposed \\"lack of character development\\" that affects this movie is deliberate; this is not \\"Sergeant York\\", after all...it is not ONE MAN'S story of how he won the war...it is ONE TEAM of men strugling for survival under conditions for which the odds of doing so are rapidly diminishing...and in doing so become heroes, men whose service has to paralleled to that of the men who served in Vietnam...a generation of heroes trapped by their involvement in another unpopular war.<br />><br />....<br />><br />In short, you will be hard-pressed to find a more realistic screen adaptaion of what the reality of war in its simplest context is truly like...watch this if you're at all curious. For those few thin-skinned liberals out there who have an interest in war films, you might wish to check out \\"Three Kings\\" instead.

6304080921|5.0|Outstanding movie, very complex and intelligent, but you already knew that, so I'll ask my questions. First, why did the Madeline Stowe character, after meeting Bruce Willis for the first time, claim that she vaguely remembers him? Second, at the end of the movie, the David Morse character is on the plane sitting next to a woman who says she is in insurance. This is obviously the same person who is the woman scientist from 2035, at the same age. Who is she? Is she the mother of the scientist ( which in a post-apocalyptic world would be tough ) or is she the same scientist turned time traveller picking up where Bruce Willis left off? If so, did she assist the David Morse character or try to stop him?
B00005OAIE|1.0|I used to own this cd (for roughly 2 days).  now my copy is sleeping with the fishes.  This guy just goes on and on about his \\"issues\\" the whole album, and never caught my attention.  infact, he comes across as condescending pretty much the whole time.  i guess John Mayer is smarter than all of us.  i guarantee this stud won't even be remembered 2 years from now.  my sister recommended this cd to me, because i like matthews band.  but she should have just told me that he's just a dave matthews cover act and saved me the time and money.
6305144176|4.0|This flick really put Robin Williams on the map, and deservedly so- he's freakin' hilarious in this movie! Good acting jobs by all major roles; Forest Whitaker also does nicely as the \\"protege\\".<br />However, the fault of this movie is where it tries to be serious. Williams's politics are thinly veiled, as the only people who oppose anything he does (VC's, bully GI's, \\"the brass\\") are stereotypes. Nothing Haup or Dickerson say or do is ever pleasant or reflective of any redeeming qualities whatsoever. In addition, after picking oneself up from the floor from laughing at Williams's brilliant jokes, one can step back and understand (empathize?) why people might not have liked such comments as \\"If it's being done well, here or abroad, it's probably *not* being done by the U.S. Army!\\" Now, maybe that's true, maybe it's not, but a lot of people work (and worked) very hard to be sure that what the U.S. Army did is/was done well, and these people wouldn't be the jerks that Dickerson and Haup (sp?) are in this film if they took offense to a deejay like Williams's portrayal of Cronauer.<br />In short, watch this movie and enjoy the humor, but think twice before taking any sort of \\"deeper meaning\\" more seriously.
B000002UB3|5.0|As I say in my title, this album is one of the Beatles finest moments. I love every album by those four guys from Liverpool, but Abbey Road is in my top three. This is a complex, intelligent and unforgettable musical journey. Every song is a keeper.  From the extensive drumming and thought spinning lyrics of &quot;Come Together&quot;, to the subtle beauty of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, each one of the Beatles delivers on Abbey Road. And, do I even have to tell you how amazing the famous medley is? It barely leaves you time to take a breath. Easing through the complexity of Polythene Pam and She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, the medely is a brilliant masterwork in the world of music.  Abbey Road will forever be remembered as, simply stated, THE BEATLES.<br />P.S.-I happen to love the weird, happy and somewhat creepy &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;.
0345451325|5.0|I got this book basically because I was extremely bored and needed something simple to read.  I came across Halo and decided to give it a try.  I wasn't disappointed.  I hated the game and I really wasn't sure how the book would turn out.  Basically, its the prequel to the game version.  You'll learn the whole story of how the Spartan soldiers first emerged and what they faced.  The overall elements used to make this story up have all been seen and read before.  Nonetheless, the author managed to write a very entertaining story that was fairly descriptive of the futuristic worlds of humanity.  This is one that many of you could probably finish in a day or two, like I did, but its still worth the buy.  So check this one out.  Whether you liked the X-box game or not, you won't be disappointed.
B00000I0XW|4.0|I have a CD case that holds 8 discs. When I go on a trip, this one usually makes it in and goes with me.<br />The selections from Phantom are lovely, needless to say. The others I shall comment on individually:<br />Unexpected Song - a very beautiful, sweet song that I have learnt to like all over again<br />Chanson d'Enfance - a song in French. A bit plaintive but easily one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br />Don't Cry For Me Argentina - I don't really dig &quot;Evita&quot; a whole lot but I do like this song. I have to say that although I don't dig Madonna either, she did a better job singing this than Sarah Brightman does.<br />Another Suitcase in Another Hall - Another Favourite in my music selection<br />Love Changes Everything - a crash course on love and its positive and negative effects, to a gradually increasing beat. Wonderful song.<br />Amigos Para Sempre - She sings with Jos&eacute; Carreras. Not bad but not a favourite.<br />Memory - I love this song. It is so beautiful and who can sing it like Sarah? I like the end when there is a bar or two from the &quot;Phantom&quot; score - &quot;He's with me even now/Your hands are cold/All around me/Your face, Christine, it's white/etc&quot;<br />Gus, the Theatre Cat - Other than &quot;Memory&quot;, &quot;Cats&quot; is scratched out in my book.<br />Anything but Lonely - OK but not great.<br />Macavity the Mystery Cat - See comment on &quot;Gus&quot;.<br />Tell Me On a Sunday - See comment on &quot;Anything&quot;.<br />Pie Jesu - Another one of those songs you can't help loving. The boy she sings with here complements her perfectly.<br />So that is my boring synopsis. I hope it will help you in some small way at least. Because even with the songs I don't particularly care for, this is a CD worth having, and my favourite Sarah Brightman collection. Eden is also quite good.
B000028U0Y|5.0|For anyone who listened to the original Live At Folsom Prison on their Grandma's record player and didn't quite think it told the whole story, they have released this masterpiece of a performance.    I'm a young feller, but I do believe Johnny had the right idea when he went to play in prisons for prisoners.  It only seems right that he played for the people that were guilty of many of the crimes that are the basis of his songs.  How many rap artists go to prisons (on their own accord) to play for the people whose crimes they prosper from?  Not too many.  This unedited concert is Pure Cash playing for the people and not to satisfy the record company.  Though I myself am not religious, I appreciate that Johnny wasn't afraid to soften it down to play religious music for the prisoners.  It is masterpieces like this that are the basis for modern day musical enjoyment.  Any Johnny Cash fan (or classic country fan) will enjoy this album more so than any studio album because it captures a bard playing what the people want to hear and not what the company wants him to play.

B000069HKH|3.0|Bruce's new cd is 72 minutes with about 30 minutes of filler. it does have some great songs like the Rising and Lonesome Day, but overall many of the songs are very simplistic and repititious, especially the choruses. Into the Fire's chorus, obviously meant to be &quot;inspirational&quot;...&quot;may your faith give us faith, may your strength give us strength&quot; is just sappy and belongs on a Christian rock station. Max Weinberg's drums are high up in the mix so the tunes have the usual Boss fist-pumping feel, but a song like Waiting For a Sunny Day is just 87 era Mellencamp and not as good. Let's Be Friends and Mary's Place are strikingly repetitious with weak melodies and should've been left off, period. this is a feel good cd for people looking for a reason to believe after 9/11., but I think history will see The Rising for the mediocre offering that it is.
B0000508U6|4.0|Had thought I had never heard of Coldplay til I listened to this album.  Realized I had heard them on the radio.  This album is great for the long drive in the car.  Unhurried, calming and soothing...am able to think and actually form thoughts and conclusions while listening.
0140186409|5.0|Truthfully the only reason I read this novel is because it was part of my summer reading assignment this year for highschool. Somehow being told you HAVE to read a book rather than wanting to on your own makes the reading experience something to dread. Well all I can say is I am SO GLAD I HAD TO READ THIS!!!<br />  This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I have added it to my list of favorites way up there with Animal Farm (people think 'cause they read it in junior high it's for kids, WHATEVER!!)and Wuthering Heights. Every chapter is a feast for the mind. You can picture ever bead of sweat, every loss and tear as if it were right there in front of you. The story goes from humorous, to serious, to hopeful, to emotional so quickly you almost don't realize it's there till it hits you.<br />  The story takes place in the 30's based on real events, following the fictional accounts of the Joad family. Apparently back then, there was a crisis where farmers had overworked their land to the point where the soil had been reduced to worthless dust annd could no longer grow crops. The bank then had to take it from them because, well, god forbid they lose any money. Thousands, maybe millions of people were kicked out from their homes, the homes that their grandfathers had built, where children had been born and lives been lived.  They were forced to all move west to California, selling what little they had for cash, dreaming of a new life. Flyers promised work and good pay, but when only 10,000 workers are needed, and 100,000 see the flyers and come looking for work, what happens then?<br />  This is a story of survival. Not like in that movie Cast Away where he's stranded on a deserted island with no food or anything, but a time not unlike today. A place filled with stores and restaurants and yet a man still can't feed his children and they are dying from malnutrition. How can you buy food if you don't have any money? and how can you make money if there aren't any jobs? \\"water water everywhere and not a drop to drink\\". And hungry men become desperate, which turns into fear, which becomes anger, and this makes teh Californians afraid. So wages drop to pay for security, to pay for more sheriffs and police and spies, and all the while this anger grows...<br />  Like I said this is a wonderful book. I'm so glad I read it.<br />Some parts were so touching I actually cried a little. They weren't even necessarily sad but very moving. Anyway, I recommend this book to everyone as a great read. Yeah and to the person who said teenagers can't appreciate a book like this, I guess I just proved you wrong.ren't any jobs? \\"water water everywhere and not a drop to drink\\".

B00005JLHG|3.0|What a great idea to try to recapture on film, the Manchester music scene during the late 1970s to early 90s. Also called the \\"Madchester\\" music scene, it witnessed the birth of punk and the death of acid house. At the top of the music revolution, a philosophical tone presented itself; a sort of \\"music existentialism\\" one might say. Inspired by both the Situationist International and the art of Andy Warhol, a bored TV journalist named Tony Wilson, created Factory Records after catching one of the first Sex Pistols concerts. The company's philosophy centered more on partying than actually working. Their mode of operation in the style of total anarchy; no rules, no organization and no real desire to launch new careers or make money. What a great concept and subject for a movie! The talented Winterbottom attempts to fill the shoes of his characters, thus adapting his filmmaking to \\"Factory Records standards.\\" He shot the film on digital video, his actors equipped with radio mics. Their dialogue is mostly improvisation as they find their way through the scenes, and the credits are so cryptic and psychedelic, they are virtually unreadable. Well, guess what? Manchester is not \\"Madchester\\" anymore, the Sex Pistols are gone, and film is not the medium for a musical \\"improv.\\" Music back then had something to say or to scream rather, about life, the world, or better yet, how to approach both life and music. Winterbottom doesn't appear to have anything at all to say about this subject, not even through his characters. Wilson (the real one) confesses that he has \\"no talent but to hang out with geniuses,\\" and we feel it throughout the film. His character starts out as a bored journalist, and remains a boring music promoter. Wilson also says he tried to convince the filmmakers to make the film about the real geniuses, the musicians, but that they refused. Big mistake, because all this energy, passion and philosophy of life doesn't come through in the film, making it...well, boring. Even the idea of \\"people partying for 24 hours\\" is absent. The music was intellectual and emotional. The film is neither, leaving us cold and numb...

B00005B4GU|5.0|I've now purchased every major released album.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Excellent movie, great soundtrack and cool effects. This movie didn't get very good reviews from the \\"critics\\"... but who are they anyways? This movie is defiantly one to add to your Action / Science Fiction / Horror collection. For what the movie is based on and the amount of violence deemed to \\"neutralize\\" a Non-living hostile, there is very little gore. Even when those poor guys get Ginsued in that little hallway, it doesn't show what a mess it really would be... Instead it lets your gray matter ponder on it. This itself makes it very gruesome. The music is wonderfully placed and mixed, I never was a MM fan... I think he's the same thing Brittany Spears is to little normal preppy types that he is too little wanna-be Goths. But I have to admit, he did an excellent job with the soundtrack. The RE DVD is loaded with all kinds of stuff, which is a huge feature I love about DVDs. The only negative thing about this DVD I can say is that the Commentary is terrible. It would have been better if it was just the director, but they have the entire cast droning on and on about things that have little or nothing to do with the film.<br />There's a million little touches they did to make this movie cool, like when the zombie dog jumps in the air and gets shot in the head. For a split second you can see half of its head explode... very cool. There's a zombie with a broken ankle that walks around and you can hear its bones crunching as it walks around, and the very best little detail... The guy who gets sliced up into a bunch of little squares... his eye oozes just a little before he falls apart. What's not to like about RESIDENT EVIL?<br />Even the movie soundtrack is cool, they put a cool sample right in the beginning. Check it out.
B00005TT77|4.0|I think a lot of reviewers missed the point of this album - nobody expected the songs to sound BETTER than the Beatles renditions; what we expected and got were unique interpretations and yes reverence to the Beatles.  There is simply something about their music that transcends time.  I grew up with them and owned every record they ever made and I now have every cd including the Anthology set.  Yet, here I am buying a cd of their work performed by other artists - and LIKING IT!  That is the real tribute to the Beatles.  No one else has ever come close to the magic they produced, and on this cd no one tries.  But the covers are very interesting and most of them are worth a listen.  As for the four lads from Liverpool, their legend remains.  Name another group or individual that had a number one album 30 years after they stopped recording.

B00005NWM3|5.0|What can I say? This is what happens when you take a great band out of Toronto, let them have a little real world experiance, and then let them rip. The State was a great CD, but Chad Kroeger has obviously become much more confident in his vocals in the year in between. Here is my review of each song:<br />Never Again 8/10: This is the kind of song that you love when you first buy the CD. A true, horrifying story about domestic violence in the Kroeger household was the base for this. The chorus is great, but the verses become a bit tiring. This song is also going to be Nickelback's next single/video.<br />How You Remind Me 9/10: I think we've all heard this song before...I would give it more than a ten out of ten if it weren't overplayed, but facts remain facts. This is great song, from the light guitars mixed with light vocals in the verses, to the fast moving chorus, to the middle sped prechorus, this was a great first hit on Silver Side Up.<br />Woke Up This Morning 10/10: This is a great song! You can sense the anger in Chad Kroeger's voice as he nearly raps the verses away! I loved this song for the longest time, and I still do. Every part of it is good, including the fast choruses, the blanancing 'all of this' prechorus, and the downright catchy chorus. This song was a keeper.<br />Too Bad 7/10: This song's slow to fast then back to slow movement never reached out to me, really. Then, when this song became a hit, all the fun that was left in it in the first place was drained out by overplaying. The chorus is great, but it just doesn't match the versus. Sadly enough, this was also a true story at the Kroeger house.<br />Just For 8/10: This is a great song, but the chorus guitars are a little unoriginal. However, if you do own Curb, which also has this song (Just Four) on it, it's fun to see how much the band has improved in the time between the CDs. Also, the background in the verses is great.<br />Hollywood 8.5/10: I know what you're probably thinking. 'How can he like 'Hollywood'?!?!?' Well, it's one of those songs that just grows on you. From the opening two note riff, to the much advanced guitar solo, this song ends out being pretty good, except for the lack of lyrics in it.<br />Money Bough 6/10: I've heard a lot of great things about this song, and if you guys like it, that's really good for you. But I don't like the repetive beat, the repetitive chorus, or the repetitive lyrics. So, if you didn't pick up a hint, this is a repetitive song.<br />Where do I hide 10/10: I've heard rumors of this song being the Brandon Kroeger story, Chad's brother and Nickelback's drummer who just disappeared months before the State, but I'm not sure on that. Anyways, I love this song. The verses could have gotten a lot more put into them, but the chorus and the guitar parts are great.<br />Hangnail 10+/10: This is definately my favorite song on the album! It's very original, as most of Nickelback's songs have a mix of country and rock, this almost has a mix of swing and rock, the swing coming in right after the choruses. The lyrics and the style they are sung in are original, including the 'it's not worth it for me' part right before the chorus. If you are going to buy Silver Side Up, be sure to check this song out!<br />Good Times Gone 9.5/10: This is another song I disagree with the world on. Everyone thinks it sounds too country or too creepy, which it might before the first chorus, but after it picks up into definate rock. Pearl Jam became involved in this great song.
0446677450|1.0|As I read this book and I found myself feeling sorry for the \\"Poor Dad\\". To have spent his life working hard and sacrificing for his family, and the people of Hawaii, only to have his greatest notoriety come from his son writing about him so disrespectfully, broke my heart. Kiyosaki is simply a con man, exploiting people's hopes and dreams for his own gain and offering them nothing in return. He has no concept of what makes a person truly rich. He's a shallow, sad little man. Follow his advice and you'll end up the same - and you still won't have any money.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is great. Yeah it's no Blood Sugar Sex Magik but there will never be another one like it. I've been listening to By The Way nonstop and I love it. I'm not one of those people that only owns Californication. I have every album they've put out. And I love them all. For all you people that say it's not the same Chili Pepper as before, you're right they've changed their style of music slightly. But it's still awesome.<br />I have a question for everyone. Have you listened to the same style of music your whole life????? I know I haven't. I've listened to some popier stuff. I've listened to a lot of bands like Greenday and some like Bush. I've listened to funk and blues. I've always loved the Peppers. And I'll never stop listening to Hendrix, The Who, or Led Zeppelin.<br />I've listened to a lot of different styles of music. So if I can change what kind of music I listen to why can't The Red Hot Chili Peppers change the style of music they're playing????????? Is there some kind of law in music that says you can't change your style of music. I'm pretty sure there is not. I love this album it shows growth and change and everything's good on the whole thing. So stop criticizing them for changing I'll always love the Peppers no matter what they put out. LONG LIVE THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!!!!

B00005O5CM|5.0|\\"Legally Blonde\\" wasn't as good as I thought it would be, it was much better! I had always thought that it would be just another chick flick, dumb plot with stupid jokes. Nevertheless, I really wanted to try it out so when I did, I had a pleasantly fun surprise!<br />Sorority girl of Delta New, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), has it all. She's beautiful, everyone loves her, and she has the love of her life, Warner Huntington the 3rd (Matthew Davis). But on the night she believes he's going to propose to her, he instead dumps her big time! After being told she's not serious enough to be his wife if he's going to become a senator, she comes to a decision; to show him how serious she is, she'll go to Harvard Law School where she'll be near Warner! But when she does, she discovers he is already engaged to another student, Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair). With the help of a manicurist, Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), and support from the handsome Emmet Richmond (Luke Wilson) Elle decides to prove how smart she can be. Will Elle have enough heart to believe in herself to show the world the real person inside of her? Also starring Victor Garber as Professor Callahan and Ali Larter as Brooke Taylor who is being put on trial for murder.<br />\\"Legally Blonde\\" is not your usual chick flick, one of the reasons being that it falls in the category of a pure comedy since there really is not much romance is a way. The plot is as cute and as feel good as it gets, with an outcome you already guessed. But who cares since \\"Legally Blonde\\" ultimately satisfies you just the way it is!<br />Reese Witherspoon is terrific for her role as the cute and peppy girl, Elle Woods. She's incredibly funny and is very much into her role as the way she walks stylishly, swishes her hair, and 'like' talks the way which makes her so believable as a sorority girl. Her character is given some character development but not too much making it too much of a change. In the end she's still Elle, fun and lovable yet a much smarter girl. The supporting cast is also superb and it's hard not to mention all of them. I especially loved Luke Wilson, my first time to see him act though I've seen his brother Owen Wilson in many movies (\\"Behind Enemy Lines\\", \\"Shanghai Noon\\", \\"Meet the Parents\\"). Though Luke Wilson doesn't have that much screen time as I'd hoped, in every role his character Emmett is such a support to Elle. Matthew Davis is also good as the 'jerk' ex-boyfriends of Elle's. I mean from the very beginning you can't help but despise him in a way though he may seem like Elle's 'Prince Charming'. <br />As I have already mentioned, \\"Legally Blonde\\" is just so funny, filled with one-liners and very funny moments! There are plenty of favorite parts, some of mine including Elle's 'bend and snap' method, Elle's two friends coming to the court house saying, \\"How cute! There's a judge and the jury people!\\", Emmett giving tips on the professors, and lots more! Plus Bruiser, Elle's chihuahua is so adorable as she has as many different outfits as his master! Oh, and a bit of trivia, Reese Witherspoon's character wears 40 different hairstyles throughout the film! And a numerous array of outfits! <br />So if you're in mood for a fluffy and light comedy, check out \\"Legally Blonde\\", fun whether you're a blonde, brunette, or otherwise! Rated PG-13 for language and sexual reference.
0380973464|4.0|Going in to CRYPTONOMICON, I had absolutely no idea what to expect.  I'd never read anything by Neal Stephenson, nor had I read any blurbs or reviews of the book.  However, it had appeared on enough \\"Best Book\\" lists that I decided to give it a try.  And boy am I glad I did.<br />This novel is fun, huge, funny, rambling, witty, and sprawling.  It is clever, engaging, and well-paced.  It is full of quirky, eccentric, immensely likeable characters, crazy, interesting ideas, and amusing, often hilarious, looks at various situations including, but not limited to, mathematics, life, how to eat Cap'n Crunch properly, the purpose of beards, and well, just about anything else you can think of.  Obviously, then, this book is not for everyone.  Those who like tight, meticulously pared-down straightforward stories may not be able to get into this one.<br />For me, though, as you may have guessed from the title of the review, this book was an absolute joy to read.  The books chapters cycled between four main characters, and every time I finished a chapter I found myself in an awkward position: I didn't want to go on, because I wanted to keep reading about the character I'd been following.  However, by the end of the first paragraph of the next chapter, I'd be feeling the same way about the next character in the cycle. It was an odd feeling, and a tribute to the skill with which Stephenson created these characters that each of them was so completely engaging.<br />In addition to the main characters, the settings and situations were vivid and well-drawn.  Despite this books immensity and its tendency to ramble at length about inanity, it never got boring, and always retained its charm.  Stephenson provides us with a very amusing outlook on life.<br />However, this book is not without flaws, the two biggest of which have been noted in previous reviews:<br />1) Women.  There are no really well-developed female characters.  Most of the women have virtually no \\"screen time\\" at all, and the one who does have quite a bit of time is not fully realized as a character.  It would have been very helpful to have gotten inside her head once in a while.<br />2) The ending.  This book kind of just ends, without resolving properly.  It feels like it just cuts off, and that was kind of unsatisfactory.  Randy's story deserved at least another chapter or an epilogue of some sort to tie-up the plot.  Alas, Stephenson, at the end, couldn't deliver.<br />So, as I've said, this book is delightfully readable, and if not for the sudden ending, would easily have garnered a 5/5 rating.  I'm definitely looking forward to the next CRYPTONOMICON book (which, if I'm not mistaken, is intended to stand alone; it will not be a sequel, per se).
B000001ES4|3.0|I hate to be the only dissenting vote, but I bought this album and _Songs from a Secret Garden_ as Valentine's day gifts, based on the rave reviews.  Although it's lovely, I was looking for something special, and I have to say it isn't that.    Lovely, charming, and soothing, yes; special or extraordinary, no.  Secret Garden is fairly average New Age music, light and airy, but not compelling or memorable in the way the best New Age is.  I wouldn't have purchased it if I'd had access to sound samples at the time.
B0000683DH|5.0|This is simply the best Star Trek movie.  From the startling opening sequence, which appears to show the death of much loved Star Trek members, to the interplay between Spock and Kirk, and the themes of sacrifice and redemption, it is a stunner.  Yes, there is some ham-acting of the first order!!  But that's okay, this is Bill Shatner and Ricardo Montalban - you expect Shakespeare?  A thrilling ride with lots of surprises, and a stunning, first class ending that still brings tears to my eyes even on the 30th time of watching!  The Wrath of Khan is just the best.
B00005LW7R|3.0|One of a valecdictory series of discs for Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic, this Falstaff has a number of good moments to offer, but does not quite make a convincing whole.  Abbado secures brilliant playing from the BPO, and at frequently rapid speeds.  When the right frisson happens between singers and podium, as in much of Act 2, this is as lively a Falstaff as you'll ever hear.  I listened to Muti recently for direct comparison, for Muti and the more indigenous casting (compared to the veritable UN-style, Tower of Babel casting on Abbado - who poured the borscht over the pasta and tomato sauce?), and it turns out sounding studio-bound - live performance that it is. A Karajanesque malaise hangs over it, as well cast as his women are (preferable in the Nanneta and Quickly categories to the new set, particularly). Muti was a little too new to the score to be cutting a recording of it, under any circumstances.  (If he follows more the De Sabata model next time, instead of the Karajan, he might be able to work wonders).    Abbado lacks lyricism, or lyricism rounded by warmth - places that Muti capitalizes on more. Bryn Terfel makes a fine,warm, jolly fellow out of Falstaff, always with a personable twink in the eye (and to the phrase).  The broad nuancing in a few places betray that he is not quite entirely the natural as a Gobbi, Stabile, or Evans, but this is certainly no achievement to scoff at, and much preferable to the mannered Fischer-Dieskau or to the completely deadpan Pons (Muti). Thomas Hampson makes a handsome Ford, if without the traditional snarl of a Panerai (that Frontali drily emulates well for Muti).   There is more of a Mozartean lightness and roundness to this Ford (Stilwell similar on the Solti video) and his interaction with Terfel (and Abbado) in their scene together is brilliantly humorous, energizing Abbado and his forces to thier quicksilver, sleight-of-hand best. Adrienne Pieczkonka is a warm voiced, animated, supple Alice Ford.  If less Italianate than Dessi, she is more even voiced and equally animated for much of the role.  Dorothea Roschmann is also fine as Nannetta, if not as light voiced and magical in the final scene as her best rivals, or even O'Flynn on Muti.  Stella Doufexis (Meg) and the Caius, Bardolfo, and Pistola are all fine.        The only Italianate or Latin casting on Abbado is the Dr Caius of Ernesto Facini.  One would not feel so inclined to fly all the way to White Nights at the Kirov for a Falstaff, but this new set by Abbado gives an idea in a few places what such an evening might be like. What part of Snow Maiden inspired Verdi when he wrote Fenton's arioso?  Daniil Shtoda, an artist of some promise, even including for some Italian roles, I'll dare say, is a little miscast here. He makes a heroic Fenton, but a heroic Slavic Fenton at that. Ramon Vargas, also suffering a few intonation problems, conveys a little more charm in this part, for Muti.  And, c'mon guys.  The competition on the part of Quickly is simply too great (Elmo, Barbieri, Simionato, Horne, Ludwig, Manca di Nissa) to accept Diadkova here, histrionically brilliant and deep voiced an artist that she is.  What is \\"Po-VAY-ra Donna?\\"  What language is this?  Diadkova's voice also does not blend well with the other ladies, but tends to dominate trio, quartet groupings.  A major part of the wit in Falstaff depends on language sounding like something communicable between characters, and this Falstaff misses that a few too many times, thus also running contrarian to Abbado's stated point of view on this masterpiece, however good the intentions were. Abbado hears in Falstaff a lot of influence on 20th century music, as the liner notes tell us. It was a favorite opera of Ferrucio Busoni, for some of the very qualities that make the best passages on this recording work. Note the brilliant divisi near the end of Act 1, between the different strands of ensemble.      Where to turn?  Gobbi/Karajan, in spite of a humorless podium (made up by great solo work both from all the singers and within Philharmonia), and secondarily the Toscanini (very animated, if a little cold, studio-bound, and with a disastrous Fenton), or better yet,with sacrifice of sound quality, the live De Sabata (La Scala 1951) with a young Tebaldi, aging Mariano Stabile as Falstaff (a little weak on voice, long on humor and wisdom), and great casting the rest of the way.  De Sabata sacrifices cleanliness of ensemble between stage and pit in a few places, but listening to this set, you'd hate for anyone to go back and fix it.  There also exists the brilliant Solti/Friedrich video (Karan Armstrong, Friedrich's wife, cast as a very animated and sexually alluring Alice, if a bit unsteady vocally) with Gabriel Bacquier as Falstaff. Fruity sounding Nannetta aside, this is a must-see and definitely should be reissued on DVD soon.    I'd recommend Diadkova, Abbado, and the BPO no less, to reconvene for Folk Songs on a new disc of Luciano Berio. One might hear more influence that Falstaff has had than one might have first suspected.  Thinking about the idea for a moment, it isn't really as diabolical as it might sound, at first.  \\"Una parola. Che c'e in questa parola?

B000067CPX|5.0|The red hot chile pepers keep getting better and better. I think this is there best CD yet. I mean this is the BEST CD OF THE YEAR.  Some people just don't like it because they just don't know the Red hot Chili Pepers. I have been listing to this CD becuase it is the best CD. I know that this is the best CD and By the Way is the best song on it.  I know that there last CD was good but this is even better. I knwo if they make another cd it is going to be even better
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The biggest criticism of this cd -- and a valid criticism, certainly -- is that a lot of the great music from the film was left out. And while Volume 2 does much to correct that oversight, there STILL are several songs I wish they had included, or left in their original movie form. However, the selections on this cd stand out on their own, maintaining a constant upbeat feeling that makes it great for dancing or listening to in the car with your friends. :) My take on the individual tracks:<br />1. NATURE BOY: This is the song that opens the movie, but here it is performed by David Bowie rather than John Leguizamo (Toulouse-Lautrec). Whether you like Bowie or not (and generally I don't), his voice gives it a very poignant touch. A fitting song for the first track. 4.5 stars.<BR>2. LADY MARMALADE: Sung by Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya and Pink. I hated this song when I initially heard it, but it's grown on me quite a bit; you have to admit, it's pretty darn catchy! 4 stars.<BR>3. BECAUSE WE CAN: Fatboy Slim's frenetic techno piece, with Jim Broadbent's Zidler screaming, &quot;Because we can-can-can!&quot; The version from the movie (during the Can Can sequence) was SO much better -- considerably faster and overlaid with a sped-up &quot;Lady Marmalade,&quot; but this one is a lot of fun, too. 5 stars.<BR>4. SPARKLING DIAMONDS: Showcases Nicole Kidman at her singing best, with &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; and &quot;Material Girl.&quot; However, I prefer the original film version, which is bolder and more brassy. Ah well... 4.5 stars.<BR>5. RHYTHM OF THE NIGHT: It hardly appears in the movie at all and its inclusion in the soundtrack is kind of random, but it's an enjoyable dance song anyway -- more &quot;mainstream&quot; than the rest of the cd. 5 stars.<BR>6. YOUR SONG: Ewan McGregor's first number...God, if only a guy would sing like that to ME. *sigh* I think I was about as astounded as Satine when I heard this. An operatic tenor backs him up, which works surprisingly well. 5 stars.<BR>7. CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION: Maybe I'm biased because I don't like Bono's singing, but I find the tune of the song annoying anyway. A track I tend to skip over. 2 stars.<BR>8. ONE DAY I'LL FLY AWAY: Kidman doesn't quite pull this one off as well -- her voice comes out sounding on the weak &amp; breathy side. The song itself is lovely, though. 4 stars.<BR>9. DIAMOND DOGS: I believe this is originally a Bowie song, but it's performed here by Beck. I especially like the instrumentation and guitars here. 4 stars.<BR>10. ELEPHANT LOVE MEDLEY: There are so many different songs cobbled together in this duet, I can't count 'em all. Christian tries to woo Satine, who has her own cynical view on love...but that's about to change! The editing here really works to make it one unified, fluid track, and all the songs they picked are great. 5 stars.<BR>11. COME WHAT MAY: The emotional high point of the cd. The original orchestral version in Vol. 2 is more moving, but this one here actually works better as a song, with a more defined beat and structure. Also Ewan's voice dominates over Nicole's in the film version...not that I don't like listening to Ewan sing :) but this track is more successful as a real duet, with both voices melding together seamlessly. 5 stars.<BR>12. EL TANGO DE ROXANNE: The decision to put &quot;Roxanne&quot; to tango music was a stroke of genius. Ewan just oozes with jealously and despair in this track as Satine is forced to meet with the Duke in the tower. 5 stars.<BR>13. COMPLAINTE DE LA BUTTE: It's, um, nasal French. Actually, I do like the song, but it sort of wrecks the flow (and mood) of the cd. 3 stars.<BR>14. HINDI SAD DIAMONDS: One instance in which the cd version is superior to the movie's! It has a dark, driving beat accompanied by Hindu vocals, and its strangeness might not appeal to all listeners, but I LOVE it. 5 stars.<BR>15. NATURE BOY: Massive Attack's remix...I don't know why it's here. It's a really boring remix that doesn't add much to the soundtrack. 1 star.<br />So there you have it. :) Overall, a simply fantastic soundtrack that's bound to spend a lot of time in your cd player. But I recommend Volume 2 of the soundtrack as well to give you a &quot;fuller&quot; Moulin Rouge experience.
B000002MFE|5.0|I've listened to this cd countles times and cherish ever time i hear it.  It was the firs cd i ever bought (like ten years ago) and have bought another copy since because the first was worn out. (scratched and so forth)  the guitar is just fantastic and the variations of his songs are well done.  This award winning album is a must have for people of most musical tastes.
B00005JL3A|3.0|This movie wasn't bad. It just wasn't as good as it should have been.  R-rated movies are just too crippled to have any teeth most of the time. The movie had plenty of action once it got started, but it needs gore and blood spraying for the complete package. This movie had no gore and a female lead that could act but I like my women more voluptuous.  Story is confusing but unimportant anyway so don't worry about it.  American movies should not be censored or at least available in an uncut form because the audience for this type of movie demands it and this is the land of the free. When will these movie studios get a clue.  Movies rated for children are well and good but it's the adults that pay for them and we should be able to watch movies that cater to us too. In short, good concept but marginally executed.
B00003CXCS|1.0|This movie was made in the sixties, we live in the 21st century, GET OVER IT!
6305313687|5.0|I watched American History X for the first time about an hour ago. Having already seen a number of Edward Norton films, I expected nothing but brilliance from one of my favourite male actors. But I also knew that Norton, as spectacular of an artist as he is, could not single-handedly conceal the flaws of a less talented team of actors, and certainly not a poor script. I also knew that racism and hate were becoming cliche subjects, and that they have been losing the passion they used to inspire in American audiences. Feeling all these things, I popped the movie into the VCR and watched the film. All the skepticism I had had disappeared long before I reached the end credits.<br />A number of movies about the division of blacks and whites have been made through still prejudiced eyes, glorifying one view or the other. This movie's focus on racism and hate is unlike the others because the perspective we see the characters through changes during the movie. The black man is not pure good or pure evil, and neither is the white man. Rather than pointing out the differences between blacks and whites, the movie made me see only their similar struggles and conflicts, and their similar means of trying to resolve hate through suffering and bloodshed.<br />Also in most movies, there is a distinct line drawn between protagonists and antagonists. American History X is filled with such complex, disturbed, and impressionable characters that it is difficult at times to be sure who is who, ethically speaking. For example, Derek's (Norton's) motivating speeches about white supremacy and illegal immigrants are given with such confidence and leadership that at times, I find myself agreeing with his views. But when he is released from prison a changed man, I understand his newfound disgust with white supremacists, and find myself feeling sympathetic toward Derek. These feelings I have, along with the vulnerability and despair of the characters, make me believe absolutely that people are notborn hating each other, rather it is taught by those who have the power to influence people.<br />Along with Edward Norton's wonderful performance, I found Avery Brooks' role to be powerful and authoritative, to such a realistic extreme that I felt guilty whenever his lines were punishing, and reassured whenever his words were comforting. I have decided that Avery Brooks should have had a number of Samuel L. Jackson roles.<br />I guess I'll finish saying this: American History X has the power to force us to question ourselves and the people that influence our lives; to ask ourselves 'Do we believe what our role models are saying because we're truly listening, or are we so blinded by their glowing reputations that we couldn't distinguish right from wrong even if we tried?' There are so many more things I would like to say about how I feel about this movie, but I'd rather let you decide where you stand on things. I will probably write a ten page essay later.
6305268843|5.0|I stumbled upon this dreamy English movie one dreary day when I needed something to make me feel better. Having been the author of several ROMANCE novels myself, this movie was just the ticket to keep me happy for several fullfilling hours. The film has everything women want, believable love and lovemaking, real down to earth feelings between man, woman and child, gorgeous houses, original costumes and all the allure needed to fall headlong into the compelling storyline. Marvelous first rate acting by heroine, hero and child actress make this a must see for Romantics. I couldn't get enough of it and could see it again and again.
6305428425|5.0|High school-where every little thing you say, do and wear seems to matter so much and all those little &quot;disasters&quot; are magnified.  Then, it all just ends one day and all you have to look forward to is the occasional alumni update, and the dreaded reunion.  In the meantime, you try and start your life, while some of your classmates are still living theirs from high school. <BR>Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion took all of those things and turned them on their head.  It could have been the normal high school reunion movie where the main characters come back and show the &quot;A&quot; group how great they have become.  Instead, they learn they are just fine they way they are.  And, that the &quot;A&quot; crowd really didn't do that well anyway.<BR>Made me laugh, loved the music, loved the outfits and the interpretive dance.  I want to do one at my reunion, with the nerd who is now probably worth millions.
6300216268|5.0|One day I was feeling down and went to the video store to check out a movie.  I came across Harold and Maude and decided to give it a try.  When I watched that movie, I laughed, I cried, and I felt so deeply moved.  If you haven't seen it, it's hard to explain what makes H&amp;M so wonderful.  It's an experience that I think everyone should have.  I have forced most of my friends to watch it.  Yes, they initially think it's creepy about the age difference between Harold and Maude.  Yes, it's difficult convincing college kids to watch a 30+ year old movie.  But, when it's over, they too can see what makes Harold and Maude my all-time favorite movie.
B00000I07P|5.0|&quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; will always be their trademark. This is the album that defined to the public who Bon Jovi was. With their dashing looks and their musical genius, they were an instant success. This was one of my first tapes on my Stereo Boom Box. Yeah, that dates me righ tthere. Anyway.... every song on this album was amazing. I would listen to it over and over and I had chills. Their music touched me and this album started my love for Bon Jovi and more than love... .my respect. I should also add, my cousin Karen &amp; I had a dance to Livin' on a Prayer that we would perform for anyone who would watch ( I still remember the whole routine too). She was so jealous that I had the tape. It was great to be envied.
B000002KO3|5.0|Brian Eno is credited with the line that everybody who bought the first Velvet Underground Album started a band.  This brilliant album, which was constructed by Eno and Byrne in a NYC loft where friends and guests simply laid down track on top of track, should provide motivation and direction to thousands of folks who have recently put together home studios with macintoshes, pro tools and mackie mixers.  Get off your lazy butts, crank up the rhythm box, and start filling your sonic canvas.  <BR>   Houses in motions may be the best Head's song;  this is certainly the best Heads album, which compares favorably to Eno's own Green World masterpiece.  Would that such musical gems still rain on us as in times past.  (sorry, I'm kind of a whiney old fart)
B00005J73X|4.0|This review of One Wild Night wil be broken into 2 parts: flaws and aces (good points).<br />  flaw 1: This compilation is more than the title claims.... it is taken from concerts over the years.<br />  flaw 2:  The sound quality is sketchy. Some songs are great in sound while others are on the line of mediocracy.<br />  ace 1: This compilation is wonderful because it is taken from all the years and it shows all the phases on Bon Jovi<br />  ace 2: These songs are some of their greatest hits (although they missed a few good ones) all on one CD.<br />  ace 3: The audiences enthusiasm in virtually unparallelled and when listening to the album, you're adenaline starts pumping as if you were actually there.<br />All in all, this album is one of those albums you would choose to bring with you if you were trapped on a dessert island. It has a little bit of it all from one of the best bands of our time!
B00005NRN9|5.0|I saw Journey of Man in IMAX and was very impressed by it.  The wonderful Cirque du Soleil acts we have become accustomed to are as good as ever and set as they are in beautiful landscapes, they become even more beautiful in a surreal but intimately familiar way.  From the grace of an underwater ballet to the lively banquine, every act is a gem.  I especially liked the dance of two human marble statues with the theme of &quot;Love&quot;.  In addition, the soundtrack is inspiring and lovely.

B000068PQ0|4.0|This is my first real exposure to The Flaming Lips so my review isn't colored by previous works. As I listened to YBTPR, I found myself asking several questions. Questions like: what motivates a buch of guys from Oklahoma to create such a strange piece of music? Who were their influences? And do I like this stuff? As an answer to the last question...I think I do but it may take several more listens to discover all the subtle nuances that lie within. My question about influences stems from a feeling that this felt like a throwback to several different progressive music styles that I knew of, yet it wasn't an imitation of anyone in particular. The songs do not try to overwhelm the listener with any deep message.The music is accessible but slightly mysterious with a sense of humour thrown in every so often.  Though this may not be a masterpiece, I find it very comforting to know that there are musicians like The Flaming Lips who are courageous enough to move music in new directions at the risk of remaining unpopular. Five stars for integrity!
B000001EMW|5.0|This Cd is very well performanced.A wonderfull sound treatment and very nice for people who doesnt like metal but love good music
B00004Z459|1.0|a combination of poor raping and a few original beats made this band huge with so much undeserved attention
B0000076DH|5.0|The Grand Funk Railroad was a band that constantly reinvented themselves, almost with each album. At the beginning there were considered a Heavy Metal band (White Noise) of course even that part of there career has been reclassified as classic hard rock because of what Metal music has advanced too, but it cannot be said that GFR is at least not a grandfather of Heavy Metal. GFR's first two albums On Time and Grand Funk (what we GFR Fanatics call The Red Album) were extremely heavy and somewhat simplistic (also GREAT). So when Closer To Home Came out it singled a change. Now this &quot;heavy Metal Band&quot; is showing the ability to change and showing versatility and more sophisticated lyrics. Closer to home is more of a blues based album there GFRs pervious efforts and It also contains GFR magus Opus (Best song) in my opinion I'm Your Captain Closer To Home. Its wonderful song and singer Songwriter Mark Farner said it came to him in a dream and that he believe God gave him this song to be meaningful to people. It has been meaningful to me for over 30 years now and to millions of others as well. The song is just a beautiful blend of melodic Guitar chords (Mark Farner) a great lead bass line (Mel Schacher) and wonderful drumming along (Don Brewer) with great lead vocals by Mark and wonderful Harmonies between Mark and Don, take all that and include a great orchestra blended and you have an all time rock classic. Closer to Home is worth the price just for I'm Your Captain Closer To Home alone, but that is not all. This album is great from start to finish. Sin's a Good Man's Brother is a hard rocker with an infectious groove. Aimless Lady a cool Bluesy rocker. Nothing is the same showed more sophistication in lyric writing for the young band and it rocks as well. Mean Mistreater and is slow down for the band a bluesy song crying out for lost love. Get it together is a fun (mostly) instrumental a nice grove provided by the rhythm section (Don &amp; Mel) and some nice guitar chops at the end. Hooked On Love has that Gospel feel that influences much rock n roll from the 60s and early 70s, a typical we got to have Love song and a very good one. And I'm Your Captian/Closer to home which is GFRs magus opus as I said previously. IYC/CTH is one of rock n rolls classic songs and its simply a beautiful songs. Coming form GFR such a heavy band at the time it was a big surprise. This CD also includes shortened Am radio Versions of I'm Your Captian and Sin's A Good Man's Brother and both of these versions are very rear. This album shows GFR still with gritty power, but also shows striking maturity for the three young man, Mel, Don and Mark. This is one of Rock N Roll's classic hard rock album by one of Classic Rock's best bands. I would recommend this album to any hard rock/rock fan and any metal fan who wants to see the beginnings of modern hard rock and metal.itar chops at the end.

B000069CWE|4.0|Well I got the cd, and well some of the songs are pure genius, some aren't exactly ruined but could ahve been better, maybe to much rap =P. Generally it's like a rap/rock/techno mix haha. I tihnk it's a great cd really though, and made me fall back in love Linkin Park =),
B000002UR7|5.0|...I used to listen to OK Computer 24 hours a day - 7 days a week...then I got hooked on The Bends....Then Kid A....Then Amnesiac (with any other Radiohead CD I can find)...and I always just left Pablo Honey as the \\"other\\" album...the \\"rock\\" album that was a bit premature...I wrote it off....good listen, but not really addicting.<br />Boy was I wrong...just like any other of their albums, you need to listen to it a lot to get the full appreciation. I realize now that it IS 100% radiohead. Every aspect of their music is in here - in a wonderful raw form. There are times when I think this is their best album....I'm not kidding!!!<br />The guitar throughout this album is fantastic...the whining background feeds, the distortion, the acoustic...it's all there. You rocks with an amazing combination of angst  and sincerity...Creep (all you people that CRY about it being a sell-out song or whatever, give me a break...YOU ruined that song for yourself if you listened to it too much - or - if are influenced by what others think who's the real sell out) is one of the finest songs of the decade...the Punk influence in How Do You is wonderful - amazing lyrics across all these by the way...social message of Stop Whispering....Thinking About You might be my favorite radiohead song...so pure and unbridled...Anyone Can Play Guitar - I don't even really need to mention - it's another of their best...Ripcord - one of the most underated songs...Vegetable....Prove Yourself...I Can't...Lurgee...Blow Out....I can't get enough of any of these.<br />Seriously - you can't call yourself a radiohead fan if you don't appreciate this gem!
B00005YXZH|1.0|I thought I would hold out until I went to the concert to do this review, and after seeing Wilco here in Chicago last week, I can truthfully post this.  It was without a doubt the WORST concert I have every seen, and this CD may be the worst in my collection.  Except for 'Heavy Metal Drummer', this CD drones on and on in a single chord monotone that has me reaching for the razor blades.  Skip this one at all costs.<br />The only decent CD Wilco has put out in 'AM', so if you really want something from this band, get that one.
0684857820|4.0|While reading this book I had to remind myself that it was in fact a true story.  I could not put this book down, I had to know how Alice's life would turn out and how she would come through the terrible event which changed and affected her life forever.  It was interesting to see how she not only changed but those around her changed as did their reactions to her. <BR>An emotional and compelling read!

B00005QGAT|5.0|Although this album and Thriller run neck and neck for the best album of Michael Jackson's career, this one is the better of the two.  I like the special edition in that you get to hear from Rod Temperton and Quincy Jones.  I wish that Mike would get back with those two instead of running to a flash in the pan producer like Irv Gotti to try to get his career back on track.  The only gripe I have is that the special edition didn't use the original cover with Mike smiling standing in front of the wall.

B00000JLEP|5.0|In the absence of the availability of the Ashkenazy recording of these same works on the London CD label (I am a &quot;library listener&quot; right now!), I finally had a chance to listen to and study these orchestral works by Alexander Scriabin.  I found myself feeling impressed.<br />Many critics and detractors constantly point out the overly analytical aspect of Pierre Boulez's musical interpretations, a fact he himself admitted to.  However, I think that his thoughtfulness, knowledge of orchestral sonorities, attention to detail and architecture, and striving for perfection make for crisp, warm, and full-bodied interpretations.<br />The &quot;Poem of Ecstasy&quot; is performed with clarity, attention to detail, and an air of mystery.  Boulez's French background give this piece an overall sound and feeling that recalls his recording of &quot;Daphnis et Chloe,&quot; by Maurice Ravel.  The trumpet plays with excellent tone and clarity.  The strings seem to balance well with the rest of the orchestra.  Perhaps there is too much of a feeling of Ravel and Debussy in this piece, but I find the interpretation very convincing.  The final orchestral climax is most impressive, indeed!<br />Next, I found myself enjoying the collaboration of Anatol Ugorski and Boulez in the Piano Concerto in F-sharp minor and the &quot;Poem of Fire.&quot;  Ugorski plays with beauty, sensitivity, and crystalline clarity.  He is an accomplished virtuoso pianist.  Ugorski's playing shows the strong connection with Scriabin and his reverence for the piano music of Frederic Chopin.  The orchestra gives a performance full of precision and the attention to detail that never escapes Boulez.<br />The &quot;Poem of Fire&quot; is even more mysterious and evocative to me than the &quot;Poem of Ecstasy.&quot;  One can hear the increase of fourth chords, augmented chords, whole tone scales, and tritone modulations that give Scriabin's sound world its unique sonorities.  Once again, Ugorski gives a wonderfully detailed, evocative performance, and Boulez gives an outstanding accompaniment.  The sound quality of this CD is absolutely outstanding!<br />Overall, I understand that the Ashkenazy recording of these works is the definitive performance and recording of them, but one cannot go far wrong with this CD.  If you can overlook the &quot;Frenchness&quot; of this interpretation and don't mind thoughtful, analytical music-making, this CD is well worth your money and time investment.
B00005B4GU|1.0|although this is the only radiohead cd i have bought, i think that it is very overrated. listening to it is boring and there is aobut 1 song that acutally keeps my attention for about a minute. i dont think that they are some kind of genius's and there music is not complicated. it sounds like really bad, really slow techno or something.
B000002J1F|4.0|Firstly I'd like to state that I've never understood the fact that <BR>this album gave the band huge international success as I personally <BR>find thier previous album (The Yes Album) more interesting,and <BR>coherent with stronger material, however were not talking about that <BR>were talking about Fragile.<BR>It strikes me immediatly that theres not much fragility to Fragile, <BR>with the possible exception of Mood For A Day, a likeable piece of <BR>neo-classical noodling that follows on from &quot;The Clap&quot; in that its <BR>just Steve Howe, alone, on the recording, both pieces demonstrate a <BR>definate virtuosity from the guitarist. Out of the two MFAD is my <BR>favourite although The Clap is much more difficult to play.<BR>The reason for the presence or these &quot;twins&quot; isnt too obvious to me, <BR>evidently the band were showing what virtuosity was inherant in the <BR>band, (see also Cans &amp; Brahms) but I cant justify thier inclusion and <BR>would have thought they belonged on a solo work. Anyway, the album <BR>opens with the solid rocker &quot;Roundabout&quot; which even non-Yes fans <BR>adore (Pink Floyd did this with &quot;Money&quot;) and is sonically very <BR>interesting, I love the opening guitar figure, so delicate and <BR>lovely,complete with backwards something, (?), before the <BR>sladgehammer bass line pounds its way in with its growling menace. <BR>The song is that, a song, quite rocky, quite jolly, quite simple, but <BR>what makes it special for me, is the progressiveness of the <BR>interwoven passages, the interplay of all the musical elemants, <BR>staccato breaks, polyrhythms and sonic textures that give it <BR>spaciousness with precision.<BR>The stacatto breaks that preceed the &quot;bridge&quot; (I will remember you <BR>etc) lead to a middle section with a totally different metre and lilt <BR>which leads to different terittory, like a second movement, then just <BR>as you ve got used to this new environment the original re-enterson <BR>top of the one thats still down loading information to the brain, on <br />and on this rolls until the whole sonic picture grinds to a halt and <BR>were serenaded by the tranquility of that opening guitar figure <BR>again, this time backed by a trill of Rick Wakemans magic fingers <BR>carressing the synth keys, Jons voice, softly and tenderly re-<BR>appears..In And Around The Lake...a few bars of peaceful heaven, but <BR>were all in anticipation of all hell breaking loose once again with <BR>Ricks famous organ solo rocking our socks off , a manic prelude to a <BR>fine final verse, the best yet, completing a fine song, not truly <BR>prog, but song based prog..wonderfull, but not the best this opus has <BR>to offer.<BR>Small interludes of musical mayhem follow, some disorder..1:35 <BR>seconds here, 0:35 there (5% for nothing), 1:30 (We Have Heaven). <BR>This &quot;middle&quot; section of the album seems lacking in tangebility but <BR>some very diverse stuff, &quot;South Side Of The Sky&quot; starts with running <BR>footsteps and wind? entering into another heavy piece, a vehicle for <BR>Howe's characteristic chromaticism, every note he plays here has an <BR>attack and is played with a rapaciousness almost violently <BR>until...silence...a piano...complete metamophosis, vocals which <BR>harmonize with others, a bridge section of peace, a haven in your <BR>headphones, then its back to the original again for another dose of <BR>hard wearing rock!<BR>If this is not enough to confuse your senses the aforementioned 5% <BR>follows (confused!!).<BR>Most important to the work has to be the finale, coda, piece der <BR>resistance (in French), call it what you will but &quot;Heart Of The <BR>Sunrise&quot; represents 10:34 of progressive grandeur, seldomly matched <BR>by any other of this genre, a new form of rock opulance was created <BR>with this lavish production, I'm in heaven when I listen, still now, <BR>its technical brilliance still amazes my senses.The band beautifully <BR>manipulates the whole of its originality on the song, is it a song ? <BR>or an event? mild physical sensations are sometimes brought forth <BR>unusual tastes, with the eyes closed, colours abound and illusions <BR>can occur. Yes I love it...Thank the lord this track is included on <BR>the album, worth the money in itself !<BR>Whats it all about? I dont know, Yes music will always be an enigma <BR>to me, I prefer to look at it as a sound collage with no particular <BR>message, well, maybe one, music has no edges or boundaries, you cant <BR>confine it...yes, a very important message.

B000002HJD|5.0|From day one Jim Morrison saw himself as a poet, no more, no less. I sometimes wonder if he realized that he was creating with The Doors some of the most influential rock music of all time, certainly a lot of people at the time did and we especially know that now. \\"An American Prayer\\" is the album to listen to after going through \\"The Doors,\\" \\"Strange Days,\\" \\"Waiting For The Sun,\\" \\"The Soft Parade,\\" \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and \\"L.A. Woman\\" because it is the album that circles back to Morrison's essence and truth. While the albums brought fourth the pieces of his identity, \\"An American Prayer\\" puts the puzzle together, at least to show him as a poet. If you're looking for a rock album here, then don't bother, this is for people who enjoy words mingled with sound and imagination. And yet, fans of soft, soothing poetry shouldn't be desperate for this piece, what we get here is chilling, violent and dangerous visions that compete with the best of Sylvia Plath. Morrison's voice is truly that of a natural writer, it has a pace, an intellectual identity and reveals a man with a vivid imagination and brilliant capacity for creativity through words. We get rich imagery as in \\"Ghost Song,\\" frank perversity with \\"Lament\\" and there's even an exhilarating version of \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" which does fit and nicely leads into the next track, \\"Curses, Invocations.\\" The Doors music is timeless particularly not just because of the sound, but also the words which don't stick to a time and place, songs like \\"Five To One,\\" \\"Break On Through,\\" \\"Love Me Two Times\\" and \\"Strange Days,\\" all work perfectly with our times and the same can be said with Morrison's poetry. He invisions a dark, violent yet romantic world where danger and death lurk in one corner and bliss in another. This is true with our times, Lester Bangs once wrote that \\"The Rolling Stones were dirty but The Doors were dread and dread is the great fact of our time.\\" This is especially true, like the songs, Morrison's words here explorethings and ideas that never leave us, violence and fear are even more prevelant today than in 1967 or 1978 (when this album was made). One needs only to look at September 11. The album is filled with great moments, as when Morrison plays a hitchhiker who just killed a guy who gave him a ride, the mood is even more atmospheric with \\"Riders On The Storm\\" playing in the background. In many ways, \\"An American Prayer\\" plays like a movie for the ears, it is very vivid. True Doors fans will certainly enjoy it, it is definately my favorite piece of audio poetry. Like the music, it is timeless, evocative and unforgettable.
B000066NW0|4.0|she's beautifull, talented and rebel,this is avril lavigne and her album:let go.what can i say,it's huge!!! all the songs are great,but unfortunatly,not exactly all the songs,until the 8th song it's sublime but then the songs start to be a little boring like:things i'll never say and too much to ask (who's sound reminds me k's choice's songs)and of course my world who didn't go with the rst of the songs and nobody's fool who's little annoying with his rap intro (it's totally not avril's style) and by chance we have naked who ends really well this cd.even if some songs aren't that good (that's why i put 4 stars)the album on his totallity is amazing and for some songs avril can show us that she got a really beautifull and strong voice.i'm blown away because she's only 17 and i 18 and i would love to do what she do now,so congratulations avril,and stay as U R...and YOU serriously you must by the cd,so go now!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|Over the last five years it's been a rare occasion when I've purchased a CD, and an even rarer one when I've been glad that I did so.  I feel that bears mentioning, because I'm not just glad I purchased \\"The Rising\\", I'm ecstatic; it undoubtedly represents one of the most thoughtful, powerful discs in my entire collection. Over fifteen tracks, Springsteen explores the pain of 9/11, without exploiting it, and the results are remarkable.<br />Actually, only two tracks \\"Into the Fire\\" and the eponymous \\"The Rising\\" are direct \\"tributes\\", if you will.  Both pay homage to the raw courage that the FDNY showed that day as they charged in to the inferno.  In the first, Springsteen is almost praying to what he sees as newly minted spiritual beings: \\"May your strength give us strength, may your faith give us faith, may your hope give us hope, may your love give us love.\\" In \\"The Rising\\" he explores that transformation from flesh and blood heroes into something more.  It is a beautiful and comforting vision of firefighters rising up the stairs, only to painlessly rise into another dimension.  Like all of the tracks dealing with 9/11, he takes something horrible and sees hope.<br />The balance of the 9/11 tracks (about ¾ of the disc) are less obvious \\"stories\\" and are more concerned with the emotion of the moment, and related issues.  Of particular note in this category are:<BR> \\"Paradise\\" which explores the juxtaposition of a female Palestinian suicide bomber and her likewise female victim (this is an event that actually happened in the latest round of Mid-East violence). <BR>\\"Nothing Man\\" which considers the guilt of a survivor who is a hero to everyone but himself.<BR>\\"Your Missing\\" which is a heart wrenching song whose theme is easily deduced from the title.<BR>\\"Waitin\\" On A Sunny Day & my personal favorite, I'm actually not entirely sure this is specifically about 9/11, but the influence is definitely there, and the hopeful tone is undeniably welcome.<BR>\\"Lonesome Day\\" which considers the need to have foresight, to cope and move on.<BR>And last but not least, \\"My City of Ruins\\", while actually written prior to 9/11, it is impossible that its final form was not influenced by that day.  This is perhaps the best cut on the disc; it represents Springsteen's own plea for spiritual guidance, a crutch for his seemingly irrepressible hope in these difficult times<br />The remaining non-9/11 tracks are generally excellent, and while on any other album they would be fine, they represent my one (small) complaint with \\"The Rising\\".  Again, they are on par with the other tracks, but because they deviate from the theme of the bulk of the songs, they break up the flow of the album. That is by no means a reason not to buy this disc, but I suspect you will find yourself skipping around rather than listening to the album straight through.<br />Musically, \\"The Rising\\" is excellent; Springsteen's voice is in fine, gravelly form, and the arrangements are unique, but still distinctly Bruce's.  One item of note is that uber-producer Brendan O'Brien produced this album.  More generally associated with the Seattle sound, he brings many unique elements to the table (strings, funky little riffs, interesting percussive arrangements) without overproducing the album.<br />\\"The Rising\\" is destined to take home a huge haul of Emmy's this year, and for once they will go to a deserving album.  Springsteen has eloquently captured the horror of 9/11 and somehow injected into it an element of hope.  This album is a poetic examination of the triumph of the human spirit that is both uplifting and contemplative.  As we approach the anniversary of that awful day, it is reassuring to have Springsteen at our side, showing us the way out of the pain.
B000060MML|5.0|Genius!! Pure Genius!! If you like the Dropkick Murphys then your going to love Flogging Molly.  I've seen them in concert twice and no one plays Celtic Punk like Flogging Molly.  Each song is a hit and then they hit you harder.  One of my personal favorites is &quot;Rebels Of The Sacred Heart&quot;, but who cares what I think check it out for yourself. And if you are Irish, like me, or just in to Celtic music you will love this album or their other album &quot;Swagger&quot;. This is definitely an band to drink to. So grab your Guiness or beer of choice and get ready for a flogging, me lad.
B00000BKE1|5.0|It does seem that many people whether fans or not, don't like this album. It does seem this way because some of the songs are weak. There is no point in masking the truth. I find it hard to enjoy The Apparition and Weekend Warrior. Wasting Love and From Here to Enternity lack in areas too, but if you took those away you'd have a killer album. But as they are there you may be wondering why I gave Fear of the Dark five stars. Frankly no album or even song is perfect, there's always somehting that's annoying. Then fans don't like the album because of Janick being in the band (it's BS), but don't get me started on that. He's a great guitarist. Anyhow, the album opens with the riveting Be Quick Or Be Dead. Great Guitars and sounds good live too. From Here To Eternity, lyrics aren't that imaginative, but Steve deserves to have a little slack. My Second Favorite Song is Afraid to Shoot Strangers. Written by Steve, its about the souls who fought in the Gulf war. The beginning is so subtle; its a gentle guitar tune that explodes into a inferno of percussion. Then at the end, it winds down back to the same guitar tune. It's terrific. Fear is the Key is tolerable and has a good beat. Childhood's end is my third second favorite song. Great lyrics. Wasting Love has intersting drums if you listen closely. The Fugitive is my third first favorite song. It's about a fugitive (DUH!). It has a distinctive chorus and great bass playing. Chains of Misery is has a kind of swing beat to it that's somehow pleasing to listen to.<BR>The Apparition is incredibly irritating. There's a heavy whack on the snare drum and obnoxious guitar filling between it for almost the whole song. Judas Be My Guide is a welcome change. The chorus of this song is probably the best one on the album. Weekend Warrior is so surprisingly grotesque that I would have had to write Parental Discretion Advised as the title or the first sentence of the is review. And finally, we have the album titled song. I'll start by saying all the songs on this album could \\"be real bad\\" besides the last one but I'd still get for Fear of the Dark. (Actually I'd probably just get the single). This song however is totally, completely, there's no other word for it, Kick-\\"butt\\"!There's a mass of commotion to start it off, but then, like Afraid to Shoot Strangers, it goes quiet with the humming guitar. Then it launches itself into a whirling tornado of music and lyrics. This song is unbelievable. It quiets down at the end again and then fades out. What a song!! I urge you to look for a live edition of it too, because I am sure this one was written to be played onstage! It will knock your socks off I swear to God. In short, this album desererves a lot more respect than its receiving.
B0000640VO|4.0|Since the beginning we notice something different. Amelie is not just an ordinary comedy, but the reflection of our desires of freedom, pasion, love and, of course, a little of revenge against whoever deserves it.<br />In the movie, we are witnesses of the adventures of Amelie, since her birth till her quest for true love. We discover magic is also knowing our neigborghs, taking care of the people we are constantly in touch with, as the guy in the store, the old man at the door, etc. And we can also truly enjoy the little things about being alive, by seeing the ways of Amelie taking care of an old boring father, an excentric boss, or a mistery in the photo machines at the central station.<br />The action is as fast as it would be in a thriller flick, but here we are enjoying a comedy. Definitely a great movie to see and to enjoy.
B000066NW0|4.0|I saw Avril perform on Regis & Kelly and really liked her voice a lot so I thought I'd give her cd a shot!  I was pleasantly surprised with how good it actually is!  I don't think this girl is a one hit wonder...she actually has some talent.  I highly recommend picking this up!  :)
0743517849|4.0|The statistical data presented in \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" goes a long way to explaining how wealth in America is actually spread.  Having well defined definitions of being `wealthy,' along with the examples of actual spending and lifestyle habits of people with a net worth over a million dollars brings out in perfect detail how to decipher what are the myths of being rich and what is the reality of having sufficient wealth.<br />I do not know if the study of wealth by Dr. Stanley and Dr. Danko was originally meant to showcase different ethnic backgrounds and there attitude toward money and wealth, but I was very pleased they presented these breakdowns.  I personally would have liked to see some comparison of African American millionaires and how this (my) culture ranked in this study, but I can not condemn this great book based on this issue alone.
B000002N2P|5.0|I'll keep this brief because there is little point in heavily analyzing this band. Green Day is constantly bashed because they &quot;only know 3 chords&quot; and other ridiculous assertions, but I say so what if they do? There is one thing I know and that is that this album flat out rocks. I'm not a guy given to dancing around or showing much emotion but whenever I hear of of the tracks on this gem I can't stop my head from flailing around out of control. And that's all I have to say about that.
B000000WFZ|3.0|I have come to the conclusion after many listenings to this soundtrack that Vangelis 1492 film score is much better and more varied in content,(not so boring)! The soundtrack is much more powerful when used in the films poetic narrative. I even wish I would not have bought this soundtrack and bought Vangelis Spiral album. This Soundtrack is too monotonous to really keep me interested,Morricone should have used different themes instead of the same one over an over an over,lol...
B00003CXE7|5.0|It's exactly what you expect to see in a movie.Great shots-beautiful landscapes-action-drama-the fall and rise of a hero-great battles.
B00005RFVL|5.0|This album is completely unlike his others.  He pulls together some of the best rat pack songs for this incredible album.  He has a wonderful voice and the big band sound behind him gives the album a full, rich sound.  I have spent a lot of time trying to pull together Sinatra, Martin, etc. CDs together to get a nice mix of swing, but this has it all on one CD.<br />A must for any Robbie fan OR any swing/rat pack fan.
B000069HKH|2.0|Being a 20 plus year fan of Bruce Springsteen and The E-Street Band I could almost predict the next note that was to be played on each song.  Bruce's words were rehashed from previous songs.  The only one that was worth the cost of the CD was &quot;Counting on a Miracle&quot; because he allowed Little Steven sing harmony and you could almost hear him if you listened close enough.  The remainder of the songs did nothing for me.  I was greatly disappointed.  Next time I'll just get out one of my old albums and pretend they are still that good.
B00005OAIE|4.0|First of all let me say that this a fantastic album...a fantastic album. I only write that twice because I want it to be clear. However, I do have a few things to say about comparing John Mayer to DMB. I don't think that it is a fair comparison. First because John Mayer's band doesn't have a world class drummer such as Carter Beauford...who knows how to play jazz and rock and of course fusion...he can do it all. Second he doesn't have a world class violinist such as Boyd Tinsley who can play classical or country or rock...he can do it all. Third he doesn't have a world class saxophonist such as Leroi Moore who can play Alto, Soprano, Baritone, and Tenor saxophone at the same level and at times beyond the past jazz greats such as John Coltrane...Coleman Hawkins...Canonball...and so on. Fourth he doesn't have a world class bassist such as Stefan Lessard. And finally he is not anywhere near the level of talented and gifted individual that Dave Matthews is. Listen to Rememeber Two Things...the Dave Matthews Band's first album. You can tell that they were just starting out but it is sort of at the level of musical quality that this album Room For Squares is at. But then listen to the masterpieces such as Under The Table and Dreaming...then listen to Crash...no no no it doesn't stop there...then listen to Before These Crowded Streets...then move on to Everyday...then finally Busted Stuff. All these albums are Masterpieces. In a phrase, John Mayer has got a long way to go. But he could get there. But it isn't fair in my opinion to compare him to the Dave Matthews Band. Since the DMB is a very special group of talented and gifted musicians and Dave Matthews in particular putting his exceptional poetic lyrics to music...they have been proving themselves for years with masterpieces time after time. You won't ever see another group like DMB...maybe ones with similarities...but not identical. So I would like to say congratulations to John because he should have a very successful career...but in his own way with his own fans.
0446677450|4.0|This book does alot to change the way you think about money.  Although the story telling gets a little dull at times, I found this book very informative.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Its always a shame to see such lavish special effects spent on a mediocre movie.  I haven't seen the original in a long time but as far as I can tell this is a scene-for-scene remake.<br />The effects are impressive;  the music is overpowering, intrusive and just plain awful.  On the plus side, there are a few attempts at &quot;humour&quot;.<br />As big Summer movies go it could have been much worse.
B000069HKH|5.0|Well... it does.  Whether you are a hard-core Springsteen fan or a &quot;let's-see-what-he's-up-to&quot; type of fan (my category), you can't help but be impressed by the range -- emotional and musical -- that is displayed on this disc.  After each song, I say, &quot;OK, that's my favorite cut.&quot;  Yes, there may be some filler here, but it's more like good pacing than unnecessary cuts.  From the incredibly moving &quot;You're Missing&quot; to the romping &quot;Mary's Place,&quot; the album succeeds on all levels.  Very cool work.  My only question:  Where was Clarence?  I wouldn't have minded Bruce letting Clarence cut loose a little more often.
0875847706|4.0|I met Benjamin Zander several times, as the company I work for had him present at several leadership type meetings.  He had a profound impact on my life.  I went from thinking that I worked for an insurance company, to working for a company that helps to keep people healthy and living full lives.  His ideas appear simple, almost child-like, yet they make total and complete sense in the big-bad grown-up world.  Taking these simple steps lets you live a more joyous, purposfull life.  I highly recommend this book, and if you ever get a chance to see Zander, whether conducting a symphony, or discussing his philosophy, please take the chance...it will be inspiring!
B00005JL3A|3.0|I wasn't expecting much when I began watching Resident Evil, so I was not so much disappointed with it. The plot is completely non-existent, the scenes just an excuse to lots of shots, punchs, kicks, etc. You know from the beginning who is the bad guy, how the end is going to be, all that. The low point of the movie is Michelle Rodriguez, from whose face we understand she's suffering severe pains in some kind of vital organ (in the real life, not in the movie). The high point is Milla Jovovich, more beautiful than ever. She is the only reason for someone to watch Resident Evil more than once. Milla is not hysteric like in \\"Joan of Arc\\", and not stupid like in \\"The fifth element\\". She is plainly gorgeous, and her almost-gone kind of voice is very atractive.<br />I give Resident Evil three stars: one for some of the action scenes, who were well done, and two for Milla, one for each of her lovely blue eyes.<br />Grade: 5.1/10
B000066NW0|5.0|this is the best c.d. you will ever listen to avril is the best and is the best thing that has happened to music!!!
B000002IST|5.0|After &quot;We can't dance&quot;, Phil Collins left Genesis, and I thought to myself that the almost thirty year old band was over. When, with new members, &quot;Calling all stations&quot; was released, I was sure Genesis had finished after &quot;We can't dance&quot;. Collins' departure was not like Peter Gabriel's departure. In 1975, Genesis was able to keep on going because Collins boldly took over the band spirit, and changed Genesis' style to keep up with the market. And I think that was great. After Gabriel's departure Genesis still could count on four amazingly talented musicians to write and execute its songs. This fact is so true that &quot;A trick of the tail&quot;, already without Gabriel, is one of the band's best.<br />That said, on with &quot;We can't dance&quot;. In my opinion, this is one of the best Genesis' albuns, a mix of fast and sentimental songs, all well thought and greatly executed. Among the slow ones are the great &quot;Never a time&quot;, &quot;Since I lost you&quot; and &quot;Hold on my heart&quot;, where Collins sings passionately and with emotion.<br />On the other side, &quot;Living forever, &quot;Tell me why&quot; and &quot;Jesus he knows me&quot; are fast songs with provocative themes and intelligently composed. But the best songs in this album are my favourite Genesis kind of song, the dark, foggy and long ones. &quot;No son of mine&quot;, &quot;Driving the last spike&quot;, &quot;Dreaming while you sleep&quot; and &quot;Fading lights&quot; have to be included among the best of Genesis. In fact, some time ago I made such a list, and it had more thant thirty songs.<br />This is the last Genesis album to me.<br />Grade 9.4/10
B00005JL3A|4.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT.I LOVE IT I REALLY DO BUT THE CHARCTERS DONT MATCH UP LIKE THE STARS TEAM  JILL VALENTINE AND CHRIS REDFEILD. WHAT A BLOW AND (MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ AS RAIN) COME ON I CANT STAND HER AS AN ACTRESS ILL KILL THEM ALL MYSELF ATTIUDE. BUT YET THERE WAS A FEW GOOD CHARACTERS LIKE (MARTIN CREWES AS KAPALINE),(ERIC MABIUS AS MATT) AND (MILLA JOVOVICH AS ALICE) DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB ACTING. THE MOVIES PLOT AND THE GAMES PLOT BOTH MATCH UP PRETTY GOOD THE HOUSE ,THE TRAIN ,AND THE HIVE.ITS JUST THE CHARACTERS IN THE GAME AND THE MOVIE. THE SECOND TIME I WATCHED IT , IT WAS BETTER IT REALLY IS A GOOD MOVIE I LIKE HOW ALL THE PEOLPE DIE, AND THE PLOT, AND ALL THE ZOMBIES ,AND OF COURCE THE LICKER SO THATS WHY I GIVE IT 4 STARS.
0316666343|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  The narration of little Susie from heaven made the book so much more believable.  The story was one that any reader could relate to: a family looses a loved one violently and they are trying their best to cope.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I've seen my I've seen my fare share of Horror, Sci-Fi, Suspense, etc. &amp; I can honestly say I was mentally bored with this movie. The kid that played Donnie was not a believable character. The only time I saw \\"talent\\" was the scenes when he was hypnotized. Other than that the only good thing about the movie was not the remake, but the fact they used mad world, a Tears for Fears classic song, was good enough to bother watching it.
B00006FMAW|2.0|I rented this movie while living in Japan several years ago and was struck by two things: interesting effects and I paid too much.  <br />The story focuses on a young man discovering a horrible secret about his family when they host a party of flesh melding, limb swapping madness for a bunch of mutants (or something like that) and then discovers his true purpose there.<br />The story is weak, the acting is third-rate, but the effects of joined bodies and malleable flesh are not bad.  I've seen worse excuses for a horror movie, but then I've also seen many better.  This is a good example of a movie where the story is written to match special effects thought of in advance.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Come-on it's The Evil Dead! Bruce Campbell, is a god! This movie alone is great. The cool new DVD is awesome. All the extras & cool cover. So far I have every version of this movie. I am in awe every time there is something \\"new\\" or extra features from this movie & it's prequels. Its worth the rent or the buy!! I'm an old-school fan. Every Halloween, if our theaters show it who do you think is there?
B000002KGT|5.0|I think it's pretty well known that Rumours is the most loved and considered Fleetwood Mac's best album.  It's simply a classic.  Every song is a masterpiece, every note tells a story.  From beginning to end this album enchants and amazes.  It is not to be missed, skipped over, or misplaced.
B000002B7M|5.0|This is an EXCELENT album.  Rather than write a drawn out review, I just wanted to state one thing about this album and get it over with.<br />You may have seen the recent re-master in stores.  But guess what!  It isn't the original!  Because Sharon Osbourne is as greedy as any upper exec in the music industry, she simply had the original bass and drum tracks cut out so that she wouldn't have to pay the original preformers.  And what is even worse is that they tried to hide this fact, and market the album as if nothing had changed!  You won't find anywhere in here, \\"Oh P.S. - You guys are all suckers because we rerecorded the bass and drum tracks to save chump change.\\" written in the CD booklette.<br />For me, it's either the real thing, or nothing.  This is the original album, and if you buy anything else, you're getting screwed over bigtime.
B00001QGPR|4.0|I would be what you could call a David Bowie bystander.  I was aware of him throughout my childhood and enjoyed the songs on the radio.  I knew all the classics by heart and loved hearing them on the radio.  That all changed when my husband brough home Hours.  <br />Being avid gamers, he bought this album for the music found on the game The Nomad Soul.  As soon as we put it in, it was more than we expected.  I have fallen in love with this album completely.  It comforts, it cheers you up, it proves the wonder of love, and it cures insomnia!  There's nothing better than to put this album on in the middle of a stormy night and lay in bed and listen to it.
B00005U152|5.0|This is the first version of the movie and in my humble opinion, the best. I say this for one reason and one reason only, and that is that its the only version that ends the way the novel does. Without spoiling it I'll just say that its tragic yet the most romantic imaginable!!
B000069HKH|5.0|Being a big fan of Bruce Springsteen, I heavily anticipated this release.  This is the first studio album Bruce has recorded with the E-Street band since his classic album &quot;Born in the USA&quot;, released in 1984, and as far as I'm concerned, it's just about as good as any album Bruce has released with the E-Street Band that I have heard.  After 18 years, Bruce still knows how to make an amazing album with the E-Street Band.  This album has everything that makes a great album:  a great flow, great songs, and great lyrics.  <BR>The album kicks off with &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, which on its own right isn't one of the best songs on this album, but it IS probably the best choice to start this album because it certainly grabs your attention. <BR>Following &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; is my favorite track on this album, &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, which is a tribute to the firemen of 9/11.  It is highly impressive and shines high above all the songs I've heard written about 9/11, which seem to sound rushed.  But, &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, sounds very well thought-out, and it shows as Bruce delivers one of the best songs on this awesome album.<BR>Following &quot;Into the Fire&quot; is yet another song that I'd call one of the best on the album, &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot;.  It's fresh and it has this irresistable riff that goes on throughout the song.  Clarence Clemons also does a very good saxophone solo.<br />After &quot;Waiting On a Sunny Day&quot;, the album flows very well with good songs until you hit &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, which doesn't seem like a Bruce song at all, with its incorporation of world music sounds that sounds Middle-Eastern, while still maintaining American rhythms.  It's rather tough to explain, but it's easily a standout.<BR>The album flows on quite well with &quot;Let's Be Friends&quot;, &quot;Further On Up the Road&quot;, and &quot;The Fuse&quot;, into the final five:  all great standouts. The first is &quot;Mary's Place&quot;, which isa fun song that will get you excited with its wonderful rock and roll feel and repeated lyrics that are intensified each time he repeats it.<BR>&quot;You're Missing&quot; follows &quot;Mary's Place&quot;; it is yet another favorite of mine, with a wonderful string arrangement and captivating melodies by Bruce.  The song sounds lamenting and is saddening.<BR>&quot;The Rising&quot; follows, and it is a wonderful song with its fresh sound and optimistic feel.  Bruce also does a chant that adds to this song's greatness.  This was probably the best song to be released as the first single from this album.  <BR>&quot;Paradise&quot; is another wonderful song, with Bruce playing a very calm and peaceful ballad that soothes you quite well.  It seems to be a great lead into the final song on this album, &quot;My City of Ruins&quot;<BR>You might recall this song as the song Bruce played on the America: Tribute To Heroes telethon.  Honestly,  I like that version of it more because it is much more powerful unplugged, which sounds weird.  It has a greater effect with Bruce alone and unplugged, backed by a choir.  However, the album's version definitely does not disappoint me at all.  It is an amazing performance with the E-Street Band, and I like the different take.  It is also a powerful performance and a highly effective way to conclude the latest release from Bruce and the E-Street Band.<BR>I give this album 5 stars because it has 8 great standouts, while even the worst song on this album is still damned good.  I bought the album with high expectations, and now I'm not at all let down.  It still has the sound of Bruce with the E-Street Band from the classic days, but also has a few new things to show as well.  The Rising proves Bruce Springsteen still knows how to make amazing albums with the E-Street Band, even after 18 years since &quot;Born in the USA&quot;.  Anyone who likes Bruce will enjoy this album; HIGHLY recommended.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's hotly contested sophomore (he put out a previous album himself) disc, \\"Room for Squares,\\" will not appeal to everyone. I'll admit that right away--and it even took a little while for the disc to click with ME, a Mayer fan.<BR> While on this honesty kick, I must also say this: despite charges of being a \\"Dave Matthews rip-off\\" and \\"a whiner who only thinks about himself,\\" I like John Mayer. I find him refreshing and talented, and I really feel this disc DOES deserve five stars.<BR> With that said, here's a rundown of the individual tracks:<br />1) No Such Thing: The token anthem about independence and high school oppression (the new, young stars of the film and music industry, often referred to as \\"Young Hollywood,\\" are fond of these spoken/sung discourses) comes off a LOT better than most of these songs do. Sure, it's a pretty common theme, but Mayer reworks it well, adding a sort of winking charm often lacking in these types of high-school-graduation anthems. He actually seems amused about the whole experience, rather than angry or disenchanted. In the world of Blink-182 and Sum 41 and whatnot, this Nice Guy attitude is nice.<BR> <BR> 2) Why Georgia: This is a mellow, contemplative piece. Mayer shows off his skills on the guitar, and his smooth, clear voice shines on the intelligent, probing lyrics. This guy clearly has a lot on his mind--and he expresses himself well.<BR> <BR> 3) My Stupid Mouth: Mayer does a delicate balancing act here; at times, he seems like a frustrated, earnest young man who can't understand why he can't seem to ever say the right thing at the right time; at other times, he seems to be employing his sly charm (\\"I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shakers\\"). No matter what age, listeners will relate to his frustrations with his faults and limitations.<br /> 4) Your Body Is A Wonderland: This is a mellow love song that shows off Mayer's amazingly large capacity for sweetness. His voice and lyrics are tender, andthis song provides a nice touch to his genuinely sweet album.<br /> 5) Neon: One of the album's standout tracks, Mayer shines once again on this tale of a young man forced to watch as his girlfriend self-destructs in a landscape of partying and failed escapism. Mayer's guitar work is worth more than an appreciative nod, and the lyrics display both an integrity of character and a vulnerability listeners will find appealing.<br /> 6) City Love: This song can be described with the word \\"cool.\\" Mayer plays it smooth here, with witty lyrics and great instrumentals that give the piece an extremely tender feeling. Once again, we're shown just how sweet this guy can be. This is not one of the best tracks, but some people will appreciate it, and Mayer's \\"quirky charm works its magic once again.\\" <br /> 7) 83: This is a sweet, relaxed song about wanting to be six years old again. It's got a cute premise, made even more charming by the fact that Mayer uses long phrases and an adult vocabulary to describe the feeling of being a child. His fond recollections of his family, as well as his \\"off-screen narrative\\" of how he felt when he was six, add a nice touch to this playful ditty.<br /> 8) 3x5: The instrumental track of this song is gorgeous--jazzy, catchy, and matching the lyrics perfectly. Mayer's voice is relaxed, as if he is actually speaking directly to you, or as if he is really writing a letter to you. His words perfectly describe a journey filled with beautiful sights and revelations of the soul--and that's what Mayer's all about. This could probably be described as the quintessential Mayer song.<br /> 9) Love Song For No One: I like this song. I really do. Some people thought it was too \\"conventional,\\" but I find it a witty rework of the traditional \\"looking-for-love\\" theme. Mayer speaks words that ring true to so many people: \\"I'm tired of being alone/So hurry up and get here.\\" The instrumentalists on this track (including Mayer) tear up the excellent, instantly recognizable melody, and I mean that in a good way (of course). This is probably one of my favorite tracks.<br /> 10) Back To You: Again, the instrumentalists shine here, and so do Mayer's vocals. He provides the smoky emotion needed to make this a really touching song to a love he still carries a torch for. Carrying torches is a human pastime, and Mayer manages to express his anguish and longing in a way listeners can instantly relate to.<br /> 11) Great Indoors: This song actually seems a little TOO quirky for my taste. It talks about the wonders one can find around your own house, a la \\"Amelie.\\" It seems like something from a Disney Channel movie-of-the-month, and somewhat crosses the line between childish charm and complete overhaul. Not one of my favorites, but I can overlook it.<br /> 12) Not Myself: This is a smoky little number that asks, \\"Would you want me when I'm not myself/Wait it out while I am someone else?\\" People will be able to relate to the idea of sometimes coming out of character and wondering whether or not their \\"better halves\\" will be able to deal with that. (This is getting to be a little boring: I must say, once again, that the instrumentals and vocals rock. While it seems a little redundant to keep saying the same thing over and over, it's not a problem I often have, so I'll keep quiet ;) and appreciate the artistry.)<br /> 13) Mayer skips the 13th track, probably as an allusion to the old superstition. At first, it was a little disconcerting, but now I realize it's just another little quirky touch, one of the many that Mayer adds to his album. It's sweet, in a way, to see those personal touches that are so severely lacking from most pop albums.<BR> <BR> 14) St. Patrick's Day: This is an excellent song, an emotional and melodic way to close the album. I haven't listened it to it that often (because my CD player gets stuck on the blank 13th track quite often), but I do enjoy it.<br /> All in all, this is one of the best CDs I've ever bought. I'ma harsh musical critic in general, but this CD received glowing reviews basically across the board.<BR> Run, not walk, to buy this album!
B00003CXHJ|3.0|Passed up for his own commission, Matthew McConaughey joins up with Bill Paxton, the guy who quashed his advance, and a crew including Harvey Keitel to intercept a damaged German u-boat and take their Enigma code machine by force.  Matt M. is suitably grim and over determined [difficult to get past the Dr. Steve persona from the Wedding Planner we watch a lot], thrust into a position of leadership.  Keitel and Paxton are relegated to the background and wasted for the most part.  Unlike Das Boot with its gritty realism and thick tension, this movie felt much more unintentionally polished and glossy.  That's not to say it wasn't an entertaining couple hours, it told an intriguing story with some interesting plot twists and nifty effects.  More of an old style matinee adventure than anything more ambitious and works at that level.  Recommended.

B00000JGHM|5.0|This is my favorite robbery movie... strong performances by the all-star cast.  It's a bit long, but every scene is important.  The picture quality is barely above a good VHS, but the sound is excellent, particularly in the action sequences.  There aren't any bonuses, unless you count trailers and language, but I'm giving it a five because it is such a good movie.
0316666343|5.0|I read the first two chapters of this book while waiting in line at the DMV. I was actually frustrated when they called me and I had to put it down. How often does THAT happen? Alice Sebold is an enormously talented writer.  Her characters are alive, the story is great, and her words are beautiful.  I think the reviewers who thought it should have focused on finding the killer and were disappointed that he didn't receive justice, were looking for a different kind of book. This was never meant to be a mystery or a thriller, but a look at how one event shaped the lives of the people affected by it.  There was one section, toward the end, that I wasn't thrilled with, but it didn't ruin the book for me. I just thought it might have been better without it.
B000069HKH|5.0|The cloud of 9/11 hangs over Bruce Springsteen's new album, &quot;The Rising,&quot; but who better to address that horrible day than Springsteen, who can write anthem rock like no one else on the face of the earth? Songs like the opening &quot;Lonesome Day,&quot; &quot;Empty Sky,&quot; and the already well-known &quot;My City Of Ruins&quot; will make Bruce fans proud. The man still has a great set of pipes that can scare ships off the Jersey shore, and the welcome return of Springsteen's E Street Band co-horts, including wife Patti Scialfa, Steve Van Zandt, Nils Lofgren, Clarence Clemons, and Max Weinberg, helps lift the material to the same glorious heights of &quot;Born In The USA&quot; &amp; &quot;Born To Run.&quot;With &quot;The Rising,&quot; America's working-class hero of rock has returned in a big, big way. It's truly wonderful to have Bruce back in business. He's needed. :-)
B000068PQ0|5.0|It inspires you to say a lot without saying a word, to complete the sentences that the lyrics merely suggest, to live inside the silences between the songs. . .  <BR>It's not so much a &quot;naive&quot; and childish record, but rather an invitation to inocence, it encourages the listener to wake up in himself one of the dear lost things in ourselves: the capacity to be astounded by everything around us.<BR>Whoever doesn't really &quot;get&quot; this kind of music must surely be cynical. Whoever does get it must start to think not in terms of realities, but of possibilities. <BR>Maybe I'm not saying much about the music. Maybe I should say something about the lush orchestration, the minute attention to detail, the musical references so finely tuned they no longer belong to the source. I could talk about the tenderness of the lyrics, the deeply confessional and touching references to the singer's own life and world. I could also mention, just as a pitch, that if you want to hear the sunny side of radiohead, you should veer towards the magnificence of these songs. I could talk about a lot of these things. And in the meantime, I already did. You should too.
B00000JMP9|2.0|The singing of the two principles (especially Fassbaender) is good and the film looks pretty. But the director compresses the performance to feature film length by deleting every scene that does not involve the two principal singers. This is not a performance of \\"Werther\\"; it is a disk of highlights.

B000002C1W|3.0|The next time Pink Floyd's current self-proclaimed \\"leader\\" David Gilmour complains about the tyranny of former band member Roger Waters, this album should be brought to his attention; his egotism and lack of confidence in fellow band members is appalling.<br />Pink Floyd's first album without main composer Roger Waters, who departed in 1983, would not come without a fight. Waters claimed the right to the band name, and guitarist David Gilmour disagreed, resulting in a dreadful court battle that fortunately resulted in a ruling that denied the ex-bassist's claim. With all of this built up in the press, Pink Floyd fans were expecting a flawless acheivement full of the true Floyd sound they'd done before--instead, they got \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\\" released in 1987.<br />The album is full of advances (good and bad), and is overall a mixed blessing. Normally, a flawed comeback after a shaky hiatus would be expected from a lesser band, but not for the accomplished Floyd. The album's high points are dazzling, and overshadow some of the low points, but definitely not always. The biggest mistakes that Pink Floyd (or here, David Gilmour and crew) makes on \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" are impossible to overlook; the heavy reliance on session musicians and composers is ridiculous and absurd, wounding the natural Floyd ore. With all of the justified complaining about the domination of Waters, and the players' claims that the ex-bassist did little to let band-members Nick Mason and Richard Wright contribute very much, one must observe how \\"Momentary Lapse\\" marks the rightly labelled era of 'Gilmour Domination,' which even continued to 1994's \\"The Division Bell.\\" In both production, arrangement, and composing, Gilmour does little (or next to nothing) to allow Mason to contribute, much less Wright, who was not called in until late in the album's sessions (and even then he was still at session player status). So it's no surprise that Gilmour pays tribute to his own overdone guitar work at least once in each song (especially on the grimly poetic 'Sorrow'). Four songs, the half-track 'Round and Around,' 'Terminal Frost' and the two-part 'A New Machine' are brief and unimaginative, leaving the listener to become curious at the length of time it took to finish the album (though some of it was due to court battles). There are many gracious qualities of \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" however, like the marvelous studio recording quality and the balance of sound effects is very impressive (much of this was due to Nick Mason, though his production credit was muted.) This is apparent on the swirling keyboard-synthesizer masterpiece 'Signs of Life' and the memorable 'Learning to Fly.' There are also some musical innovations, even for the already accomplished Floyd, in the overlooked and misinterpereted 'Dogs of War.' 'One Slip' is a great lyrical feat, though its arrangement is disappointing. 'On the Turning Away' is promising but could have been better, and 'Yet Another Movie' contains flaws that are more puzzling than they are disappointing.<br />Nonetheless, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" is poetic in its approach, overall tone, and mood. More important, it re-established Pink Floyd's progressive sound, which had formerly been the responsibility of Roger Waters. This album sounds more surreal and three dimensional than Waters' limited sombre works. And if departing from Waters' boundaries was one of the goals of \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\\" Pink Floyd surely succeeds at that.itar work at least once in each song (especially on the grimly poetic 'Sorrow').

B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising is one of the best adult disks to come out in years!  Bruce has evolved.  The rock anthems are still anthems but with an adult sensibility and sound.  <BR>Many of the songs were surrounding the events of 9/11, however the lyrics have bittersweet pointency as alagories for lost love.<BR>Just as Born to Run was my favorite disk of the 70's and Born In the USA was my favorite for the 80's and Human Touch was one of my favorites for the 90's, The Rising looks like number one for the 00's!
B000065U1N|5.0|Forget about Platoon,  discard Apocalypse Now, and toss Saving Private Ryan, and pick up Black Hawk Down!!! Sure the affore mention titles are great movies, and surely some of the best movies for their genre, but in my opinion Black Hawk Down is  just that one more notch above. After finishing the book long before the movie, I can safely say its what I perceive to be afairly accurate retelling. I do not know what excatly the author Mr. Bowden thought, but its good none the less. The movie is simply marvelous and breath-taking. Yeah it may not have the deepest of characterization but anyone will immmediately attach themselves to anyone of the charcaters, and thus immersing you into the bullet-flying terror on screen. Josh Hartnett as a soldier? Yes my friend and he pulls it off along with anyone of the other numerous actors in the flick.<BR> <BR>Ridley Scott's direction along with the hauntingly beautiful score by Hans Zimmer are simply amazing! Each one of Zimmer's scores are different, and this one is no different. It will move you to tears. Because I know it makes this 19 yr. old male cry, and that doesnt come easy, especially since this is the only movie that brings me to tearsand it still happens, even after seeing the movie a half a dozen times already!<br />Whether you rent it or buy it, you owe to yourself to check out this excellent piece of film work. You cannot walk away dissapointed. Only filled with the admiration for those who fought and were able to give it all, their courage, their bravery, their brotherhood, their hearts, and some their lives. For those 19 men that died on that fatefull day in '93 this is their memorial, a living testament that \\"No One Is Left Behind\\".

B00003CXZ4|5.0|As great as this movie is...it's not for everyone. <br />That being said, I'll tell you why I see it as a WOW!  Christopher Nolan has created a piece that is unmatched in it's originally and is on par with 'The Usual Suspects' in terms of storytelling at it's finest.  The script is tight, and the performances (Guy Pearce...if you haven't heard of him yet, trust me...you will!) are solid.<br />The fact this film is told backwards gives you an intimate 'bond' with the protagonist, in that you can't remember what happened before either, and this adds a dimension that few films can project.  But, you can't 'leave' for a second.  If you have to do anything, pause it, because little clues are left all throughout the movie, and the different way the story is told can also leave you feeling lost if you miss some of it.<br />This is a true gem of a film that it's a shame it didn't get more buzz early on.
B000001U3K|3.0|Is that guitar lick in \\"Vicious\\" just a bit familiar? I think Boston might have something to confess. Right, well, anyway. This album is nowhere close to the level of genius Reed accomplished when he was with the Velvets. This is the one that made him the second-in-command of the Glam Movement back in the day. <br />\\"Perfect Day\\", the soft ballad of self-loathing and \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\", a motown serenade to Warhol's Menagerie are the songs you know. But the ones that really make me listen to this album over and over are the rocking, proto-straight edge \\"Hangin' 'Round\\" where wise old grampa Reed looks down and mocks the people who'd have felt right at home in Sister Ray's apartment, and the yearning, spaced-out \\"Satellite of Love\\". \\"I'm So Free\\" sounds like it means the title sentiment far more sincerely than the VU track \\"I'm Set Free\\", even if it does go on a little bit too long. \\"Make Up\\" is a pretty boring cookie tossed to the glam kids and really grates on one's nerves, as does the weightless \\"NY Telephone Conversation\\". The rest of the tracks really stand out in no way. <br />Basically, \\"Transformer\\" is a plain-old pop record, with the 'hits-and-filler' formula that that implies. But the fact that it remains listenable and even, at times, brilliant, thirty years later, is only a testament to the genius of the men (Reed and producers David Bowie and Mick Ronson) who made it.

B00005RYQO|3.0|When the sun goes down, the wheels come out (like vampires in the night) to race the deserted streets of LA. They race for money. They race for \\"papers.\\" They race for respect. And they race to escape. It's urban chaos with babes; babes who can also race.<br />Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker of Joy Ride, Varsity Blues) is an LA cop working undercover to find the hijackers who have been stealing from semi trucks as they're en route at highway speed. He befriends Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel of Saving Private Ryan, XXX), the intimidating, yet charismatic, tough-guy leader of the local race scene. Brian must prove himself as a racer and earn the trust of Dom and his race team in order to find out who the thieves are and stop them. Naturally, he also falls for Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster). And, of course, there's a rival Asian gang to shake things up even more.<br />Paul Walker puts in a believable performance, however, it's all about Vin Diesel. He has such a captivating presence on screen. Hooking up with Director Rob Cohen (Dragonheart, Daylight, XXX) has really been a blessing for him.<br />The cinematography here is just outstanding. The camera seemingly gets into the car, into the mechanics of the power and the acceleration. The filming/lighting has also created an LA that is appropriately surreal.<br />The entire movie is one constant adrenaline rush - totally exhilarating. The race scenes involve some amazing action along the streets of LA. If for no other reason, you must see this film for A) Vin Diesel, and B) it's just a great action film.
6302250269|5.0|I have a problem with some people who think that, because the two main characters of the film do technically illegal things, this makes them bad people, and therefore this is a bad movie.  Especially when there are those that seem to treat them as heroes. While they are not heroes, and I can't argue with many things the naysayers say, my opinion is that this is still one terrific movie.  <br />The story of how two women go on a short-lived crime spree made a big stink when it was released in 1991.  How a housewife in a dead-end marriage, and a waitress in a dead-end job get pushed far enough to strike back was written about as a triumph of the feminist agenda and a strike back at the male-dominated world.  I also disagree with this other extreme point of view.  Every crime the ladies commit should have, in my opinion, been punished with some jail time.  <br />But that old argument aside, there are other things that make the movie well worth seeing.  First, is the magnificent scenery.  I've made the drive from Illinois back and forth to Las Vegas many times, but have always taken the fastest highways.  As they try to make their escape by going down side roads AND avoiding Texas to get to Mexico, you get some breathtaking scenery that doesn't involve a Stuckey's or pecan logs.  <br />Then there is the acting.  The males are good, especially Christopher McDonald who wants Thelma as a wife of his molding, but only if it doesn't take too much time from his TV football games.  But Geena Davis plays Thelma brilliantly when you see the thrills she experiences on their little adventure.  While maybe not the best way to solve her problems, you can see that this is a woman who's been needing a good time for a very long time.<br />But the cake goes to Susan Sarandon on this one.  Yes, she was premature in committing the first crime, but you can see that something from her past has finally been released at this point.  Not all at once, though.  The movie never really tells us her secret, but you can see it still simmering throughout the movie.  Next time you watch it, catch all the times she makes eye contact with old people on the road.  She holds this gaze for awhile, as if wondering if she will ever reach that stage, and if she wants to at all.  I believe these thoughts play a big part in their final decision.
B000067CPX|3.0|This CD is a major dissapointment. Their new CD contains many slow beat songs and light lyrics, not there usual deal. After the mild dissapoint of Californication this is just getting stupid. The Chili Peppers should have sticked to their fast funk music. I suggest buying Blood Sex Sugar Magik(BSSM) instead, or Mother's Milk, two of their greatest alblums. If you were one of that fans that think the Chili peppers are all that because of Californiacation, your opinion on the music of the RHCP doesn't mean much. You should try getting ahold of RHCP's originals with Hillil Slovak on lead guitar. Their best CDs are all Punk and Funk music. This CD is decent I guess, they have some interesting riffs in the track Cabron, but again, it's not their style.

B000002LRX|5.0|I was appalled to find out that this record was a commercial disaster. It's great! A masterpiece, even! And it seems 100 or so other people on the site seem to agree somewhat. I'm guessing they've covered the finer points of Faith No More's Angel Dust in detail, so I'll just give an overview...<br />This album has everything for the demented music lover. \\"Land Of Sunshine\\" sounds like a Mr. Bungle b-side. \\"Caffeine\\" is opened with monkeys and contains the only swear on the CD. \\"Midlife Crisis\\" has some tribal-sounding drums and a quirky bassline. \\"RV\\" is a piano-laden monologue on the life of a trailer park junkie. \\"Smaller and Smaller\\" is an aggressive funk tune. \\"Everything's Ruined\\" contains an ethreal piano part, making it sound much like a song from The Real Thing. \\"Malpractice\\" veers close to death metal at some points and integrates parts of Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 8. \\"Kindergarten\\" has an addictive guitar line and shows off Patton's rapping ability. \\"Be Aggressive\\" is sexually explicit, but also contains a catchy cheerleader chorus. \\"A Small Victory\\" is probably my favorite track, with incredible singing and awesome Oriental keyboards. \\"Crack Hitler\\" sounds like a spy theme song, and \\"Jizzlobber\\" is 6 minutes of pure venom, ending with majestic/sinister cathdral organs at the end. Finally \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is the album's closer, and is the band's rendition of the theme by John Barry.<

Highly recommended not just for kids, but for adults as well.<br />Movie explores how he became spiderman and his struggle to cope with one of his family members death. (Won't tell you as it will ruin who).  It is also a romantic in a sense with the girl he thought he could never have but has always wanted and how that relationship goes.  Again great movie!!!
B000002KP3|4.0|Smooth.  Slick.  Cool.  All these words adequately describe ELECTRIC WARRIOR, but they fail to completely sum up the album.  They don't quite capture the quality that allows this album to stand up to repeat listening.  There are other albums out there that are also smooth, slick and cool, but you'll probably be sick of listening to them after putting the disk in the player the second time.  However, this album manages to be both superficially hip and substantial enough to be worthy of multiple listens.  <br />It's glam, of course.  The sort of glam that makes you glad that the genre was born, rather than those examples that make you long for the days before lipgloss and eyeliner.  It's mellow and laid back.  There aren't any songs on here that I skip over while playing, which speaks volumes in itself.  The whole CD just has a very slick and polished sound that I find really appealing.  The rhythms are all extremely tight, and the guitars are perfectly placed between the drum beats.  It sounds effortless, but you know something that sounds that easy must have been extremely difficult to produce.<br />It makes great party music, but it's also a CD that you could sit down by yourself and just listen to.  It's dance music, but it isn't only dance music.  Pay close attention to it and you might hear something really special.  If all so-called throwaway songs were this impressive, then the state of pop music would be in much better shape today.
B000002J1I|5.0|Okay, okay, some of the tracks are a little sub par, but the songs \\"Don't Kill the Whale,\\" \\"Onward,\\" \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom,\\" and \\"Madrigal,\\" well, those 4 make the disc worth the purchase!  And that is not to say that the other ones aren't good, but that list of 4 are superb!<br />This disc is that one odd Yes album which is difficult for some Yes fans to like -- oh, yah, this and the \\"Union\\" album -- but once you get used to it, it'll really grow on you.  I promise.
B00005B0PU|5.0|This CD is in effect two LPs on one CD - 'Odessey and Oracle' and the 'RIP' project.<br />The former was the Zombies classic (and final) album. It is seemlessly produced. It was actually recorded at the famous Abbey Road studios - and it sounds it. Despite the rushed recording schedule, Odessey is smooth, slick, pop-psychodelia. <BR>The melody hooks are memorable - check out 'Maybe After He's Gone,' 'Friends of Mine' and the irresistable 'Care of Cell 44.' (Careful - it'll get stuck on your brain!)<br />There are a few moments of experimentation (as per norm circa 1967), however they fit into the entire picture of the LP comfortably.<br />Odessey &amp; Oracle is an album that grows nicely on you with repeated plays - it's a work of quality. (and it won't 'burn quickly'). <br />The bonus tracks (Get this - 16 of them!) are a combination of Zombies 'leftovers,' late 45s and songs that the band Argent recorded under the name 'Zombies.'<br />It was originally intended to release this selection of songs as an LP called 'RIP.' However no dregs here. The songs are good!<br />'If it Don't Work Out' was originally recorded by the Zombies as a demo for Dusty Springfield. Their version is fresh and the later overdubs improve instead of hinder. 'Walking in the Sun' predates ELO's harmonies by several years. 'Smoky Day' is beautfully eerie. <br />I am a fan of audio - but I must say I was stunned at the crisp sound quality on this release (recordings over 32 years old!)<br />And to cap it all off - included is the rare 1965 single 'I Want You Back Again.'<br />Great, enjoyable stuff!
0743455967|5.0|I don't think you're supposed to have this much fun when you read a text about WRITING.  As an English teacher, I'm always looking for ideas for mini-lessons and concepts to present in class.  I started to dog-ear the corners of useful pages, and now my book looks like a Day Planner.<br />I appreciate his advice about omitting needless words.  Shed those ridiculous affectations and rid your writing of phony pretension.  (THANK YOU!  It's about time someone said it!) This book also presents the best support for the active voice and for writing with courage.  <br />This book taught me not only how to be a better writer but also how to be a better reader.  I'm more aware of what weakens writing and how to improve it.  I hope to bring this knowledge back into my classroom this fall to strengthen my writers.
0446608955|5.0|There's not much left to say. The book is a quick read and I couldn't put it out of my hands. It's very well written and I'll sure check out more by Nicholas Sparks as well as the movie.
0151008116|5.0|This surpasses any book I have ever read.  I enjoyed every chapter, every page.  After I finished the last sentence, I opened the book up from the front and read it again.  It is a great discussion book.  Your book club will love talking about Pi, Richard Parker, and their voyage.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I watched this movie on t.v. around 2:30 in the morning and it had me hooked to the very end (lasted till like 5:00!!, I've never stayed up that long for a movie) I was so shocked by this movie I couldn't believe it. I usualy don't buy into all the vampire movies but I dunno something about this one was just different. All the actors did fantastic jobs - especially Kirsten Dunst considering how young she was. I recommend this DVD completely I give it two great big thumbs up!! 100%!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I am a young, generation X-er who loves jazz, but has a hard time finding anything except old standards and Diana Krall to listen to. When I first heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, I was hooked. Norah Jones has invented her own sound. I tried to describe her to my best friend and could only say she is a mix between Diana Krall/Natalie Merchant/Sarah McLachlan and I am not sure what category to put her in. Jazz? Soft rock? Oh, who the hell cares. . . she shines. Every song on this CD is great and the title &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; couldn't have fit better. Her music takes you wherever Norah decides to go. And let me tell you, it's a great place to be.
B000067CPX|5.0|'By The Way' is a wonderful CD~! Of course I know it's weird to hear the Peppers (who used to be some wild, out of control guys) sing such soft, steady (not to mention emotional) songs but it shows that they have matured and developed into more experienced singers. Don't you agree that it would be weird to see some 40 year old guys still singing songs like Linkin Park's? those type of people are called \\"Wannabes\\" and the Chili Peppers are just the opposite of that. They are creative and original since they had written the songs in the CD dealing with their own emotions. Anthony's wonderful, soothing voice creates a dreamy feeling. Flea and John are great at the guitars and Chad is, of course, the best drummer~! <BR>  The song \\"Dosed\\" is my absolute favorite and you will be able to hear a beautiful blend of anthony's voice with flea's and john's. Another fantastic song is \\"The Zephyr Song.\\" The songs are really touching and I seriously enjoyed listening to them. <BR>  I just couldn't stop my CD player...I listened to the CD day and night~! they were so good that you would keep on hearing the songs in your head, even if the CD wasn't be played. 'By the Way' is not like other rock/rap CDs that are filled with screaming and yelling (which would make you go absolutely deaf) nor is it filled with slow music to make you fall asleep. It is perfect to play at dance parties or just for the heck of it when you want a relaxing afternoon. What's best is that no profanity is used so even little children could listen to it (it's never too late or early to become a Chili Peppers fan)~! The songs are clean (so it won't start up any violence or aggression)...It's the perfect thing to add to any Chili Pepper fan's collection~! A++ all the way~!
B00004YRQA|5.0|i don't even think about my memory card - it is easy to label and works fine  -  i did buy a 3rd party card and i had to load a cd every time I used it - needless to say - i just trashed it - anyway - this is your best bet -
B0000024YL|4.0|One of the ALL-TIME BEST &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilations, Paul Simon's and Art Garfunkle's genius and artistry again is seen in creating an album that ISN'T JUST the original studio versions of their hits (something that any record company accountant can put out for anybody afraid to take a chance or spend money on an original album). Incidentally, this was one of the first greatest hits compilations ever to do more than just use the original versions. I already own all of their other albums and compilations on CD and have the original LP's (bought in the 60's and 70's), and THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE that you can still get these live versions (4 songs are live, the rest original studio versions). &quot;Kathy's Song&quot; in particular shows Paul Simon's growth as a guitar player from the early studio version. &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;, this being my favorite version (though I know many hate it) is still valuable at the least as an example of their live interpretations from that era. I have recommended this to dozens of people wanting to buy some Simon and Garfunkle ... of all the albums that I recommend, this one gets me the most positive comments. The only negative, though, is that the mastering onto the CD does not bring the instrumentation out as much as the LP fully does. Perhaps Sony/Columbia can take a second look at their mastering on this one.
B000069CWE|5.0|okay, usually i hate when artists do remixes but with LP, i must say, they did an exceptional (sp?) job!  it is tight.  i am right now listening to the remix of crawling with aaron lewis, who adds a lot to the song, even though i still and will always love chester's choir boy vocals.  if you are:<br />1: a big lp fan<BR>2: like hip hop<BR>3: like rock/alternative<BR>4: want to hear something new and innovative<br />-then get this cd! It's tight, and even though they move far from their rock roots, it still upholds the tradition that the two can blend in harmony (rock and rap) together.  And as one of the few black females (i honest to God can't find that many more) who listen to rock/alternative, i would without any hesitation recommend this cd! mega props to mike s. for producing a wonderful cd!
B00005LC1H|5.0|John Cleese is at his best in Fawlty Towers.  Between his mishaps with German guests to the complete hillarious incompetence of his Spanish waiter, Manuel (he's from Barcelona), this 12 episode series will keep you laughing from beginning to end.  <br />Favorite episodes:<BR>The Germans<BR>Basil the Rat<br />The DVD edition is well worth buying, by the way.  There are many special features, including interviews, out-takes and sections of the funniest clips from the show.  The picture and sound quality is also very good.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is really one of the best Madonna`s greatest hits` collections.It`s a sum of Madonna`s best in the last decade.This period also presents vrey important part of Madonna`s life.She became a serious and mature artist in 90s.And all that is said by album.So &quot;GHV2&quot; is really worth of our money.Especially if we know that the artist is someone who`s called &quot;Queen of the pop&quot;. This album really deserves all respect.not even from Madonna`s fans.There are some hits that will be memorized all the times in a history of music.The greatest hits are &quot;Erotica&quot;&amp;&quot;Frozen&quot;. But &quot;Don`t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; also mustnt`t be forgotten.That remind us on her succesful performance in &quot;Evita&quot;.It`s a big step in her not so succesful career of actress.There`s also an excellent soundtrack from &quot;Austin Powers&quot; called &quot;Beatiful Stranger&quot;.Only resentment is that there`s no one very great hit on this album,&quot;American Pie&quot;,soundtrack from having the same name film.Even it deserves the respect like the other songs,it can be ignored.I like all songs but my favourite are &quot;Frozen&quot;,&quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot;,&quot;Ray of Light&quot;,&quot;What It Feels Like for A Girl&quot;,&quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;.So this album is a mixture of qualitate and various songs that can be listened in every situation.
B00005B36H|4.0|For more than 3 years of my life, I concidered myself to be the biggest Tool fan around. I lived and breathed the lyrics and felt the music. But time has passed and my musical tastes have changed. However, I can still aperciate good music and Tool doesn't disapoint here. Well, kinda.<br />First thing that becomes apparent is Tool leans toward a even more progressive sound that AEnima only hinted at. Rapidly changing time signatures, lengthy songs, and soundscape are the new aim of Tool. The result is impressive, with Tool's musicianship at the height of their game. Justin Chancler shows off some impressive bass playing to complement the always impressive kitman Danny Carrey, who can still &quot;woo&quot; and &quot;wow&quot; with his off-kilter rhythms and jaw-dropping fills. Adam Jones throws out some good riffs that aren't the most intricate, but shows that he is competant guitarist above the heads of most of todays guitarists. If I have a complaint to any of the members, it would have to be Maynard. <br />Maynard's vocals have normally been the main focal point of the band and certainly the band still plays to that here on the record. However, I may just be being hyper critical, but something is lacking. Keenan's vocals lack the punch that made him my favorite vocalist. There's still the rich, deep lyrics that are Trademark Tool. And there's still the sweeping changes between our harsh, angry front man to our sullen, more reflective style. Hell, he even has a larger vocal range than he used to. But still something is lacking.<br />Also, I'm not too keen on the cleaner production of Lateralus. Albums like Undertow and AEnima had this thick, muggy production that made sound even more gritty and human. This is just too polished.<br />These things however can destroy a great album. And Lateralus is that album. It is certainly a step forward in song-writing both musically and lyrically and shows the band finding a sound that they like. Its nice to see after so many years of inactivity that these guys can click and still show the mainstream that what craftsmanshinp is. But I won't goes as far as to say that it's my favorite album. AEnima will always hold that place(untill the next album perhaps). I can't wait to see what happens next.
B000050FEN|1.0|The mood was set perfectly by Fincher.  I loved some scenes such as the stomach in the plastic bag.  However, I hate movies where serial killers kill people to some goofy formula.  There was nothing compelling to killing people 7 deadly sins style.  It was just boring coming across more and more dead bodies.<br />I hate Kevin Spacey.  He just has that lispy voice and blank stare as he does in every movie.  There are Sesame Street characters that are more menacing than this.  (Snuffalufagus and the Grouch are 2 examples. Heck, Burt and Ernie are as well. Ok, Elmo and the rest are as well!)<br />I loved the macabre mood in this picture.  Fincher did a great job of that.  I really wanted to like the other aspects of this movie but the story just bored me.<br />I liked the style including the credits scrolling opposite than normal but the story had no substance.
B00005YW4H|5.0|As a music lover, I enjoy listening to new artists break through into the world of music. This is the best CD that I have heard all year. Norah's blend of piano melodies and her voice smoke through the cd and lull the listener into a relaxed calm. To call her music just jazz is an insult. Her music is so much more layered than that, with a blend of jazz, blues, and old world style. Her music is rich beyond her age, and is well worthwhile. If you only buy one cd this year, this is the one to choose. I highly recommend it to any music lover.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Do not fall into the trap, as I did after my first viewing, of letting this movie wash over you like an incomprehensible  wave. Do not accept the idea that the film makes no conventional sense but simply appeals to the unconscious and the dream-like. This film is something of a puzzle, but can be easily cracked open and solved, and the emotional truths that lie at its heart are simple, timeless, and heartbreaking. Make the effort to link the images and characters in the two halves of the film, refer to Lynch's &quot;clues&quot; in the DVD inlay card, or even listen to the excellent commentary which can be found on-line, and makes a great companion piece to this mindblowingly good film.
B000001FS3|5.0|Ok, I recently wrote a review of this album that I just don't think did justice for my feelings about this album and its quality.  Having won best album for the Joshu Tree, this album is the peak of U2's career, more so than All That You Can't Leave Behind.  In fact, those who only know U2 for that album should really give the Joshua Tree a listen.  They will find that All That You Can't Leave Behind is a mirror of this album, with similarities throughout.<br />Starting with The Unforgettable Fire, U2 began a maturing period where more than politics went into their music.  The growth culminated in the Joshua Tree.  Some argue that this was their first non political album, but that is not true.  The key difference is that U2 expanded their ability to put emotion behind the politics in a sense disguising it.<br />The politics of Africa and Central America permeating through poor area vs. richer North America.  Tracks such as Where the Streets Have no Name, Bullet the Blue Sky, and Mother's of the Disappeared.  The big achievement is the solitarity they group has made.  I appreciate the ability to make what you want.<br />Where the Streets Have no Name is my favorite song of all, but mostly because I like to think of it as heaven.  The rest of the album goes the same way often leaving various possibilities for the meanings that can make a lot of people happy.<br />Overall, this is the best U2 album ever and is the basis for albums such as the recent All That You Can't Leave Behind.<br />Enjoy
B000068PQ0|5.0|When \\"Clouds Taste Metallic\\" Came out it was heralded as the \\"Pet Sounds For the 90's\\", To Much hyperbole for me, but it was still a good Album. That is about the only bad thing I can say about the Lips. The Flaming Lips are probably one of the most inventive and underrated bands of the last 20 years. Although not the sonic wall of sound that is \\"In a Priest Driven Ambulance\\" or \\"Oh, My Gawd\\". It still Seems like a natural progression for the band when you listen from \\"Oh, My Gawd!!!\\" to \\"Yoshimi\\"  (in order). This Album is what critic's god band Radiohead wishes they could make. The flow is brilliant, every songs flows easily into the next. No songs reaks of filler, every note, every noise, every word serves a purpose on this album. Even the little \\"Hi, Hi\\" in \\"Yoashimi battles the Pink Robots, Part II\\". Finally a band has remeber what making a great album is all about and how one songs should compliment the others. This is supposed to be a (Gasp!!) Concept Album, when you think of concept albums I think of Styx \\"Kilroy was Here\\" and Queensrychre \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" as concepts taken to far. But if \\"Yoshimi\\" is a concept album it should be placed on par the Who's \\"Tommy\\".
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind had everything there needed <BR>to be to be the best film on the big screen.I <BR>just loved every minute of the film.I have seen <BR>every film that Ron Howard has made and there is <BR>only one that is greater.Ron is the best.I would<BR>recommend this picture to anyone.I laughed and<BR>I cried and cheered while watching this film.Not<BR>many films can make you do that.I own it on <BR>DVD.You should too.
B0000683DH|4.0|Coming after the successful yet overbloated TMP,TWOK was a leaner and no less meaner film that really kick started the Trek we know and love today.No other villian(well maybe DS9's Gul Dukat)commands your attention like Khan.Where he was set on conquering on Space Seed,he's hellbent on revenge which makes him an even effective villian.Kirsty Alley's Saavik injects a dose of new blood into the veteren crew, and the battle scenes(a far cry from the cheap opticals and camera shaking of the original series)are very effective and even the newer offspring(TNG DS9,VOY)have taken their cue from this film.Regarded as the best Trek film,Wrath of Khan has yet to be toppled,though it has come close(The Voyage Home,First Contact).
B000001FA4|4.0|This album represents U2's leap to maturity.  This album hints at the greatness to come with the Joshu Tree and on.  Songs like Pride, Bad, The Unforgettable Fire, and A Sort of Homecoming demonstrate the maturing sound of U2's intruments combined with Bono's great lyricism.<br />This album is a must for anyone who loves the Joshua Tree or more recently All Than You Can't Leave Behind.  It is solid and forms a link with pre-Joshua Tree (i.e. pre-super star) days.
6305657947|3.0|...I liked how the movie used New York city as a luxurious backdrop and let the viewer get a real feeling of our unique city, I also liked Brosnan's portrayal of a bored loner with a gift for theft. I didn't like Russo who made me cringe everytime I saw how horribly thin she was inspite of the beautiful clothes she was dressed in. I had seen her 'In The Line of Fire' and liked her performance. In this movie she looks hard, hungry and gaunt - as for Dunaway's facelift everytime she was on screen I couldn't help but stare at her noticeably higher 'left eye'. <br />I had planned on getting the original movie, but I read that the picture quality was lacking. However, after reading the reviews about the performances of Dunaway and McQueen, and seeing the preview that is attached to this DVD, I think I'll get a better feel of what the story should have been.<br />Jewison, Dunaway, McQueen - the original Crowne might be gold that I thought I found.
B00000064G|5.0|This was Nick Drake's final album before his 1974 overdose. It's not even a half hour long, but in that short amount of time, he created some of the most emotional, challenging, somber, and thought-provoking songs, just with an acoustic guitar and his voice! Not to forget that piano line in \\"Pink Moon.\\"<BR><BR>7!!! count em, 7 songs on this album made me cry, the title track, \\"Place To be,\\" \\"road,\\" \\"which will,\\" \\"things behind the sun,\\" \\"parasite,\\" and \\"from the morning.\\" That says a lot on how moving and harrowing an album can be. Nick Drake certainly had a gift of finding the right guitar chords to trigger someone's buttons, and of finding the right vocal tones that are not too quiet, but not loud either. His near-whisper resonates so loudly that it sticks in not only your mind, but also your heart and even your blood. <BR><BR>While some either scream at the top of their lungs out to get their point across, and others use walls of sound tyo capture an essence, Drake expressed more emotions on this album than Linkin park ever will, and moved me to other dimensions in music more than Jimi Hendrix, although Hendrix has always been a God to me.<BR><BR>It's a tragedy that Drake went unnoticed during his lifetime, which only adds to the mystique of this album and his entire catalogue, but thankfully, people are discovering him 28 years after his untimely death, and his music will definitely live on for centuries. The 2 best words to describe his music: ephemeral and ethereal. He might've only released 3 albums, but those 3 albums are some of the greatest ever... this one is the best one. This one is definitely in my top 10 for best albums ever. Buy it now.
B00005YUNY|4.0|I was really hoping to see more of the Magnification material, if not all of it. That's really my only complaint, and why I didn't give this compilation a 5.  Other than that, it's great material.<br />On another note, I think it was brilliant to use different DVD camera angles to give the viewer the option of graphics.  Way to go, Yes, for helping to pioneer more new ideas and for going out of your way to satisfy those who didn't like the graphics.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Luckily it's not-but more for the reason that Incubus is so much smarter than 98% of rock these days they couldn't really make something totally awful.  However, it's painfully obvious that the 15-30 year old Seventeen magazine girl is creeping into their demographic, which has caused a large number of fans to hop on the sell out bandwagon.  Mexico, a failed attempt at Drive 2 (even though they won't admit it) and Echo are the two most obvious examples of attempting to become TRL and Top-40 radio mainstays.  Consequently, those two tracks happen to be the worst two tracks Incubus have ever put on an album-but listen to the girls scream at the concerts!  Nonetheless, Incubus has still put together a quality album.  The gems on Morning View come right in the middle of the album.  Circles and Blood on the Ground, combine the best of Incubus: heavy yet intelligent rock that shows how good of musicians they can be.  The #4 and 5 tracks, Just a Phase and 11 AM (the sucessful Drive 2, so to speak) are quieter, yet fantastically written pieces of the right road for the boys to &quot;evolve&quot; on.  Brandon Boyd's lyrics are steadily improving, although drifting away from his roots.  The beachy hit Wish You Were Here would have been the song of the summer of 2001-on the charts and in the music-had it been released a few months earlier it would have been perfect.  As it is, though, it's still a great song.  Nice to Know You, Warning, Have You Ever and Under My Umbrella are tracks that aren't bad by any means (Warning is actually quite good), but give you the feeling of how much talent Incubus has and how they could have been so much more.  So while Morning View comes nowhere near the masterpiece that Make Yourself, and is ranked just below their major debut, S.C.I.E.N.C.E, MV is a quality album.  Fans of Incubus should shut their mouths for a moment to look past the fact that it sounds different from their other albums and realize what a great piece of work their listeningto.
B00004Z459|5.0|this cd is really good, at first I just liked a few songs. But now I like all of them. Reanimation is a good cd too you will like it if you like hip-hop. <br />here are some extra songs you can download, i dont know if they are real but they sound like them<br />far away<BR>part of me,etc <BR>just type linkin park ep, and you also can type linkin park remix to get remixes for the 12 songs.
B000003N7G|5.0|Let me get this out of the way; I am a pagan. I've been pretty discontent with religion since I was maybe 13 years old. But this was John Coltrane's way of praising God and getting his religious beliefs through. The liner notes were written by Coltrane and they explained his devotion to God, his music, and his fellow bandmates. Overall, this was an album sparked by faith. And if this is a way to pay tribute to God through music, then this is one touching album to do it. Parts of it actually leave me in awe for hours at a time, almost to the point of tears, and some of the music stays with me for long periods of time. If you can get an irreligious person to be moved by an album with a dogmatic message to it, then you've definitely accomplished something. The same cannot be said for bands like dc Talk, no offense against them. <BR><BR>John Coltrane has always been one of my favorite musicians ever, and his sax playing always floors me, the way Steve Howe from Yes does to me with the guitar. I feel his playing, as well as the others in the band (especially Elvin Jones' killer drum solo on Psalm 3). Every note of this album to me reflected his spirituality and there has never been another album that has expressed religious devotion so beautifully and so clearly than this one (though Genesis' 23-minute opus &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; comes close). To those who like passion with their religion; leave the Bible on the shelf, and listen ot his! God bless you Coltrane, and rest in peace!
B000063V8R|5.0|Next Generation is my best &quot;Trek&quot; programming, and this third year series has the best of the available episodes.  Clearly, the series came together in its writing and acting.  It seems everyone is operating at &quot;prime&quot;. Beverly Crusher returns after an awful year with medical officer Pulaski.  Guest characters such as &quot;Q&quot;, the &quot;Transfiguration&quot; being, Zurak, and, of course, the Borg, make this year incomprehensible.  IT's a great way to get lost in this whole environment.  Enjoy!
B00004Z459|4.0|...Anyways,this cd is really, but it gets overplayed way too much, and when i heard that they were comming out with another cd i thought cool some new songs but all they did was remix it. But wait the remixes are pretty good they hardly changed the lyrics though. Anyways back to this the best songs are 1,... oh wait they are all good...
B000000WCA|5.0|What ever happened to these girls, huh???  I loved them back in '98 - as did everybody else.  Unless you were lacking a pulse, how could you not love the Girls of Spice??  Admittedly, I was hooked from the first single.  Like the Spice Girls, my motto has always been: \\"if ya' wanna' be my luva', ya gotta' get wit my friends; \\"friendship lasts forever, friendship never ends!!\\"  I couldn't sum it up any better than they did.  But the fun pop of the album doesn't end there, NO WAY!!  The groove of the second song will have you on the dance floor in seconds, as will every single song from this late 90's pop classic disc.  This album, to me, boasts an updated 80's pop sound and vibe, right down to the 9-song lineup on the album, which is the amount of songs found on so many classic 80's albums!!  I luv the 9-song format on any album!!!<br />Finally, I simply want to say that Britney should NOT get the credit for starting up blonde teen pop - these girls should.  They were blowing away the \\"pop and roll\\" world well before Britney, and they are 9 times more talented!!  I look forward to more fun pop music from these girls - hopefully very soon!! <br />HAVE A GOOD DAY!!
B000069CWE|4.0|I recently purchased this CD at Best Buy. As always being a fan of Linkin Park, and generally liking their music, I thought I would find their new CD to be as good as The Hybrid Theory. <br />At first, I was disappointed by the fact that the band never created their own new songs. Actually, they did create about three new tunes and placed them on this CD. I expected to find a variety of new songs to look forward to. However, I wasn't too upset yet. I listed to all the songs and liked the 'remix' style of the songs. I had to admit I liked some of the older songs with the remix. I found the Pts. of Athrty. and the PPR:KUT to be some of my favorites. The remix gave a new grouve to the music and it's a unique way of creating a new CD.<br />There were also some negatives about this CD. I was confused by the answering machine messages and the purpose of the opening song. It might of been an 'inside joke' of the band. Unfortunately, the listeners don't quite understand the point of this. Finally, I was disappointed that there weren't any completely new songs never heard before. Oh well.<br />I need to give the band credit for taking the time to put this together. I'll give it a B and recommend it to Linkin fans.
B00005JL3A|3.0|First off, I love the Resident Evil games.  I have played all of them (aside from Resident Evil Gaiden for the Gameboy Color, and Resident Evil Survivor which is just a title trying to cash-in on Sega's success with House of the Dead).  Having said that, I must warn fans to take this movie for what it is- an action movie with similar monsters and the same city.  The movie is loosely based on the game, there are no characters from the game, the mansion lab has been replaced by \\"the Hive\\" (a lab buried deep under Raccoon City, more in common with the 2nd and 3rd games).  So, once I turned off the RE fan boy inside and gave up on the hope that this would be a faithful representation of some of the finest games in the world, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience.  However some problems are inherent with the movie itself.  The villainous Red Queen seems to have conflicting motivations from scene to scene.  At times she seems to be merely enacting protocol, other times she seems to be playing a malevolent game with the lives of innocents.  The zombies, other than a couple instances, are uninspired.  Unlike the game where the people have had time to rot and are sufficiently dead-looking, these look merely like people that don't get out much.  The special effects are hard to believe, especially the Licker.  It doesn't look convincing, or even reasonably scary (a Hunter would have been a more suitable monster, if not several Hunters).  The fight seen between Milla and the Dogs is forgettable, and stupid.  Finally, the obligatory femme fatale SWAT team member, that takes no guff and shows no fear, is both contrived and offensive.  Otherwise, Resident Evil is an entertaining, if uninspired movie with more in common with Aliens than the game from which it recieves it's title.  I suggest you check it out.
B000067CPX|5.0|Where do I start?  I've become emotionally attached to four CDs in my life - the chili peppers' \\"Blood Sugar Sex Majic\\" and \\"Californication\\" and the smashing pumpkins' \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Saddness\\".  The other CD is this one, \\"By The Way\\".  I've been a fan for a while, loving up songs like \\"Give It Away\\" and \\"Suck My Kiss\\", but always also diggin' songs like \\"Tearjerker\\" and \\"Soul To Squeeze\\".  I loved how they could play the two styles of music and make em' sound equally amazing!  Funk is a state of mind, and everything they play masterfully shines through.  They are the only musicians on the planet that I think were destined to play together and make crazy wonderful nice music.  <BR>1)By The Way - 10/10 - Probably already heard this one, it's all good<BR>2)Universally Speaking - 10/10 - After I heard this one the first time, I was moved.  Anthony said it was about everything in life and you can hear it, I get instantly happy with every listen<BR>3)This Is The Place - 10/10 - I love the way it builds up at the end....damn, it's just so good after you get used to it<BR>4)Dosed - 10/10 - Nice ballad that also features some great textures and layers <BR>5)Don't Forget Me - 10/10 - This one is a personal favorite.  I love how the bassline is the same throughout, but you would never notice it.  Features the mother of all build-ups<BR>6)The Zephyr Song - 10/10 - The second single features a cool beat and sound in the beginning, followed by a nice chorus and somewhere towards the end, a great instrumental part is really great<BR>7)Can't Stop - 10/10 - As funky as anything on 'Blood Sugar Sex Majic', this song is a gem.  It's very catchy and the chorus is excellent.  Just listen and tell me they aren't the coolest 40-year olds on the planet!  They can rock better and harder than ANYBAND half their age.... damn this song rocks nice, hope it'll be a single<BR>8)I Could Die For You - 10/10 - One of those songs that you'll never get tired of.  SUCH an intense, sincere love song.  It almost makes me fall in love with ANYONE! BY THE WAY - listen for the bassline around 2 minutes and a half - it's incredible! Better than sex <BR>9)Midnight - 10/10 - Starts off great with strings, and gets better as it goes on.  Great song<BR>10)Throw Away Your Television - 9/10 - A strong song that starts off with an intense, funky drum and basslines.  Thanks to Flea and Chad<BR>11)Cabron - 10/10 - Unique as hell (name me one other band that could or would record this - such a great change of pace!) John really shines here - got better after a few listens for me<BR>12)Tear - 10/10 - After much thought, this song is my favorite.... maybe even the best the Chili's have EVER recorded.... it's so sweet on the ears, it's basically an orgasm to my ears.... gotta love Flea's fantastic trumpet on it!  get's better every time....<BR>13)On Mercury - 9/10 - Another song that I wouldn't have expected.... really is neat<BR>14)Minor Thing - 10/10 - Just about sums up this album, what a tune!  Fast and catchy, and just about the best thing I've ever heard.  Thank John for pushing for it to be included on the album!  GREAT CHORUS   would make a great video/single<BR>15)Warm Tape - 10/10 - Like nothing I've ever heard, really sounds cool.  Kind of relaxing<BR>16)Venice Queen - 10/10 - WOW !  ! ! !  what an amazing sonic song!  is a masterpiece.............  you just have to hear it....  especially love the first 3 minutes!  All Chili albums have unique, great closers, and this is the best one to date....<br />To everyone who reviewed it in the first week they got it, man you are not doing anyone a favor by reviewing something you dont know too well.  I've already had to buy another copy. You have to give it a fair shot you'll be happy.  Anthony and the band spends too much time making this great stuff for you to listen to half of it once and give your opinions.  Anyways, I hope people enjoy it as much as I have, and I eagerly await their tour of BY THE WAY andcant wait for Bsides and videos of the songs that I love.  <BR>All I can say is it is just one of those CDs....better buy it!!!!
B00003CXI0|5.0|This movie is excellent! It goes hand in hand with the book. The characters are cast to PERFECTION! The special effects are amazing! This movie will leave you breathless and on the edge of your seat! I have it and it's a pleasure to watch with the family!
B00005JKDR|4.0|Unlike their contemporaries at Dreamworks, the folks at Pixar continue to turnout high quality entertainment with excellent special effects and computer animation time after time.  This movie is great for young and old alike.  As opposed to the traditional fairy tale type story, Disney has taken a different approach this time.  Instead of human or animal heroes, we have monsters.  It has the usual entertaining Disney storyline, complete with enough twists and turns to keep it enjoyable.  And, true to form, Disney has made this film both funny and entertaining.  This is a definite keeper, and will be a great addition to anyone's Disney or animated film collection.
B000000QG2|5.0|Like Roy Buchanan and Van Gogh, Rory Gallagher was an artist who shared something real during his lifetime.  Rory was an incredible blues player, but more so he rocked and vented through his playing.  Let's put it this way, he influenced Schenker.<br />Unlike Stevie Ray Vaughn, Rory did not rely on cliche appearance nor cliche guitar licks.  His voice and his guitar playing and tone were much more unique, well crafted and interesting than &quot;SRV&quot; or Clapton for that matter.  It's not just my opinion, it's really supported by the music.  If you're not familiar with Rory's music, but you seek out blues based hard rock music, than this album is what you've been looking for.<br />No hat, no rainbow tape on the guitar.  A Marshall tone that screamed, a ballsy voice and great songs.  You won't see a VH-1 story on Rory, but you'll wish you would.
B00005JL0I|5.0|Those who say they don't get the plot have missed the point: there isn't one!  This movie is meant to be absurd and make you laugh at the total incongruity of it all.  When the brass come to bring James Bond out of retirement he's a stuttering nutball; when he gets back to headquarters and Moneypenny, he asks \\"Have you noticed me stammering since I got here?\\"  She replies, \\"No.\\"  He says \\"Good.  Let me know if you do, I haven't got time for that now.\\"  And so it goes.  If you're expecting coherence, you won't find it here.  If you want to laugh yourself silly, this is the place to be.  And Woody Allen plays Bond's nephew, not his son.I consider this one ofthe funniest movies of all timeIf you can't enjoy this flick, you are taking yourself far too seriously.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|This is another one of those movies that you either love or you hate. I seem to be in the minority. As a fan of musicals I was looking forward to the film, and definitely to the rebirth of the movie musical. I was quite disappointed by this film though. First, it represents everything that is bad about postmodernism. The quick cut editing (a la MTV and Michael Bay) doesn't lend itself to a musical - or at least a traditional musical) and before you say it isn't a traditional musical (which I realize), understand that musicals rely on staging for effect. The director is so quick to change the shot or angle before the audience gets bored that he never allows the actors to truly perform. At times it becomes even cartoonish and while an accurate approximation of a vaudville musical, it's hard to generate any sympathy for Nicole Kidman or to even begin to care about the love story when Baz doesn't care enough to develop the characters beyond two dimensions. With only one original song, the soundtrack sounds like a well done greatest hits of pop songs with elaborate orchestration. Kind of like The Boston Pops does KIIS 97 FM (The best hits of the seventies, eighties, and nineties). While Luhrman certainly has an eye (reminiscent of Terry Gilliam in many ways) it doesn't lend itself to a musical - and without his help this production (as beautiful as it is) collapses under its own weight.
B00003CXXP|5.0|It wasn't easy, The long-standing champion is \\"The Big Easy\\", and that is one movie that is a model of filmaking perfection!
B00005JKQZ|3.0|An overrated film in my opinion - expecting very little of its audience and offering so little. My gripes are plain enough. <BR>1) I don't buy Russell Crowe as a graduate student. All of his classmates seem to be nearing forty - in fact, one of the characters played a graduate student in the 1986 film Real Genius. You do the math. <BR>2) The makeup in the final scenes of the film is really bad. Jennifer Connelly and Russell Crowe don't look like they're aging, they look like they're melting.<BR>3) The sentimentality here is over the top. Ron Howard is a great director in that he knows how to manipulate his audience well. Only in the case of this film, he may have done it in such a way that some may find the end result to be insulting to their intelligence.<BR>4) The performances, while not bad, certainly aren't as spectacular as the reviews would have you believe. Jennifer Connelly is playing Jennifer Connelly - and Crowe's west virginia accent sounds like what an Australian's approximation of a West Virginia accent would sound like.<BR>5) The writing is rather bland. The film's reveal seems set up for the maximum effect, not to serve the plot. Its like someone thought that it would be a good idea if the film had a Sixth Sense twist - but when it happens it makes the film lurch in another direction - quite distracting in a serious drama.<br />In conclusion, there have been better films made by Howard and better dramas in 2001. I doubt that this is better than the infinitely more interesting Memento - and it certainly doesn't challenge you. It just does the math for you, so to speak.
B000059GEH|5.0|HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE was the first non-musical comedy to be released in the CinemaScope ratio.  The film was released in 1953, which proved to be Monroe's breakthrough, watershed year, with the success of MILLIONAIRE, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES and NIAGARA cementing her place as one of the top box-office attractions of 1953.<br />MILLIONAIRE is one of Monroe's most delightful offerings.  She plays the visually-challenged Pola, who, along with Chotzi (Lauren Bacall - KEY LARGO, THE BIG SLEEP) and 'Loco' (Betty Grable - MOTHER WORE TIGHTS) rents a Manhattan penthouse in the hopes of snagging rich husbands.<br />Of course, Fate often hands you things totally unexpected, and soon the girls realise that money can't be a substitute for happiness.  There are plenty of pin-sharp observations about the opposite sex, a good 50-odd years before \\"Sex and the City\\" decided to make a whole TV show about women in the Big Apple.<br />Marilyn, Lauren and Betty make a colorful trio, and the CinemaSope picture is indeed a treat to the eyes.<br />The DVD includes restoration comparisons and trailers.  Available separately or as part of the Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection.
B000002H72|5.0|Writing a review of this album is like writing a review for Thriller. If you're a fan of the pixies you already own this, if not - you won't be reading the reviews. That said, while this isn't the &quot;best&quot; that the Pixies have to offer, it is certainly the most accessible to non-fans just getting into the Pixies. It was my first album and I had no problem running out and picking up all the rest right away. Granted, this album has most of the hits and even the most in the dark music listener would recognize Debaser or Monkey Gone to Heaven. It's sure no Surfer Rosa - but it really is a crowd pleaser. You can't go wrong with this album.
0553801481|5.0|After reading Ms.Hobb's trilogy of the Farseer series, this was like a gift, to us, her readers!! I was so glad that we had the Fool and Fitz all to ourselves for quite some time!! Then, the story flows from there to find the missing prince, with Nighteyes help, of course. What a treat--don't miss this for the world!!
0812550706|5.0|Yes, folks, it's true. The first time I read &quot;The Book&quot;, the one that has its own small shrine in my room, I stayed up all night-- from 1.30 to 10 in the morning when I finished it.  I don't like missing sleep-- I'm a big fan of the stuff-- and it takes quite a book to make me break my strict bedtime of uh... okay, so I don't have one. I love this one. I think it's ruined me for other books. The games, the characters, and especially my love for the protagonist is unequaled by any book I have ever read, and possibly any book known to man. Read the book... *pokes you* read it now...<BR>PS: and yes, I did actually fall asleep at dinner with my grandparents the night after I read this.
