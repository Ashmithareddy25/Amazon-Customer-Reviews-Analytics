B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is so great that they should make second movie. My idea of second movie is that Nemo is lost again, to a place call BiKini Bottom where Spongebob live. Then Spongebob travel with Nemo to find his home. But there will be lot of dangers.<BR>It should call &quot;Spongebob meets Nemo:Finding Nemo 2&quot;
0345423496|4.0|I recently finished Arthur C. Clarke's 3001: THE FINAL ODYSSEY.  Like all of Clarke's later books, 3001 was very entertaining and also thought-provoking.  This volume completes Clarke's speculative series.  Each book stands alone in its time line but are related by common themes.  They are really four versions of one story each told from a different point in the story.  For instance, in 2010, Jupiter becomes a sun that burns for thousands of years.  In 2061, the Jupiter-Sun burns out.  In 3001 the Jupiter-Sun is still burning brightly.<br />Frank Poole's body has been found drifting in space and then revived.  The last thing Poole remembers is being on a mission to Jupiter.  Now he finds himself in a world a thousand years later.  The ban keeping humanity away from Europa is still in effect.  Because of Poole's relationship with Bowman, it is suggested that he might be able to land on Europa.  Poole tries and is successful.  He is contacted by what was Bowman.  Later, in another contact Bowman brings distressing news.  The nearest center of the intelligence that created the Monoliths is about 450 light-years away.  That means that the events of 2001 have made it there, a decision has been reached and the answer is almost here.  Bowman also knows of a link between the Monolith makers and a nova that has been puzzling scientists.  It appears that a planet exploded and that triggered the nova.  A similar fate might be in store for humanity.  The forces of Earth, aided buy Halman (Bowman and HAL), put together a plan to survive.  The most destructive computer viruses ever devised will be fed into the Monolith by Halman.  The plan proves to be successful.<br />3001 is billed at the final Odyssey but it really opens up more questions than it answers.  Now that Earth and Humanity have the attention of the Monolith builders how can we expect them to ignore us?  I don't think they would but Clarke is done writing in this series.  Maybe Gentry Lee will pick up the torch and continue the run.  Another amusing aspect is the continual references to Star Trek.  Clarke has also taken the opportunity to update some of the technology and history that Frank Poole should be familiar with.  All in all it was another fine effort from possibly the greatest science fiction writer still writing.  The book also contains an extensive afterword detailing scientific research, history and plot similarities with other projects.  If you have read any of the other Odyssey books I recommend reading this one as well.
6305090564|5.0|This movie is so great that they should make 2nd movie call &quot;Monster Island:DEEP RISING 2&quot;. With different characters.
B00004U8JV|4.0|Recently I was able to catch Spielberg's The Lost World.  I say Spielberg because other than the title it bears no resemblance to the book.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  While a lousy interpretation of the book it is still a good film.<br />Jeff Goldblum is hired (by a man who is dead in the book) to study the ecosystems on InGen's Site B where dinosaurs have been flourishing.  Only the fact that his girlfriend is in danger gets Goldblum to go.  No sooner does he arrive and try and convince her to leave than a massive InGen expedition shows up to hunt and capture dinosaurs.<br />InGen's plans for capturing dinosaurs goes awry when Goldblum and friends release the dinosaurs during a satellite-linked board meeting.  InGen plans to open a dinosaur park facility at the San Diego zoo.  During the chaos every radio in the camp manages to get trampled.  The survivors must now find a way off of the island.  Unfortunately most of them are killed in a brief attack by velociraptors while in tall grass.<br />The few survivors of the second expedition manage to capture a T-Rex and ready it for shipping to the states.  Goldblum and friends escape by helicopter.<br />In San Diego the T-Rex manages to escape and go rampaging through the city.  Goldblum must lure the T-Rex back onto the freighter that brought it to the States.  In the end a huge navy escort follows the freighter back to the island while Mr. Hammond implores to public to leave the dinosaurs alone; they deserve it.<br />Some people definitely had fun making this movie.  There were scenes from classic and not-so-classic movies including King Kong, Godzilla, Carnosaur 3 (CARNOSAUR was the book Crichton got the idea for JURASSIC PARK from) and others.  Two scenes I particularly enjoyed were a crowd of screaming Japanese looking over their shoulders while running in terror and a little boy who wakes his parents to tell them that there is a dinosaur in the back yard.<br />It was reported that a paleontologist madesure that the dinosaurs acted as current scientific beliefs say they should.  Hah!  The Stegosaurs were the size of apatosaurs.  Something, possibly the escaped triceratops, managed to knock a hummer airborne so that ir reached an altitude of at least a hundred feet and an amazing distance.  Velociraptors can now leap three stories up and forty yards out.  The tyrannosaur can run right through building walls without slowing down.  Fun?  Yes.  Realistic?  No way.  Needless to say if the dinosaurs acted this way in the first movie then no one would have escaped.<br />Still, it was a very fun film that I recommend to any dinosaur lover who can stand to see people pulled apart by huge carnivores sharing a tidbit.  The Lost World (the third film by that name) should be available on video and day now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The first thing I'll say is that Firefly has amazing characters. They are complex people, each with their own secrets and pasts. Set 500 years in the future, the series follows these characters through several &quot;jobs,&quot; usually illegal, crossing space and avoiding enemies. Combine these characters with a unique filming style, believable future universe, and deliciously evil villains and you have an unbeatable series. <br />The DVDs contain each episode aired, plus three that never made it to TV. Also, the DVDs contain a ton of terrific commentary, great bloopers, deleted scenes, and other special features.
B00005UW9T|4.0|At the end of last week I had the opportunity to see Anastasia.  Due to the prevalence of magic and the changing of history, Anastasia does qualify as a fantasy film.<br />When the Russian empire falls (in a fortnight due to Rasputin's curse), young Anastasia escapes with her life but not her memory.  An old member of the court and an old member of the palace staff look for a girl they can pose as Anastasia in order to collect a reward.  The girl they pick turns out to be the genuine article.  After some harrowing adventures made more difficult by the efforts of Rasputin from beyond the grave, Anastasia is reunited with her grandmother.  Then, just as all obstacles and plot complications are out of the way of romance the final showdown with Rasputin occurs.<br />One of the main reasons I had wanted to see this film was that it was the first true challenge to Disney's animation empire.  I was very surprised to find out that Don Bluth (All Dogs Go To Heaven and other dogs) was behind the film.  Bluth seems to have finally figured out how to make a good film and Anastasia will hopefully not be the last.<br />There are a few faults (of course) with the overall plot and the dealings with history but if one accepts this as alternate history they are not a real problem.  For one, Rasputin dies by accident (although he does drown).  Anastasia is found and reunited with her family.  The Russian Empire is likened to Camelot where all is good for everyone.  Rubles seem to have worth outside of Russia.  But if you can handle that, you should have no problem with the story.  The only real problems I had with the production involved the musical numbers and the animation.  There was some good music but it just wasn't as clear as it should be.  Oftentimes one had to guess what the song was about.  The problem with the animation stems from to jarring an interface between the computer animation and the cell animation.  Hopefully these small problems can be eliminated in future projects.<br />So, overall I really enjoyed the movie.  It was a fun story with some old cliches eliminated (Tracy thinks they too a close look at the success of Buffy The Vampire Slayer).  The animation was beautiful, if jarring in a few spots.  The characters were likeable and believable and were backed by some excellent voice talents.  If you get a chance to see this one on a big screen you should take that opportunity; it's worth it.  If not, get the DVD.
B00005JN0A|5.0|This was a great movie. Whatever you do don't mess with Absinth believe me i know.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Hip Hop wasnt looking too good until Kanye West &quot;College Dropout&quot; CD came out. I was blown away by how the beats didnt sound like Lil Johns last song. Kanye has given Hip Hop what it needs to survive, some awesome beats, some of the most lyrically intelligent lyrics ive ever heard and some positive messages. All of the songs are great on this CD except maybe &quot;Workout Plan&quot; but if you listen to it enough, youll wanna listen to it some more. One of my personal favorites is &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; which has one of the coolest beats ive heard in a while and great lyrics. Im not a real big religous guy but i enjoyed this song alot. Another great song is &quot;Spaceship&quot;. When i first saw the title of this song i thought it was a joke but its one my alltime favorite songs. I suggest picking up this CD immediately folks you wont be dissapointed!
0385507755|5.0|Not being as eliquent with words as James Frey is, I struggle to communicate how this book has impacted my life.  There is something about it.  It is intriguing.  It captures you from the very beginning, and I am easily distracted.  The writing format keeps you interested along with what is being said.  This gives NOTHING away, but he describes drinking coffee in this book to the extent that I ALWAYS think about his description everytime I have a cup of hot coffee - which is every morning.  So I think about this book every morning.  I don't struggle with addiction.  I, of course, know people who do or have.  It is just a fabulous book that really changed me.  I love this book.  Absolutely love it.  Will read it again.  But am letting it marinate for a while.  Please read it.  It will move you.
0394818237|5.0|Wish I could give this 10 stars. I discovered this book as a preschooler in 1968. My mom would take me to the local library every week. I checked it out from the library and I was hooked. I wanted to check it out at every visit, so my mom had the library order a copy for me. I remember even before I could read the words, I completely understood the story from the illustrations. I still have that original edition. It is tatered but still intact. I bought another copy this year for my preschool sons. They absolutely love it as well as the other Scarry book I had as a child, Busy Busy World. The newer book is the abridged edition. The abridged edition has 63 pages as compared to the ~95 pages in the original. They removed 4 stories from the original: busy (stay at home) mom, water treatment plants, electricity and how we get it, and Sgt. Murphy the Busytown policeman. Why? Somebody at the publisher must have had a lobotomy. Anyway, we keep the original up in a closet to read only with adult supervision. The new one is on the shelf, readily accesible to the kids.   This book (even the abridged edition) is an absolute classic.
B000148KK2|4.0|Let's say you're the manager of a 20-something power-ballad-pop-diva whose career is traveling the increasingly well-worn path between Radio Disney and the Betty Ford Center. <br />Your pop princess comes to you in a moment of personal emotional crisis. Bad luck: she will not star in next summer's remake of last summer's remake, and her hopes of becoming a crossover movie star, not to mention a Burger King action figure, have been temporarily dashed. So she has decided that she might actually have to work on another CD.<br />Any ideas?<br />Well, you say cautiously, it's not really you, but if you want to listen to an artist who has found something of herself, you might listen to the latest Diana Krall, 'The Girl in the Other Room'. <br />Found something of herself, she mouths. Secretly she has been holding a grudge against you since the Super Bowl. Why wasn't her breast the one that was exposed? Then she would have found something of herself. <br />Instead she smirks.  \\"Diana Krall is elevator jazz. Music for root canals.\\" <br />Perhaps it was the last temper tantrum in her dressing room when she held up a bottle of Evian and complained that she had specifically asked for low-carb water. <br />Anyway, something snaps. <br />\\"If you want to get a clue\\", you find yourself saying, \\"lock yourself your house, and listen to 'The Girl in the Other Room' over and over. Drill down, and listen to 'Temptation' over and over. Drill down and listen to one phrase over and over:<br />I know that he is made of smoke<BR>but I've lost my way<BR>He knows that I am broke<BR>so that I must pay<br />\\"Learn what separates talent and artist. Learn that each note is like a hand that touches your skin: It's not the touch, but the beginning of the touch and the end, the attack and decay, the sensual texture of the music that matters... Learn something about phrasing. Listen to exquisite production and hear the importance of great sidemen.\\"<br />\\"Learn something about an artist who took a chance, who said this is what I like, and it comes from many sources.\\"  <br />Then you turn on your heel and walk away. <br />It probably was the best thing for both of you.
0790729687|5.0|This is one of my favorite films! absolutly wonderful. It's true to the book as much as possible, and really brings the emotion across. If you loved the book, this will be right up your alley!
B00008EY65|1.0|IMO, this film is like X-man and Spiderman but this one is not as successful as the other two.  The story is neither attractive nor novel.  The acting is boring and no character is really outstanding or special.  I can hardly watch this film from the beginning to the end at once.  I don't recommend this film to anyone.
B00024BHTC|1.0|When you thought Nightwish couldn't get any worse, they release this pile of garbage. Symphonic crap, blasted out with stupid synthesiser effects, awful vocals and done all before guitaring.<BR>Once is a terrible album.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I bought this months ago and still can't stop listening to it.  There's not one song that shouldn't be a classic.    Also, I would like to respond to Adrian from NJ (whatever that stands for) and his review of 26 May, 2004.  He criticized my review of 25 April, 2004.  He seems to think that my review is somehow invalid just because most of the facts I refer to are wrong.    Okay, you're right.  The Beatles were quite a good group.  I didn't realize that they were the ones who did some of those songs I've heard alot but didn't know the artists of.  An example of what I just said is that I didn't know that The Beatles did \\"Hey, Jude\\" which I always loved (as a song).  But, I didn't bet you didn't know that Led Zeppelin didn't do \\"Paranoid\\" and that it was, in fact, another English band called The Black Sabbaths.  We all know some things and don't know other things.  That's what makes life rich, Adrian.      And perhaps the lead singer of Joy Division was not dismissed as much as he committed suicide (if you call hanging oneself suicide).    But, this I'm right about:  Franz Ferdinand is a person, not a band.  Look at the name!  It's a first and last name!  Why would a band have one person's name?  So, they could get on planes with only having to buy one ticket?  I think they're too rich at this point to worry about that.  And, what would happen when they actually had to sit down in the plane?  No attendant is going to let the rest of the \\"band\\" stand the whole flight.  And, M.C. Mobbs, who also attacked me with his criticism in his review of 29 April, 2004, stated that you can tell Mr. Ferdinand is a band because there are pictures of the four (4) band members in the compact disc packaging.  Uh...Not exactly, Mr/Ms/Mx Mobbs:  I only see a picture of one hip-looking youngster feeding his horse.    Both of these attackers also saw fit to criticise me for informing my public that CD stands for compact disc.  They think it's obvious.  Well, in case you didn't know, CD also often means Certificate of Deposit.  I see no reason not to clarify.    Why?    Why am I attacked by these two (as well, incidentally, as by all my \\"friends\\" lately)?  I am a great reviewer!  I have a lot of reviews published in Amazon!  I've never had a rejected review!  I work soooooo hard for those of you who don't know good music!  I try to teach you, but you just attack and bite.  Stop biting me!  It hurst!!!  Aaaaaaaah!   Why????
B00004TDTO|5.0|Before the PG 13 rating existed, producers of Jaws placated the MPAA ratings board by adding &quot;May be too intense for younger children&quot; after the PG. May be should be changed to MOST DEFINITELY. Jaws broke box office records BECAUSE people of ALL AGES found it amazing. Jaws may seem quite tame today, but in 1975 it kept all age groups out of the surf.  It succeeded because all aspects of the filmmaking process were done excellently.  First, the script. Speilberg wisely jettisoned the affair between Hooper and Ellen. He softened the characters making them more likable.  He obviously changed the ending to make it more spectacular. Next, the acting.  Perfect casting choices all around, from the 3 leads to the smallest part (secretary Polly is a riot with that voice). Location shooting was right on the money.  Beautiful beach is made ominous at night. Effects: Speilberg may complain but the mechanical shark is very convincing when it is on screen (mostly near the end). Lighting, editing, and of course the most famous musical score of all time are the icing on the cake. Top it off with an eye grabbing movie poster, and how could you NOT succeed.<BR>This is one of my favorite movies, I usually watch it around the fourth of July. The DVD is excellent, however the 75 minute documentary was cut by about 45 minutes (which was included on the laser disc). That aside, enjoy this marvelous film that will make you feel you are on that boat, that beach, or most chillingly, in the water.
0312335164|4.0|Dan Brown may not be a literary genius in the traditional sense (as many reviewers have pointed out in detail), but he's certainly done something right.  Four of his books have received thousands of reviews on this site, and I doubt we've all been reading the same copy. Instead of a negative review citing poor research, farfetched storylines, and juvenile writing skills, I'll offer this simple, positive remark...<br />Along with The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress is an perfect &quot;escape&quot; book.  If you're looking for a mental break from &quot;the everyday&quot; and want to experience a fast-paced, entertaining read that won't keep you tied up for more than a few days, any Dan Brown book will do the trick!

0060512806|5.0|I've read Cryptonomicon twice now and am convinced that while this is very tough read, it is both highly entertaining and extremely educational. Stephenson has a tendency to weigh the reader down with minutae, but it's the kind of information that'll make you hit the internet to learn even more about. The plot switches back and forth between two eras: 1940s in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of WWII and in present day. If you're a technically minded person interested in historical fiction, cryptography, and the evolution of currency (i know, sounds weird but is highly interesting written by Stephenson), this is a must read.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|this movie was pure genius, and the same goes for the soundtrack. the songs are weird, which fits. the music will only be good if you have seen the movie though. without seeing the movie first, the music is like a rambling homeless man.
B0001EBXBK|5.0|Uma Thurman plays the ultimate kick-ass, no-holds-barred chick in Kill Bill. I completely loved her character. <br />The music totally rocked. It's funky and a medley unlike anything you've heard before in a movie. I've bought both 1 &amp; 2 OSTs. I couldn't resist.<br />I'm warning you: there are a few scenes that have a high 'ick' factor, but actually, the worst gross scene in Vols. 1 &amp; 2 combined was the &quot;eyeball in the trailer&quot; scene in Vol. 2. Oh God, ew. Vol. 1 does get pretty gory, but the way Quentin did it, you can almost think of the movie as Japanese animation, but with people. It didn't bother me too much.<br />Okay, there IS a cliffhanger ending... but that's because Kill Bill is one entire movie. Quentin had to cut it in half because otherwise we'd be sitting in the theater for 6 hours. So: you have you watch Kill Bill Vol. 2 soon afterward you see this. That's what I did. Vol. 2 is coming out on DVD pretty soon, so no worries.<br />Above all, if you're into 'different' movies, with an edgy and funky feel, be sure to watch this.
B0000024PC|3.0|The haunting score of &quot;The Graduate&quot; was provided effectively by Simon &amp; Garfunkel.  It's the lyrics and eerie acoustics that provide the real backdrop for the film and the soundtrack.  I felt kind of disturbed by the Grusin tracks, although appropriate in the film, end up being scanned by on my CD player to hear Simon and Garfunkel in a continuous unfolding of the film.  It's beautiful in the car on a crisp autumn day.  Scarborough Fair is the true star of this soundtrack and April Come She Will.  I wasn't born until 1975, but always held onto the cusp of this age of music because it reflected the real mood of the film, one I didn't appreciate as a kid in the 80s, but understood after I became a college graduate.  It's great to have the authenticity of the original score, but if you're buying &quot;The Graduate&quot; solely for Simon &amp; Garfunkel, you may find 90% of the score sitting on your dad's music shelf . . .
B00005RHGK|2.0|high expectation when i put the dvd to watch it.... in the end, disappointed. an average movie, very predictable, we dont know who the creeper is and where does he come from.. there are better movies in the categorie. watch it in the tv...
0385510438|1.0|I have read most, if not all, of Grishams books and this one was by far the worst!! I've actually stopped reading it about 3/4 the way through because i have ZERO interest in finishing it. It is very boring, has no suspense, and jumps around a lot. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have a lot of CDs.  I have a lot of good CDs.  I have some awesome CDs.  I have few perfect CDs.  This is one of the ones I would categorize as essential.  It took me up until just recently to start checking out Radiohead, and I am so surprised that I never really bothered with them before.  It is hard to find words to fittingly describe this disc, and I don't know if I want to try because it's all been said before.  This music stabs you in the heart, lifts you back up again, and then knocks you back down.  The last three tracks almost sound like their own little section of the album and are perfectly placed as the &quot;ending&quot; of OK Computer.  I find myself almost in tears by the time &quot;The Tourist&quot; ends, and I haven't had that kind of reaction to a disc since I first heard Porcupine Tree's &quot;Stupid Dream&quot;.  This one will always have a presence in my rotation.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|My mother has always been a big fan of Dylan and I liked a few of his songs (i.e. Hurricane, Shelter from the Storm) but it wasn't until I heard the entirety of Blood on the Tracks that I truely appreciated Dylan's genuis. The album starts out with one of the most deeply moving and thoughtful ever. Tangled up in Blue is really food for the soul following a young man's on and off romance with a girl. The other excellent song is Idiot Wind. I must've played this songs more time than any other. It's amazing that a song could you keep your intrest for 7:50 minutes. Idiot Wind is a rant against the self obsessed but still makes you feel, and thus is a masterpiece. I have heard people complain that Bob Dylan's voice ruins what otherwise could've been a very good album. I have but one thing to say, no one else has felt what Dylan has felt and therefore no one could put the same emotion and passion in to his songs.<BR>Buy this, you won't regret it.
B000001A3H|4.0|Personally, I don't like the vocalist. Sounds too much like Dio and very dated. But the music..............the music man is pummeling. Makes you want to drive your car through a shopping mall or something. The music ebbs and flows like lava destroying everything in it's path even at it's slowest pace. If you're into the whole guitar solo thing stay away because there aren't any. Don't get me wrong, the guitar playing is phenomenal seeing how Josh was only 19 when they recorded this. You'd never guess though. Definitely can be compared to Sabbath but it's no rip off. And this ain't Queens of the Stone Age the Early Years either. Totally titanic and stands on it's own. I'd hate to call it a concept album but every tune sets up the next very well. I think they just spent some time on the order of the songs is all. Like a good mix tape does. My favorite Kyuss album by far and never fails to blow me away.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I dont understand why there are some reviews talking so bad about the band and the album, by someone who doesnt identify (chickens?)... by the way, if you like nightwish you will love the album, it is my favourite along with oceanborn. it has an heavier guitar sound, excellent melodies, its great, believe me it is awesome!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|All true art acuratley reflects the human soul. For instance &quot;Hello&quot;. The music is both lovley and alive. I would'nt call Evanescence a hardcore rock band, nor exactley Gothic, just a portral of what we won't say; not out loud.
B00005JMYG|1.0|I only went to see this movie with a freind becuase she wanted to, and I had nothing better to do. Plus, I like Christina Applegate, and I thought that it possibly *could* be funny. Well, Will Ferral was, but only occasionaly. The rest of the movie and cast wasn't. I smiled at some of the jokes, while the rest of the crowd at the theater HOWLED with laughter at every single joke, seemingly just to laugh. This is one of those stupid-humor movies like \\"Scary Movie\\", but not as extreme. And like \\"Scary Movie\\", \\"Anchorman\\" gets old fast, and therefore gets very boring. It throws gag after gag at you, and they just aren't funny. And Christina Applegate, while not awful, didn't seem to be putting much work into the role as the tired strong,competetive sassy women.
B00003CXCT|5.0|What really more needs to be said about the Star Wars Trilogy? It's the classic Sci-Fi Fantasy Saga. I don't understand the big fuss over the special editions only being released. People are so anal over a few extra scenes and added footage to closer match the original vision for the films. I'll buy the trilogy and I'll enjoy it too because I'm not someone who is scared to have a little change in the movies. George Lucas probably didn't even see the sense in releasing the original versions in the first place since it's all right there in the special edition, and it's how he wanted the films in the first place. Afterall, they are his films. Just watch the movies and don't let yourself get in an uproar over some minor enhancements.
B00020HEL6|5.0|The orchestration, arrangements, and amazing singing talent in terms of style, timing, phrasing, and voice on this CD are worth every penny if you are a fan of this type of music at all ... &quot;older standards.&quot;  Some songs are very much Diana Krallesq and one or two lean in the direction of Norah Jones.  Those I can do without.  In Norah Jones I find nice music, but nothing special.  Renee has much more to offer and, when she turns to a Diana Krall style of orchestration and adds her own voicing, she wins me over completely.  <br />At 15 years old, this young lady and comic actress seems to be an amazing talent.  Her bio bears witness to this fact.  Her singing is wonderful and, judging by the list of well knowns, including Chris Botti, that helped her on this CD, the right people seem to agree.  <br />Buy this CD and hope that she continues, because if she does, with another 3 or 4 years of maturity, this will be a singing talent to be reckoned with.  If she takes the time to further develop her own style, phrasing, and voice even more, she will be a premiere singer who's CD releases we will all anxiously anticipate.  I am already looking forward to the next one.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD is way too short.  Good, hard rocking CD, and the use of double vocalists is one of the coolest things about this band.  The music is fresh, with just enough bite without going overboard.   Very highly recommended.
B00005RYLE|5.0|This film is the ultimate horror movie. Great sneaky gore with a good storyline (unlike most horror movies) and not-so-bad acting or directing to be such a low budget film.
B00018D44U|5.0|I usually listen to hardcore, punk, blues, and am just getting into jazz. Norah Jones is great. I'm not one to say this but she makes me want to sit on a porch with a chick and watch a nice storm drinking tea. She definetely relaxes you. It's not just about the relaxing though she is really talented!
0553382179|1.0|I was (...) looking for a book about organizing clutter - wanting suggestions for containers, shelves, new ways to organize,etc.  I picked up and skimmed through this book, and found it amazing that there are some people out there that need to be told to throw away old crusty toothpaste tubes.  Is it possible?  And they know how to read too?<br />The writing was sickeningly syrupy sweet, and not my cup of tea (which you may have only after you have cleaned your kitchen for 15 minutes, your living room for 15 minutes, and your kitchen again for 15 minutes).  But you may only have your cup of tea for 15 minutes!  There are glowing testimonials from ladies who have used this book and website to change their lives (all misspellings are included) - the one I read was the lady who said she now had a better sex life due to FlyLady's cleaning and organizing methods.  This was a 30 year old housewife, who apparently had no idea it might be a good idea if she cleaned the house while her husband was at work.  Also, she learned that she could cook instead of order pizza, and give the kids a bath at night and read to them.  Oh yeah, and start washing her face in the morning.  All this turned on DH (Dear Husband) so much that...well, you can figure out the rest.<br />As none of this applies to me (I already take a shower every morning), and I can't go through my apartment looking for 27 items to throw away (they are already in the trash to begin with), or 27 items to give away (I keep a box in my closet for this purpose, and when it gets full, I take it to a local store that benefits a no-kill animal shelter).  So basically this book had nothing new for me.  And I'm not going to wear shoes in the house.  Any expert will tell you it is bad for your flooring, bad for your feet, and just plain unnecessary.<br />If you are in really bad shape and in dire need of someone to tell you to throw away empty shampoo bottles and such, this book may be of some benefit.
B00005JMUA|1.0|I've seen every Tarantino movie.<BR>And I have to say, this is the worst.<BR>I thought he was done a quality material again. Heck, NO!<BR>Why did you have to do this, please tell us? <BR>Maybe the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. And I'm honest.<br />This movie was made for primitive people. They usually eating popcorn, they're drinking cola, and they're laughing at primitive jokes.<br />(...).
B00005QK3B|5.0|every marillion fan should have this album in collection.a must.
B000002J09|3.0|As said in the official review, this song has many great songs which are all drowned by Stairway to Heaven. Although this song is fantastic and it is obvious why it is so famous, it is also overplayed and frankly quite boring after god knows how many times its been played. The highlight of this album, or rather the low point, is the straight up blues song When the Levee breaks. This is the song which makes me put on the album over and over again. I normally listen to it and then it goes back in its case ready for the next time i need to calm down. There are many other songs that are worth listening to, Black Dog is a clasic example of how rock and roll should be played, this was not matched until Deep purple and AC/DC came along.<br />There are a lot of people saying that Led Zepplin created rock. This is not true. Music historians have decided that the day Elvis Presley released his first song was the day rock was born, way back in 1950.<br />I have also seen a lot of people describing Led Zeppelin as 'Heavy Metal'. This is very very wrong. Heavy metal was born with Black Sabbath. Led Zeppelin is in the genre classed as Hard rock. To prove my point, Led Zeppelin is crap heavy metal but fantastic hard rock.<br />The points made about Zeppelin being a band for people who play instraments is somewhat true, although i don't play any i do understand what is skill and what is not, and this cirtainly helps.<br />And a final point. Well done Avril Lavigne fan #1 you can make jokes. And if that wasnt a joke, i aplaud you on liking corperate made music and having the most eclectic music style i have ever seen.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|Move over, Blade:  there's a new girl in town.  Kate Beckinsdale plays a vampire assassin who kills werewolves in an ongoing, ages-old feud between the two groups of nightime dwellers.  Although she is a member of a clan, she doesn't really feels she fits in, and spurns the affections of the young and handsome  next would-be leader of her clan.  The only one she has complete respect and adoration for is her ancient sire.  Things start to change when she finds out more about the true reason the two groups are fighting, and falls in love with a human caught in the crossfire.  This relationship lends a Romeo & Juliet aspect to the film.<br />Set in a modern Romanian city,  Underworld is an orgy of extremely violent action between the decadent vampires and the Spartan werewolves.  Supercool, with great acting, gorgeous sets, and KB in a skintight leather suit with kool boots, Underworld is a classic that I am proud to own.
B00006G8O1|4.0|The young Richard Kelly, director of this film, graduated from USC Film School in 1997. This was his first feature film. He has spun a dark multi-layered vision, part dramatic comedy, part science fiction, part fantasy and allegory. The movie almost needs to be classified as three genres stirred gently. He set the world of the film as autumn 1988. It is, in part, a story of adolescent teenae angst, the familiar turf of a John Hughes project, but actually it is more like John Hughes meets David Lynch meets Steven Spielberg. Kelly has put several interesting twists into the high school yarn. It is like a hip FERRIS BEULLER'S DAY OFF.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal, from MIDNIGHT MILE &amp; OCTOBER SKY, played Donnie Darko brilliantly. He was a young man smarter than his teachers, his parents, and his friends. An intrepid curious lad who could ask those questions very few wanted to answer. He is a kid who is being treated for mental illness, even though he may not have been clincially ill. He was outspoken, outrageous, and socially boorish...like most smart teenagers. Roger Ebert wrote,&quot; Donnie is appealingly smart yet sarcastic, more quixotic than eccentric, more curious than frightened.<br />The film's prologue is bang on target. A bright sunrise on dark foothills, suddenly interrupted in the frame by the insertion of the black silhousette of a young man's head. Donnie Darko, there on the hard ground near his bicycle, far from home. After he cycles home, his arrival is treated as familiar behavior; sleep sojourns, adventurous forays into the darkness. That very next night, we witness him roused from his slumber by someone calling his name. He slips outside and we meet the presence that has beckoned him...a medium longshot of someone in a rabbit suit...someone named Frank. But this rabbit, tall as HARVEY, is not a benign companion. Its face is twisted into a demonic death mask. With Darko away from the house, we see an accident happening. Something has fallen out of the night sky, and crashed directly into Donnie's bedroom; a 707 jet engine. If he had been there when the engine came acallin', he would have died instantly. Frank sends Donnie off to do devilish chores; flooding the school, and burning down a house.<br />Nothin is linear or logical in Darko's dreamlike world. His parents are too understanding. His new girlfriend, Jena Malone, is really too easy to get to know. Physical laws, like an axe being buried in a bronze statue, are tweaked and violated. The film can only approach some level of cohesiveness if one is able to conjure up a premise, a through line. For me, most of the characters presented are probably actually a part of Donnie's<br />&quot;real&quot; life, but as they were mostly presented in the bulk of the narrative, they were peopling his &quot;dream&quot; life. One possible explication for the whiplash lunges from drama to comedy to satire to science fiction and fantasy, was that most of the film's narrative occurred from the time Donnie was awakened in his bed, either by Frank's voice, or the faint sound of the 707 engine whistling and plummeting down toward his bedroom. Time was compressed, like in THE INCIDENT AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE on the Twilight Zone, a sort of Alice through the Looking Glass dream squeezed into those precious elongated seconds.<br />This film poses more questions than it offers answers for. There are theories that we, as spiritual entities, can sustain more than one version of our &quot;Self&quot; in parallel dimensions similtaneously. Somehow, it seemed that Donnie called on one of his alternate selves to swing through those last few brief moments, those seconds that stretched out into 30 days. Perhaps time is relative, and does not exist on the other side. I think this movie requires several viewings to begin to be fully appreciated. It is an original vision, bizarre yet strangely familiar, and immediate with it's punch to the emotional gut. It is eccentric, yet appealing.ght sky, and crashed directly into Donnie's bedroom; a 707 jet engine. If he had been there when the engine came acallin', he would have died instantly.

0385510438|2.0|I read this book and found that it is a little bland. I think that Grisham is just throwing books together now and not taking the time to make a great book. Still think his best book to date is a &quot;A Time TO Kill&quot;
6305127689|5.0|TOPGUN..wat can i say. i grew up watchin this film ,its fun, exciting,thrilling and above all SEXY..tom cruise has never looked soo hott...this movie has given a new meaning to the song 'Youve lost that loving feeling' youd be surprised how many pilots, footballers sing this to girls in bars...it has an amazing soundtrack. 'take my breath away' performed by berlin is a wonderful emotional lovesong that truly melts your heart. so if your a fan of a little romance then this will be a movie top of your list. i know a lot of my boy friends have enjoyed this film so its not just a sloppy romance for girls. the boys get a kick out of 'Maverick'  the stud played by Cruise who is 'one hell of an instinctive pilot'  who learns never to leave his wing man. His best friend 'Goose' is the coolest character hes so entertaining. there are really fun sexy catchprases, such as 'goose ya big stud take me to bed and loose me forever'  and 'son your ego is writing checks your body cant cash'<BR>Top gun is a great movie to just chill out with some popcorn on the sofa and watch with your best friends. ill guarantee you will definately enjoy it.<BR>\\"there are no points for second place in Topgun.\\" (girls checkout the volleyball scene...mmm)
1592400876|4.0|No, it's not an authoritative style book, though it does set out some well thought-out guidelines on punctuation. And no, it's not a comprehensive grammar text. Syntax mavins aren't likely to learn anything new. It is, however, a delightfully witty, highly readable survey of a traditionally deadly dull subject. Here's a fun, brief analysis that is certain to be informative and useful to the average reader and writer. If you think apostrophes and commas are nothing to laugh about, you're in for a surprise.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is more a review of the package than the movie , which is a classic and extremely well presented on disc one....vivid colors , crisp images....not a complaint there....and the bonus features are very good....a comprehensive set of Errol Flynn movie trailers...WB night at the movies....(an exhausting Rudy Belmer commentary track that will have you gasping for air).<br />the SECOND disc is just ridiculous in its amount of archival coverage..<br />a wonderful documentary on the movie<br />a great feature on the history of Technicolor....<br />two very fun looney tunes cartoons with a Robin Hood theme...<br />outtakes from the movie!<br />home movies shot during filming!<br />a long lost Errol Flynn movie about yachting..<br />and a positively thrilling short film about archer Howard Hill...<br />and more.<br />HOURS of fun and informative viewing on disc two alone!<br />Warners should be congratulated for such a comprehensive set ....buy this and encourage them to keep this type of content coming!!!
B00005O5CM|3.0|I was expecting this movie to be full of dumb blonde jokes, but was pleasantly surprised. Considering I'm naturally dark, and dye my hair as dark as possible, I'm never gonna be blonde, and it probably wouldn't suit me. But I do have what people would call my &quot;blonde moments&quot; where I say/do something stupid. I don't see why brunettes can't be labelled a bit daft at times too! Cos I definitely am!<br />This movie is carried by a strong cast: Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Stifler's Mom from American Pie, Ali Larter, Thomas Andrews from Titanic, and many more! My faves out of the cast have to be Ali Larter and Stifler's Mom! They stole the movie out from underneath Reese Witherspoon.<br />What is amazing about this movie, is the sheer amount of time spent on Reese's hair (which looks suspiciously like extensions). Throughout the movie, she has a mere 40 different hairstyles, which sometimes feels like a different hairstyle for each scene of the movie. Reese also wears a lot of different clothes for each scene, a lot of them with something pink in them, which she all got to KEEP after this was finished shooting! Free clothes, alright for some!<br />Once again, Selma Blair comes across as a bit of an ice queen in her role as Vivian, but you'll be glad to hear, the ice melts before the end of the movie!<br />What didn't I see coming in this movie? What Victor Garber's character really turns out to be. And trust me, he's not as nice in this, as he was in Titanic.<br />There is a sequel too, which I'm sure I'll manage to get my hands on eventually. And Stifler's Mom comes back for that too! That's how good her role is! But this is basically a feel good movie, which shows you don't need to change for anybody.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I picked this album up about two weeks ago and it hasn't left the CD player since.<BR>An amazing amalgam of reggae,jazz,ska,salsa etc that lifts the spirits every time.<BR>I see many people complain that it sounds the same as his previous album,&quot;Clandestino&quot;,which I haven't heard (although I have heard the song &quot;Bongo Bong&quot;). The music from that song is reutilised in a couple of tracks on the new album but I have no problem with that.When you can come up with such a gorgeous melody as the one in question here why let it drop? Shane MacGowan of the Pogues did the same thing and no-one ever complained there. Not to mention AC/DC who have essentially only ever written about four songs.<BR>I would recommend this album to anyone who needs a lift,a dance or an alternative to mainstream pop.I challenge anyone to listen to &quot;Promiscuity&quot; and not have their face break into a grin or &quot;Me Gustas Tu&quot; or &quot;Homens&quot; and not move their feet.<BR>I will be buying &quot;Clandestino&quot; very soon in the very hope that it sounds like this album.<br />Pure Genius!!!!!!
B00005JMUA|2.0|The first one ruled. But when the second one came out- Everything went wrong.<br />Too much talking and blah blah blah in this movie. In the first movie my eyes were wide, in this one, they were shut.<br />Now the scene of Uma coming out of the coffin through the dirt was straight out unreal. I didn't know if I was watching action or a Sci-Fi movie.<br />I give it two stars because there were some scenes that were kind of cool- To mention the kung fu master scenes and the 4th Assassin losing her left eye.<br />I don't even want to go about the ending how Bill dies. There could've been more to it.<br />Don't waste your time renting this or buying it on DVD.
B000002J1U|1.0|Cover of CD nice. It interesting. Music not good.  First song sound like band trying to scare people.  And man who sing songs, not understanding why people like him. He look a like a man, but he too much sound like woman. Pretty sure he a hippie too. It sound like they use cheap guitar on songs. Sound not clear, it just very loud. Maybe they make some money first and buy better guitar.  Songs not very understanding either. Not good!!
B00005M91K|5.0|I can gaurantee this is unlike any film you've ever seen before.  Baraka is not a movie with a plot or words, but it is one massive work of art, a composition with the scenery as the main &quot;characters&quot;.  This movie will open your eyes to the fact that there is a whole world of different cultures, religions, and rituals out there.  It will give you chills, make you smile, make you gasp, and make you appriciate diversity.  Baraka is not a film for everyone.  If you are ethnocentric, you might not see the point.  If you have a passion to learn and become enlightened, you will love it.
B000005H7D|3.0|The music is good, the cover is iconic, and it was recorded for the most famous jazz label.  So, why three stars?  Mainly because compared to the truly masterful Trane of just a few years later, this sounds tame and boring.  It could be called &quot;Coltrane For Squares.&quot;  The title tune and the solo he plays on it are first rate, and show how he was evolving toward his later style.  But there is still a long way to go.  The rest of the album is pretty standard Blue Note bop material.  Again, not bad, but not nearly as special as everyone makes this album out to be.  If you are looking to start digging into Coltrane, this is a totally safe album in which to do so.  But, if you end up going further with him, you will hardly ever come back to this one.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie had nothing but non-stop action. Hearts pumpin', bodies droppin like flies. Uma Thurman rocked!!<br />The story blended in pretty well. From beginning to the end, it left you smiling out the theatre.<br />Lucy Liu wasn't an angel in this movie- She was wicked!!<br />I recommend it.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|The Butterfly Effect is quite possibly the most provocative movie I have ever seen.  After I saw it in the theatres, I couldn't stop thinking about its message for weeks.  There are definitely some disturbing scenes, but the film is not intended to cheer you up or make you happy.  Kutcher and Smart's characters are compelling in their own ways, and the rest of the cast seamlessly shifts from one alternate reality to another.  The critics were very harsh on the film, making a big deal out of plot holes and flawed logic that you could find in every film of this genre.  This is a movie where you must suspend your sense of logic and think about one of life's most fascinating questions - what if we had the power to &quot;rewind&quot; our lives and change something?  How would it affect our future?  I bought this DVD and just watched the Director's cut - the alternate ending is a little more sobering than the theatrical ending but makes just as much sense in the film.  The DVD also has loads of special features including some short takes on chaos theory and time travel.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who is looking for an intense, provocative sci-fi thriller.
B00005JMUA|4.0|First of all, understand that I am not reviewing the DVD, as it has not yet been released. I saw this film in the Good Old movie theatre, right on the second row. KB2 is definitely a different animal from KB1, as the martial arts action is not as predominant (except for a few key scenes), and there is more character development. A large chunk of the film concerns the back-story, or what happened prior to the beginning of KB1. Tarrantino flips back and forth in time, but this never slows the flow of the basic plotline. The episode featuring Michael Madsen is by far the most entertaining, and his comeuppance is quite grisly indeed. Dialogue is superb and oftentimes hilarious, with Gordon Liu getting off some really choice lines; in fact, he is one of the best things about this film. Don't be put off by some reviewers, who have stated that the film is boring, compared to KB1. This is like comparing apples and oranges (they both taste good). All Tarrantino fans should love this film, it delivers all of his trademark style and eccentricities.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|A movie that never loses it taste.<br />&quot;When you get the money, you get the power. When you get the power, then you get the women.&quot;<br />&quot;All I have in this world is ba11$ and my word.&quot;<br />A man who started off as a peasant, working his way through in life to be one big bad mobster and took no nonsense from anybody.<br />He had his own ideas. When he wanted something, he took it. Heh! He took Frank's wife.<br />The ending cannot be forgotten. He went out like a 'G'. All coked out and cappin' a bunch of Sosa's mob. Too bad Scarface the cheap shot by the dude with the glasses. That was a punk who needs no respect.<br />This movie will always be remembered.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Out of all the Nightwish CDS I own, this one sounded... quite different from the others. It is really good, and I have enjoyed it thoroughly. For those ppl that say this is trash - they really have no room to talk. I doubt they could sing like Tarja can, plus she's been professionaly trained. For each and every one of you who diss them - you really have no taste in music.
0060989157|5.0|This was a great book......great pictures and the stories of these guys is just amazing. The fact that it is so in detail about each band member and how they told each of thier stories is amazing. The fact that they are all clean and sober is just as great. This band is amazing and I do feel that the music will live on forever. Don't ever judge a book by its cover. Highly recommended.
B00005Y7PS|4.0|Yep, it doesn't have much to do with Ozzy-era Sabbath, so if that's all you're looking for, you can pretty much disregard it.<br />But if you like a wider palette of metal, this is really a great disc.  The opening four songs are all top notch metal and cover a pretty wide territory.  Anno Mundi may be the most 'progressive' song  Sabbath ever did.  The Lawmaker is fast, has a killer chorus riff, and sounds a lot like something off of Holy Diver, actually.  And The Sabbath Stones is a classic, with a pure doom riff changing to a fast triple time outro.<br />There's a silly little synth orchestration in the middle, then you get another killer pair, the quiet, pretty Odin's Court flowing directly into Valhalla, which is upbeat and almost anthemic, with a catchy chorus you'll scream along too.<br />Surprisingly good production and high re-listenability value; I've got a lot of spins out of the disc and still enjoy it a lot.  More than anything it reminds me of Savatage in the Zak Stevens years, so if you like that kind of metal, definitely check this out.
0380789035|4.0|After being such a huge fan of the Sandman series, I approached this book with caution. I read his collection of short stories, 'Smoke and Mirrors' and impressed by it, decided to see how Gaiman tackled the non-graphic novel. I was bowled over. This is a great absorbing read, and so well written, that one can really 'see' it anyway. I won't go into details as they are mentioned above, but I particularly liked the historical sections of these people bringing their gods to America - very intriguing.<br />My only faults are this: the road trip seems to sag a little in the middle and draw out a bit too long. In two places, I found myself thinking 'ok, I got the plot already - wheres the action?' and also, it has left readers wondering at the end because the fact it's a trilogy hasn't been made clear. The second part is coming out later this year, I believe.
B00006AW2F|4.0|&quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, the great lost outtake collection, finally gets its first official CD release. It had already been long out of print by the time I became a Stones fan as a teen, and the general critical and fan buzz for all the years that it was unavailible was usually a curt &quot;Don't bother.&quot; How wrong those reports have been!<br />&quot;Metamorphosis&quot; offers up several treasures for the Stones afficianado, the bulk of which consists of several fine examples of the earliest fruits of the songwriting combo of Jagger/Richards. Some of these early efforts are very good indeed, and I can't imagine how they got left off of some of those early Stones albums in favor of less interesting cover versions of blues and rockabilly standards.<br />In addition to the earliest material, the album opens with a terrific orchestrated version of &quot;Out of Time&quot; which blows the &quot;Aftermath&quot; version right out of the water (actually, it is pretty much identical in arrangement to the Chris Farlowe version of the song which came out about that time). There is also a much rawer version of &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; than the one most are familiar with. One of the best outtakes on the disc, &quot;Family&quot; comes from the &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; period, an effective work highly reminiscent of and on par with &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;.<br />Stones completists can now rejoice! Now, if they'd only re-issue &quot;Sucking In The Seventies&quot; for those rare single sides . . .
1400032717|5.0|I was floored by this book...the way Mark Haddon was able to crawl inside Christopher Boone's head and deliver what is - for all intents and purposes - a 226-page monologue is nothing short of a spectacular achievement.  For the first time, I feel like I have true insight on what it means to be autistic.  The revelations here - for example what Christopher 'sees' when he is standing in a field vs. what the 'normal' person sees - are eye-opening.  Christopher is compelled, no *forced*, to remember every small detail.  No wonder life and its newness each day are so frightening for him.<br />You will devour this book.
B00003CWNR|2.0|Roger Ebert said it best:<br />&quot;A larger question remains: Why is there such a muddle about the movie's subject? I left the theater wondering what the movie thought it was about and was unable to say. It's almost deliberately unfocused; it shows us many events without guiding them to add up to anything definite.&quot;<br />I got up from my bed wondering the exact same thing.  A movie should never leave you with that big of a question.  If it does, it did not accomplish anything, because it is as if it felt it had nothing to accomplish.<br />I was highly disappointed with this film.  It just didn't work on so many levels.  Lasse Hallstrome is probably my least favorite major director at the moment.  It seems he exists solely for Miramax to hire him so they can produce another accessible --no matter how impersonal-- piece of crap such as this in order to garner Oscars and, in the end, more money.<br />Many have said it is an important film because it approaches family and abortion.  But the family aspect was so sparse it felt non-existent for about 75% of the running time.  And the issue of abortion is left at an unfortunately impersonal level, exploring whether or not Tobey McGuire's character Homer finds it moral to use the medical skills his confident Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) has taught him in order to help women with abortion without bringing the issue past Homer himself.  It does not ever leave the television screen.  You aren't left thinking about whether it is right or wrong, or whether it should be legal or illegal, the woman or man's choice.  I would further my point, but I would risk spoiling the film. <br />I think the only thing I truly enjoyed about the film was Charlize Theron.  Otherwise, 'The Cider House Rules' was bland and confused.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Not much happens on this album, no raging solos, no instantly memorizable melodies, no thunderous or mind blowing drumming.  So why 5 stars?  Because this album has something about it, an ineffable atmosphere of calm beauty that is joyful, trancendant and yet peaceful.  Its like a cooling summer rain punctuated by occasional thunder in the distance.  Its pastoral, yet electric.  &quot;In A Silent Way&quot; is considered Miles first fusion album and the first in which he explored rock rhythms (that's debatable).  Its also ironically one of his most tranquil and beautiful.  An ambient masterpiece.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I think all these negative reviews are just hilarious! It is so painfully obvious most of the people who wrote them haven't even listened to the album. Right now it's &quot;cool&quot; to not like Madonna, what with this album not selling as well as her other albums have and her wanting to be called Esther. When you review an album, you should start by, I don't know, actually listening to the album and not trying to be cute by posting negative comments when you have no idea what you are talking about. It's just like what's happening to Damita Jo by Janet Jackson. It's different if you actually listen to the album and ended up not liking it.<br />OK, enough of my venting! I think this is a terrific album. Madonna continues to do her own thing and takes her music in some unexpected directions. Madonna does a lot of introspection on this album.<br />1)American Life: many people seem to hate this song, mainly because of the rap. I actually like it. It's not one of her best ever, but she takes risks here and not enough artists do that nowadays.<BR>2)Hollywood: I love this song. It is fantastic and I love the lyrics in this. My favorite line is &quot;Music stations always play the same song. I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong.&quot;<BR>3)I'm So Stupid: she does some powerful singing here. This is a pretty cool song and it is very good. <BR>4)Love Profusion: another great song. It is one of this album's many highlights.<BR>5)Nobody Knows Me: this has got some really smart lyrics. The line &quot;It's a set up and I'm fed up&quot; is really simple yet effective (as the best Madonna songs are).<BR>6)Nothing Fails: excellent song. The choir at the end reminds me of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;. I love the meaning behing this song.<BR>7)Intervention: probably the best song on the album. It is just so incredible and she does some of her best singing here. Everything about this song works.<BR>8)X-Static Process: another good song. This has some really good lyrics in it.<BR>9)Mother and Father: my least favorite song. It's good, but compared to the others I just happen to like it least. <BR>10)Die Another Day: I love this song. I thought it was one of the coolest movie theme songs I've ever heard. Madonna really got it right with this song. She usually doesn't include her soundtrack songs, so I'm glad she did in this case.<BR>11)Easy Ride: great way to end a terrific album. It really makes you think.<br />Having actually listened to this album (unlike so many of the reviewers here), I highly recommend it. I have listened to it several times and it gets better each time. Madonna gets really personal on this album and although it hasn't sold as well as her other albums, neither did Erotica and that was a really good CD. When the &quot;Let's hate Madonna since that is the new cool thing to do!&quot; bandwagon comes to a close, people will finally start to appreciate this album for what it is: a highly introspective album that takes chances and really does pay off for the listener. Until then, this album will continue to gain a following of people who enjoyed this CD when it wasn't the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.
B0000CABBW|5.0|The story of a young Maori girl born to be a leader. However, her grandfather, the village elder, keeps searching for a male leader. It is a really touching movie and an interesting look at Maori customs. Keisha Castle-Hughes is radient. I highly recommend WHALE RIDER as well as the book of the same title by Witi Ihimaera. Karen Woodworth-Roman
B00000F6LQ|5.0|excellent.  Possibly the funniest movie ever made.  Who could forget such a line as &quot;I fart in your general direction.  Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of eldeberries.&quot;  This is a great movie and a great dvd edition that gives it justice.  This is completely worth the money.  A comedy Classic.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|\\"Oh goodie, another teenage movie featuring the pretty-boy-of-the-moment\\", was my thought when my husband brought home The Butterfly Effect last night.  He rarely picks anything I would have, although about half the time his selections surprise me by being good.  Happily this turned out to be one of those situations.<br />TBE is about a boy growing up under a peculiar curse; he has occasional blackouts, during which he does things that he cannot remember afterwards and which usually traumatize everybody around him.  They often come at key moments of his life that end up in disaster before he comes back to himself.  CAT scans of his brain show no organic disorder.  Hypnosis doesn't reveal much.  His mom and circle of friends learn to accept him and cope with him, and he grows up with some strong friendships until he has to move at age 14.  That's the last he hears from them until he revisits childhood sweetheart seven years later.  Her life has been a downward spiral since he left and after he leaves this time she commits suicide.  Remorse drives him to reexamine his childhood journals for clues and answers to why things got so bad, and he makes a disturbing discovery:  he can travel back in time to those blackout periods and redo them.  The question now becomes, should he?  Because on every one of those \\"trips\\", his tampering has unexpected, horrible results for one or more of his loved ones.<br />I never used to think much of Ashton Kutcher, for better or for ill, but TBE changed my mind about him.  He proved that he can play a smart, compelling character with a good range of emotions.  I believe that Kutcher may have a future in Hollywood aside from the himbo roles he's been stuck with up until now.  Let's hope some casting directors agree.<br />My final opinion of TBE is that it is a somewhat dark, but well done film.  The plot is not perfect (toward the end there is a big plot hole that I won't reveal so I don't spoil it for you) but it does raise intelligent questions for the viewer to ponder on the long-term consequences of everything we do and what moments in our lives really decide who we will become.  It was also engaging on a more gut level that I can't explain, but I enjoyed the entire hour and fifty five minutes.  Recommended.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle
B0002DRDBE|5.0|the others have already shown what the special features are so i'll just say that I cannot wait until september 7th.  This is a great movie and I would suggest buying this even if you already have the first release edition. The extras themselves are worth the money.  This is the best Kevin Smith Movie ever.  Dogma, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back are great movies but, aren't as good.  I'm not even going to include Jersey Girl.  Back to the point, this is definetly worth buying and is a classic.
0375707972|4.0|I really loved this book. It has so many different levels that it can leave one pondering the issues over and over in their mind a week after they have read it.
0385335482|2.0|This book was terrible.  I always finish the books I read, it was done painstakingly with this book.  Her lying was just annoying!! I don't even understand how she ended up with the guy in the end.  Truelly terrible book
0440418569|1.0|The first two books of this series were wonderfully written, fast paced marvels that held me riveted by the hour - I couldn't put them down. The characters were intriguing, genuine, and well rendered. I was facinated with the plot that never let up for a minute. So when I picked up the last book to the trilogy I expected nothing less than to be amazed.<br />How sorely I was dissappointed - there is only one way to sum up the ending of this trilogy - horrible! I felt SO CHEATED!!! As many other reviewers have stated - there were so many loose ends that a good portion of the storyline was rendered pointless - what a shame! I can accept that not every story has a happy ending - that is what makes life bittersweet - but I felt that readers, myself included, deserved a better crafted ending than we were \\"served\\" - This ending makes you long for even one more chapter that would truely and artfully conclude this trilogy so it could become a true masterpiece.<br />- Hey, my final thought - it is never too late to for a revised edition!!!!!
B000065V9Y|4.0|if you live in the usa and have no health insurance to go to a therapist and talk about how screwed up your life and relationships are--then buy this album.  <br />this CD is better for my psyche then 10 sessions with my therapist, and i wish i was kidding.<br />anyway, peter gabriel does good.
B00003CXXM|1.0|I watched the movie a week after I read the book, and that probably wasn't the best idea. The only part of the movie that follows the book is him waking up not knowing who he is, and having the number to the bank account in Zurich. That is where it ends. I tried to appreciate the movie as a movie, and not as an adaptation but I found it impossible and turned the movie off somewhere near the end. Not cool.
B00000AFDW|4.0|the people that gave this such bad reveiws are'nt real KISS fans so don't listen to those morons, I like this album, the only thing bad about it is, that it got hyped so much. But its still a good KISS album.The highlights to these are the title track, Into the Void, Within, Raise your glasses, and Journey of 1000 years.<br />This is a good KISS album.
B000094DUP|5.0|Amazing album from the Australian Superstar. Sold over 2million copies; at Number1 on the ARIA chart for 29 weeks. Delta is Australia's sweetheart and her debut album has spawned 5 Number1 hits.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Its been a few months since I went to see The Passion of the Christ twice in theatre. Both times I was moved to tears and both times I witnessed the brilliant direction of veteran director Mel Gibson. I wonder, where are the riots that Jewish leaders claimed would occur? Where was the rampant anti-semitic acts that were to happen because of the this simple little film? As far as the papers were concerned, the sky was supposed to fall after this movies release. Instead a wave of love spread through out our nation. People from all walks of life were brought together by this film to celebrate their faith and witness the raw and inspiriring portrayal of the life and death of Jesus Christ. Christians everywhere were supposed to suddenly hate the Jews after watching this movie, instead something else happened. Christians everywhere showed their intelligence and good will and understood that this film had NO such message. All of that talk and concern, over nothing, all it did was take away from the REAL story about this movie. The story of a God that loved man enough to sacrifice himself for us. Come Oscar time, we will see how Hollywood treats this masterpiece. Will politics get in the way of truly rewarding the best film of  2004? Only time will tell.
B00020HEL6|2.0|I am sure some people or going to attack this person because they don't like her music or her age or something to that effect.  If you close your eyes and listen to her sing, you won't even notice anything like that.  Reminds me of the attacks against the talents of Nora Jones by fans of Avril Langione.  I love all kinds of music myself as well except maybe attack rap songs and a few others.  I listen to the Motown Oldies station here at my job because that is about the only clear fm I can get.<br />But this girl has been singing for a number of years and I am sure she was involved here in Houston with a number of local singing groups.  A friend of mine said he recognized her from some of the vocal workshops he use to go to.  <br />She has a talent and knows how to display this to the audience which is where her acting talent comes in.<br />You will be hearing her name for sometime.<br />Brad
B00000JQFL|5.0|This is the kind of live album that shows that Earth, Wind &amp; Fire was a strong combo on stage, featuring a dynamic set with lots of improvisation and hot playing. Just listen to Sun Goddess, Africano or Reasons. Unbelievable! isn't it? Definitively of one the best live albums ever.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This made for television film first aired nearly 25 years ago while the Cold War was on - and it still packs the same sobering multi-megaton emotional wallop as it did back then.  The story and scenes of human and animal tragedy and suffering will haunt for days afterwards.  It's very good early 1980s period piece that fairly accurately depicts the rising Cold War tensions early in the Reagan administration.<br />In a reprise of the Soviet blockade of Berlin two decades earlier in 1961, the plot begins with a Soviet blockade of access points between East and West Germany, following by the massing of troops on the border between East and West.  When the Soviet bloc troops move across the border, NATO responds by unleashing tactical nuclear weapons on the invading forces, destroying two German cities in the process.  The Soviet responds by targeting a NATO regional headquarters in England.  It rapidly escalates from there to a major exchange of MIRVed ICBMs, including electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons that detonate high in the atmosphere and knock out all electrical and electronic equipment.<br />All of the European developments are depicted via fast paced news reports and bulletins coming into a worried American heartland on  what would have been an otherwise typical early September weekend as people went about and planned their lives.  One of the more chilling scenes vividly depicts the contrast between normal life and unfolding nuclear exchange.  Two children innocently watch television, unaware of the gravity of the situation, as their amorous parents slip upstairs for a quick interlude before breakfast.  Suddenly a TV bulletin interrupts to report the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.  The scene then shifts to a nearby Strategic Air Command base as klaxons wail and B-52 crews scramble to get their planes into the air.  The film is set in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas.  Jason Robards puts in a fine performance as a doctor and the central character.
078581325X|5.0|This book contains some of the greatest mystery stories the world has ever known.  Throughout the book, through the eyes of Holmes' friend and assistant Watson, who recalls the things he sees and hears while in his friends company.  This book also features illustrations that create a further interest in the story itself.  Doyle shows his genious by leading the reader throughout each story (while successfully hooking them) and providing them with all the necessary clues to solve it.  Of course none of it ever ties up in your mind which further compells you to read on faster and faster.  When always at the very end, you see how Sherlock's genious (kindly provided by Doyle's genious) ties everything together very effectively by using the famous deducted theory which was concocted by Doyle and is used in every single Sherlock Holmes novel/story.  This is a fabulous book and it will make you thirst for more.  This is not a book to pass up!
0790729369|5.0|Anyone who calls this a snooze fest is scared to death of themselves.  This is a true love story.  Its about a romance that keep people alive whether they dream of it or in this case actually get to live it.  I hope someday to meet Mr Eastwood and Ms. Streep and thank them for doing this movie.  Watch the movie, read the book and dont be ashamed to cry and to dream and cry some more.  It's ok.  It's a beautiful story of something so special that few us ever get to feel.  I am a deep romatic and love to write love songs and play them on my guitar.  I have been married to my wife for 26 yrs.  We dream of finding someone who really cares about us and appreciates us and doesnt take us for granted. Some people are threatened by those who can openly share there dreams and secrets.  They are ahsamed of being.  I dream of true love and romance.   To find someone to slow dance with under the stars to the music of each others hearts.....  Someone to hold hands with, and feel so damn happy you pray to God it will never end.  Thats what this movie and story does for me.  Cheers.

B00005QDW5|5.0|I'm a 17 year old kid. Most of my life Ive listened to the same things that everyone my age listened to. Modern rock, some rap, you know what I mean. However just recently when going through the radio I happened to hear the song &quot;Wish you were Here&quot;.  I didnt know who sang it but I knew that I liked it. I hadd heard it a good three times (without ever gettin sick of it) on the radio before I found out that it was actually Pink Floyd who sang it. The song &quot;Time&quot; was the second of Pink Floyd's songs I heard on the radio and I began to think to myself, wow these guys are really good. So I purchased this album. I wanted a greatest hits compelation because I wanted to know their whole deal and not just one part of their recording career. After five minutes I knew that I knew that I had just bought something by one of the greatest bands I had ever heard in my life. This album is amazing. Despite what any of these other critics are saying. If you want a good way to know what these guys are all about buy this album. Amazingly the songs run together seamlessly, like a huge double album, so you can have a song from their album &quot;Meddle&quot; right next to something from &quot;The Wall&quot;. All of the songs on this set are incredible but their are only a few that really truly stuck with me for days after I listened to this. &quot;Hey You&quot; being the first one that appeared on it. The entire selection from &quot;The Dark Side of The Moon&quot; album is brilliant although I do wish they had included &quot;Brain Damage&quot; in the place of maybe &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;. The song that I like the most however is &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamnod&quot;. On the album &quot;Wish you were Here&quot; this song is seperated into two party, 1-4 and 5-7. On this album it is one huge song titled 1-7. And it works very well. Then of course there is &quot;Wish you were Here&quot; which at my heart is the one which started me off. And it truly is a great song, probobly the best piece of songwriting put out by Pink Floyd. This album is amazing. One of the best greatest hits sets I have ever had the privilage of purchasing.
038073186X|2.0|I love Lehane's books - have read every one of them. I thought I was in for another treat as I started this book but soon the parallels to \\"The Ninth Configuration\\" (W.P.Blatty published in 1978 by Harper and Row and taken to the screen in 1980 - Stacey Keach plays the lead role) became transparent and the end of the book predictable. What a disappointment! Why would Dennis Lehane jeopardize his reputation? How did this make it past the editors? And why aren't more people screaming \\"This has been done before!!??\\"
6301966015|1.0|A fashion photographer discovers a crime. So what??? Big Deal!!!<br />The action is slow, boring and unrealistic.<br />The photographer is arrogant and simply rude both to<br />his assistants, and to his customers. All actors are square<br />and unconvincig, schematic. All the action spins around the<br />daily activities of the photographer and his frozen face.<br />I would understand, if this crap were made in 1920s, but hey!<br />Wake up! The year is 1966! So, this piece of garbage is just an example how NOT to make movies. And I do not care how popular the actors were, and how great the director.<br />Do not waste your time, unless you are A movie major and this one is in you Summer Viewing List.
B00006RINF|4.0|This woman's voice is amazing, and she is extremely sexy.  So hot in fact, that I now only want gothic chicks....<br />The only thing I don't like is Andrea's voice, it sounds good in \\"Heaven's a Lie\\" but in most songs he should not be allowed to sing. I really don't know what it is, maybe its just because her voice is so much better. I wish Maynard was the male vocals instead of Andrea..hey why not three bands is better than two.  Overall though, great EXPERIENCE...GET THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW you will not regret it.
B000001ELF|5.0|Probably the best KISS solo album.  Period.  Simmons wasn't close, Stanley had a couple of good songs, and Pete kept trying.<br />This album was a testament that Ace was in fact more talented than people were led to believe.  For years he stood in the background as Simmons and Stanley basked in the sun.  This album put those guys to shame.  Even his first solo effort with the comets was better than The Elder.<br />Face it KISS fans if you want the best, this is it.  Don't bother trying to fan the flame on this one, it speaks for itself.  If KISS would have given him a little flexibility on Psycho Circus as well as Pete we might have had a good KISS album.  We as fans continue to suffer from the band direction helmed by Stanley and Simmons.  Perhaps they should hear this album again and then realize who they let walk away!<br />Ace you are the best and this record is the testament to true Frehley fans.  Thanks for many great years of listening and hopefully we get a new solo cd from you.  My favorite track is &quot;In Need of Love&quot;.  Amateurs take note....<br />Peace Out!
B00000G3PA|2.0|We all love sci-fi disaster movies. It's a guilty pleasure. I can tolerate disaster movies as long as there was effort involved to make it as entertaining as possible. This movie was watchable, but it was not an entertaining experience. \\"Armaggedon\\" is a movie that is bombastic, nonsensical, cliched, ridiculing, and is an insult to a moviegoer's intelligence. The Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay team is the worst Hollywood duo next to Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. Sure, \\"mindless fun\\" can have its moments, but \\"Armageddon\\" pushes this way too much.<br /><br />The summary in a heartbeat: An asteroid \\"the size of Texas\\" is on its way towards Earth, and the US government hires oil drillers to drill into the asteroid's center to nuke it internally. The writers seemed to reach for some undesired effect here. So what if the asteroid is the size of Texas? You don't need an asteroid that size to wipe out Earth. A city-sized asteroid is all it would take. Were the filmmakers paranoid that the movie will lose flavor if the asteroid were only the size of Seattle? And despite it's size, an asteroid does not have the same gravitional pull that the Earth or even the Moon does, yet the astronauts walk on the asteroid as if they're strolling through the city park.<br /><br />\\"Armageddon\\" plays like a montage on steroids. It just does not know how to enjoy the scenery. Camera angles shift and change so fast like an MTV-style music video, as if the filmmakers wanted to prevent you from taking a better look. It felt like the film was going to short-circuit on me. The disaster scenes are among the worst ever filmed. Closed-up shots so that the audience can't comprehend the mayhem is an insulting and annoying film gesture.<br /><br />The script is one that is completely dry of original ideas. The usual world in peril and average Americans have to save it. The usual sentimental farewell of the sacrificial hero. The usual love complications. The usual fumbling of high authorities. Cliched scenes like having to decide whether to cut the red or blue wire before the bomb explodes. This movie ridicules everybody, and it's not done in good taste. It ridicules NASA. It ridicules the President. It ridicules Russians. It ridicules average citizens. Everybody is a half-witted pawn for the plot's progression. The movie lovingly sets up human beings for doom as if they're too stupid to know what's coming. There are a number of scenes were the filmmakers decided \\"Hey, let's insert a disaster here!\\"<br /><br />The movie is littered with other kinds of nonsense. At the end of the movie, Harry says to AJ, \\"I've always thought of you as a son.\\" Right. At the beginning of the movie, he was chasing him around the oil rig with a shotgun. Then there's a scene where the nuke is about blow in less than a minute, but Harry takes his time to talk about his determination to drill his mark. Then the asteroid is about to hit the zero barrier mark, but Harry takes his time to say a final goodbye to his daughter. The world is about to end, for crying out loud. Giving lengthy banal eulogies seems more important to the director.<br /><br />\\"Armageddon\\" is an ugly, frantic, burdening experience and is a movie that makes you wonder if the filmmakers even went through any edits in the screenplay. Another asteroid movie \\"Deep Impact\\", while not great, still wipes the floor with this one. Hopefully this movie will serve as an example of what NOT to do with making disaster films.o decide whether to cut the red or blue wire before the bomb explodes.

B000060P79|5.0|Well first of all let me say that this is a really great album and I think that the guys in SP are really talented. I mean, how many of these people writing these reviews can even play an instrument or write lyrics of their own...if they can, well good for them; but if they can't, then they should stop being so hypocritical. Anyway, no matter what all of these haters are saying SP will keep on rocking because of those people who love them that much more. I believe that they are one of the best bands out right now..and they don't let all of the fame go to their heads, whcih is very rare among celebrities. I'll admit that their sound is more punk-pop, but it is a good transition from bubble gum pop to punk rock..for those who are thinking of coverting their tastes to Billy Talent and Death By Stereo. All in all...SP is my fave band now and I hope they are for many years to come.
B000002H97|5.0|Hey, hey, hey... So SAD that this was the beginning of the &quot;commercial&quot; phase from Metallica BUT nevertheless a TRUE metal album. My favorite song is number 11, &quot;My friend of misery&quot;. Quite interesting how a sad (but beatiful) melody along with depressing lyrics can actually bring your spirits up. Maybe it's the yin opposing the yang, maybe it's just a click hidding in the Song, who knows. I still listen to this album in a row, no concessions and no interruptions. It's as homogeneous as it can get but not repetitive. I'd advice anyone to buy it if they don't own it already. A classical, 'ze' classical.
0380713802|2.0|after reading &quot;A Walk In the Woods&quot;,  I was extremely excited to get my paws on  another Bryson book.  I was dissapointed.  &quot;Neither here nor there&quot; has about half the humor, one tenth of the adventure and even less of the overall appeal of &quot;A walk in the woods&quot;.  It is a book that starts off on a promising note, with a description of his quest to see the northern lights in northern norway in the middle of winter; it had me thinking, 'great, here we go, typical Bryson, doing whacky things that come to him on a whim'.  However, as the book progresses it digresses into a mundane journal of the rather ordinary wanderings of a solo traveler.  Part of  the problem is that he makes very little effort to interact with others.   Because of this there is an awful lot of, &quot; I went from the train station, found a hotel, had some dinner, drank a coke, went to bed&quot; kind of &quot;action&quot; that even Brysons astounding propensity for making ordinary situations seem extraordinary cannot save it.  One other major flaw it seems is that Brysons trip had no ultimate goal, no purpose.  It seems to me that most satisfying travel literature begins with the author expressing a desperate need to find or achieve something, then chronicles the pursuit and struggle to meet those ends, cope with failure, and come to some kind of grand catharsis.  My all time favorite, &quot;tales of a female nomad&quot; is the story of a womans need to find something fufilling in her life and in herself after essentially losing the &quot;family woman role&quot; that had come to define her.  Her travels are not planned to a T, but she does travel cognisent of purpose/goal/need, and this makes that book very compelling indeed.  I am not saying that travel literature must have all of those elements, but at least a little dose of purpose would have gone a long way towards making this book compelling.  Do yourself a favor and put the 15 bucks you would spend buying this book in savings toward your own trip to Europe.
B0000931QR|5.0|Un genial cd desde el comienzo hasta el final, tiene temas excelentes.
B00024I31C|5.0|This is without any doubt the best CD by J J Cale.He released a new album after a long time but this is worth the wait.I always had great respect for this man and after listening to this album I must say he's one of the living legends of 21st Century.This album showcases another side of this man.Overall this album is like a Greatest Hits,with different kind of tunes put together and his wonderful ability to mix Blues,country and Folk into Rock surpasses his earlier efforts.The first few songs have the Classic Cale sound.He introduces Synthesizer in some later songs and drumming machine is a new element also in this album.But this CD showcases his awesome singing and songwriting talents.This man is a good singer,poet and guitarist.I must say he has given wonderful messages through the down to earth yet poetic lyrics of the songs in this album.The guitar playing is solid throughout the album,some classic J J Cale bluesy guitar licks(lead) and awesome folksy rhythm guitar(acoustic)in most of the songs.All songs are good and has different sounds.My personal favourites are &quot;Chains of Love&quot;(it has wonderful country rhythm and lead guitar),the haunting ballad &quot;Homeless&quot;(this song will be a favourite of anyone),the awesome bluesy fully acoustic song &quot;Stone River&quot;,The Political meassage giving song &quot;The Problem&quot;(it showcases how thoughful J J cale is about Social Issues)and soulful &quot;Blues for Mama&quot;.The surprising element is the last song.Fortunately I got a copy of the French Edition of this CD and got the Bonus 13th song called &quot;Another Song&quot; which is not present in the American Edition of the CD.This song is J J Cale as a Folk singer,just a Banjo and his warm voice,a wonderful Traditional Kinda Folk song.That song is just awesome.J J cale plays wonderful Banjo.He has played Guitar,Synthesizer and Banjo is this album.And his voice is getting better with age,just too good.And songwriting is top notch with awesome music and guitar playing.Just get it folks,this is the man who's creating the classic vintage 70's sound(maybe with little twist in some songs) in this 21st century.This is a record for lovers of serious music and a purely artistic record made from the core of heart in this age of commercial music.Long live J J Cale,we are proud to have you!
B0000027RL|5.0|This is not a review, it's to counter-act most of the garbage this album is getting. This is not and should not be compared to the other breakthrough act of 1991 Nirvana. While if it wasn't for Nirvana Pearl Jam would never have been popular that doesn't make them bad at all. Just because your a Nirvana fan doesn't mean you have to bash Ten and give it 0 stars.I myself am a hard-core Nirvana fan and own all their albums from Bleach to the Muddy Banks of Wishka and I can still enjoy it. Nirvana's sound was quick and punk rockish and Pearl Jam's was slow and more like 70's hard rock. And as for the 10 year olds who say these guys are trying to copy Puddle of Mudd and Creed, get a clue. This came out in '91! Puddle of Mudd and Creed are just pale imitations of this band and don't deserve recognition. If you like Puddle of Mudd or Creed check out Pearl Jam because it is they who are copying.
B000002J1U|5.0|led zeppelin was their masterpiece in a row after their hugely succesful debut and second albums.this album is great because of the presence od songs like immigrant song and a few folk rock hits.a must for your collection.very highly recommended.
B00008CLOA|5.0|As many musical historians have proved, you don't have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy Pink Floyd's 1973 masterpiece &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;, though it certaily doesn't hurt (or at least seems like it doesn't). The 9 songs on this album are among the best ever made, and prooves that Pink Floyd deserve the respect they get today.<br />I was a little hesitant on getting &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;. I heard a lot of the songs on the album were eerie, and I'm not good when it comes to listening to music of this kind. But I took a chance. I admit that the songs that scare me quite a bit, but I was afraid in a differnt way that I really can't explain. It wasn't that I was as much afraid as I was overwhelmed by its brilliance.<br />&quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;explores just about every genre of early 1970s' music: hard rock (&quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;,), easy listening (&quot;Us And Them&quot;), instrumental (&quot;On The Run&quot;, &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;), and even a combination of the three (the chilling &quot;The Grear Gig In The Sky&quot;). &quot;Brain Damage&quot; is an eerie number written about Sid Barrett, the founding member of the group. One lyric signifies the whole song's story documenting Barrett's fustration and ultimate nervous brekadown concerning the group: <br />&quot;And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes/I'll see you on the dark side of the moon&quot;.<br />The first half of the opener, &quot;Speak To Me&quot;, is a terrifying collection sounds such such as screams and a spooky, heartbeat. The closer &quot;Eclipse&quot; is a review of everything life has to give you (as one reviewr pointed out, this album is meant to be a life cycle), and reprises that heartbeat at the end.<br />This is such a great album. I hope Pink Floyd patches things up and get back with Roger Waters and go on the road again. Too bad he's too stubborn to ever do such a thing. Oh well. Until then, this album is way more than enough to remind us of Pink Floyd's glory years.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first discovered this band on TakingBackSunday.com, the band said that they had a new album coming out and that it was really good. Well, since I am a huge fan of Taking Bak Sunday, I decided to check them out. I looked at reviews and downloaded the song Helena, and I was instantly in love with them. I decided to buy the album, and I have come to the conclusion that it was a purchase that was well worth it. If you are a fan of emo/punk, you will like this band. The album is very catchy, and will appeal to most people. Here is a track by track review.<br />Helena 10/10 Great opener, great energy, a standout.<BR>Give 'Em Hell Kid 9/10 Catchy, pretty short, well tune overall.<BR>To The End 9.25/10 Has twisted lyrics, but is a very upbeat and well played song.<BR>You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison 9.5/10 Great intro, reminds me of Bohemian Rhapsody, this is a very unique song, always good to listen to.<BR>I'm Not Okay(I Promise) 10/10 It bugs me how people seem to be dissapointed with this song, it is so awesome, its one of my favs, so so catchy.<BR>The Ghost of You 10/10 Arguably the best song on  here, its the albums only ballad, its incredible.<BR>The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You 9/10 Somewhat of a stepdown from the first 6, but its still great and catchy, you'll hum it a lot.<BR>Interlude N/A Interludes are usually nothin special, but I must say this is relaxing.<BR>Thank You For the Venom 9/10 One of the catchiest choruse on here, one of the two songs I heard before buying the cd.<BR>Hang 'Em High 8.5/10 Worst song on the album, has a country feel to it. Still catchy, typical MCR.<BR>It's Not A Fashion Statement, Its A Deathwish 9.5/10  The song on the album that really gows on you, good beggining, the real song has the f word in it.<BR>Cemetary Drive 9/10 Has great lyrics, and a good beat. Nothin too special though.<BR>I Never Told You What I Do For A Living 9/10 Ends the album pretty good, could be better but not much to complain about.<br />Incase You Do Not Have The Time To Read the Track By Track Review, look at this:<BR>Top 5<BR>1. The Ghost Of You(I'm A sucker For Ballads)<BR>2. I'm Not Okay(I Promise)(Underrated and dang catchy)<BR>3. Helena(One of the best openers I've ever heard)<BR>4. You Know WHat They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison(Unique tune)<BR>5. Its Not A Fashion Statement, It's A Deathwish(It Grows On You)<br />Anyways, check this album out. Its so catchy and unique that you can not go wrong with spending 12 bucks.
B000093BDX|5.0|Countless Beach Boys hits collections have been thrown around like trash over the years. Most of them are not good. 2003's 30 - song &quot;Sounds Of Summer&quot; is the exception. It features all the big hits plus a few less recgonized tracks.<br />All the Beach Boys classics are here. Whether you enjoy &quot;Surfin' USA&quot;, &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;, &quot;California Girls&quot; or &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, it's unlikely that your favorite Beach Boys song isn't here. But there's more than a few unrecognizable songs hear that make this collection even more worthwhile: the latter - day singles &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, &quot;Darlin'&quot;, &quot;Do It Again&quot;, &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot;, &quot;Good Timin'&quot;, &quot;Come Go With Me&quot; and &quot;Getcha Back&quot; are just as good as anything from their peak period.<br />As usual, there is a fair amount of hits missing, even with 30 songs. There are too many to list here, so I'll just list the ones that reached the Billboard top 40. They are:<br />&quot;Little Saint Nick&quot; (numner 6)<BR>&quot;The Warmth Of The Sun&quot; (number 13)<BR>&quot;The Man With All The Toys&quot; (number 3)<BR>&quot;Caroline No&quot; (number 32)<BR>&quot;It's Ok&quot; (number 29)<br />But overall, this a very worthwhile collection of classic music, perfect for this time of year. Also, get the boxed set &quot;Thirty Years Of Good Vibrations&quot;.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|i didn't know a movie could change your life, 'till i saw donnie darko. this movie is stunning, it grabs you, i highly reccommend it. unbelievable soundtrack too, gary jules, joy division, echo in the bunnymen, 5 stars. see it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|After reaping huge success , both commercial and critical, with &quot;The Beach Boys Today&quot;, leader and producer Brian Wilson set out to make an album even better than that. What he came up with has been called the greatest album of all time. <br />1966's &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was the least successful Beach Boys album up to that time, barely hitting the top 10 (it peaked at 10) and not going gold. So it's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time. Under Wilson's guidance, the group became more experimental, moving out of their signature &quot;surf rock&quot; realm and writing songs that dealed with real - life issues such as maturity (&quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;), love (&quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&quot;, &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;), rejection (&quot;Here Today&quot;, &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;, &quot;Caroline No&quot;), even death (the ethereal &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, with Carl Wilson's angel - like vocal and Brian's stunning production). The only song that seems even remotely like their earlier work is &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. But while this one has to do with the ocean they loved so much, it is more of a distress call than an ode to summer fun. The two instrumentals, &quot;Let's Go Away For Awhile&quot; and the title track are great. The former is carried on by the gentle, slightly mysterious vibraphones and great strings, while the latter is a sidewinding instrumental workout. &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot; is a crackerjack keyboard workout with a fierce chorus and scorching lyrics. The bonus track, another version of the song entitled &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot; is just the same song with just the title line changed.<br />&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; now comes with a beautiful booklet filled with pictures and track information. Brian Wilson provides a wonderful inroduction, and the essay is beautifully written. verall, this is what I conisder the greatest album of all time. For me, to be a great album, the album has to really speak to you, and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; speaks to me because, as I mentioned earlier, it talks about the issues in our lives. If you want an album, look no further than &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.
B00013PHGS|1.0|Ta bueno loco eh!<BR>Mira vos.. franceses, que loco. Pens que solo se dedicaban a los autos. Igual son medios chorros, ya existe Bjork.<BR>Ac en La Plata est fresco, un saludo a todos, especialmente para vos Ricky.<BR>                                                       El Tecla
B00005ABX0|4.0|After achieving artistic triumph with the &quot;Pet Sounds album and the &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; single, Brian Wilson and the rest of The Beach Boys began work on what was to be their masterpiece, &quot;Smile&quot;. But soon, Brian's drug addiction get out of control and he was unable to complete the album. So &quot;Smile&quot; was shelved and became known as the greatest unreleased album of all time.<br />In early 1967, The Beach Boys took some &quot;Smile&quot; cuts, edited out parts and rerecorded them, and put them together on a hastily assembled album entitled &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. The results were mixed at best.<br />&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; kicks off with &quot;Heroes And Villians&quot;. Many people call this the last great Brian Wilson production. While it's a great song, it could've been so much moee. If you don't know what I mean, then listen to the outtakes of this song on the &quot;Thirty Years Of Good Vibrations&quot; boxed set. &quot;Vegetables&quot; comes next. I don't know why they released this version over the eerie &quot;Smile&quot; version (also on the boxed set). &quot;Fall Breaks And Back To Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)&quot; is an odd but cool instrumental. &quot;She's Goin' Bald&quot; is the worst thing yet. Before the song gets to the one - minute mark, you wish it was over. I don't want to devote entire half paragraphs to the songs, so I'll just give brief opinions on them: &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; really doesn't need an explanation, &quot;With Me Tonight&quot; has great harmonies, &quot;Wind Chimes&quot; and &quot;Wonderful&quot; pale in comparison to the &quot;Smile versions (again, they're on the boxed set), &quot;Gettin' Hungry&quot; is a nice rocker, and there isn't snything to really say about &quot;Whistle In&quot;. <br />After the so - so &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, they rebounded with the excellent &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. This album was essentially an R &amp; B album. The excellent hit rockers &quot;Darlin'&quot; (withone of Carl's best vocals) and the title track feature hints of Motown. The chilling &quot;Let The Wind Blow&quot; features soulful vocals by Mike and Brian. &quot;Country Air&quot; features great harmonies and a booming bass line buried under the myserious piano intro. Their cover of the Stevie Wonder hit &quot;I Was Made To Love Her&quot; showcases another excellent Carl Wilson vocal. &quot;A Thing Or Two&quot; is a nice rocker. &quot;Aren't You Glad&quot; features a bouncy intro while the cute &quot;I'd Love Just Once To See Her&quot; features a naughty little lyrical surprise from Brian at the end. &quot;Here Comes The Night&quot; will have you on your feet and &quot;How She Boogalooed It&quot; is a fast - paced number. It's difficult to understand the lyrics but has a great beat. Finally, there's &quot;Mama Says&quot;. This a capella number was supposed to be on &quot;Smile&quot; as part of &quot;Vegetables&quot;. Instead, it's on its own and remains one of the most stunning showcases of the group's harmonies. <br />The bonus tracks are a real treat. The alternate version of &quot;Heroes And Villians&quot; gives new life to the song, especially the &quot;cantina&quot; section at the end. The &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; outtakes (inclduing a completely different alternate version) are amazing. &quot;You're Welcome&quot; is an eerie chant. Then comes the whole reason to buy this album. In 1967, The Beach Boys were to record a live album called &quot;Lei'd In Hawaii&quot;. The project was never to be and remains a highly sought out collector's item. One of the many songs they rehearsed was a Four Freshmen hit called &quot;Their Hearts Were Full Of Spring&quot;. This a capella recording is my favorite Beach Boys recirding ever, Their harmonies are etheral, almost as if angels were singing. &quot;Can't Wait Too Long&quot; is a great collection of outtakes.<br />&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; is very far from one of their best. To think that gis followed &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is kind of hard to believe. Now that &quot;Smile&quot; is supposed to be released in September, we'll finally see what Brian Wilson was trying to accomplish. &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, however, remains an excellent piece of music that will please everybody.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|ITZ is definitely one of the best albums I've ever purchased and that's not an exaggeration.  I heard &quot;Toxic&quot; on the radio and I almost immediately decided to buy the album.  I'm so glad I did because just about every track is great!  There are so many great styles and varietities of music on this album to suit every kind of taste or palate.  Whether or not you're a fan of Britney, I guarantee you'll enjoy this album.
B00006G8HX|4.0|Leonard Nimoy spent most of his time behind the camera directing this film, and though I miss his presence as Spock, it's one of my favorite of the Star Trek series; it's more subdued and introspective than the others, and the overall theme is friendship, and risking one's life for a friend.<br />The year is 8210, and the plot centers around &quot;The Genesis Effect&quot;, an experimental device that can be placed on a &quot;lifeless space body&quot;, like a dead moon, and make it flourish with life, but because one of the scientists used risky methods, &quot;life&quot; is happening at a fast clip.<br />The evil Klingons of course, in their constant lust for power, want the &quot;Genesis&quot; secret, and Admiral Kirk must stop them.<br />William Shatner is fabulous as Kirk; I've always found him to be a unique, immensely watchable actor, and all the original ensemble cast is wonderful: DeForest Kelley ~ McCoy, James Doohan ~ Scotty, George Takei ~ Sulu, Walter Koenig ~ Chekov, Nichele Nichols ~ Uhura. Added are Mark Lenard as Spock's father Sarek, Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik, Merritt Butnick as Kirk's son David, and Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon Kruge. Dame Judith Anderson plays the Vulcan priestess TLar, in a scene that is high camp, and quite marvelous.<br />There are some nifty special effects on the Planet Genesis, and some nice cinematography by Charles Correll, as well as an exceptionally lovely score by James Horner. Leonard Nimoy gave this film a moody, thoughtful atmosphere, and it works for me, and I find the ending quite touching, no matter how many times I see it.<br />Total running time is 105 minutes.
B00011RPB0|5.0|I can't tell you if you'll enjoy this movie, I know I loved it but thats just me.  Lost in Translation, can be meanless blip in your busy schedule, a waste of Twenty bucks for a DVD collecting dust on the bottom shelf of your CD rack, or it can mean something else, something more profound, a kind of special connection you have that can hardly be decribed in words.  And these two different experiences of the same thing, both valid, both honest and true to the person expressing their view is due to how you view the world. The type of person you are is going determine what kind of experience this movie is going to be for you (kind of like life). I'll give you a little crib sheet (Lets assume you are rather intelligent or at least claim to be, since you are considering an arthouse/independent film), if you are very goal oriented, time consciences, a bottom line kind of person who knows the apporpriate behavior in all situations, skip it, this movie offers nothing for you.  I'm sure you have a very successful life, a beautiful house, delightful children and a movie is nothing more than entertainment for two hours of your day, where you can unwind. But for you other 10 percent who are a little odd, never really feel comfortable in your own skin, always feel out of place no matter where you are, and consistantly late to any appointments or dates you've ever made, you might be just the right kind of person who really gets this movie. <BR>     Getting lost doesn't happen to everybody.  Everybody might say they have, or got a taste of it but getting truly and profoundly lost, takes the right circumstance and a special kind of disposition to get there.  And you'll know who they are if you've ever been there, because these people don't wear it like a badge of courage, they don't wear black, they don't become goth, they don't express how dreadful they feel. They hide it the best they can.  And you'll notice it in subtle ways how they try to act normal, try to fit in, and try tofeel like other people.  This is one reason why I think Scarlet Johansson is an amazing actress, she hits this quiet despair on the nose. It takes a special kind of actress to portray a woman acting in real life. This kind of multi-layered complex emotional state is so hard to portray because most people aren't aware enough to detect this in real life let alone make it come alive on the screen. Some people believed Charlotte was merely a character bored out of her mind and I could see why because most of the movie she is blank faced, frowning occasionally, and smiling rarely. But you can see her distress in rare moments like her conversion on the phone back home, her meandering walks, her sleepless nights and most telling, her conversion with Bob on his bed. One of the hardest thing to do in acting, is to make it look like you are not acting and Scarlet Johansson does this exceptionally well. It seems like a contradiction and some people might think &quot;what if the person can't act, won't they look like they are not acting just the same?&quot;  And I disagree because if they couldn't act, we would not believe that that person is feeling the emotions they are portraying, and the only way a person who couldn't act would be believed is if we all witnesses that person going through those emotions in real life as it happens to them, and that won't be acting, that would be real life.  <BR>    Bill Murray, what can I say?  He was playing himself if he was stuck in that situation. Maybe it wasn't a strench for Bill to play himself (ie Bob) but who else could have played Bill Murray better than Bill Murray.  The part was written for him and of course it fit him like a glove.  What couldn't be faked is the magical chemistry between Bob and Charlotte, and for a movie with no plot, that is everything.
B00005JMX6|4.0|I can only assume it was marketing that screwed things up for this film. For one, the title suggested to me when I first heard about it, another one of those teen flicks like \\"she's all that\\". I brushed it aside until one night I managed to view it. I was in awe of this film! Not to mention the music arangement. I loved it.. To me it was like a beautiful rendition of Risky Business and I pushed it on all my friends like a petty dope dealer to see this flick. I checked the theatres and found that after only ONE month from release, it was showing at the dollar theatre?! It's a classic!? I hope someone lost their job because of this. I will definitely buy this DVD and you should too. Nuf said...
B0001NBMBC|3.0|This cd is not like the others. The other cds were heavy and loud. This is light and artistic stuff. Some songs like duality are heavy and good. Others like that vermillion Pt. 2 are light and arent like slipknot. I was at my buddys house and his grandma listens to slipknot. no BS. he was playing this cd and she couldnt tell it was slipknot. (...).we were crackin up. Id stick with Iowa. Corey spent to much time with stone sour. Hes gone light and that sucks
B000000OSG|5.0|yes. use your illusion I and II both rock, estranged and november rain are 2 of my favorite songs (by any band, not just of these 2 cds). though i have both of these and appetite for destruction as well, i think i'm just going to remove the filler myself, though most of the songs are really good. the best off of UYI2 are civil war, 14 years, shotgun blues, pretty tied up, so fine, estranged, and most definitely you could be mine. after you could be mine, just stop playing the cd. you've already hear the better version of dont cry on UYI1 and my world just plain shouldn't be there. at all. and if you're going to order this cd, be sure to get UYI1 as well, mostly for november rain and don't cry. and while you're at it, get appetite for destruction because in my estimation it's one of the greatest albums of all time.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I went into Butterfly Effect with only one expectation: to see Ashton Kutcher in a serious role. After seeing him on &quot;That 70's Show,&quot; &quot;Punk'D&quot; and the deliciously stupid &quot;Dude Where's My Car?&quot; I was ready to see what the serious side of him could bring to the table. What I got with this film is more than I had bargained for. Sure, the previews promised a lot (and delivered on it), but this film is one of the most intense and gripping movies I have seen in a long time. First time directors  J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress do an outstanding job with the material, and although the initial premise is far-fetched, it's forgiven because of how the story sucks you in and makes you feel involved. Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a college student with a dark past, who can't remember key moments in his life because he simply blacked them out. He is told his dad is crazy, and as a child, sees him die. Evan's doctor told him to start writing journals when he was seven years old and when he reads a passage in the present day about a moment that he blacked out, he finds himself in a dream-like state where he is reliving the moment he couldn't remember. After a few experiences, Evan figures he can control these dreams and try to change things and maybe create a better future for him and his three childhood friends: Tommy (William Lee Scott), Lenny (Elden Henson) and most importantly, the girl he has loved since as long as he can remember (Tommy's twin sister) Kayleigh (Amy Smart). However, everytime Evan goes back in time, things in the present get shifted around severely, and most of the time, end up the worst. Evan finds himself going from frathouse to prison to wheelchair and each time he experiments, his window of hope for saving his friends seems to be waning. The most powerful scenes involve Evan's childhood, where we slowly watch how deranged Tommy can get, how disturbed Lenny can get, and how messed up Kayleigh's life can get. All of the actors in this film turn out exceptional performances. Obviously Kutcher does a great job, and is natural as Evan. But props must go to the underrated Amy Smart, who plays so many different characters in this movie and covers so much area. You can tell she put a lot into the role and it translates onto the screen. The movie (well, the theatrical cut) revolves around the love-story between Evan and Kayleigh, and basically serves as Evan's motivation. This movie is a bit disturbing, if you have certain childhood scars that you would rather not bring up, I wouldn't recommend this movie. But the bottom-line is &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is a great movie and exceeds all expectations. The Director's Cut found on this DVD, is basically the original movie, with some cut-scenes pasted here and there (and it's easy to see why some of these were cut) and a completely different ending. Personally, I liked the original ending better. It just seems to end perfectly, exactly the way it should. But The Director's Cut, while being risky and bold, just doesn't seem to fit. But, it's all open for interpretation. The extras are somewhat disappointing. The extra deleted scenes are always nice and the commentary from the directors is rather interesting, but there isn't much else going on.n this film turn out exceptional performances.

B00028HBKM|5.0|The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better ,but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie, you might think it will be boring, so did I ,but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics, then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace, the Power, the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel.
0618526412|2.0|Overrated.  Just god awful, can't stand it. Ok, I know that isn't really helpful, but I have a feeling that this is one of those books that everyone claims to enjoy becuase they don't want to be accused of \\"not getting it.\\"   The characters were really difficult to care about, and the writing was just blah. Truly overrated (like most Oprah books).
B00005JKC3|3.0|Marvel Comics most legendary superhero after Spider-Man. The Incredible Hulk and his alter ego Bruce Banner come raging on the Big Screen. Eric Bana stars as mild mannered scientist Bruce Banner who is accidently hit by gamma rays, which triggers his anger, and he turns into  a guargation green skinned monster and superhero known as The Hulk with unstopable powers. I don't care if people didn't like it, this one was made for Marvel comic fans, Spider-Man 1&amp;2 was made for everybody. I'm a Marvel Comic fan. Oscar winner Jennifer Connoly stars as Betty Ross, the only person who knows that the Hulk isn't dangerous. Sam Elliott stars as Betty's dad General &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross, the man who doing anything to stop the innocent beast and Nick Notle as Bruce's insane dad. See this Action-Packed rip roaring monster slam, it will have you raging and after you see it you know what it's like be the green one,. Raaaaarh!
0743244257|1.0|This is absolutly, by far, the worst book I have ever read.  I purchased it in Germany at a train station where they did not have many english books to choose from.  I should have just stared out the window during the long train ride!  It was awful, depressing and just plain odd.  The protagonist, Eric Packer is not the least bit interesting.  He spends the day driving across Manhatten trying to get his hair cut, he meets various people along the way and has sex with many of them. He is married, but somehow he does not really know he is married.  The odd thing is that he keeps running in to his wife when he decides to get out of his limo to get something to eat.  How can she get across town when he can't?  None of it makes any sense.  <br />Don't bother!
0618526412|5.0|I enjoyed this book. To those who find it too depressing, I would like to say that anything that deserves to be designated as &quot;literature&quot; irritates the reader. I recommend this book to anyone who looks for reading material that is not just entertaining or funny, but for something that enriches their minds.
038533348X|1.0|This is the third book that I have read by Vonnegut. I also read Sirens of Titan and Wampeters, Foma, and Grandfalloons, his Autobio. Look, he's witty, but not deep. He is a cynic. If anything, his writing displays the fragility of human existence, and the fact that not a lot of people know what the point of everything is, including him. You will most likely reach a point, about half way into the book, where vonnegut is absentmindedly continuing the exposition while your saying to yourself, &quot;get to the point already.&quot; The other thing is that he is never uplifting. Nothing revolutionary here.
B0002234LS|4.0|The movie trailers were misleading relative to the action/suspense. The storyline was somewhat predictable. Johnny Depp makes this movie. He is superb.
069452607X|3.0|Read it -  but maybe buy it used<br /><br />This book does however ask some good questions about how to go from being good to GREAT such as:<br /><br />1.  What am I(or what is the company) intrinsically passionate about?<br />2.  What is the company\am I good at?  and does this \\"thing\\" come naturally?<br />3.  Finally does this area that was chosen have \\"GREAT\\" potential?<br /><br />On the other hand, here are some questions that I felt were left unanswered:<br /><br />Can't you be GREAT at two things at the same time?<br /><br />According to Jack Welch's book, you should strive to be #1 OR #2.<br />btw: Aren't there three medals awarded in the Olympics?<br /><br />What about sales?  The Mary Kay Company motto is \\"Nothing happens until somebody sells something.\\" (from her book)<br /><br />What about creating barriers to entry for competitors? (to protect market share like Carnegie or Rockefeller did)<br /><br />Why didn't you include MORE on the failures of the Good to Great companies?  Not just the failures of the competition.  Guys like Edison, Lincoln had many defeats before they found ultimate success.<br />Doesn't bouncing back from failures have something to do with going from Good to Great?<br /><br />The author mentions getting the right people in the right seats on the bus and the wrong people off.  I believe this is an oversimplification.  Age, salary, tenure, unions, hierarchy etc make this a very difficult task to accomplish!!<br /><br />Yes this book took 5 years to write and was supported by 21 staff researchers BUT I am not totally convinced of the results.  (and I liked the first book -  Built to Last)<br />That's why I gave it only 3 stars
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Unbelieveable performance by Kutcher. This movie exceeded my expectations. This must be purchased on dvd for the director's cut and infinifilm features.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|&quot;I'm going to be open-minded,&quot; I told myself at the video store.  &quot;Even though it seems a little quirky, I like quirky.  That's cool.&quot;  This isn't.  Despite its critical acclaim, those of us who are actually looking for a purposeful story in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; will come out emptyhanded.<br />Basically, the film is about two American losers (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) who are in Tokyo and hate it.  They hate the people, they hate the sights, they hate the food, they hate communicating with their spouses--basically, they think their lives are unbelievably stupid.  Then, in a chance meeting at a hotel bar, the two forge a friendship, just because there aren't too many other English-speakers nearby.  They go around the city together, complaining about their pathetic lives and attempting to further dig themselves into depression.  This all makes for a deathly boring film that isn't worth a second glance.  I can honestly say that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has become my least favorite movie of all time.  It is so bad that I can't even remember any of the characters names.<br />So why do I hate it so much?  Besides its ability to put me to sleep, this flick is full of so many dark emotions--sadness, irritation, longing, depression, hate.  Bill Murray doesn't smile once in the movie.  If he and Johansson's childlike character can't stand their lives so much, why don't they do something about it?  They moan and whine and pass judgement on everything in Japan but never try to make themselves happy.  Instead, they should go back to the States, divorce their spouses, and do whatever it is they like to do.  Don't complain about their idiotic lives if they put no effort into changing them.  Instead of inspiring feelings of joy and excitement, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; made me feel gloomy and upset.  Nearly everyone would love the opportunity to travel freely or appear on TV or stay in world-class hotels--I would do anything tovisit Japan--and here are these two ingrates, in Tokyo of their own accord, loathing every minute of it.<br />If you do pick up this movie, don't even bother with the DVD extras.  The deleted scenes were well deleted (actually, they should have deleted the entire movie).  The interview with Murray and writer/director Sofia Coppola is just as lousy.  For as many awards as her original movie received, Coppola seems highly unenthusiastic about it.  In fact, she seems downright P.O.'d that she is doing the interview.  Murray is similarly bored and displays a bit of arrogance.  What for?  The end of the movie is exactly the same as the beginning--no closure, no resolution, no reason for existing.<br />Pass the popcorn--you're better off passing this one by!
B0001KL3SW|3.0|I got the sampler of this album one of the reviews was something like 'she sounds like a 40s jazz singer' ... I like 40s/50s jazz so I was pysched to hear this ... it was a let down.  This is NOT jazz, some songs may have a jazz feel but she is much more soul/R&amp;B than jazz ... her voice sounds a bit like Erykah Badu, not what I expected.  She's not BAD ... just not what I was looking for.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I absolutely loved the first terminator.  I thought the second one was just so so.  I actually was forced to watch this when it was released on DVD and boy am I glad I did.  I think its MUCH better than the second one.  Arnold did a great job and I think the visual effects were great.  Once again it delivered on great action sequences and I thought it followed the story of the first 2 really well!
079284131X|5.0|This DVD is the first of the Child Play series and is by far the best.  Chucky, a sadistic, smart and persuasive doll who has been possessed by the ghost of Charles Lee Ray is the star and is actually a pretty freaky looking doll.  The young boy Chucky needs to hurt/kill in order to obtain his body is played by a wonderful (young at the time) actor Alex Vincent, a very intelligent first move.<BR>There are a few good scares in this first one, unpredictable since it's the first, a good start and a must see for horror fans.  Chucky will sure be a classic of our times.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I was a bit reluctant to watch this movie,but after I sat down at watched it, i have put it in on my list of favorite movies. This movie has everything! It's a thriller, romance, a bit of comedy, mystery, action...it's a movie you dont want to miss! Ashton Kutcher proved that he can do something other than comedy in this thriller, and it makes me want to watch it over and over again. After you watch this movie ask yourself,&quot;if you had the power to change something in your past, would you?&quot;
0783232039|5.0|I like the Child's Play series and though I personally think the first one is the best, this one is good in its own way.  Bride of Chucky has much more humour, a lot killings in more unique ways and an extra doll.  If you like the Child's Play series, you will definitely enjoy this one but if you never liked the series, I doubt you will find anything enjoyable about this one.
B0000262QW|5.0|Upon hearing this album on a recent holiday to Miami I was immediately spellbound. I bought it upon returning home and now play it continually. There is something completely correct about these latin-tinged compositions. I can hear them over and over, which is a real surprise for me. Stanley Clarke, Joe Farrell, Airto Moreira and Flora Purim are all exceptional here. I do not even think that 5 Miles High and their other work at the same time come close. There is a delicacy and subtly of vision here which is pure genius.<br />(...)<br />For me this is as good as it gets.<br />N.B. Do not confuse this album with his later and inferior group (in my opinion) Return To Forever.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's debut CD 'Ten' is one of my all time favourite albums of all time.  It's now a classic 90s album, the perfect addition to anyone's alternative collection.<br />Once / a perfect opener, a great song to show us what Pearl Jam is all about.<BR>Even Flow / I usually don't like singles ... except Pearl Jam singles.<BR>Alive / a sad song, based on Eddie's childhood.<BR>Why Go / an angry song, I love this one.<BR>Black / a slower song, beautiful lyrically and one of the best vocally by Vedder.  The ending is actually haunting: 'I know you'll be a sun in someone else's sky but why, why, why can't it be, why can't it be mine?'<BR>Jeremy / Pearl Jam's widely known song, about violence, based on true events.<BR>Oceans / another slower song, probably their weakest song but still very good.<BR>Porch / the beginning should tell you everything, this song is angry.<BR>Garden / yet another slower one, perfect.  It was one of my favourites at one time, nice repeating lyrics at the beginning and end.<BR>Deep / though I love this song, it's my least favourite on the album, yet it's still musically well done.<BR>Release / the closing song (not including the &quot;secret song&quot;), a very beautifully crafted song with stunning lyrics.<br />In all, this is a very good album, good anytime and it's the perfect CD to start off your Pearl Jam collection.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Read the part of the Gospel starting with the Garden of Gethsemene through the crucifixion (short reading), then see the film.  Gibson has been criticized for the violence but what Christ went through was no walk in the park.  The most amazing thing was that Christ did this for ALL of us.  He didn't care what color, creed, nationality you were/are...the point is He came for us all.  He loved us enough to SUFFER and die for us.  Gibson shows us truly just how much Christ loved us.  Gibson pulls no puches and doesn't sugar coat this film with some generic text such has been done before.  Christ really suffered.  Whatever our sin, it is nailed to the cross so thanks to Him we bear it no more...all we need is to believe and ask forgiveness.  Yes, it is that simple...try it out!  See this film and try it out!!  You will not be let down.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This is one of the only Disney movies almost everybody loves.  The reason?  The storyline!  It's a perfect movie.  Ariel is a mermaid who falls in love with a human and wants to be one, Ursula is the evil octopus that transforms her while King Triton worries madly about his daughter's where-abouts.  Prince Eric is Ariel's love interest, this is a very romantic movie and it will have you almost crying because it's so sweet.<BR>Ariel's friends include flounder, a crab (Sebastian) and a seagul who make up interesting yet funny stories on the where-abouts of Ariel.  In all, this is a beautiful tale and it's a definite MUST OWN.
0451527046|5.0|Who doesn't love the story of Treasure Island? I think it's a great book. Some people say it is not very good because of the &quot;ancient&quot; way it is written. Just goes to show how dumb modern man is. Buy it and maybe get a better vocabulary.

B00004YKUY|5.0|I have never met anyone who owns in excess of 1,000 albums who does not put Journey in their top ten bands. This album is incredible. Take the macho out of the equation and just examine the all round talent on show. Those who knock Journey look to the image of a band first. Seriously, how good are the guitar solos on this album, the structure and variety in the songs, the harmonies, the singing, just everything. Not an album for simpletons so after you get up to at least a 1000 albums, get this and appreciate it. Like all Journey albums, it is a combination of Streisand, Hendrix, Sabbath, Larry Carlton, Steely Dan, The Doobies, Zeppelin, Air Supply, Santana,, Miles Davis, Beatles, Queen, Jethro Tull. As good as any Journey album if not better and probably is my favourite album of all time. Have over 3,000 so this is a big statement. Best live DVD ever as well (have over 100).
B000089J0R|3.0|This album boasts incredible vocals and harmonies, the problem is they are very difficult to hear, the singer is hardly audible over the drums, which are turned up far beyond what they should be in comparison to the other instruments. This doesn't exactly help the CD, since the drums are, I think, the weakest part of this band, the drummer is a bit of a one-trick pony who seems only capable of playing lightning-fast beats, even at parts of the song when it feels like the beat should be slower.  You want to use slow beats often, so when you increase the speed, intensity can increase, but if you stay at maximum intensity through the better part of a song, instead of getting a more intense number, it just starts to get annoying.<BR>Guitar, bass and synth are all incredibly strong, but like the vocals to a lesser extent, can be difficult to hear at times.<BR>I think Dragonforce is a great band with an incredible amount of technical ability.  I think their problem is they often let showcasing that technical ability get in the way of what is pleasing to the ear.
B00005JMYG|5.0|This is possibly the best comedy I've seen since the original Austin Powers. Will Ferrel rocks, Christina Applegate ain't bad on the eyes even though shes in her 30's, and theres cameos by Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and many more. There isn't one part in the movie that will bore you.
B000066C87|5.0|The upperclass friends and relations of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) arrive at his country house for a weekend of shooting, accompanied by maids, footmen, and valets, all of whom will be staying under one roof.  Sir William is a mean-spirited and self-centered old man, married to a much younger, emotionally distant wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), with many family members dependent upon his continuing largesse.  The hilariously waspish Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), who believes she has a lifetime stipend, arrives with young Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald), who is trying valiantly to become a good lady's maid.  Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), a Hollywood star, and Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), a producer of Charlie Chan movies, are the only guests without aristocratic backgrounds and inherited privilege.  The atmosphere of the house, filled with venomous \\"friends\\" and relations, soon becomes even more poisonous.<br /><br />The \\"below stairs\\" lives of the servants are also fully revealed, as they share living quarters, eat meals together, tend to the laundry and cooking, and gossip about their employers.  The butler Jennings (Alan Bates) and the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren) run the household and try to guarantee that no real-world cares will intrude upon the lives of their employers.  Since \\"upstairs\\" and \\"downstairs\\" occasionally meet very privately at night, secrets abound, many of them secrets of long standing.  When Sir William is poisoned and stabbed (\\"Trust Sir William to be murdered twice\\"), nearly everyone has a motive for wanting him dead.<br /><br />For director Robert Altman, the primary focus of the film is on the characters, their way of life, and their values, with the murder mystery secondary.  Set in late November, the end of the year 1932,  the action takes place when this secure aristocratic lifestyle is also nearing its end, something that the arrival of the newly rich Hollywood characters, Novello and Weissman, illustrates.  Dramatic cinematography (by Andrew Dunn) emphasizes the cold and rainy dreariness of the weekend, and suggests parallels with the coldness of the dying aristocracy.<br /><br />Interior shots reveal the contrasts between the elegant and mannered lives of the \\"upstairs\\" characters and the hardworking daily lives of the \\"downstairs\\" characters, who adhere to their own rigid social codes.  Every detail seems true, and as the characters' lives and interrelationships are revealed obliquely in brief snippets of seemingly unrelated conversations, a broad picture of the upstairs and downstairs lifestyles gradually emerges.  Fully developed, many-leveled, wonderfully acted, often funny, and impeccably directed and filmed, this is a film one can watch again and again with delight.

B000068TPN|1.0|It is highly disappointing to watch Mel Gibson giving his high credibility (Patriot; Braveheart) as humanistic actor in this cheap propaganda. There is nothing in the movie but (a) 45 minutes of wasting time before going to Vietnam and (b) 90 minutes of violent extremist Vietnamese wanting to humiliate the west (by liberating their country??) challenged by few American heroes.<br />Opposite to 1800 Vietnamese, there were almost 360 Americans, supported by artillery, helicopters and extensive use of Napalm bombs by jet fighters. What is heroic on this? Why making a movie about it? Are we back to the 50's to celebrate American heroism of WWII?<br />Am glad that I saw the film on cable and did not specifically pay for it; the film is very boring, repeated and vague.
B00002E224|5.0|(...)P>I caught this film on video in 1996, the year after it premiered in the theaters and it's been a favorite ever since, one of those rare movies I never forget. I just saw the sequel (no spoilers, don't worry!) and it is just as sublime as the 1995 film. I hope Linklater continues to cast these two wonderful actors, Delpy and Hawke, every ten years and catch up with Celine and Jesse - characters and actors aging in real time.    Before Sunrise has a simple but brilliant (they often go together I find) premise: have two people meet on a train and drop them off in Vienna where they will have just one day to spend together, talking, talking, talking. And see where that takes them. It wouldn't have worked had it not been for Delpy and Hawke - their performances are flawless. The dialogue seems like they're making it up on the spot and Linklater lets them do their thing. Vienna is a beautiful city and the perfect backdrop for a romantic movie such as this one. I believe Linklater's paternal grandparents were Austrian, so no wonder he picked Vienna.    A must see!!!    And when you've seen it, run out and see the sublime sequel: \\"Before Sunset\\".
B0001Z52RU|3.0|From what I have seen in the previews, and from what I have been told, this is a good movie. I bought it because the box says spanish subtitles are available. My girlfriend doesnt speak english and we watch movies together. Only one problem. I cannot find the subtitle option. Then I tried changing the subtitles as the movie played, but it did not let me do so. If anyone can help, please let me know. Maybe I'm just having a brain fart.
B00005JMEW|2.0|This film is very creative in an almost plagiaristic sort of way, coming across like a blend of Jackie Chan and spaghetti western. At the same time, it is a long string of hyper violence, fountains of blood, profanity and crude sexual references. It reminded me of an gratuitously violent video game made into a movie. It closes without ending, setting the viewer up for a sequal. I find very little here to recommend.
B00023B1LC|2.0|There is absolutely nothing and I mean nothing explosive about the extended edition.  It has a slightly different begining and a modified ending.  But it is boooooring.  Don't waste your money.  The theatrical release version is a better bet.
078681859X|5.0|I'm a science fiction/fantasy fan and read books like shannara, harry potter, lord of the rings, bartimeaus, and eragon.  This book was highly original in the power of magicians.  It's not just like using magic to do everything and being in secret from non-magic people.  the structure of it is cool because of the way it has two main charaxters and switches views.  Since magicians don't actually use magic, (they summon demons and the stronger the demon, the harder he is to control so you need to be a strong magician to control strong demons) Bartimeaus is actually the one with all the power, not Nathaniel (the magician).  I loved the ending of the book because of the strategic plans the main characters come up with.  BOTTOM LINE-------- if you're a fantasy fan, READ THIS SERIES.
B000268QB2|5.0|While the stripped down approach (voice, piano, bass, drums) may not capture everyone's taste, this is a superb CD.  The production is first rate.<br />The eleven tracks really lack any filler stuff.  My favorite is definitely &quot;This is the Last Time&quot;. I really enjoy the slower tracks, &quot;She has No Time&quot; and &quot;We Might As Well Be Strangers&quot;.  Of course, &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Changing&quot;  and &quot;Can't Stop Now&quot; are top notch.<br />I have to admit I was a little skeptical of the Keane mystique when I read about them in Q magazine, but I'm really glad I bought this CD. I find myself listening to it all the time.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|I found this film to be disturbing, haunting and quite confusing.<br />Clint Eastwood did a great job directing this film, allowing the actors to take on the character's personas with stunning ability. He also kept extremely close to life as it exists in the Boston suburbs, nothing fancy or colorful, just an average working class living. The actors were cast in nearly perfect roles for their vulnerabilities. Eastwood allowed the story to evolve without pushing but I wish he would have included more explanation and a more thorough ending.<br />Sean Penn is PERFECT in his role and I can see why he received an Oscar. He is open and raw with his feelings, in fact so much so that your heart is almost wrenched from your own chest as a few of his scenes are played out. Tim Robbins edged upon scary as his character dealt with the consequences of his childhood. Kevin Bacon seemed a little too reserved and I kept expecting him to open up and really act at some but sadly he never did. The wives are all a little too sappy for my taste and seemed to agree with whatever their crazy husbands decided to do so I was disapointed by their characters. <br />This film is good and mysterious but sort of leaves one hanging at the end with many strings seemingly unconnected that should have been. Sean Penn's performance is well worth the watch however. At least I was eventually able to figure out where the title &quot;Mystic River&quot; came from, but as for the rest of my questions I will search for them in the novel.
B000002INR|5.0|This is one of the few ultimate head bangin' cds that i listenin' to on a day to day basis. Great Vocals, great guitars, just an all around great cd. a must have for any 80's rock fan.
B00004VVND|4.0|Welcome to Delos, an adult amusement park where, for a mere $1000 per day, guests can experience the excitement of life in America's Old West, Medieval Europe, or Ancient Rome.  Lifelike costumed androids populate the park and interact with guests, and said machines are programmed to fulfill all human desires, be those yearnings romantic, heroic, violent, or whatever.  But the robots have also been programmed with a fail-safe that prevents them from harming the guests in any way.  Think of Delos as a high-tech Disneyland for wealthy grown-ups.<br />Businessmen Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) and John Blane (James Brolin) are looking for a few days of excitement and relaxation, and the Old West section of Delos, designated WestWorld, seems like just the ticket.  But it turns out there's an unexplained glitch in the main computer that controls the park's network of androids, and unfortunately for Martin and Blane, the error just happens to manifest itself while the two are visiting the park.  The robots are suddenly able to exercise free will--which includes the ability to override the directive that prevents them from harming guests--and it's not long before Martin and Blane find themselves pursued by a ruthless android gunslinger (Yul Brynner).<br />This minor opus from Michael Crichton marks his first directorial effort and is also the first theatrical flick based on an original Crichton screenplay rather than an adaptation of one of his novels.  While the special FX in 1973's WESTWORLD are decidedly cheesy and low-tech by contemporary standards, this sci-fi thriller still stands up today due to the tight, well-paced script and the solid performances from principals Benjamin, Brolin, and especially Brynner (here playing a robotic version of his character from 1960's THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN).  WESTWORLD is a bit too earnest to have yet become a CULT classic--a status it is likely to achieve as technology continues to grow leaps and bounds beyond that which the film depicts--but it continues to be held in high regard by the majority of SF fans.<br />Though Crichton was connected (as a writer) with a few films and TV shows prior to WESTWORLD, it is really this film that brought him widespread notice and launched his high-profile Hollywood career.  WESTWORLD did well enough at the box office, in fact, that it even spawned a sequel--a lesser film entitled FUTUREWORLD (1976).<br />Warner's edition of WESTWORLD on DVD is a no-frills disc that offers the film in both anamorphic widescreen and pan-and-scan, with the only bonus being the original theatrical trailer.  The digital transfer is pretty good, but there was obviously no effort to clean up the dust and other filmic artifacts that are visible from time to time.  Digital artifacts, if any, are minor, though there is some occasional color drift.  (To be fair, color drift could be on the source rather than a result of the digitization.)  All in all, it's an acceptable DVD of a film that most longtime SF fans will want to have in their collections.<br />(Rating breakdown: Film gets 5 stars; DVD gets 3.

6305291446|4.0|I've always enjoyed the Halloween movies, but in the past there have been mistakes. However, H20 tries to fix that, by offering a good dose of horror. The beginning is somewhat weak, and seems like the director added it in to up the body count, but still you have to start somewhere. After the first two murders occur[ one being very gruesome, in which a character gets an ice skate shoved through his face]. The cops flock to the murder scene, and discover that Dr. Sam Loomis's nurse has been murdered, and that the file on Laurie Strode has been stolen. We then go to a prep school in California, where it is one day before Halloween, and Miss Strode is having quite a hard time recovering over what happened 20 years ago. She is the headmistress of a private school, and we meet her son Josh. Josh is very annoyed by her mother's overprotectivness. It doesn't help that it is one day before Halloween. Josh wants to go on a camping trip, but can't seem to persuade his mother to let him go. So, him and his friends decide to arrange a gettogether at the prep school after everyone else leaves, but Josh's mom decides to let him go to the camping trip, so he takes the slip but doesn't leave. Laurie then discovers that Halloween night that her sons camping items are still in the house and comes to the realization that Josh is in trouble, and her brother is coming back to get him. It is at this point that what we have all been waiting for happens. Michael shows up at the school. In this movie, Laurie finally conquers her fears and faces her maniac brother. Good acting, good writing, and all in all a good movie. I had to give it 4 stars because the middle is a little slow in some parts, and the movie entirely ignores 4, 5, and Curse, but some people may enjoy that.  Rated R: violence, gore, sexual content  Body Count: 8  Best Death: dumbwaiter crush, or ice skate in face
B00005R62K|5.0|This is not only Judas Priests best album , imo its the greatest heavy metal album of all time . Don't confuse this with the candy coated crap from the 80s ie: Screaming.., Defenders... and dare i mention Turbo. This is the good stuff , back when JP was a cutting edge band. No fillers here either. Check out Heroes End, Beyond The Realms , Invader , Savage, Exiter... all metal at its very best
B00005JLWN|5.0|Of course it's not the Matrix.  Equilibrium actually begins and ends with an excellent storyline and tight plot!<br />I wonder why I've never picked this DVD up before - it honestly boasts of some of the best, if not the best, choreography and fastest action sequences I've ever seen!  Few movies can live up to this kind of lightning-quick action.  Yes, if you loved the Matrix, you will DEFINITELY love this one.  However, this is actually a 1000 times more satisfying than the Matrix, considering Reloaded.  Wish I discovered this earlier!  You won't regret this.

0060090383|5.0|I too could not put this book down. I have read all of Marian Keyes' books and this by far is may favorite. I found it interesting to go from Rachel's absolute denial of her substance problem to her later acceptance and recovery. I work with at risk families and I have recommended it to some of my clients who are going through similiar experiences as Rachel was. I think that this should be a must read for anyone involved in a recovery program.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Classic Nicholson! Great flick. Even my husband loved it.
B000002OHX|5.0|Wishbone Ash were one of THE top guitar bands in the Europe of the 1970s, although they were and remain barely known in the US. They even became tax exiles and lived in the States at the end of the 70s. This album is one of the very best live albums from the 70s, if not ever, for classic two-guitar rock. This live album reflects the best tracks from their first set of albums with their original lineup complete with Andy Powell on his trademark Gibson Flying V, and Ted Turner with his Stratocaster or Les Paul. People struggle to pigeonhole this band - usually falling back on the &quot;The English Allman Brothers&quot; or similar. Unlike most guitar rock bands in the 70s Wishbone Ash are actually closer to progressive rock than either the blues based Led Zeppelin approach, or the heavy metal Deep Purple or UFO style or the blues-jazz of the Allmans. But they are more straightforward than say Gentle Giant or Jethro Tull. They represent I think a more mystical approach with the emphasis on melodic intertwining guitar leads and certainly, in their early days at least, long instrumentals. Not too loud, not too many guitar histrionics, but plenty of long, beautifully played, guitar lines and leads often with pseudo-mystical lyrics. A sort of less flashy Kansas. Anyway any person who appreciates guitar based bands and classic rock should listen to this album. The first three tracks in particular are absolute Wishbone classics, my favorite part is the stunning and haunting Ted Turner solo on &quot;Lay Down the Sword&quot;. Just wonderful clean melodic and powerful lines that will be guaranteed to impress anyone.<br />&quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;the Pilgrim&quot; are both long, largely instrumental, tracks full of verve and interest, but not really jams like the Allmans do, nor are they blues based to any significant degree - just great and interesting instrumentals. &quot;Lady Whiskey&quot;, and &quot;Jailbait&quot; were crowd favorites and are more typical bluesy rockers- to really enjoy these you have to have been there I think. &quot;Ballad of the Beacon&quot; is an English folk song with a great melody. Their one real bluesy number, the Everly Brothers' &quot;Baby what you want me to do&quot; is an interesting exercise in slide guitar playing and very good it is, even if it is anything but American blues. <br />I must also mention the outstanding rhythm section, particularly Martin Turner who holds it all together with his very melodic bass lines, lyrics, and singing. I recommend this album highly, especially as most Americans have never heard of this wonderful guitar band. This is the best introduction to their classic first period.
0156027321|5.0|This book truly lives up to the hype! It provokes deep thought about issues truly essential to humans of all religions and paths of life. The beginning is thick and should be read to absorb, but allow yourself to get through it and reevaluate it after completing. Truly a book about faith, God and love. AWESOME
B00003CXCT|5.0|The way I think it is is that George Lucas felt during the 90s that he needed to do something.  Since most movies had been relying on special effects to tell their story In think George thought it would be neat to see his classic films updated with special effects.  That's where it should of stopped.  Just adding in visuals to help tell the story.  There should have been no plot changes.  The Solo/Greedo scene should of stayed the same.  IFf George would have done this scene in the original film I would have no problem with it.  But he went and let Greedo shoot first(whose shot was worse than a stormtrooper!)because he thought it wouldn't look like a cold blooded kill.  That minor change made the whole Star Wars trilogy change.  C'mon George!  If this stuff about Hayden making a CGI appearance in ROTJ DVD is true why don't you just have Luke accidently die in the Sarllac pit and have Artto and Threepio fight Darth Vader!  I think George should stop updating and let the films update themselves.  These sre movies everyone loves.  If you go and change them all the time people will eventually loose track.  Some one will ask you if you watched Star Wars and you'll say what edition.  Oh just SW SP IIV.  He'll say \\"Oh, the one where Halle Berry is CGI inserted sas princess Leia.  George, these movies colud end wars someday.  Don't take that away.  I saw that they are making new junior novels of the OT for the DVD  release and they won't even be worthty of star wars  Keep it up with the Prequals and don't make any changes 70 years later!
B00005JMKI|4.0|I don't want to repeat what a lot of the reviews have said.  Yes, Von Trier has done an excellent job, the set was a brilliant choice to film on, and the acting is all excellent.  I just wanted to point out a few flaws I felt the film had.<br />First, it did not have to be 180 minutes long.  I understand the long time Von Trier took to introduce us to the town of Dogville, because it made everything that followed in the story more powerful because of the understanding we had for the village and it's characters.  However, Von Trier proved his point again, and again, and again.  I felt between the two and a half hour point and three hour point that a lot could have been cut.  The story lost its fury and steam through that half hour.  It felt like rambling, and it could have been condensed in the screenplay to still showcase everything the filmaker wanted to.<br />Next, one of the reviewers said that critics \\"pounced\\" on this film for being anti American and gave it bad reviews.  They didn't.  Most reivews of Dogville are positive, and those that aren't clearly state problems with the film, and not the anti Americanism in it.<br />Finally, I felt like Von Trier took all this time, three hours to be exact, to construct this pretty darn good cry out against humanity, and not America, and then after the powerful ending the credits just let me down.  I felt like Von Trier took all that time creating this masterpiece, only to side swipe it with a cheap jab at America.  Those who say it's not anti American need to review it again.  The end credits play over homeless people to the tune of David Bowie's I'm Afraid of AMERICANS.  HELLO, thats a big clue people!  The film itself is not anit American I believe, but the end credits really let you know what Von Trier thinks.  The end creidts also felt like they had no relation to the film.  After watching the bare bones scenery, set to classical music, the glam rock Bowie tune did not fit at all.  It was cheap, sloppy, and unfortunate that it degraded such a fine piece of cinema.  Bad choice Von Trier.  It quickly numbed the sting I felt after the actual film ended, instead of letting it stay.  <br />Overall, see this film if you are curious about it.  It is a mini masterpiece from Von Trier, but a flawed one at that.
0780626966|5.0|Each DVD in this set has special features and the like.  All movies have similair menu formats meaning that they were designed for the set, which makes it consistant and enjoyable.  There is even an extra DVD full of special features inclucing, interviews with freddy, music videos, cast and crew, and even Clive Barker himself.  There is this cool way to find all sorts of hidden facts and videos in an interactive way.  You control you way through a dark maze and solve riddles and unlock doors.  Really great set!
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|If you liked the movie, you will enjoy this soundtrack.  It has some very good and memorable cues from the film, especially Track 14, &quot;Glasgow Love Theme&quot;.  Always reminds me of the scene in the movie itself... and I would have to recommend this piece the most out of any track.  Billy Mack's &quot;Christmas Is All Around&quot; also will make you re-live the Christmas Eve moment.  I highly recommend this soundtrack, and especially Track 14!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie is not only the best film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, it's also a wonderful film in its own right.  What did I love about it?<br />1) It isn't stuffy and unnatural.  The characters sound human when they speak; you can imagine that this is how people spoke in the 19th century - not like pompous orators, but like real people.  The world surrounding the characters isn't overly polished or brightly lit; again, there's a natural, &quot;lived-in&quot; feeling to all the buildings and landscapes; they do not look like they came out of a glossy postcard.<br />2) The performances.  I don't have enough praise for Amanda Root, who plays Anne Elliot, a woman whose marriage prospects are slim to nil, and who has just been thrown into the company of a man whom she rejected years ago.  Root can speak volumes just with her eyes, and everything about her fits perfectly with the gentle, wry and intelligent Anne Elliot.  As Captain Wentworth, Ciaran Hinds is also great; he disappears into the character.  Both actors aren't conventionally beautiful or handsome either; Root in particular blossoms before the viewers eyes - at first she's very faded and quiet, and then we (like Wentworth) see her spirit shine out.  In addition to Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, the rest of the cast also do a wonderful job.  Perhaps because there aren't any big name actors, we can get totally immersed in the film.<br />3) It's true to Austen.  There's subtle humor, real human feeling, and a keen understanding of human nature.  It's an unforgettable love story.<br />4) The kiss.  One kiss - perfectly timed, perfectly executed...  you will melt.<br />5) The soundtrack.  This holds true particularly for the assembly at Bath, and the Italian vocal pieces.
B000001FTD|4.0|Now this is some good thrash! Not like modern-day bands who CALL themselves thrash, this is true thrash, from the time when metal was cool. Just everthing about this album rocks hard. They add elements of hardcore punk and humor in their music, which makes it quite enjoyable. And of course, no metal album would be complete without a track about the plight of the American Indian. On 'Among The Living' Anthrax titles their song 'Indians'. The only thing I don't like about this album is the sound quality. It sounds pretty tacky. But sound quality can't really take anything away from such a good album. Buy it.
B000002IJO|5.0|When this Cd was released in 1986, the hair metal movement was beginning to hit its stride. And one of the best and sleaziest hair metal bands was the ever-popular Ratt. This is one of their best efforts. Just everything about it smokes. From Stephen Pearcy's sleazy vocal style to those catchy choruses, this is a great CD. It is also very underrated (Why are all the good CD's underrated?), always cast in the shadow of 'Out Of The Cellar' and 'Invasion Of Your Privacy', which are both strong albums, but not so much better than this. Get this for one of the most essential pop-metal CD's ever.
B000001EHS|4.0|Although this is a very good starter CD for one of the bands that put metal in the mainstream in the 1980's, it's missing a little bit. It could have included at least one song from their debut, and at least two more from High n Dry. But the songs they did put on here are really good, and are their best. Let's Get Rocked is sort of reminiscent of an account I had involving a friend who listened to classical music. In short, this is a good collection for a great band, but it could have been better.
B000009FHN|5.0|Here's the deal: DEAD SOULS is amazing.  But so is everything else on THE CROW SOUNDTRACK.  AND you get to hear edgy stuff from bands you most likely wouldn't hear otherwise.  A great way to be introduced to Machines Of Loving Grace (then go pick up &quot;Concentration&quot;) and For Love Not Lisa.  DOWNWARD SPIRAL is a brilliant album.  Buy the original format and shell out the extra for THE CROW.  While you're at it, check out the Trent-produced NATURAL BORN KILLERS soundtrack.  &quot;Burn&quot; is a must for any fan.
0517548232|5.0|Having poor public schooling on economics, I decided to pick this book up. This is the perfect starter book for anyone wanting to learn about economics. Relatively short book, just goes through major topics each chapter. Short and to the point. <br />After this book, I would recommend &quot;Naked Economics&quot; by Charles Wheelan. I started off reading Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell, and in comparison, this is a much easier read. I think I might have started backwards. =).<br />A must read for beginners.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I only buy so many CDs a year. Mp3s combined with the fact<br />that CDs are so overpriced leads to this.<br />Anyway College Dropout is one of the rare albums that is<br />very well produced. For a Rap album this is the best one<br />I've bought in a long, long time.<br />The really annoying things are the skits but that happens<br />on a lot of albums in particular Rap ones.<br />The music is catchy, well produced and he has some<br />great beats working for him. He is at times funny,<br />sexy, poetic and semi-gangsta. He really knows his<br />stuff and his lyrics are a complex weave of his<br />music. Unlike P.diddy he not only can produce he<br />can also perform very well. Is it any doubt that<br />he is featured on so many songs this year?<br />Fav tracks:<br />7. Jesus Walks (An excellent song, that really hits hard)<br />10. Workout Plan (which is not only funny but also has<br />an awesome beat)<br />13. Breathe in Breathe Out Which my fianc&eacute; loves. Ludacris<br />doesn't sound like himself. He almost sounds like DMX on<br />this song!<br />4. All falls down. Nicely produced. A catchy beat that doesn't<br />get repetitive.<br />All in all an excellent album!
B0000DG00B|4.0|After 30+ years the ABB's performance at Atlanta Pop has finally seen the light of day.  Recorded 9 months before the legendary Live At the Fillmore East,this set shows a band that is just finding it's collective voice.  Brother Duane Allman's incendiary slide playing drives the band on tunes like Statesboro Blues and Please Don't Keep Me Wondering and the extended Mountain Jam is a joy.<br />Yet it's clear that at this point in their career the band is still feeling its way, just finding what really works and how to extend the improvisation over long periods of time without becoming noodlers.  This set is a must for Allman Brothers fans
B00000JZI9|1.0|Ididn't like this movie.Ithink it sucked.It hade no comedy and it was boring.I think  westrn movie's for old people.silverado was a very boring movie.The actors were ugly and there clothes are ugly &amp; dont match,the music sucks it made the movie worse then it was then it is.It wasn't my type of movie.i've seen western movies before i never llike them.I dont recomended to nobody.
B00005JMUA|5.0|First of all this is a far superior film to the first, and anyone who disagrees is not a fan of good cinema, but a fan of violence. Im tired of people writting that there is too much dialogue. That is what Quentin does and that is his speciality. He doesnt need action to make a movie exciting. In conclusion Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a great action picture, and Vol.2 is just a plain great picture and anyone who thinks otherwise needs to get off the Vin Dessil bus and open your eyes.
B00008RH3L|5.0|&quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; is a direct linear descendent of &quot;Blood Simple&quot; which was extracted from a line in a Dashiell Hammett novel. In turn, I think &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; is a homage to one of the best writers of the 20th century.  Everyone praises the crisp, cynical dialog of &quot;Millers Crossing&quot; and the complex plot that still holds together.  This is characteristic of a Hammett novel.  While everyone is familiar with Hammett's &quot;Maltese Falcon,&quot; &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; is more of a blend of the character's and story line found in his &quot;The Glass Key&quot; and the gang war is similar to one in his &quot;Red Harvest&quot;.  If I am right, the Coens couldn't have a better teacher.
B00000JZI9|4.0|I don't really watch westerns but when i do there almost always good. The kind of movies i like to watch are action and comedy. &quot;Silverado&quot; doesn't really have comedy but it sure has alot of action.The moviewas great but the part i least liked was the ending of the movie. My favorite parts of the movie was the shootouts and when they fought. I think what made the movie &quot;Silverado&quot; uniqe was having to African American characters in the movie. The sound track of the movie went with what was happening. The movie had many good quotes but my faorite was &quot;This use to be a peaceful town.&quot;. Before i saw the movie i knew it would be good because most westerns are and i was right.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|The Butterfly Effect is a stunning thriller about a young man(Ashton Kutcher) who discovers he has the psychic power to literally relive his childhood traumatic memories.  Obsessed with getting things right between him and his girlfriend in the present, Kutcher just keeps making things worse, to the growing horror and fascination of the viewer.<br />Kutcher's dark and powerful performance is a far cry from his That 70's Show.  One look into his dark, haunted eyes tells you that you will see this young man again on the big screen.<br />The Butterfly Effect is most profound in the implications it has for our own lives, and the lives of those you love.  This movie has one of the most powerful and moving endings ever.
0783225849|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to review this film. Perhaps I've been extremely busy, but this creepy and memorable piece of cinema came into my mind a few days ago, and I haven't seen it in YEARS! Unsurprisingly though, I remember everything about it, as if I saw it yesterday. That's one of the many impacts PSYCHO has, no matter how many times it's viewed. (Just for the record, mine is three so far, which includes a USC screening with Hitchcock's own daughter and granddaughter providing a Q&amp;A afterward.)<br />The master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock has outdone himself with this brilliant masterpiece. It's a taut, suspenseful little tale that paved the way for other thrillers and provided many firsts in cinema-<br />1) It was the first slasher film, EVER! Without PSYCHO, there would be no BLACK CHRISTMAS, no HALLOWEEN, no FRIDAY THE 13th, no SCREAM, etc. That's right folks, PSYCHO is the granddaddy of the slasher pic.<br />2) It was the first movie to show a woman (Janet Leigh) in just a bra and slip, an aspect used very cleverly by Hitchcock. In the opening scene, Marion Crane is wearing a white bra because Alfred Hitchcock wanted to show her as being &quot;angelic&quot;. After she has taken the money, the following scene has her in a black bra because now she has done something wrong and evil. Similarly, before she steals the money, she has a white purse; after she's stolen the money, she carries a black one.<br />3) It was the first movie to show a flushing toilet on camera. This is a must know for any film buff. <br />Yup, PSYCHO did all those first. Learn it, live it, love it.<br />Anyway....Alfred Hitchcock anonymously bought the rights to Robert Bloch's great novel, for just $9,000. He then bought up as many copies of the novel as he could to keep the ending a secret. That's one of many things that made him so great. Hitchcock did take liberties when having the novel (which was more graphic) adapted, but they all work well. In Bloch's novel, NormanBates is short, fat, older, and very dislikable. It was Hitchcock who decided to have him be young, handsome, and sympathetic. Norman is also more of a main character in the novel. The story opens with him and Mother fighting rather than following Marion from the start. I think that's one of the many reasons PSYCHO works so well. It also shocked audiences when Janet Leigh, who was advertized as the star, bit the dust a mere 50 minutes into the film. (SCREAM used this tactic by offing Drew Barrymore less than 15 minutes into the picture.)<br />The picture is filmed in black and white because Alfred Hitchcock believed the movie would be too gory for color. That adds to the creepiness and makes the film more effective, as the horrible colored remake proved. <br />A brilliant and much duplicated score by Hermann Bernard adds to the atmosphere and builds the suspense. Hitchcock originally envisioned the shower sequence as completely silent, but Bernard Herrmann went ahead and scored it anyway and Hitch immediately changed his mind. I couldn't imagine the movie any other way.<br />However, what makes PSYCHO truly immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten, is that it connects directly with our innermost fears: Our fears that we might impulsively commit a crime, our fears of the police, our fears of becoming the victim of a madman, and of course our fears of disappointing our mothers.<br />Speaking of mothers, you wouldn't want to disappoint Norma Bates would you? I thought not, so see the film, before you make mother really angry....
0061015725|1.0|Do not lose your time in reading this terrible novel.
B00005RFVL|2.0|Robbie didn't do a bad job.  The vocals aren't bad.  But why buy this CD when you can buy the originals.  The originals are much better.  Robbie Williams isn't a bad singer but he isn't a Frank Sinatra.  Don't buy it, buy Frank's album instead as there is no comparison.

B000000W5P|5.0|This is one of those albums that I can't help but like.  I am by no means a die-hard Stones fan, though I do enjoy their music from time to time.  With the exception of &quot;Shattered&quot;, which I have always found to be annoying, the rest of the songs are great.  The title track is one of my all-time favorite songs and other stand out tracks include &quot;When the Whip Comes Down&quot;, the mega-hit &quot;Beast of Burden&quot; and, of course &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot;, which is a great country songs that breaks all of the rules.  Even Keith's vocal contribution, &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot; isn't half bad...for Keith.

B0000C8AVM|5.0|Few artists can match the impact that Dylan has had on the music industry and Blood On The Tracks is simply on of the best albums ever made.  No one before or since has been able to match the passion and the brilliance that Dylan demonstrates on this record.  &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; is one of the best written songs of all time and &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot; still manages to stop me in my tracks whenever I hear it...possibly my favorite of all Dylan's songs.  This record should be a cornerstone in every music lover's collection and is the perfect place to start for those who are new to Dylan.  Quite simply the perfect album.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana is so good live! <br />[...] has more live clips...
B000002L99|5.0|This is my all time favorite VH album, in no small part because it's the first one I heard from start to finish, just discovering rock and roll in '86. Yes, I must agree the synth drums perhaps give it a slight &quot;dated&quot; feel, but it still sounds cool as hell when played at proper hellacious volume. I dare any of you to NOT get pumped when you hear &quot;Get Up&quot; or Best of Both Worlds&quot;. &quot;Dreams&quot; contains one of Eddie's best solos ever, and Sammy sings it like his life depends on it.<br />So, we got the Roth-era remasters, now how about 5150 and ou812??? These two albums are SCREAMING for a remastering.

0446677450|5.0|Have you ever wondered what makes the rich stand out from the rest of the flock? Is it luck? Pull? The government? No! The rich become rich because they have a better strategy.<br />In this great book by Robert Kiyosaki he explains the difference in thinking between his Rich Dad (his friends father who had a different approach to life than most) and his Poor Dad (his real dad who followed convential &quot;wisdom&quot;)<br />The fact that this book is still a top 20 best seller after all these years should tell you something about it.<br />You will learn things vastly different from what you have heard before, before you attack it ask yourself this question: how are you doing financially? If you are not doing as well as you would like, what makes you think that doing more of the same things that don't work will work now? Fact is, doing of more of what doesn't work won't make it work any better.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is now in school libraries. I really think that  Mr. Kiyosaki should design a course and have this taught inthe school system.  Think about how much better we would all be.<br />Great book but only for achievers.
B00018TI5E|1.0|The trouble is with artists like John Frusciante is that they have a very loyal, cult following. Fans who will support them no matter what. I think this is what is going on here judging by the ridiculously generous reviews........ I also consider myself to be a big Frusciante fan but I also like to remain objective about the way I view his output.<br />I haven't been this dissapointed with an album for a long time. It contains mediocre, boring songs that drag on and on and on and on.........<br />I think John has got lost somewhere along the way in his quest for artistic fulfillment and experimentation; resulting in an album which seems to be unremarkable, formulaic, banal and lacking the usual edge that is expected of his work.<br />Worse than Coldplay.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Inspite of all the complaints about the track selection, this CD still ROCKS!!!!! But if Interscope/Geffen really wants to put out &quot;new&quot; GN'R product, they should offer up remastered and upgraded copies of APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION (1987), GN'R LIES (1988), USE YOU ILLUSION I &amp; II (1991) and THE SPAGHETTI INCIDENT (1993)...and hopefully they will in the near future!!!
0385510438|2.0|Nice book but not up to his previous work. Didn't bother to finish his work. Must have been in a hurry, under pressure from publisher. Would not recommend.
B00018D44U|3.0|Maybe this is an incorrect assessment, but I think that the major problem that people have with Norah is that people buy into her hype, and expect to buy an album full of flawless, hardcore jazz.<BR> Norah Jones is not a jazz artist. She's clearly trying to distance herself from the &quot;otherworldly chanteuse&quot; label so many stuck on her after &quot;Come Away with Me,&quot; which certainly had a light jazz flavor but did not in any way resemble a straight jazz album. <BR> Norah is a &quot;saloon pop&quot; (someone used that phrase, and it's perfect) artist, plain and simple. She likes to flavor her work with light shades of other genres--on &quot;CAWM,&quot; it was jazz, with hints of country...and she lets her cowgirl side shine through on &quot;Feels Like Home,&quot; which, I would assume, is intended to showcase the kind of music that she loves and probably would have heard a lot when she grew up in Texas. (I'm not saying that everyone in Texas is a country fan, but it's certainly a serious presence on the airwaves.)<BR> I am not a country fan, and so I was a little disappointed to see how heavily she leaned on those influences. I felt the change was a little more dramatic than most reviewers did, but it's not a TOTAL departure. If you liked &quot;CAWM,&quot; give this CD a shot...even if the style is different, Norah's voice still takes center stage, and I like her voice. She sounds more confident this go-round, and &quot;sings out&quot; a little more. (I'm not always convinced that there's enough emotion behind the words, but this album has a much wider spectrum of emotion than the last one, so that's an improvement.)<BR> Personal highlights are &quot;In The Morning&quot; (very much in the &quot;CAWM&quot; vein), &quot;Humble Me&quot; (probably the most emotional song on the record, and the only one that I've found in which Norah really moves beyond the role of &quot;lovestruck/lovesick girlfriend&quot;), and my favorite, &quot;The Long Way Home.&quot; Iadmire Norah's bravery with &quot;Don't Miss You At All,&quot; even though I must admit the lyrics aren't up to level. It's like two-star writing with five-star music...but I guess just about everyone would sound like way when singing along to Ellington. (This is probably the one song where her piano skills are REALLY showcased.)<BR> Lowlights were &quot;Sunrise&quot; (the music was great, but the lyrics just...don't impress me), &quot;Carnival Town&quot; (it just struck me as a juvenile song trying to masquerade as deep metaphor), &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; (which just didn't make much sense, perhaps because I'm just too cynical), and &quot;Creepin' In.&quot; I thought Dolly did a nice job on subpar material, but Norah's just got to start putting a little energy into her performance.<BR> Overall, this is a solidly O.K. album, with too few standout tracks to make it a great one. I think if Norah (or whoever is making her career decisions) loosens up on her determination to stay very rootsy, and embraces her identity as a sweet, truly wholesome pop artist with one of the most interesting (but limiting) voices out there, she'll make some truly great albums.
B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Depp plays this part to PERFECTION! As others have stated, the movie is a little slow in the beginning, but Depp easily manages to hold your interest as the plot unfolds. As I haven't seen &quot;The Shining&quot;, (I see others are comparing the 2 movies) I thought the movie, and especially the ending, were quite original and excellently done. &quot;Secret Window&quot; is more of an intellectual &quot;thriller&quot; than an action packed gore-fest, which adds to its appeal. Not to mention that Depp is simply superb! The cast was awesome, but Johnny's star outshines them all! I can't wait to watch it again to see the &quot;clues&quot; that I may have missed in the first viewing. An excellent DVD to buy!
B00024BHTC|5.0|Well, I pretty much read all the review and I'm astounded that so many people can be so close-minded about music. This is an incredible album. The music meshes perfectly with the vocals. Within Temptation is the only other band out there right now doing it right. This album is quality music from start to finish. It's time to put away your Megadeth and Metallica CDs and start opening your eyes to what the future holds. Evanescence helped open door to gothic music (although they are not really gothic), and Nightwish is running through it. The American record companies are too busy selling pop garbage like Britney, Christina, and Jessica to open their eyes to true talent. You can listen to this entire album all the way through, unlike most of the trash that's sold in stores right now. You're lucky to get one good song per CD on most of the top 40 junk that's \\"popular\\". I think it's just because nobody gets to hear the European metal to form a proper opinion. Buy it and listen to it, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.
B000006TRV|4.0|The Wall is a masterpeice in many ways, In terms of Art and Creativity there is few &quot;compilations&quot; that come close. The Wall is story of madness and insanity brought on by old memories and Experiences, which in simple terms causes the character in &quot;The Wall&quot; to build a virtual wall between himself and the outside world. The story takes you in and out of the very depths of darkness with the combination of amazing guitar work and well done vocals. The problem with the Wall however is that to really get the enjoyment the album has to offer you must listen to it more as one big peice of music which can be annoying at times. The plot is also very hard to understand at first and It's not a bad idea to watch the movie as well as listen to the album to understand it, But even so it still has it's grand moments like &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Hey You.&quot;
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin is such an amazing artist! I listened to this cd once and was blown away!!! I also saw him live and my jaw was dropped the entire time.... SO INCREDIBLE!!! This cd is 4 everyone adn i strongly recommend it.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Ms. Beckinsale does a great job as usual. The two main vampire men in the movie were terrible however. The plot is good, the acting is acceptable, and the action is good. It just doesn't strike you as a great movie, entertaining yes, watch once or twice and forget it.
B000001DQG|4.0|This was the first EJ item I bought as a teen.  I had enjoyed the radio play of Dont let the sun go down on me and The bitch is back.  Other songs that I found that I thought were good were Ive seen the saucers and ticking.  The worst track is Solar prestige a Gammon.  Dumb.  The others are enjoyable but not great.  I went on to find the other albums and would agree with another reviewer that this is a weak album in comparison to Goodbye Yellow brick road, Captain Fantastic and some of the others but overall it was still an enjoyable 45 minutes of music.<BR>I dont have the remastered version but the addition of Lucy in the sky and Philadelphia Freedom would make this a decent buy
B00003CXCT|2.0|Forget the original effects, forget the original films...remember that real people worked on the effects Lucas deems \\"old and dated\\".  Those people and \\"old\\" effects were what gave the movies so much charm and timelessness.  Those people also slaved for hours and REDEFINED special effects as we know them.  Now most of it is just CGI whipped up in about a years time.  Replacing actors and effects that aren't even that poor is just a show that there is a pure monetarial motivation for doing this.<br />What was so magical and timeless about Star Wars was that you could return to them whenever you wanted and see exactly what you saw the first time.  Now, we have so many different versions floating around no one can remember what's what.  And that's what I find sad about this.  It's deplorable that there is such a lack of respect being paid to the versions that made these films timeless.  <br />As far as DVDs go, I'm sure this set will be the new standard.  I'd expect nothing less from Lucasfilm.  However, I just wish that Lucasfilm would expect something from us instead of putting out their product with no credence for the fans.
B00005NGZX|5.0|This is hands down, the most remarkable hardcore record i own and that i have ever heard. And it is just that, a RECORD, not a collection of songs...most of the songs directly blend into the next song as if they were written to be peiced together in that order. The songs all sound different, but it sounds as if it was recorded with the same instruments in the same settings, and the effect of it is a cohesive batch of music that is recognizable as an album...Jane Doe has a definite feel to it, much different than the stuff they've done before. I thought &quot;Forever Comes Crashing&quot; was alright, but it never impressed me that much...it was just a little too sloppy...it had some good songs but it just didnt blow me away. The entire reason why Converge is my favorite band is on the sheer power of this record alone. It hits so many bases too...something that a lot of records lack...it can be slow without being boring; it can have a melody without being soft; it can be technical without being rediculise; it can be fast without being monotonous; its not macho, yet it will rip your face off...it is just so dynamic. Every single song on this record is honestly amazing. I try not to listen to it unless i can digest it front to back. It is abrasive as hell, and if you arent into pretty extreme music, it will sound a little too intense, but that is the nature of it. All the instrumentation is precise and exact, and Jacob Bannon's vocals dont even sound like a voice, it sounds more like an instrument itself, because the words are completely undeciferable. In my opinion it transcends hardcore, because there isnt really breakdowns and typical hardcore tricks in it, it is just extreme music. I happen to think it is certainly the most amazing thing to come out of the underground hardcore scene; and personally, one of the finest records ever made. I honestly recommend it.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I am sure most of the people who wrote the review that hate this album didn't even went through listen the whole album, my be just couple of radio hits. And some people here are just personal attack rather just don't like the music. Okay..Honestly, This album compare to &quot;Let Go&quot;, I have to say  the tune is not as popish and catchy as the first one, but i still think some of the songs is rather melodic, i never thought her music is anywhere near punk, maybe just her image gave people the impression. This album compare to the first one, is a bit more angry, the selection of music is more mature, is it worth a listen? YES. Definitely an above average sophomore effort for a young pop singer. <br />P.S. Bad Music? Go to buy the William Hung album and listen to it, his &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot; still couldn't get out from my head..
B000002H97|5.0|This is a great CD.  The only problem I have is that this isn't their normal sound.  &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; were the CDs that defined Metallica.<br />   This CD is still great but an alteration of sound for any band is looked down upon.
B00005JKZ3|4.0|Unlike many who have virtually thrown cocktails at this sequel to the 1997 original, I still really enjoy this movie alot even though it certainly has it's share of problems.<br /> Agent J (Will Smith) has been a bitter and unpleasant agent at the men in black business since his sidekick from the first MIB movie retired from the force but a new alien enemy has come forth to threaten Earth's future. The alien is named Serleena and is after an ancient artifact named The Light of Zartha and threatens to destroy the Earth and blow it into space dust if it isn't found. Now Agent J must try to get his former comrade out of retirement and back onto the MIB business to once again protect the Earth from the scum of the Universe and the new scum is Serleena.<br /> The acting is once again fantastic by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones but the acting by Lara Flynn Boyle is a bit forced and somewhat tired. The biggest flaw with this movie is that it's so incredibly short being only a measly 88 minutes long. It just feels rushed with it's short running length. It just feels so brief at it. Another but much more minor weakness is that it feels a bit like a rehash of the first one with similar jokes and such but overall though, &quot;Men in Black II&quot; is nonetheless a worthy sequel that is very good.
B00000JZI9|4.0|This movie was a great movie to me but it had its let downs. What makes a movie good to me is one that has lots of action, adventure and not to much computerised. I don't usually like westerns because they don't intertane me. What makes amovie suck to me is to much talking and that I'm not beliving what is happening.This is a tipical western by the horses, and the way they talk. What makes this movie uniqe from the other westerns I've seen.<BR>                  I thought that the sound track was exellent and perfect timming and placing.I didn't notice any fore shadowing. All the extra little scenes did kind of help the movie, it gave it it's mood.<BR>      Over all I did like this movie. Oh yeah one of my favorite quote was ''I don't want to kill you and you don't want to be dead.''
B00000JZI9|4.0|This Movie Is called Silverado and its the best Western movie I have seen so far. It's a typical western story with lots of fighting sence and horses. There's the good guys who fight for justice and the bad guys who are selfish, greedy, and cruel. What makes this movie different from other western movies is that people actually go to jail and escape. Also there's lots of dust and smoke from all the gun shots and the houses are different. Another reason why this movie is different from others is because you get to see the kind of equipment they use, like to turn off houses on fire they use buckets. Theres a quote at the end of this movie that explains how people reacted at the end. This Quoat says &quot;This used to be a quiet and peaceful town&quot;. The music not only fits in with the film, but it also is outstanding as a symphonic composition.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|I am not going to bother reviewing the film as a film, because it social pornography and nothing more.  I urge all parents to seize the film on sight and toss it into the wastebasket.  Or better still, watch it alone (no kids present) and tell me it isn't the most corrupting experience for your children that you could possibly imagine.  The worst of it is this film has passed through without the usual controversial film fanfare.  It is being presented as some kind of 'alternate lifestyle' film disquized as a sci-fi/philosophical epic.  O yeah, if you look closely on the back of the dvd you'll find a tiny R hidden within the maze of visuals, so I guess that covers the makers from any liability claims.  If you want an idea of how dangerous this movie is, consider that this reviewer is not even a religious person, and that he grew up in the liberated 60's, and was unsupervised as a youth,free to experiment with life-threatening situations, and in spite of this could not make through to the end of the film.
B00000JZI9|5.0|I love western movies the are so exiting. Especially the saloons and the showdowns. The soundtrack of &quot;Silverado&quot; really helped the movie run along better.For example when people were riding the horses and were shooting at each other it had fast music the movie ran along  good and it made it even more exiting. &quot;Silverado&quot;was a very nice movie.I prctically loved. It had every thing a western movie needs.For example the cowboys, guns, sherif, and of course the horse. I would like to buy this movie because its very exiting. In my english class it  my first time watching&quot;Silverado&quot;  .Western movies are not for every one. But if you like western movies i'm telling you are going to want to see this movie
B00000JZI9|5.0|I  used to hate western movies. I thought that they were a wast of time. I   first watched the movie &quot;SILVERADO&quot; in my english I thought that that i was going to hate it but i loved it. I was wrong it was an intence movie filled with action. The reason why I liked it so much was becuase it wasn't like many other western it was modern. The movie &quot;SILVERADO&quot; had a good foreshadowing like the part when the settlersshowed the money to the guards you knew that they were going to steal it from them in the trip. What i think makes a western not good is the actors they are always serios. Unlike &quot;SILVERADO&quot;  the actors were serios and funny at the same time. I have three qouts from the movie that i really liked. One of then is &quot;Don't force me to make a adjustment around here.&quot;What i think this means is that don't make me do some thing that i don't want to do. the second qout is &quot;Quit your yelling you old coot.&quot; This means to stop talking or to stop yelling. The last one is &quot;This used to be a peaceful town.&quot;  I think that he is trying to say that everything was good when it was his way and before payton, mal and Raden were in town.Thats why i liked the movie'SILVERADO.&quot;
B00006RINF|5.0|It's one of those cd's you can listen to from the very begining to the end, and then re-listen to it again, and again, and again, and again. The music will never cease to pull you in. <br />It is extremely melodic and has a lot of atmosphere. The harmonies between vocals, guitar and other insturments are almost insurpassable in sound and overall quality. <br />If you are a music fan, buy this album.
B000089RVX|1.0|One of the reasons I rarely listen to the radio anymore.
B00000DQSV|1.0|please stay far away from this eighties lousy dance group and this terrible cd where the title explains everything.songs like skin trade and meeting elpresidente sound bad and dated.i would sincerely recommend you to avoid all their lousy albums.get premonition from john fogerty instead.
B00003CY5J|4.0|&quot;The Score&quot; is a thriller with slow pace, but that is not a factor because two screen legends and the best actor of his generation are in the leading roles. So the semi-slow pace is an advantage, because Robert De Niro, Edward Norton and Marlon Brando displayed better their acting talent. I don't want them dodging bullets and climbing walls all the time, I want to see their performances.<br />However, &quot;The Score&quot; still has some stunts, and above all, a smart direction. The movie has a lot of interesting camera angles, a nice choreography for the stunts, cool gadgets, and a very welcome movie score, by Howard Shore. But that's just the icing in the cake, because the three actors are the main reason to see &quot;The Score&quot;.<br />Robert De Niro's latest films aren't exactly nice movies, so perhaps &quot;The Score&quot; is the latest good movie that he has appear on. Also, &quot;The Score&quot; is the last chance to see Marlon Brando (R.I.P.) at the top of his game, we know that he didn't like his acting career very much, so &quot;The Score&quot; was the last time that he showed us his acting talent, perhaps because he was stimulated to share scenes with Robert De Niro and the promising Edward Norton.<br />The DVD doesn't have a lot of features, but they are good. The audio commentary is very informative because not only Frank Oz, the director of the movie shares his experiences, but also Rob Hahn, the director of photography reveals some tricks and resources used to film &quot;The Score&quot;. The Behind-the-Scenes feature and the additional footage are really interesting, because we can see a lot of Marlon Brando's famous improvisation. So the DVD features are few, but they are solid, plus the audio and video quality are very good, because this is a recent film.<br />&quot;The Score&quot; is not a groundbreaking film, but the cast is stunning, the plot is familiar but it's also interesting, the direction is smart, the music is good, and all that results in an amusing film. Specially recommendable for fans of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando or Edward Norton.
B00000JZI9|4.0|I myself don't usually watch western movies but this one caught my attention from the beginning. To me a good western must have action, adventure, and it must be very funny. Also it must have a point. Silverado had all these things plus more. Silverado has you on your toes wanting to see more. This movie has a very good plot. One of the themes was good vs evil. The bad guys steal something or do something bad and the good guys restore the peace. The soundtrack was pretty good. It kept me awake wanting to see more. This movie overall has a good theme, great action , adventure, and it keeps you on your toes.
B00008BXJ6|4.0|Well, this cd is simply awsome. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period.Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period.  <br />keep saying this to yourself until you buy it.<br />Now to the review:<br />This cd is great but, as my Linkin Park loving friend told me, it does get a little boring after you listen to it a lot, but i made it a lot more exciting by playing the guitar part along with th cd and that was lots of fun. This music is fairly simple, yet has a catchyness to it that makes it great. The guitar parts aren't really complicated, but that doesn't matter cause it sounds awsome (plus then i can play along, im not very good at guitar, ive only been playing for 2 months, yet i had no problem playing along with tnt once i found the tabs. My favorite songs are the first five tracks. The ones after it don't seem to have as catchy lyrics, but that might be because i haven't listened to them enough to be able to sing along. <br />Also, when i first got this cd i was disappointed because when i listened to it i thought it was boring but after listening to it a few more times and paying close attention the guitar playing and lyrics, the songs became etched in my brain and thats were i like them.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Frankly, the first reaction for this movie is, musical...cheezy! I have to admit, it is hard to look for a really good musical nowadays, or at least up average would be fine for me. Then, I heard Nicole Kidman is going to star on this musical, so I firgured, what the heck, let's gie it a shot. Since she just had her divorce and such. I must say, I have had put my foot in my mouth for this. The movie was splendid. Despite her personal mishaps, Nicole has proven to be one of the best. She sings, with Ewan Mcgregor as her co-star and they have their work ut out for them.<br />This is a story of a poor writer (Ewan) in strive of getting his unobtainable object of desire (Nicole), who happens to be the main star of this circus theater show in Paris. They succumb into some sort of Forbiddened Love and they tried anything to be and stay together but fate have other plans for them. Nicole has to help her friend and boss from going bankcrupt and with that, she has to attend to this other rich guy, who owns the deed to the place. Help in the sense of be her compainion. Meanwhile, to cover up their affair, the Ewan has manage to create a play, due to mistaken liason earlier in the movie; therefore giving them the room to be together at least somewhere along the line.<br />I must add one thing.<br />The rich man gets what he wants, and if he can't have what he wants...nobody else will either.<br />An applause for this one.
B00004Z459|1.0|This sucks! Even if i thought they sounded good (which i don't) They still suck because they don't know how to sing (They yell and &quot;rap&quot;, but never sing), they don't know how to play music any better than what i can and ive been playing guitar for only 6 months, and they are nothing special. My friend loves them so much, he thought i was stupid for liking ac/dc, he says &quot;linkin park is WAY better than ac/dc&quot;, and im thinkin &quot;does he seriously believe that a crappy &quot;rap/rock&quot; band can be better than one of the best true rock bands?&quot;
B00008EY65|5.0|This movie is SO AWESOME and isn't one SECOND boring. A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE!
B00000JZI9|5.0|A western to me is a small town with a saloon, tumbleweeds, and noble good guys ,pure evil bad guys, the perfect marksman, and the loose cannon cowboy. &quot;Silverado&quot; met all of these requirements. I loved this movie mostly for the action, but at the slow parts it wasn't appealing to me. Luckily, &quot;Silverado&quot; wasn't slow for long.<BR>       I enjoyed this movie through-and-through. It had many famous faces in its cast including Kevin Kline, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, and Kevin Costner. Kevin Kline played Paten, Jeff Goldblum played Slick the gambler, Danny Glover was the marksman Mal Johnson, and Jake the hot shot cowboy was portrayed by Kevin Costner, &quot;Thanks for giving me a hand&quot; this was directed at Paten when locked up in the cell hiding in Paten's coat in return Jake was Paten's hands but getting handcuffed to the cell Paten punched out the guard there fore giving Jake a hand. <BR>      In conclusion, I give this movie five stars. Great actors make a movie work well and &quot;Silverado&quot; worked very well.
B00005ATQF|4.0|one of my favorite movies kubrick and matthew modaine how better can it get.lol. i suggest this omvie to anyone who likes kubrick, war movies or both for that matter. i also read the book that its based off of &quot;the short timers&quot; by gustav hasford it was really good but i still liked the movie better becasue it had vincent d' onfario and and the segarent(its like blasphemy that i cant remeber his name at this moment) but this movie is great, kind of boring at parts but still its deffinalty worth a watch.
B00000JZI9|2.0|I didnt realy like movie very munch  because I,ve seen better westerns than that one. the only thing I like about it is that tere was a lot of gun fights in the movie there was kidnapping fires . I wouldnt see it in thearters i would just wait for it to come out on dvd or vhs .                                                           <BR>        In awestern I would espect roberys breaking out of jail moe hanging.I thought the movie kinda suck because the bigining suck a lot . The way this movie identifis a western is that theres cow boys and guns farms horses and cattle. One of the forshowdowing is when someguys got jack by bad guys.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is great.  The band is made up of Daron who is a great guitar player, Shavo a good bass player, Serj a amazing singer/song writer, and John who is an exceptional drummer.  This CD has most of System of a Down's good songs like Pshyco, Chop Suey, Toxcicity, and The Prison Song.  I actually cant think of a bad song on the whole CD.  Soad is very unigue.  There isnt a band out there that can match Soads unigue style and sound.  There is absolutely nothing like System of a Down.  Once you hear some SOAD music you will be singing it for days or even weeks.  System of a Down even touches on political content.  Their music is meaningfull.  They arent just one of those bands that go out there and just scream about nothing.  They are amazing.  This is a MUST BUY for anybody that likes hard rock or metal!

B00005JCAA|5.0|Meet Joe Black is one of my favourite movie of all times, I think it is also one of the best movie of all times. I remember the first time I saw it in the theatre; I was taking a break in the middle of my projects with hardly any sleep for days. I did not realise that is was a 3 hr movie and I did not fall asleep. The opening scene with Anthony Hopkin just captivated me within the first 5 mins of the movie. Since then, I have watched it over 5 times, each time with new discovery in the wonderfully written script about love, death, and life; how a perfect gentle, who I think has everything, still cannot escape mortality, and how this fear has been transformed into courage. The movie had many wonderful moments, one of which when Hopkin with Forlani in the helicopter talking about love like &quot;when lightning strike&quot;, also a moving scene when Bill's (Hopkins charactor) less favourite daughter told the father that it is alright as everyone is allowed to have a favourite, it is OK as long as she feels loved. I strongly recommend anyone to watch the movie for yourself and not listening to the negative reviews from the &quot;critics&quot; as most of the time, they are wrong.
B000002J1U|5.0|This is an amazing album.  Some of my favorite songs are the &quot;Immigrint Song&quot; with the traditional rock sound, &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; and &quot;Thats the Way&quot; with a more bluesy sound, and &quot;friends&quot; which i dont know how to explain but is one of my favorites.  Like the person above said this album did not get the appreciation it should of because people were still caught up with the first two albums which were also good.  This album has a little of everthing and i think it has a little something that everyone will enjoy.  This is a must buy for any Zepplin fan and even for people that arent in to Zepplin.
B0000C1733|5.0|This CD is one of the best compilations ive ever heard. EVERY track on the cd is awesome. I never get tired of listening to this masterpeace. The two new songs are also very worth being put on the greatest hits cd, my favorite being Save the Population. The ending of the song is very well done. If you are a fan of the Peppers or simply a fan of good music, you owe it to yourself to buy this cd.
B00024BHTC|3.0|Being a fan of Nightwish, I had high hopes for this new effort. I was very fond of &quot;Century's Child,&quot; with the exception of the &quot;Phantom&quot; track, and liked the direction that album had taken. This one however, seems lackluster. It's not a bad album, just a bland Nightwish album. Fortunately &quot;Nemo&quot; and &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot; keep it from decending into 2 star territory. I hope this is just a slight misstep, and they will be back in top form with their next cd. I feel like I overpaid for this one.
B00000JZI9|3.0|I am not that into old Western movies. I never did like them, because i am not American and they seem very boring to me. I, myself like action movies and horrur a lot. The things that are interesting to me in this movie are the revolvers and how fast they take them and and shoot. Another thing that is pretty good are the scenes that make me go &quot;wow&quot;. What i dont like is this movie or any western movie is that when one guy takes out like six guy's at the same time. That makes the movie very unrealistic. However some people like that in movies, because, the good guy wins; i am not into that. I mean, the bad guys should win once in a while. A typical Western movie should have cowboy's, &quot;of course&quot; and revolvers &quot;definitely&quot;. The thing that makes this movie diferent that other western movies is that it is less real than other western movies that i have seen, so far. I like the quote'sin western movies, because, they mean so much and even make the movie much better. &quot;I maintain the peace&quot; and &quot; It could of been such a good deal for us&quot; are some examples ofquote's in this movie. The best thing about this movie, I have to say that it is the soundtrack. When ever dool's happen or something exiting happens and the music comes, it make people really feel the movie.The soundtrack in the movie is very loud, so you could kind of tell what is going to happen next. Another thing i liked about this movie is that the shot's they took in western places. Shot's make the movie freeze for a second and makes you think about what beatiful area's they took place in the movie. That just makes the movie improve more to me. I like the way that the people dressed like back then. Their clothing were very cool. But, i don't like the way that they talk. It is very annoying to me. Their accent is very wierd, because, they are so polite. Polite is very good. i am more of a slang talk kind of guy so maybe that is it. If i would rate this movie i would of gaven it a 55 out of a 100. The reason for that is, because, i would give it more on the positive side just because of the dool's; i like that. My advice to you is, if you have not seen this movie yet, check it out, maybe you will like it and  maybe you will hate it or even be like me and give it an &quot;ok&quot;.<br />                                     THE                   END

B00000JZI9|1.0|Have you ever seen a Western movie that you didn't like? Well I have,it's       called Silverado and I hated it!! I had to watch it in class but I didn't pay attention in some parts. I like movies that are funny,scary,and that has drama. Silverado is not a good movie so DON'T see it! The soundtrack is boring and I don't like how it was. The movie wasn't interesting and it made me fall asleep in some parts. I didn't like the way Silverado was all about guns and killing. I don't like cowboy movies. This movie isn't a good movie so don't  spend your time or money on the movie.
0671027387|5.0|I just finished 'Deception Point,' and I have to wonder how many of these great novels Dan Brown is going to put out. He has truly mastered his technique in this intriguing, fast ride through plot twists and vivid characters.<br />He is consistent in his point of view changes, which is always evident to perceptive writerly-readers. He is also consistent with the thoughts of each character. Without frivolous distractions, I was able to focus solely on the happenings in the book, and thus, enjoy it furthermore.<br />It's hard to say which Brown book is my favorite, for they all have that certain pizazz and excellent plots. 'Deception Point' definitely is playing on the same level as 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons,' though.<br />My only gripe about Brown's books are the corny pick-up lines near the end that always seem to work. If it was either dropped, or refined, the books would be even better!<br />In the mean time, though, I will continue to read Brown's work, because, as the third book of his that I have read, 'Deception Point' still keeps me guessing and makes me truly amazed!
B00000JZI9|2.0|I did not like the movie Silverado. In the movie there needed to be more blood in the movie because i like seeing blood splater all over the place. Also because i never really liked westerns.This western was the same as any other, good guys bad guys and a sherrif. In the movie there are alot of gunfights but not alot of killing.There was also alot of bad acting in the movie.So i recomend you save your time and money and watch a movie that has alot a blood.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|If you can sit through this movie without falling asleep or crying of boredom you are probably the first! This is hands down the worst Bond of all. It was never origionally writen by Ian Flemming, which made it STUPID. I don't recomdend wasting your money on this. Use it to buy one of the better ones like: <br />GOLDFINGER<BR>GOLDENEYE <BR>TOMORROW NEVER DIES
B00000JZI9|3.0|I like western movies. When I first saw it I thought it was boring,but later when Scott Glenn(Emett) and Kevin Kline(Paden) go to rescue Kevin Caster(Jake). I kept on wondering the whole time that what will happen next because the was so interesting, especially the part when Kevin Kline(PADEN), Scott Glenn(Emett), Danny Glover(Mal), Kevin Cartner(Jake) reunite and defeat the cruel and selfish bad guys. I did not feel like getting of my seat even when the movie ended because I wished there was more of the movie. The soundtrack was also pretty interesting. It was kind of the music which heroes use when they come into rescue. The music was also the one which plays in the army when soldiers march in the parade or into battle. It is also the victory music. The whole 132 minutes were cool! The fights in the movie were kind of real-life likein the wild west.I do not care if the movie was fake or real, all I care is that the movie was interesting. All the stunts in the movie were cool espically when Kevin Cortner(Jake) nephew jumps from the building on the horse. It was the second best western movies. The first best was THE WILD WILD WEST. Also the stunts,talking,moves.speed, and qualties all make the movieslook different in their own way. There are preety cool  stunts in western movies and also when the cowboys are riding,shooting,or jumping in a mad way it kind of looks wierd because if a cowboy gets shot, the other cowboy will not figures out, wheither he is having fun or is he deying. Some cowboys also talk in a way as well. I can not figure out how the cowboys keep on shooting even when the bullets run out.This is what I think about western movies and Silverado.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I thought this cd was great! All of the songs were put together perfectly. My favorite song is &quot;If I aint got you.&quot; I think the lyrics are great. I actually just printed them out. The beat to this song is fabulous. I love how she uses her own experiences and puts them together to make this song. I think alicia keys has a great voice and I think she plays the pianno like no other person. Her pianno alone moved me. I taught my dance class a combination to this song. I was beautiful. I was very pleased with this cd. i hope she comes out with more cds just like this one. Thanks Alicia you're the best
0312995423|2.0|This being the 3rd of Brown's books that I've read, I probably won't pick up any more.  Da Vinci left me a bit cold, if only because some of the puzzles were simple and all the \\"codes\\" in it were not from Da Vinci, but from a 2ndary character. 3 stars.<br />Angels and Demons attracted me since I'd recently been to Italy, and I enjoyed reading about some of the places I'd actually been, but the \\"awe and wonder\\" of the ambigrams felt a bit silly and contrived, since there are websites that can automatically create these types of things for you. 3.5 stars.<br />While I'm not saying Digital Fortress didn't have its moments, I feel it is the weakest of the three.  When the reader sees the answer to the final puzzle immediately, and it takes the supposedly brilliant people in the book more than 20 pages to figure it out, that gets frustrating.  I'm of certainly no more than average intelligence, so I expected more.  The characters often very quickly jump to highly emotional conclusions/actions without considering other options.  I also dislike the author's use of phrases similar to, \\"<character> was absolutely certain that <wrong thing> was true, there could be no other explanation!\\", when quite clearly there could be many other explanations.  I've noticed he does that in every book, and it grates.<br />The more I read from Dan Brown, the more I suspect he's writing for younger people...maybe 8th grade or early high school.  There is merit in this, but I guess it's just not for me.<br />All that said, if you loved his other work, you'll probably love this one, too.  Characters are similarly drawn, similarly emotional, and the plot is similarly (i.e., \\"quickly\\") paced.
B00005JM8V|5.0|This first aired on PBS sometime in the early to mid eighties. I was in my first couple of years of college at the time. As many of you can relate, I had lots of fun in school (especially after classes)and didn't watch much TV. For whatever reason I was at home when the first installment aired and I was hooked. Being in college, I wasn't too much of a history buff and knew little about the Holocaust. I would come home early from parties just to get to see the next installment. Since that time I have always wanted to see the documentary again and now can say I have bought it and will watch it (this time with my wife) soon.<BR>I had the opportunity to visit Munich some time back and didn't miss the chance to visit Dachau. Wow! What an experience... one that I shall never forget. I think watching the show this time will mean so much more than before. Make sure you get lots of Kleenex before you sit down to watch a segment.
B0001GL3KE|3.0|My inlaws came over to visit me from England, and raved on about this movie.  They were keen to take us to the movies with our 2 children, 8 and 10 yrs to see it again with them.  In the end we chose something more fun for the kids, as children don't want to go to the movies to watch a love story.<BR>Anyway, not long after it came out at Blockbusters, and we hired it out of curiosity.<BR>After the first 5 minutes we and sent the kids off too bed, as it wasn't really the swearing /cursing but the just that it seemed a little too explicit for my kids to watch.)<BR>I would say that some scenes are just too crass, and they could had done without them.<BR>In the second half of the movie, I noticed that the swearing and the sexual content tended to calm down...unless I was just getting used to it by then.  The story was very funny at times, but alittle confusing having so many couples to follow...hard to get into their characters, or you forget at times that someone was in the movie, until they showed up on screen 20 minutes later, and would have to remember what their life was all about.<BR>I'm not a prude in the slightest, and love comedies like Euro Trash, Coupling (the BBC Series) and American Pie etc...but the beginning half of this movie really did make my husband and I cring at times.  <BR>I'm surprised that my inlaws, who are in their late 50's really wanted to show this to my children...especially as they are very conservative.<BR>Anyway it does get better, if you can stick with it after the first 30 minutes.<BR>Hugh Grant's story line was also bit too cheesy.
B0002858YS|4.0|Do you like retro? Phantom Planet? Modest Mouse? Muse? The Strokes? The Vines?  You'll like this one. Its well worth the investment. <br /> I was in one of my random moods, so I played &quot;innie minnie miny moe&quot; at my local music store. Guess who won? :) And I am a very staisfied chica.<BR>~micha~
B0000640S1|4.0|When Sylvester Stallone is involved....you know youre going to get terrific action.  But the movies story and Stallones character of John Rambo are very interesting as well.  The thing that appealed to me most of all in this movie is Rambo barely says 2 words througout the whole movie and at the end he just blows up.  He explodes about the war,  his buddies getting killed,  etc.  Its an explosive and dramatic moment....the topper of the whole movie.<br />  Again,  terrific movie,  if youre into action/drama,  take a look at this one, its great!!!
B000002UA2|5.0|I actually give this album 10 stars. Why this album does not get more acclaim is beyond me. I couldn't phathom a Pink Floyd collection without this album. My favorite tracks: &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; and &quot;Mudmen&quot;-both romantic and soulfull! &quot;Mudmen&quot; is a track that continues the tune originated in &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; but is essentially a bluesy guitar solo by Gilmore. I Love You Dave!
B00024BHTC|1.0|Nightfish stink.  This album falls well behind expectations!  Avoid!
B00024BHTC|1.0|What is this nonsense people are saying?  Every rock riff I have heard by this band has been done before.  None of the songs are remotely original because they are all stolen medleys from opera based compositions.  The singing is diabolical.  Be realistic if this woman could sing properly she would be singing at the proms, but she ain't that good so she sings in Nightwish.  All Nightwish have done is attempt to come up with an idea which has been done by many bands before.  Play me an original composition with an original melody then I just might change my mind on this, but I know from hearing this that Nightwish can't.  Finland has never been able to come up with any original material before because they are 35 years behind the NWOBHM and American metal guitar movements.  Sweden and Holland have come out with much better talent than this and that's going back over 20 years.  All I can say is that the only people who can get into this kind of music are very young people with limited music knowledge.  As this is obviously Nightwish's mainstream audience, anybody over 15 years old should avoid!
B0000630BT|5.0|I like to think of Judas Priest's 1990 metal masterpiece Painkiller as a speed metal Exile On Main Street.  Both albums are examples of stunning perfection in thier respective genre's from start to finish.  I've always noticed that Judas Priest's role in heavy metal is similar to the Rolling Stones in rock n roll ( The Stones combined the best elements of r&amp;r, r&amp;b, blues, etc. perfected it into thier own definitive style, in every conceivable way became the epitome of rock n roll music and would be the reference point for all real rock n roll music that followed.  Judas Priest did the exact same thing for heavy metal.) so I couldn't resist the Exile/Painkiller comparison.  Painkiller is the band's fastest and heaviest album to date and easily one of their best.  The sound is simply classic Priest fueled by the influence of 80's speed metal bands such as Metallica and Megadeth.  Basically, if you like speed metal at all, Painkiller is essential.  Everyone in the band is in top form and each gives an inspiring, breathtaking 110% over-the-top performance, especially noteworthy is drummer Scott Travis since Painkiller is his first Priest album and his ferocious double-bass technique gives the band's sound a new power.  Every song on Painkiller is a classic beginning with the ferocious beast of a title track on which Rob Halford screams and wails at the top of his lungs for the entire song and Scott Travis unleashes his immortal drum intro and ending with the majestic, epic battle anthem One Shot At Glory featuring one of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing's best ever guitar soloing duels.  Also notable is A Touch Of Evil which is the one non-speed-metal song on here; its a heavy, midpaced, atmospheric ballad, of sorts, which sounds not quite like anything else they've ever done and has one of Tipton's greatest guitar solos ever to boot.  In my opinion, Judas Priest are the greatest metal band of all time and Painkiller is one of their best albums. You will love it.
0393307050|5.0|I have read this book and I think it is one of the best I ever have read. I am a teenager and technicly this is an adult book but I still enjoyed it greatly.
B000068PQ0|4.0|I absolutely love this cd...  It's at least 4 Gold Star material...<br />-&gt;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell<BR>my fave song/title on it<br />My friend gave me a copy and as they say better late than never...  The music is superb and the lyrics are eccentrically interesting...  As well as the vocals smooth nicely over the music...<br />Pick it up and give it a try... You'll like it even if your name isn't Mikey - a Flaming Fan - Savannah Skye...
B00005JMYG|4.0|That might seem like a stupid title for a review but I think I'll explain.  I have never been a huge fan of Farrell.  I think he is good at improvasation but loves to play it over the top, which ruins the humor for me.  In Anchorman, he played it just right, no over the top in this and he was very very funny.<br />If Amazon would allow me to give half stars I would of given this three and a half.  A very enjoyable comedy.  I disagree with the reviewer that says that it should of had an R rating.  I really respect movies that can are funny without relying on \\"how many times can we say a swear word\\" type humor.<br />A very enjoyable movie that delivered what it promises.<br />As a side note to the person that said that stuff that wasn't in the movie was in the trailer.  A trailer is usually made before the final version of a film is cut, so a lot of that stuff could of been on the cutting room floor.  I hope you don't see trailers and want to go see exactly what you saw in the trailers.  The trailer is to make you want to see the movie, not a promise of what is going to be in the movie.
B000000WCA|5.0|I was a huge Spice Girls fan back when they were more than just beautiful girls with sexy images. They remind me so much of my seventh grade year, as well as the summer after my seventh grade year. Everytime I put on this album, I go back to my seventh grade year and remember how much of a fan I was. <br />    First, let's introduce the girls. Starting with Geri Halliwell, aka \\"Ginger Spice\\". Geri, who was considered to be a favorite with most fans and considered to be the sexiest Spice Girl, called herself \\"Ginger Spice\\" because she was always seen in red, and it is a well-known fact that ginger is red. Next, we have Victoria Adams-Bechkam, aka \\"Posh Spice\\". Victoria, who happens to be the first prettiest Spice Girl in my book, called herself \\"Posh Spice\\" because she was raised in a very classy family. Thirdly, we have Melanie B., aka \\"Scary Spice\\". Melanie B., who is the second most prettiest Spice Girl in my book has called herself \\"Scary Spice\\" because she is constantly wearing leopard-skin outfits and has a pierced tongue. Fourthly, we have Melanie C., aka \\"Sporty Spice\\". It's obvious that Melanie C. has called herself \\"Sporty Spice\\" because of her Tomboy style, which consists of sports jerseys, sweat suits, jogging outfits, tanktops, and sneakers from the infamous Nike. Lastly, we have the adorable Emma Bunton, aka \\"Baby Spice\\". Emma has called herself \\"Baby Spice\\" because she is the youngest of the group. To add to her name, Emma dresses the part, wearing short pink skirts, rolled up socks, always putting her hair in pigtails, owning a lot of stuffed toy animals, and shows up at almost every promotional appearance sucking on a lollipop. Now, let's get to the album.<br />WANNABE<BR>  The first single from the album. Not only was this the first single released from the album, this was also the girls' first single ever. I remember the first time I heard this, that I immediately fell in love with it. The lyrics are real catchy and will have you dancing everytimeyou hear it.<br />SAY YOU'LL BE THERE<BR>  The second single from the album. Although Wannabe was major #1 hit, Say You'll Be There topped Wannabe by hitting #1 in 32 countries, including the U.S. This is a great song that talks about how the girls tell their boyfriends that they know their guys love them, but all the guys have to do is be there for the girls when the girls need them.<br />2 BECOME 1<BR>  The third single from the album. Yet another #1 hit for the girls. The girls decided to take a break from their uptempo songs and decided to release a sweet ballad for a change. The song is, indeed, about sex. If you didn't know that, just listen closely to the lyrics, especially when Emma sings her verses. The version on this album wasn't used for the video. Victoria's verse on this version is different from that of the video. On this version, Victoria says \\"Any deal that we endeavour, boys and girls feel good together. Take it or leave it, take it or leave it\\". In the video version, Victoria says, \\"Once again, if we endeavour, love will bring us back together. Take it or leave it, take it or leave it\\".<br />LOVE THING<BR>  Although I love the vibe to this song, it isn't as energized as most of the girls' songs from this album.<br />LAST TIME LOVER<BR>  This is yet another song that separates from the girls' usual hype girl power sounds. This is your casual love song, but all of its verses are sung by Melanie B., where she sings in a low, sexy voice that can make any go crazy, if you know what I mean.<br />MAMA<BR>  The fifth and final single from the album. For starters, this is a beautiful ballad, with the beautiful sound of a choir. Secondly, this was a song the girls had written for their mothers and it was a great gesture to show how much they love and appreciate their mothers.<br />WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE<BR>  The fourth single from the album. The girls went back into their girl power sound with this song. It is a great song all the way.<br />SOMETHING KINDA FUNNY<BR>  I used to be nuts about this song, but I think I played it out for myself.<br />NAKED<BR>  The girls decided to get a little raunchy by recording this song that sounds to me like they are talking about sex, intimacy, love, romance, and... being naked.<br />IF U CAN'T DANCE<BR>  Although this is great dance song, I never really understood the meaning of it.<br />    By the time this album was released, the Spice Girls were already famous in their own country, which would be England, and here in the US. This album helped push them further into their fame and the album remains a favorite amongst all of their fans.
B00005LK94|5.0|And it's not just him.  This movie came up amongst my friends in college and every female in the room said that their father KEPT watching this movie and they ALWAYS cried.  Sort of brings a whole new meaning to the phrase &quot;empty nest.&quot;<br />This movie is about Anna, who, after her mother's death in a car crash (Anna was also in the car), is sent to live with her slightly eccentric inventor father in Canada.  He means well, but he just makes absolutely no sense to Anna.  It is an exagerated case of &quot;my dad is so weird&quot; that any teenager can identify with.  Meanwhile, the idea of a teenage girl is so foreign to her dad that the more he tries to bond, the more she stomps away.<br />Into the story comes a band of orphaned Canadian geese that Anna nurtures.  They imprint her as their mother, so she more or less trains them.  The only problem is that they must fly south for the winter, and Anna is their only role model.  Luckily, she has a dad who builds space shuttles for fun.  Suddenly, he has a way to connect with her and she has a reason to trust him.<br />Though it sounds sort of hokey, this movie that never delves into complete pathos.  Instead, it is frequently quite funny and always touching.  If you are looking for a father's day present, this is ideal.  Just make sure to keep some tissues handy.
B000000WFF|5.0|In 1996, the Spice Girls saw the beginning of their fame when they released their first album, Spice, which produced the five spin-off singles, Wannabe, Say You'll Be There, 2 Become 1, Who Do You Think You Are, & Mama. Now, exactly one year after their first album's release, the girls brought us their second album, Spiceworld. The album as to coincide with their movie of the same name and was also made the soundtrack to the movie. Very much like what The Beatles did back in 1964 when they did A Hard Day's Night (both album and movie) and in 1966 when they did Help! (both album and movie).    SPICE UP YOUR LIFE    The first single from the album. I first heard this on Q-102 (for those of you who don't know what Q-102 is, it is a Philadelphia FM Radio Station). But the version I heard on the radio was kind of a mix in a way and it led me to believe that it was done by a different band. When I heard this version, which is the album and single version, I was proven to be wrong about thinking it was done by somebody else. It's a classic song and consists of every girl power hype sound within it. The song means you have to have fun in life. Life is too short to be bitter, so, Spice Up Your Life.    STOP    The third single from the album. The single was released in early 1998 and it was to be Geri's last single with the girls. I have heard three different reasons to why Geri departed from the band. The first is that she and Melanie B. had a serious outting. The second is that she tried to be the boss of the group and was kicked out by the other girls. The third was that Geri had musical differences. The third reason is what I believe is true and that is because it is true. Anyhow, this is a great song.    TOO MUCH    The second single from the album. This is a beautiful song and the jazzy sound is unbelievable. In the video, the five have their own individual scenes, but never a scene where they are together. Geri's scene is based on the film, \\"Casablanca\\" (with Geri dressed in a long, white party gown, performing in a nightclub, with sea sailors around her, sort of portraying \\"Casablanca\\"'s female lead female character). Victoria's scene is based on Michelle Pfeiffer's characterizaion of \\"Catwoman\\", from the 1992 film, \\"Batman Returns\\" (with Victoria dressed in a black vinyl outfit, complete with a long, black ponytail). Melanie B.'s scene is based on the film, \\"Mad Max\\", as she is shown in an industrial, post-apocalyptic war scene. Melanie C.'s scene is based on the film, \\"Year Of The Dragon\\" (with Melanie C. dressed in black trousers and an Chinese-style red top, her hair is in a long pontytail with a red streak). Emma's scene is based on the 1982 horror film, \\"Poltergeist\\" (with Emma dressed in a white pajamas, where she is in a bedroom with toys floating around her).    SATURDAY NIGHT DIVAS    Awesome song.    NEVER GIVE UP ON THE GOOD TIMES    They should have released this as a single. It's a great song. It is like a sequel to Spice Up Your Life, (even though this one has a fun Pop-like song) where they say that you can't give up on the good times you've had.    MOVE OVER    In their short time together, the girls recorded two songs for Pepsi. The first would be a song called, \\"Step To Me\\", which is an album cut. The second be this one right here. Although, they did not release it as a single, the girls, however, filmed a Pepsi commercial, using this song within it.    DO IT    Not bad.    DENYING    This one is not bad. Still holding onto their girl power sound, but the girls threw in a bit of R&B into it.    VIVA FOREVER    The fourth and final single from the album, although it is not a US single. Though, the single and video were released just before Geri's departure, the girls released the video just after Geri's departure and was the first single where they used an animated video. It is a beautiful song and I always make sure to listen to it before turning off the album.    THE LADY IS A VAMP    Geri was big fan of everything that had to do with entertainment from the 40s, 50s, & 60s. This song consists of a sound from the 40s, but talks about everything from the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, like Elvis, Ziggy Marley, Bond Girls, Charlie's Angels, 60s model Twiggy, Jackie-O, Marilyn Monroe (but addressed by her real name, Norma Jean Baker), Sandy and Danny (from Grease), etc. The song's finale fit the song perfectly, where they call out their Spice names.        Still filled with their girl power sound and remains as their second best album.
6304698623|4.0|When Alfonso Cuarón was picked to direct the new Harry Potter, many people were surprised because his last movie was definately for grown-ups only.  They seem to have forgotten that he is responsible for this beautiful retelling of a classic children's book.<br />This movie is based more on the classic Shirley Temple version than it is on the book, which means that it takes some creative liberties.  Gone are the diamond mines (the best part!) and back comes the father.  I did not really like these changes.  The movie is also transfered from London to New York, so it's a little unclear what they were doing in India.<br />Despite those qualms, though, this is a brilliantly filmed fable.  The girls are wonderful: dorky Ermegard, prissy Lavinia, spoiled Lottie, and Sarah pulls off the admirable feat of not being completely insipid (if you think that this is an insult, then you haven't read the book).<br />It is good for all ages.  My friend, for reasons still unclear to me, dragged me to see this in the theater when we were about 15... if a cynical teenager thought that a movie about little girls at a Victorian boarding school was really good, then you know it's gotta be great!
B00005V0X5|2.0|This album is the firt ever done by Megadeth but remasterd. (I have the old one) but I think I can revie it.<BR>The album is more a collector thing its not the record you would put and listen to beacuse you think its good. The producing has made it sound cheap and bad, you can almost not hear the singing and the sound is very raw.<BR>Even tho ther are some good bits and Killing is my bui... are quiet okay but I would not recomend it for a new fan.
6304698690|3.0|This is a beautiful film, there is absolutely no denying that.  It is also exceptionally well cast: Mary's transformation from sour little brat to glowing wee lass is completely believable, and the bratty, dour Colin makes a perfect &quot;to the manor born&quot; invalid.  My only problem is the liberties taken with the plot.<br />Having the parents die in an earthquake while Mary is watching is a needless, though minor liberty (though it does mean that the touching line about &quot;there's no one left to come&quot; must be left out).  But there was no need to change the plot to make the housekeeper (a wasted Maggie Smith) evil, and the chanting around the campfire is just weird.<br />The movie is worth watching for the scenery alone, but make sure that you read the book first.  It is much better.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|ALL THIS MOVIE DOES IS MAKE YOU THINK AND THAT IS ABOUT IT. LIKE REALLY I SPENT MORE TIME LOOKING INTO SPACE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON INSTEAD OF WATCHING THE MOVIE LIKE SO MANY SCENES MADE ME HELLA AGRY AND THE WORST PART ABOUT IT IS THE ENDING I MEAN THE DUDE GETS NOTHIN NOT THE GIRL NOT THE FRIENDS HE GETS NOTHING. AND THE VERY WORST PART OF THIS ALL IS THAT THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM. HOW MESSED UP IS THAT. IM HECKA PISSED. BUT STILL IF YOU WANT TO WAKE YOUR MIND UP AND TAKE IT FOR A THRILL RIDE WATCH THIS MOVIE PLEASE. --- SEAN
0440237688|5.0|This is a complex, beautiful book that offers a look into a futuristic dystopia in which there is no color, no aberation, no hot or cold, and no personal choices.  Drugs are taken to repress sexual urges and even out temprament, and careers are chosen for children based on their aptitude.  Children are raised in prearranged family units.  There is no privacy and no personal choice, but is this really a bad thing if people have no concept of those things?  There is no hunger, emotional pain, violence, crime, war, or sadness.<br />Growing up in this world is Jonas, a bright 12 year old who is about to receive his career assignment.  He is given the important but extremely rare job of \\"Reciever\\": the keeper of \\"memories\\" of what life was like before the creation of his utopian world.  Slowly, he begins to see color, to learn what love, hate, death, and heartbreak are like.  He begins to understand that some of the \\"happy\\" things around him maybe aren't so happy.<br />The brilliance of this book is that the world unfolds gradually.  Lowry does not hit us over the head with an up-front description: in fact, the place starts out sounding fairly normal if a bit Montesori.  Slowly, though, the reader realizes quite how foreign this world is.  Lowry is a deft writer with an excellent sense of subtlety.<br />Ultimately, this book is about the importance of cultural memory.  The idea of cultural memory is probably a new one for kids, and some of the concepts of death and destruction might be a little disturbing, so I recomend that parents read this book too so that they can discuss it with their children.  This in no way means that I think that it is innapropriate for kids: I just think that it is an amazing starting point for discussion about what makes us human.  Please read my review of \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" (also made today) for my thoughts on how these two books are related.<br />This is a moving, thought-provoking book that is a great read for adults as well as kids.  Adults might find it interesting that the idea of a drugged-to-make-them-\\"normal\\" population where everyone is encouraged to analyze and discuss every aspect of their lives sounds eerily familiar...
B00005JKC3|5.0|this isn't meant to be anything more than what it is...a movie about a tormented soul whose torment is accentuated or alleviated, depending on how you view catharsis--when bruce banner morphs into the great green beast. that being said, i loved the movie, its too bad that so many people have criticized it as i feel it is more of a distaste for the character than for the movie itself. the characters are captured beautifully, especially sam elliot's portrayal, and the hulk himself as a manifestation of repressed anger mixed with a dose of compassion works to show the same thought out story-line that captured so many imaginations in the comic series. as far as &quot;funny-ing&quot; the movie up--like spiderman for instance, that is not what the hulk was ever about for the most part--it is a different character demanding a different genre--more of a shakespearean tragedy than a &quot;dram-edy&quot;. instead, take it in twilight-zone reality--imagine if you will--a place where a seemingly miracle of science (in the healing power that david banner produces) turns rabid--and ultimately unleashes something never meant to be released. it's a good show if you take it for what it was meant to be.
0800141660|5.0|It seems that for a few years, Hollywood couldn't turn out Austen movies fast enough.  This is the only English production of the bunch, and it is wonderful.<br />The casting is perfect.  I thought it very silly that Emma Thompson was going to be the 19 year old Eleanor, and since she produced the movie I thought that was just silly vanity.  But she is actually perfect as the too-sensible-for-her-own-good Eleanor.  Kate Winslet is great as flaky Marianne.  Even little Margaret (Austen's only fully-realized child character) is great as the spunky pre-teen.  I remember when the movie came out one reviewer said that Hugh Grant's character &quot;looks like he's forgotten to take the coat hanger out of his clothing&quot; and that is so true... but he's so good as the clueless cad.<br />The film is beautifully shot, with great sets and scenery.  It's a little hard for a modern person to understand why the Dashwoods were so upset to have to move to such a charming cottage!  Historical perspective is maintained in the movie, though.<br />It is also very well written, with my very favourite line in any movie appearing (though I've read the book twice looking for it).  Truly words to live by, Mrs. Dashwood tells blabbermouth Margaret that if she can't think of anything appropriate to say, &quot;please keep your conversation to the roads and the weather!&quot;  Advice that has never failed me yet :-)
B0000AQVCL|2.0|To compare Jet to the White Stripes or the Strokes is to show a complete lack of understanding of music. For one thing, they just sound incredibly different. For another, the White Stripes and the Strokes are original, creative bands that have gained critical and audience respect by showing at least some musical vision and for taking us beyond modern crap radio. Jet has not done that, and they are neither original nor creative.<br />It is okay for bands to have obvious influences -- however, it is not okay for them to simply rip older bands off. This is what Jet does. Aside from the oft-pointed-out ripoff of Iggy Pop, they often obviously think that they are AC/DC. On the ballads (such as &quot;Look What You've Done&quot;), they pretend to be the Beatles. It's really quite unbelievable, just how unoriginal they are. They even have a song titled &quot;Get What You Need.&quot; How far will these guys go?<br />There's nothing on this album you haven't heard before, and when you heard it before, it was better. They get 2 stars for being competent with their instruments. Other than that, they're bland, uninspired, and quite simply, boring. Don't buy this CD -- and please, stop with the comparisons to the White Stripes and the Strokes.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is one of the few movies that has ever moved or impacted me in a way I can't explain.<br />I'm usally a fan of movies with shootout fights, and excellent plots.  But this movie had a plot that made me careless about violence, I just wanted to figure out what happened next.  This movie kept me intruiged till the end.  With excellent performences by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.<br />This movie just really captured my spirit in a way, very few movies and video games have ever captured me.<br />The only bad thing is, is that when I'm done, I realized I missed something on T.V. or two hours and 26 minutes of my life just passed by.  But it's not really a bad thing cuz I wouldn't care what was on T.V. and That 2 hours and 26 minutes was spent wisely.<br />To those who watch movies should definitly check this out, because altho it didn't win best picture, this is something Titanic, A Beautiful Mind, and Chicago could never be.  Out of all the movies I've ever seen, to me, this is the greatest movie ever made.<br />peace
B00000JZI9|5.0|This was a FANTASTIC movie!!!!!! From the moment the movie starts there is a fairly good amount of action. The story is also well written, and the casting was well chosen. All the actors played their parts to a tee. When Kevin Costner played the wild young maverick, he did it perfectly. One of my favorite lines in the movie was when Brian Denahee said &quot; This used to be such a peaceful town.&quot; The rest also did a fantastic job with their parts.In conclusion, this movie is one that anyone can enjoy and I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.
B00005KAQP|1.0|This is a classic disgrace of a movie by Whoopi Goldberg, one of the suckiest actreses of our time. Much to the previous reviewer's chagrin, people who dislike her know real talent like Chris Rock, Richard Pryor, Sam Kinison(so we are not racists). It was RIGHT of Slim Fast to dump the greedy tyrant Goldberg from their ads after she made some candid remarks about the president. Anyway, this film is a masterpiece of garbage. I have zilch respect for Whoopi and despise everything she does.
B0000CABBW|5.0|We live in an age where moving stories of courage and determination just aren't enough. Those tales have to be accompanied by Oprah Book Club moments of overcoming handicaps and tragedy or dealing with racism and sexism. Many a great story is ruined because the real drama of life takes a secondary role to the politically correct lens through which it is told. <br />In Whale Rider, it is the Lifetime-esque melodramatic subplot dealing with the evil old men who run the world and try to prevent little girls from reaching their life's destiny. The story takes place inside an aboriginal whaling community, seemingly untouched by the modern cultural advancements of the past one hundred years. Of course, our liberal filmmakers decided these people needed to be lectured in gender roles, and thus the little story of a young girl over-coming an oppressive and chauvinistic world is born. <br />Now, that all sounds like criticism for this film, and I do admit I wish this Steinam-like depiction of men was toned down a bit. But that one flaw doesn't change the fact that this is a wonderful film, a truly remarkable achievement. Forgetting all the male-bashing, at the center of the film is a touching story about a young child who so wants to be loved, especially by her grandfather. She latches on to a story from family's her past about a great voyager who arrived at their island on the back of a whale, a great warrior whose soul will someday return in a &quot;chosen one&quot;. The young girl decides she has as much claim to the birthright as any of the boys and attempts to prove to everyone (especially her grandfather) that she is worthy. <br />We seldom see young people depicted in such an honest manner. This touching story will be loved by almost everyone (and the feminists may take steps to have it canonized).
B00000DQSV|1.0|The year 1986 saw Roxy Music poseurs Duran Duran release their fifth album Notorious. The band became a trio after a) Roger Taylor (not to be confused with the other drummer Roger Taylor from the overrated Queen) quit because he saw that Simon Le Pew, John Failure and Nick Roadkill were pompous fools. Then, Andy Taylor realized he wanted to be a rock and roll star, had a huge fight with John and left the band as well. That left Simon, Nick, and John turning to Nile Rogers, and the result is the band's first flop. It sold worse than the previous 4 albums combined. The disc had one smash hit which was the title cut. Skin Trade and Meet El Presidente, on the other hand, FLOPPED here in the US. Today, this Roxy Music facsimile had to reunite because of money. I guess You Can't Ban Me read a PR sheet and distorted the truth.
6305252521|5.0|Who would have thought that 'The Truman Show' would be entered among the great literary and movie classics ever made. Where 1984 gives a bleak look at a government who looks at everything and Brave New World about cloning, The Truman show is the premierve movie about the most horrible of all television rages in the last 10 years: Reality-TV.<br />But in this case Truman does not it. The awful outside world has made him into an item of fun, a person used for the amusement of others. <br />Are we all watchers or maybe in a way all Trumans? Trying to get out if this spectacle called life?<br />Deep, great, wonderfullly acted and a seminal movie.
B00000JZI9|5.0|l used to hate western movie but i change my mind l say silveroda that movie change a hole lot of my opinion about weatern movie.That movie had a lot what i find in a movie .IT had lots frighting shootouts drama it fun to see.that what western post to have.i did think this movie was going to be weatern  with cowboy horse gunshuting and barfright .this was  good movies not like other western movie that have nothing to with hole movies .the muasic was great  it made it more intersing the movie u jump out if your set.silveroda was a good movie to .if you never see a western movie you should see this one .
B00005JKNC|3.0|Funny that a movie about a scriptwriter has a very sweet but unimaginable scenario. From the moment on you have a pretty good idea about what is going to happen. Making the 2,5 hours a long sit. <br />Guy is wanted for communist sympathies - gets amnesia - ends up in a town where they think he is someone else - they find out - he goes back but understands that life is better there than in 1950s LA.<br />The end is even a little too moralizing: The Constitution is open for every belief, even communism!! <br />The acting is however fine, Jim Carrey shows again he is a lot more than the Mask and he almost reaches the standard he set for himself in the superb 'Truman Show', Martin Landau is sweet as his 'father'.<br />The settings of the movie are great, the feeling of the 1950 is perfectly shown. The warm cosiness of a small town glows from the screen and the setting of the movietheater is great.<br />Too bad it's so incredibly predictable.
B000065U1N|5.0|I recently bought the DVD for this movie and I have to say that I'm blown away by the movie about the operation to capture Adid in Mogadishu, Somalia in October '93. This movie is very accurate in showing the realities of combat and I think that this is a movie that will really convey to people what it's like to fight and die not only for their country, but for each other.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know about what it's like in the heat of combat and the courage and fortitude of our soliders.
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee has a voice like an angel, which is a rare thing these days in the mainstream music indusrtry. As a debut album, Evanesence released excellent material. With their original, spiritual lyrics combined with their energetic sound, Evanescence creates their own genre of music. Cuts such as &quot;My Immortal,&quot; &quot;Hello,&quot; and &quot;Imaginary&quot; display's Lee's wide vocal range while cuts such as &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;Torinquet,&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; demonstrate the band's heavy metal inspired energy. The band is not overrated, just original and full of talent. It's something different, so go buy it.
0671449028|5.0|Our son has loved this book from when he was 6 months to now, at 14 months.  The story is very loosely based on a Biblical tale (didn't anyone get the Ark reference?) and simply describes what every child can do before bed, brushing teeth, getting changed, a little play, and bedtime.  In addition, we tell the story in two languages and ask him to point out certain animals or to make a teeth brushing motion, which he does with increased accuracy.  I recommend it to all the families in my mother's group!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Talent and energy are the words to describe Avril Lavigne's music. In her sophomore effort, she lets her talent as a singer and a songwriter shine. Her talent as a singer/songwriter, instrument playing, creativity and originality are all reflected in this album. This time, her material shows more maturity, such as songs like &quot;nobody's home&quot; and &quot;together,&quot; while maintaining the fun, upbeat tempo of her previous album in songs such as &quot;he wasn't.&quot; I listen to it all the time, so you should too.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|It is nice to find a band that releases a cd that you want to listen to the whole album (besides white stripes). All the song have that hypnotic slightly scottish rock that make F.F. a really good band. The highlights of the c d however are Take me out, Dark of the matinee, and Jaqueline. One of the best c d's of the year.
B000002LGQ|5.0|A favorite of Madonna fans, Like A Prayer is arguably Madonna at her very best.  So many factors contribute to this rather grand statement, least of which is the music.  <br />It's interesting to look at this album in retrospect.  It was an interesting period for Madonna.  In many ways, this was the last time we would see the Madonna that so many people fell in love with during her pop reign of the 80's.  While the album contains several songs that are so associated with the material girl, only Like A Prayer was a number one single.  Express Yourself, Cherish, Oh Father and Keep it Together were all released as singles and yet all failed to reach the top spot.  Not that number one singles make a great album, but most of these songs have gained popularity over time.  And yet this could still be called Madonna's greatest album.  The writing was, for the first time, confessional and personal.  The lyrics and melodies were more mature (\\"Oh Father\\" is one of the best Madonna songs of all time).  It was still a patchwork of styles and sound, a trait of all Madonna's albums.  Keep in mind where Madonna mania was at this point.  She had recently split with Sean Penn, finished filming Dick Tracy, preping her monstrous Blonde Ambition tour, and cementing her place as a pop culture icon.  Controversey came center stage before this album was even released.  The Pepsi deal and the video exploded on the eve of the albums release.  Thsi was by far the biggest controversey in Madonna's career thus far.  Though it all seems rather silly now, it was all the talk in the Spring of '89.  This was the height of Madonna's career. Erotica and the Sex book were just around the corner, a turning point that really determined who her fans were.  Her celebrity would take on a different persona after The Immacculate Collection beautifully summed her 80's image.<br />So does all of this add up to the best Madonna album of all time?  Hard to say.  It is definitely my favorite Madonna album.  But if you look at Madonna's musical career as a whole, it is obvious that this was the soundtrack to Madonna turning from pop star celebrity to icon.
B00003CXBK|4.0|The reviews for this typical Miyazaki blockbuster are so rabidly of the WOW mentality that you may expect something mind-blowing. 'Manage your expectations and enjoy the bloody ride' is my advice.<br />In terms of sheer execution this is one of the best anime capers you'll see, replete with beasts of mythic proportions, lush forests, sparkling waterfalls, and some mind-numbing inter-galactic slaughter. I could wager in a blink that this is what inspired Tarantino to do that little anime insert in Kill Bill Vol 1.<br />Plus, the film has some swank credentials under its belt: the Japanese voices are dubbed, not just subtitled, by big *American* stars -- Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Bill Crudup, etc -- who lend their laryx to a host of universally relevant issues such as the plight of indigenous people and nature in the face of unchecked business interests, the death of spirituality in the name of social progress, misogyny in its many variations, etc.<br />But I have my gripes. The film is violent. Very violent. Sometimes senselessly violent. I had to frequently turn my volume knob to the left. There are gigantic guns, and blood and guts splatter the landscape every minute. Most of this soon seems overdrawn (and the film is looooong) with all this supposedly cool action amounting to precious little in terms of any clear message about good versus evil. The underlying purpose is summed up brilliantly by a roadside beggar when he says something like the world is cursed, but we still find a reason to live.<br />I also found something lacking in the animation itself. While exquisitely vivid it seems to lag in its flair for capturing natural motion. Disney or Pixar movies  pore over a sense of suppleness when an eye is raised or a muscle is twitched by a character. Miyazaki's animators on the other hand haven't penetrated beyond the skin, the moving creatures feel inarticulate and jerky, particularly when played against the very 2D painted backgrounds.<br />But that still doesn't stop me from recommending this powerful cult flick, a must if you're an anime acolyte. If not, then be prepared for a Tarantino x 100 and you'll do fine.r />But that still doesn't stop me from recommending this powerful cult flick, a must if you're an anime acolyte.

0380789035|4.0|This book is a delight to read.  The story never drags and the reader is pulled into the story.  The main character, Shadow, is released from prison only to find out his wife was killed in a car accident just before his release and not only that she was killed with her lover who was Shadow's close friend.  After his release, Shadow meets Mr. Wednesday who is actually the old God Odin.  As the story progresses, the reader is informed that the old gods such as Odin and other gods from the various panthoen of religions are going to war with the new gods in America such as Media and Internet.  Shadow is caught between the warring factions.  The rest of the story is the gods planning the war and Shadow trying to figure out what is really happening to the gods.<br />This is a hard book to put down.  The character development is well defined and the plot never drags even though it is a rather lengthy book.  &quot;American Gods&quot; is full of twists and turns and the ending is not what I was expecting which is a joy.  Recommended.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Ok, if Nightwish are so bad and unoriginal name us a few metal bands that are good.  I know the guitar riffs on Once are not totally original and new, but that's not the point.  The guitars aren't the focus of the band, but it's the band as a whole.  If you want some blazing guitar (...) up and down the fretboard or a three chord punk band go elsewhere.  I do admit to like Tarja's vocal style might be an acquired taste. I really think though Nightwish are unique in the metal world.  I have over 700 cd's of metal from the early 80's to now and can't think of really any female fronted metal band that are at this level(maybe though Within Temptation or The Gathering for example).  <br />So, if you don't like Nightwish just ignore them and the reviews...  By the way, I'm not a teenager like the last reviewer says I might be.  I'm pushing thirty buddy and I'm a musician.  Nu-Metal and bubble-gum punk is intended for the younger generation, OK.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I bet all these brainless negative reviews were submitted by the same person (from Scotland, Queens, and Zambia, heh).  I can understand why some people would be unhappy with this album, since it has a different sound from their first three discs, but posting a parody track listing is pretty immature.  Moving on...<br />A friend to whom I recommended Nightwish describes each song of theirs as a soundtrack to a great movie that hasn't yet been made.  I totally agree with this because Nightwish is SO amazingly superior to most garbage played on U.S. TV and radio stations.  Also, like previous reviewers have said, if you're new to Nightwish, I'd suggest that you begin with Oceanborn or Wishmaster instead of this album.  Once is like a souped-up version of Century Child, showing off great melodies and orchestration, but it's a mix of various styles that doesn't really show off the power-metal-album attributes introduced in Oceanborn.  Once is still great, though, since with these new styles, they've shown that they can step away from traditional power metal and expand their creativity.  I will forever be a Nightwish fan.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Hey, listen for just one minute. Why are you guys all arguing over these reviews?? <br />Ok from the beginning...I'm at University in Glasgow (the city where FF are from) and have seen these boys live twice. I have also met them and got my album signed( all really nice guys). I think this gives me the authority to tell you...buy this album! <br />Don't compare them to anyone, they're unique with their catchy riffs and witty lyrics. Not too heavy, just really catchy. Just enjoy the experience, there's not a poor song on here. Definitely one of those albums you can play the whole way through without skipping tracks.<br />(Ps Franz Ferdinand is someone's name. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was asassinated 28th June 1914 in Sarejavo, Bosnia. Undoubtedly one of the factors fuelling the beginning of World War 1. So there you go!)

B0001LJC2K|5.0|All the comparasons with Radiohead are justified BUT I love Muse but HATE Radiohead. <br />Undoubtedly one of Britain's finest bands right now, Muse have immense talent. Fronted by Matt Bellamy, the man with the ability to capture listeners with his amazing voice and guitar playing. Unbelivable song-writer too, because he conveys so much passion in what he does. They're one of the best live performers and command the audience effortlessly. This is a little surprising considering there's only three of them!<br />Contuary to what other people are saying, Muse are not copying anyone. There is nobody around at the moment like them. Can be a little depressing but that never stopped musicians before. <br />&quot;Showbiz&quot; and &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; are superior to this newer album, in my opinion. Check them out.<br />If you can play guitar, try some of those riffs and I defy you to master them quickly!
B00000JZI9|1.0|This movie was one of the longest and boring I have ever seen. The movie suck since the begginig to the end.  It had nasty music that did not go with it and ugly people that talk funny. One of the things that suck  the most was the way they act, what I mean about that is when they died it look so fake, not even blood came out and they look like they wher playing with 5 year old little kids. One of the other things that I did not like was the clothes. I know that they have to be western but in other movies they look beter than in this movie \\"Silverado\\". So if I was you dont by this dumb movie
0440418569|1.0|I'm sorry to say that Pullman's main achievement in this last book is to create yet another soppy paean to adolescence.  I was really disappointed in the weakness of the plot and characters.  Through most of the book, Pullman is crudely trying to jerk the reader's emotions around... Oh, the sadness!  Oh, the joy!  Oh, the tragedy!  It's all surprisingly amateur, simplistic, and it doesn't work.  At least not for an adult reader.  But I couldn't like this kind of sci-fi hackery even when I was an adolescent myself.  Oh Asimov, Tolkien, where are thou???
B0001MDP3G|5.0|The film version of Cold Mountain is absolutely breathtaking. I did not read the book so I can't make a comparison. Standing alone this movie is so good it hurts. A story of war and loss. It is also a story of transformation. Ada is a rich girl with everything until civil war comes and all the men go to join it, including Inman, the fellow that Ada has set her eyes on. Their fleeting romance becomes a lifeline for them both. The cinematography is breathtaking and the direction flawless in my opinion. This one of the few times I feel that a movie actually lives up to its hype. I loved it, although I did cry quite a bit. I highly recommend it!
B000148KK2|3.0|The thing keeps trying to get me to sign up for a fan club.  Yes, I know you can get around the thing, but should I have to fight it every time.  No, I should be able to pop the CD into my machine and listen.
B00000JZI9|3.0|i thought that the movie ''silverado'' was an alright movie. it had all of the good qualities for a good movie. it had good camera work, action, suspense, and just the right actors to play the characters. it was really tight how the four main characters met. you can tell from all the foreshadowing that they were gonna end up being friends. the soundtrack of the movie definetly made the movie a little bit better. what makes this a unique movie is the suspicion. i never expected the bad guy to be ending up as the bad guy.the quotes that i liked the most were ''this used to be a peaceful town'' and ''LETS GETEM!!!!'' i think that the movie could have been better if Emmet dies.that would have made the movie more dramatic.i would definetly recommend this movie to a person who loves western and action movies.

I wanna get up and jive, i wanna wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive. do you want, do you want, do you want to dance with me baby? do you wanna take a chance in maybe finding some sweet romance with me...?'<br />With the occasional accompaniment from James Taylor and Stephen Stills, this album is worth much more than it's priced.<BR>And as always, the mixture of Joni's voice, her beautiful piano playing, and her amazing lyrics are pure proof <BR>that she is a true uninhibited musician... and she's still going strong.
B000009PNY|4.0|The only song on this compilation that sends shivers up me spine is Rammstein's version of \\"Stripped\\".  It is powerful, lovely, strange, and glorious.  It manifests the terror that I've always felt the original song merely implied.  DM are a band replete with smoldering intensities.  Their agonies are subtle and exquisite in their subtlty.  Rammstein turns what seemed like a mere suggestion into a demand backed with the threat of real punishment.<br />Locust take the opposite approach on \\"Master and Servant\\" and come up with similar results.  I've never been able to take the original vary seriously.  It has always possessed a high camp value for me mostly because I've seen Martin in his chainmail. The song threatens something sinister and exciting but it never comes off for me.  Now Locust turns a silly song into a wondeful lounge piece replete with alternating vocals between a male and female voice.  The result is jarring and far more subversive than the original.  Again, DM pose the threat.  This is the promise.<br />The Cure turn \\"World in my Eyes\\" into a strange middle-eastern number.  As usual, Robert's inflections are sublime.  I get closer to swooning every time I hear it.  It is starting to have a similar effect on me to the Rammstein track.<br />Monster Magnet articulate the rage that is implied in \\"Black Celebration\\".  They also brings forth a tasty dose of machismo with the Phil Lynott/Thin Lizzy vocals that build in intensity over the course of the track. It is heavy, sexy and very direct. Somehow, I imagine that their \\"Black Celebration\\" is going to involve debilitating alcohol abuse and varioius criminal activities. The original made me wish desperately for a black mass held in the forest. Monster Magnet doesn't get that, but they've at least got naked sororiety sisters dancing about a fire and that is good enough.<br />The Deftones shoud have amended the title of their track to \\"To Have and to Hold (under the water).  It is dark, supremely spooky and perfect for those long jaunts alone into the woods. It reminds me of Tool somewhat, and Metallica, oddly enough.<br />Of the rest of the bands, I like Gus Gus and the Smashing Pumpkins a bit.  Dishwalla is alright but becomes less the more I hear it. The only tracks that are completely reprehensible are by Varuca Salt, Apollo 440, and Self.  Skip those every time.<br />Overall, this compilation features tracks by several bands not intent on just copying the master.

B00005JMEW|4.0|The reason why I liked this movie is there is alot of killing and people fighting and stuff. Plus there was alot of violence. But there is alot  of blood gushing scenes in this movie. And them in some parts of the movie they even had to make it black and white,then one of the funniest parts was when there was one more guy to kill left and her was like 16 years old and she turned him around and started  to spank  with the sword. Then there was one more person left and she was the boss so she was gonna be hard to fight .I really liked this movie,and I recomend this movie for everybody.
B0001I55NS|1.0|This one wins my vote for the worst movie of the year with clichs galore, a thin, predictable, and unbelievable plot, bad dialogue, and inaccurate historical facts.  It's not even mildly entertaining; however it is nauseating in its cheesiness.  As I watched the movie, I wished that either the French or the English would kill off all of the time traveling main characters so that the story would end. Needless to say, I couldn't sit through the whole thing. In short, don't waste your money on this one.  If you must see it, rent it first.
0060507772|5.0|Unlike some of the more recent Discworld novels, which have been a bit on the sombre side for my taste, this one is pure, delightful comedy.  Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde are heading for Cori Celeste, home of the gods, with an explosive device, with which they intend to blow up the gods and themselves, going out in a blaze of glory.  En route they kidnap an unwilling mistrel and take him with them, determined he shall write the saga of their glorious end, whether he likes it or not.  They are also joined by their old friend Harry, an Evil Dark Lord who has fallen on hard times, and Mrs McGarry, a woman warrior who is now a grandmother.  One of the funniest bits is where they are discussing what has become  some of their old foes.  Pamdar the Witch Queen, according to Cohen &quot;runs a shop now.  Pam's Pantry.  Makes marmalade.&quot;  &quot;What? She used to queen it on a throne on top of a pile of skulls!&quot;  &quot;I didn't say it was very GOOD marmalade.&quot;  Meanwhile Lord Vetinari is determined to stop the Silver Horde blowing up the gods and possibly destroying the entire Discworld.  He gets eccentric inventor Leonardo of Quirm to make a flying machine, powered by dragons, and sends an expedition consisting of Leonardo, Carrot, and a reluctant Rincewind, to try and stop Cohen &amp; Co. (the Librarian goes along as a stowaway).Vetinari instructs Carrot to stop Cohen by any means possible. &quot;Force is always the last resort, sir&quot; says Carrot.  &quot;I believe that for Cohen it's the first choice&quot; says Vetinari. &quot;He's not too bad if you don't come up behind him suddenly&quot; says Ricnewind.  Up in space, Carrot waxes sentimental looking at the Discworld &quot;From up here you can't see the boundaries between nations&quot; he says wistfully.  Leonardo and Rincewind, misunderstanding his point, immediately start thinking of ways this drawback could be remedied, like painting the boundaries in bright colours, growing forests in theshape of names of countries etc.  Cohen and the Horde decide to get themselves into Cori Celeste by disguising themselves as gods, the god of fish, the god of stuff, the god of being sick etc.  Once inside, they encounter some familiar deities like Blind Io, Offler the Crocodile God, and of course the Lady.  They also meet some lesser-known ones like Nuggin, a horrid little god whose followers are forbidden garlic, ginger, mushrooms, and worst, of all, chocolate. Can Carrot get there in time to stop Cohen blowing everyone up?  Read this deliciously funny book and find out.  It's a wonderful story, and is illustrated throughout with the most beautiful pictures by Paul Kidby.
B00000JZI9|3.0|this old fashion western  movie &quot;Silverado&quot; was extremly exciting with lot's of action. If you a kind of person like me who likes movies with action and adventure, this moving is the right one for  you. This movie has everything anyone wants . &quot;Silverado&quot;has comedy, action , and adventure . this movie is wonderful, it makes you feel like you are the one in the movie. telling you ,you must watch it!!!<BR>what  makes movie good is making it seem real and Silverado  has done it . Also that it has to be exciting and this movie has done it .<BR>&quot;Silverado&quot;   was great you should watch it.<BR>also the sound track was off the hook  it went along with every scene that had a  sound track in it.<BR>this western movie was different  compared to  other  western movies because this one wasn't confusing or boring. I think the soundtrack was awsome.<BR>I think that the little extra sences helped me understand  the movie more.I recommend this movie to anyone and   everyone, even to people who don't like westerns  because I hated westerns too.
1400032717|5.0|If you know someone with APDD, then you will likely recognize many of Christopher's behaviours.  The author seems to understand the autistic mind and delivers, to the reader, a very realistic and believable account of a young, autistic boy's daily thoughts/rituals and the consequences he endures when his routines are disrupted.  A wonderful read.
B00005ASHM|4.0|First of all, I would like to preface that I am a big fan of this record, and to this day am absolutely blown away by Brian Wilson's innovative production and profound songwriting. The music is wonderful, no band ever did harmonies better than the Beach Boys. The gulf between their early &quot;fun in the sun&quot; recordings and this masterpiece is a wide, deep chasm.<br />I will not dwell on the technical merits of this album, although there are many, and will only pinpoint a few songs. &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; is a powerful, instantly addictive album opener, &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&quot; is a dreamy piece with exceptionally moving and beautiful lyrics. And &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is, well...enough said - the subtle instrumental layers behind the chorus tantalize the listener until the harmonies kick in at the end in a marvelous climax.<br />What is disturbing to me is this strange glorification of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as the BEST album of all time. It all apparently stems from this major competition between the Beatles and the Beach Boys in the mid-60s. Still, I find it absurd and close to infuriating when the Amazon reviewer dares to characterize &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as &quot;missing the mark.&quot; Since when do bands make records to please music pundits' dogmatic characterizations? Should we judge every album based on how close it comes to the &quot;perfection&quot; of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;? Of course not.<br />The main reason why I think &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; can never be the greatest album of all time is that both Brian Wilson and the staunch defenders of the album continue to reference the Beatles. Always, even six or seven times in the liner notes, it's all about how they are better than or inspired by the Beatles, even a lengthy quote by Paul McCartney extolling the virtues of &quot;Pet Sounds.&quot; The reason is simply a deep insecurity about the title of &quot;greatest album of all time.&quot; Greatest albums stand on their own, and do not justify their greatness by constantly comparing it to albums of a rival band. It is strange and a bit silly.<br />And since I know I will get many votes by offended Beach Boys fans and reactionary anti-Beatles, might I take this chance to offer my choice for the best album of all time, the one that escaped the loop of competition between Wilson and McCartney. The story goes like this: &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; inspires Wilson to do &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; which in turn inspires McCartney to suggest &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.&quot; In the meantime, outside of all this madness, the Beatles made THE recording of history, &quot;Revolver,&quot; which in terms of musicianship, variety, experimentation, lyrics, and especially production beats any album from any generation and any popular music style.<br />As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, I love &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; but I simply find the intense determination  by its loyal devotees to have it crowned a subjective and irrelevant title to be slightly paranoid and certainly very much overdone.on their own, and do not justify their greatness by constantly comparing it to albums of a rival band.

B00005QDW1|1.0|I will not dwell much on &quot;Rock Steady,&quot; simply because such a throw-away piece of trash does not merit too much of my consideration or time. I loved No Doubt ever since I heard &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; a beautiful song which I still fondly play. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was a unique album that I likewise love, and I have a better opinion of &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; than most - Gwen's solo songwriting effort (&quot;Simple Kind Of Life&quot;) is one of the best songs the band ever put out. No Doubt will always be for me the talented and raw ska band who once made it big with a great album.<br />Fast-forward to the present. Unlike most negative reviewers here, I still love Gwen Stefani, and didn't mind her collaborations with Moby and Eve in the summer of 2001. They were insignificant side projects, not too bad for what they are.<br />But &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is a disaster. I will give a pass to &quot;Running&quot; and &quot;Underneath It All,&quot; they're quite nice slow songs, I might even say I like them a lot.<br />But the title track and the abysmally named &quot;Hella Good&quot; (more aptly titled &quot;The Death Of Songwriting&quot;), to pick on the easiest targets in terms of airplay, are musical crimes. The lot of it is mindless, repetitive, and unforgiveably bland garbage, which will be dumped soon enough in favor of the next easily consumable and nicely packaged mass entertainment (I would not dare call it music or art).<br />While some may be tempted to get up and dance by &quot;Rock Steady,&quot; I am tempted to lie down and cry.<br />P.S. No Doubt's new single &quot;It's My Life&quot; is surprisingly good (I still like this band, I cannot help it), and will hopefully foreshadow a departure far, far away from the dark, gaping hole that is &quot;Rock Steady.&quot;

From Stinkfest to Third eye Theres not one song I dont like. Its lyircally a masterpiece. The music is so origanal. Something no rip off bands like Ear Shot will ever come close to. Tool have made place in music history.

B00000JZI9|5.0|When  I  heard  I  was  going  to  watch  a  western  I  thought  I  was  not  going  to  like  it. I  did  not  think  I  was  going  to  like  the  movie  because  I  mostly  like  futureristic  movies.  Everytime  I  finish  watching  a  movie  I  always  think  to  myself  `` What  makes  this  a  good  movie ?``. I  say  action and  drama  is  what  makes  a  good  movie. This  western  has  all  of  that  and  more.  <BR>What  I  thought  made  this  movie  ``Silverado``  a  typical  western  is  that  it  has  gunfights, bar fights, bank robbers, hostages, and  showdowns. This  movie  was  very  exciting. I  liked  the  soundtrack  very  much. I  believe  that  the  little  scenes  help  the  viewers  figure  out  whats  happenning. I  would  say  this  movie  is  one  of  the  best  I  have  ever  seen. If  I  would  recommend  this  movie  I  would  to  everyone  I  know.
B00000JZI9|2.0|This movie was an ok movie. It was good at some parts but at others it was realy boring. The begging was realy godd and it was drawing me into da movie but like 30 minutes into it it was really having to much talking but at the last 10 minutes was realy good again. I have 2 admit this movie is realy diffrent from the modern movies i watch evry friday. It is diffrent in a bad way it was to long, it has to much talking , and has a story line dat changes evry 15 minutes. It was a good story if u get da main picture of da whole movie , wich most teenagers like me dont , the things the same about this movie like the movies i watch , would have to be the gun fights, hot chicks and all the vilence. This movie is a typical western do to its shootouts, gunfights, saloons, horses, and cowboys. The peaple who made this movie made a mistake by making it to predictable because from evry scene you watch you know whats gona happen in the next scene. The little scenes kill the movies in some ways but help it in many others. Like it makes the movie to long but it links all the main stories together. if there is one quote i would remember it would be &quot; give me a shot of the good stuff &quot;. if u watch da movie youll get it eaven though i dont recomend you to. If you realy want to watch it buy it if u dont realy want to trust me dont buy it. i give this movie 2 stars thanks for reading my review. = )
B00005JMEW|5.0|I have to admit, Quentin Tarantino is something of an acquired taste. I loved this film, as I have nearly all his stuff. My wife hated it -- as she has nearly all his stuff. Tarantino grew up on Hong Kong kung fu flicks and _Kill Bill_ is filled with homages, from the name of Sonny Chiba's character (&quot;Hattori Hanzo,&quot; taken directly from the old &quot;Shadow Warriors&quot; television series), to Uma Thurman's Bruce-Lee-style yellow jumpsuit, to the Kato-style masks the Crazy-88 gang wears, to the galloping theme music that accompanies nearly every fight scene. The plot is simplicity itself: The Bride (Uma Thurman) was left for dead when all the rest of her wedding party was killed by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and now the Bride -- a top assassin herself -- is taking revenge, one enemy at a time. And it's taking her four hours to do it, hence the two parts of the film. Lucy Liu is terrific as O'Ren Ishii, head of the Tokyo yakuza, and Vivica Fox does a good job as the first bad guy to die. I'm not sure I care for Julie Dreyfus as Sofie Fatale (or what's left of her) and Darryl Hannah apparently hasn't aged well at all. But Chiaki Kuriyama is (you should pardon the expressioin) a kick as the killer in a schoolgirl uniform -- a direct reference to Japanese manga tastes. Even if this crazed film isn't entirely to *your* taste, you'll have to admit -- Tarantino's movies may not always make good coherent sense, but he does *great* scenes!
B0001HAHXW|4.0|I LIVE IN HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA. I DROVE 18 HOURS TO TORONTO AND 18 HOURS BACK HOME AGAIN IN ORDER TO SEE ONE OF MY HEROES, ERIC CLAPTON PERFORM LIVE. THE MAN DID NOT DISAPPOINT. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER SEEN HIM LIVE. I HAD TRIED 2 OTHER TIMES WHEN HE WAS IN CANADA IN THE LAST 8 YEARS TO GET TICKETS TO SEE HIM BUT ON EACH OCCASSION, I FOUND OUT TOO LATE AND COULD NOT GET ANY TICKETS. THIS TIME, I WAS LUCKY. THE LIVE ERIC CLAPTON PROVIDES SPARK AND ENERGY THAT IS MISSING FROM THE STUDIO RECORDINGS OF &quot;ME AND MR. JOHNSON&quot;. I TOO, THINK THAT, FOR THE RAW AND ORIGINAL BLUES PURITY OF THESE SONGS THEY ARE BEST HEARD PLAYED BY MR. JOHNSON HIMSELF. BUT, NEXT TO THAT, GIVE ME ERIC ANY DAY. AND WOULD I DRIVE THE 18 HOURS TO SEE HIM AGAIN, YOU BET. IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY WE SPENT GETTING THERE AND BACK HOME AGAIN. I'M A CHRISTIAN AND CAN'T QUITE BRING MYSELF TO CALLING HIM A GOD, BUT HE'S CERTAINLY AN ANGEL.
B00006RJHG|3.0|not the best slasher flick ever made, not the worst either.<br /> i won't go over the plot here (it's already been covered by others) but it involves an obscene phone caller (to a serority house) doing lots of heavy breathing and making threats, etc. they could have toned down on the breathing some, etc. <BR>flick contains a few surprises; a nice spooky, atmospheric touch here and there. <BR>i wouldn't call it a classic, but not a bad scare flick at all. however, a director with a genuine interest in horror would have had the ability to punch up the gruesome jolts a bit (not necessarily by including more blood, either. see the first tcm, for example) and given the fans more bang for their buck.
1594200106|5.0|I just finished reading this wonderful, beautiful book and I had to sit down and share my feelings about it, so anyone thinking of reading this book won't wait.<br />I won't go into the details of the story, since that is already done in the Amazon description. I will tell you that The Shadow of the Wind is one of the best books I have ever read. I read a lot of books, sometimes 2 to 3 a week, so when I say it is one of the best I have ever read, it is really saying something. I had already told someone they could borrow it when I was finished, now I am sitting here trying to figure out how to back out of that promise, I don't want it leaving my hands!!!<br />So do what I did, read this book quickly because once you start, you will have no choice. Then go back and start over, read it slowly and enjoy the writing, the story and the total experience. Bravo Mr. Carlos Ruiz Zafon.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|This is a question I've been asking myself since the demise of Blind Faith. Where is the hot-riffed kid I saw on stage at the Filmore East when I was far too young to get in who blew me away with riffs that - to this day - no one has been able to match? The solos in Crossroads are some of the very best in rock history. So I go back to my original question. Who is Clapton? A guy who died 30 years ago with the old gang, including Winwood, Bruce, Baker, Mayal and the rest of the late 60's greats? Where did that unbelievably inspired young guitarist who set the world on fire go? To this day, I have never quite understood his path, with the the exception that heroine was kicked...along with the riffs. This tribute album is yet another in a series of attempts to recapture the essence of a past that continues to eluded him.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The relative difficulty of writing tragedy or comedy has long been debated among dramatists. Sofia Coppola here takes the unusual step of combining the two through Bill Murray.  Famed for his comedy roles, in this film his ability to convey subdued emotions resulting in a poignant story suffused with ironies.  He's an actor brought to Tokyo to make adverts for Suntory whiskey.  The shooting of the advert, a high point in the film, gives Murray full opportunity to express feelings.  Photo sessions, however, don't occupy much time.  With days of lonely leisure time confronting him, Tokyo's hectic scene leads him to find solace in the hotel bar.  There, he encounters a young blonde woman.<br /><br />We've [indirectly] already met her.  Coppola vividly sets the tone of this film - loneliness - with the opening scene.  A girl's anonymous figure might suggest romance or even something erotic.  Her slow movements, however, convey a mood of solitude, strongly reinforced the next time we see her.  Scarlett Johansson plays a young wife in a strange land, her photographer husband on an assignment.  Johansson, clearly young enough to be Murray's daughter, captures his attention across the bar.  What follows should be entirely predictable, but Coppola's abilities prevent her falling into such a trap.<br /><br />Over the ensuing days, Murray and Johansson develop a liaison - of sorts.  Johansson is clearly dissatisfied with her situation.  A recent philosophy graduate, she has no view of her future. Several wordless scenes of her wandering in Tokyo set her role flawlessly - a wedding in a Buddhist temple is superbly portrayed.  Johansson wanders, almost aimlessly, her growing despair palpable.  She is seeking something greater than what she has, but is Murray the answer?  She's carefully restrained in her dealings with the urbane actor.  She attracts him without leading him on nor promising anything.  The tension in this relationship builds superbly under Coppola's deft touch.  There is nothing formula in her use of close-ups and with Murray and Johansson, she's able to convey mood with deceptively minimal views.<br /><br />Coppola provides an intensely human drama in this superbly photographed story.  In moving the setting to Tokyo, she declares her independence from the grim stereotype of \\"romantic comedy\\" almost universally set in New York City.  Her story [Coppola both wrote and directed this gem] is even more mould-breaking.  Dialogue is minimised as Coppola uses Murray's expressiveness and Johansson's pensive beauty to define the story.  This approach is far from superficial in her hands.  With no doubt attraction is building throughout the story, we  wonder 'is it love?'.  Both married, both alone - in the hands of an inept director or vapid script, every scene would be predictable.  Here, however, surprises abound, none as cataclysmic as the conclusion.

B00006CXXU|5.0|What? The album \\"In The Zone\\" by Britney Spears is NOT better than \\"Stripped\\" by Christina Aguilera is, but since I am not reviewing \\"In The Zone\\", but I'm reviewing \\"Stripped\\", I won't compare the two albums. I just had to post this title and this review because only a loon could recommend such a meaningless and nastily sexual album like \\"In The Zone\\" instead of a soulful and beautiful album like \\"Stripped.\\" I can't believe that there are still people out there that IN MY OPINION don't really know what real music is... such a shame.<br />Stripped is a great album. Unlike Britney Spears' successful attempt to write a musical biography of her life, Christina truly shone when she did that. I will explain my interpretation of this wondrous album track by track. Read and you'll understand why I say that Christina's album really has a motto to real life behind every track. She is saying something meaninful, unlike Ms. Spears.<br />Stripped Part 1 - This track is as short as it is amazing. Christina's firing back at all of her critics with true evil and carelessness. She could care less what they think about this interlude. She is talking about how everyone tries to defy her uniqueness and talent by criticizing her harshly. The line, \\"Sorry you can't defy me,\\" has a hidden message to it. To me, it means, \\"You can't change me by saying horrible things about me because you don't like my repertoire and my style, so if that's what you're trying to do, you're failing!\\" big laugh. \\"You are trying to defy me, but you can't.\\"<br />2) Can't Hold Us Down - this song talks harshly about the double-standards of society when it comes to the sexuality of human men and women, and how men are glorified for sleeping with several women simultaneously and women are judged and considered \\"[prostitutes]\\" if they do it, too, and how unfair she and Li'l Kim feel that this is. \\"[prostitute]\\" is too big of a term to use for a promiscous woman. Read the Bible if you're Christian, THOROUGLY, and you'll understand why I'm saying that this word is so harsh. Discover the meaning of that little five-letter word. Its true meaning from the Biblical point of view will horrify you, and that's for sure. I disagree with Christina when it comes to the 'sexual liberation for women', but I agree with her demanding men not to call women 'whores'. it's a truly abhorrent name.<br />3) Walk Away - this song talks graphically on a casual relationship that was formed for fun, just like a \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" kind of relationship, but when she fell in love with this sicko, it all went wrong and turned from fun to despicably horrible.<br />4) Fighter - Christina firing back at her ex. She's very angry.<br />5) Primer Amor Interlude - Christina, it's nice for you to do this in Spanish, but why didn't you re-release this track in Spanish and then record this in the beginning of it? Latinos understand what you're saying, but most Anglo-Saxons don't.<br />6) Infatuation - Great song. I have listened to it about 5,000 times since I got the CD back in Oct. 17, 2002. Fabulosa canci?n, Christina.<br />7) Loving Embrace Interlude - Two words... how sweet!<br />8) Loving Me 4 Me - Christina, you are soooooooo lucky! I wish I had a man that would love me for me no matter what.<br />9) Impossible - Chrissy, I feel your pain. I'm desperately in love with a man that's impposible to love. I've tried proving my love to him a million ways but he doesn't seem to care--what a fool I am!<br />10) Underappreciated - Great song, but I thank God that I haven't been through this.<br />11) Beautiful - Thank you, Christina! I used to think I was ugly and this song made me feel Beautiful!<br />12) Make Over - 'xtina_beautiful' - 'I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over' so don't waste your time tryin' sweetheart. Yeah, yeah, go to Xposed and cry your pain to everyone. You've put this upon yourself by fighting me in the boards. See if they'll listen. Yawn.<br />13) Cruz - beautiful. I used not to like itbut now I do, just a little bit--- just for the lyrics.<br />14) Soar - yes, Chris, I have soared and it feels so good! --- Is that the correct past tense of the verb????????<br />15) Get Mine, Get Yours - Great song, great beat, but I couldn't disagree more with the message it brings to all of your hardcore fans, Xtina.<br />16) Dirrty - how dirrtier can I be? Great song! I listen to it like it's just been released!<br />17) Stripped Part 2 - Great... whatever it's called, but I differ on one of those declarations verily. You guys figure it out. I won't explain myself here.<br />18) The Voice Within - I listen to the voice within me every time I start to cry desperately and it heals my pain. Thanks, Christina.<br />19) I'm ok - I am too, Christina. Word. Props.<br />20) Keep on singin' my song - yes, ma'am, please do! The world would be empty without your song, especially if Britney's around! There would be no point in listening to this music genre you guys convey.<br />beautiful_xtine aka DirrtyXtine in Xposed.

Man! i have to give the movie some prop's because for a western movie it was good. But, i still think the movie is alright. <BR>Even though this movie was good , i expected to see more comedy. The movie was funny, but i love to lough when i see movie's. Though the movie was alright i still think it was really good. &quot;Silverado&quot; was one of the best western movie i've seen.
B000006TRV|5.0|Defo one of my top 10 albums of all times. Beats Beatles - White Album as best double album. Also check out Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1981-82. Best live album ever aswell!!! Strongest tracks: Ermmm, all of them!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead have always created complex and exciting rock. OK Computer now defining the laws of rock and roll and giving us more complex melodies and structures. This is very fitting for Radiohead because they have always tried to push their songs just that little bit further. Its very different from Pablo Honey and The Bends. <BR>'Ok Computer' is packed with beautiful and melodic songs. Thom expressed himself that he tried to be a different person on every track, it shows. For example, the tortured torment he portrays on 'Climbing up the walls' is very different to the lulling 'No Surprises' - an instant classic.<BR>The whole album is very varied in styles but not in quality, as all tracks stand out as strong and intricate 'art-rock'. Any one of them could have been a single.<br />1) Airbag - Brilliant introduction into the album, the song that reveals the wonderful way in which 'an airbag saved my life'. Very strong and some brilliant phasering effects.<br />2) Paranoid Android - The best song i have heard for some time now. Radiohead melt art-rock, solemn acoustics and hard rock, all into 6 and a half minutes of pure genius. Definitely one of the best songs ever written.<br />3) Subterranean Homesick Alien - One of my favourite tracks on the album. A mixture of calming rhodes piano with mystifying guitar effects to give you the feeling you have really been abducted by aliens.  <br />4) Exit Music (For a film) - This song is played at the end credits of the film 'Romeo and Juliet'. Beautiful, almost baroque style. Strong, with haunting keyboard effects and a strong pulse until the end.<br />5) Let Down - A soft and wonderful mellow piece with the mention of squashing bugs and transport. Beautiful.<br />6) Karma Police - The trade mark 'the karma police will get you' track. A very Radiohead-like song. Brilliant hook-line, 'this is what you get, when you mess with us'.<br />7) Fitter Happier - A joke track Thom did on a Mac. Features the Macs monotone voice explaininga better way of life. Very funny.<br />8) Electioneering - Powerful political rock, a raging riff with furious guitars. One to play full blast!<br />9) Climbing up the Walls - Somewhat gothic and tortured as Thom's voice is distorted, which to me fits the song superbly. Strong yet elegant piece which includes some of Jonny's radio tuning at the beginning. <br />10) No Surprises - Swaying and lulling track, beautiful in every way. 'No alarms and no surprises please'<br />11) Lucky - Superb rock track with brilliant rhythmic guitar and a great riff by Jonny. Another of their classic songs. <br />12) The Tourist - Written by Jonny. A very slow tempo song with a beautiful melodic feel, almost the same feel you get from listening to No Surprises. Thom's vocals are persistent and continuously gorgeous.<br />THIS ALBUM IS A MUST FOR ANY MUSIC FAN. IF YOU ARE A RADIOHEAD FAN, YOU MUST OWN THIS ALBUM, THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT YOU HAVE THE LISTEN TO IT YOURSELF. 10/10
B0000024R8|1.0|I absolutely hate the cover for this album.  Hard to explain.  Bob has this look of a kid that I would wanna punch in the face for no reason at all.  I'd just see someone with that face walking down the street and walk to him and sucker him.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This is not happy ending kids, this is by far the most agonizing, frustrated, confused, and worst I've felt after viewing a film. That's why it's so brilliant. It makes no apologies, and doesn't cover up or sugar coat the reality of life. The performances are first-rate, top-notch hitters. Every actor involved gave the performace of their careers. Penn and Robbins earned their Oscars with the dept and truth they brought to their characters. Eastwood is a master at filmaking, and this is definitely a masterpiece. If you want a hard hitting, no prisoners drama, then this is absoultly your movie. I highly recommend this film and DVD.
0060239492|5.0|This even surpasses the Forg and Toad books, which every child must read.  As good as children's books get!
B0001I562I|5.0|This is one of the greatest family movies I have ever seen.  I saw it in the theatre in 1986 (twice).  I purchased the video as soon as it was released and will now purchase the DVD.  I'm so glad it is finally available.  If you are looking for a wonderful movie to watch with your family...this is the one to buy!
B00024BHTC|4.0|I've been a fan of Nightwish since my friend introduced me to them nearly 2 years ago, and I must say this is by far the best album I've heard of theirs thus far! Tarja's voice has never sounded quite so melodic, and coupled with a few awesome vocals from Marco, the vocals are unstoppable. Musically, the guitar has gotten harder, heavier, and faster. My only complaint about the album is that one or two tracks slow down the pace of the rest of the album (Creek Mary's Blood, Kuoleema Tekee Taitellijan), but they're still relatively good songs on the whole. This album is certainly worth buying, as most of it will be listened to over and over again.
B00000JZI9|5.0|Western aren't really my kind of movies. I usually like horror and comedies. However the movie &quot;Silverado&quot; might just have changed my mind, it might change yours if you don't like Westerns either. This movie contains everything you'd expect in a western. The classic scenes, cowboys in the deserts having shootouts to them just having a drink at the canteens. There is one thing uniqe about his movie though, it contains comedy, not a lot of westerns do. Maybe that's another reason why I like it so much. I gotta say, though, this movie wouldn't have been the same without the wonderful soundtrack it had.<BR>The soundtrack grabs your attention and delivers suspense chills at the right time. The soundtrack contributes the grasping feeling you get that keeps you in your seat waiting for more action, which never ends. You might think you're gonna know what's next, however that's not the case and the soundtrack contributes to that edge-gripping feeling you get as you're watching it.<BR>So in conclusion, what I'm saying is that &quot;Silverado&quot; has everything. From cowboys doing a shootout to them being in a bar just drinking. It takes place in the desert, surrounded by cactuses, the sun, and spectators watching the showdowns. What I'm saying is just watch the darn movie!
B00000JZI9|4.0|This is one of the frist western movie I ever saw. This movie is a good movie if you want to see people shooting each other and bruning houses. This movie has alot of shooting in it and people getting shot ever time in the movie. This movie would of been better if it had more action. The sound track had good timeing in the movie like when there were shooting the muisc came out and it sounded great.the sound track was cool in the movie. <BR>      Some of my favorite  parts of the movie is mostly the shooting. The movie would of been better if they had more shooting and less talking. It was hard to predict what was going to happen next.This was one of the great western movies I have ever seen.
B000002J27|5.0|This is one of the great recordings in the history of recorded music. If you don't enjoy this album you probably don't know what music is. The interplay between Tony Banks, Steve Hackett, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford is awesome. The songwriting is a cut above the Gabriel material in both mood and flow. Surely, this was a band with much to prove. They achieved their goal of stepping out of the shadow of a living legend. Curiously, the first Peter Gabriel album was also outstanding and can also be listened to twenty years after the fact. This album has not dated like much of the earlier recordings have. I would rate it a cut above Selling England by the Pound and enjoy it as much as the Steve Hackett Voyage album. If you want to buy the best of this bunch I suggest: This cd, the Steve Hackett Voyage disk, Selling England, and the second Gabriel disk. Buy the remastered version, you will hear things that are not on the original release. Amazing Stuff!!!!
B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|First the negatives: I don't really understand the concept of Marbles and the brief songs of Marbles I, II, III don't do anything for me, but perhaps I haven't looked close enough at the lyric book in the incredible box-set type packaging of the two disc the Campaign Edition. The Marbles album available now may be more stripped down with respect to the tracks.<br />POsitives: This album sounds great. The production takes you to &quot;that fantastic place&quot; of Marillion sonic art. Each songs is unique. This album (2 cd version) seems a little too abstract upon first listen; however each song grew on me. Now it's always in my car CD changer. Ian Mosley does some interesting drumming on the slow and catchy &quot;Only Unforgettable Thing&quot;. Vocalist Hogarth displays his still incredible vocal ability/ vibrato and at times also shows a Radiohead influence. Classic expressive Rothery guitar can be heard here, but Trewavas'(underrated bassist) is appropriately subdued for this music, while Kelley's  again juggling lots of keyboard sounds. &quot;Don't Hurt Yourself&quot; and &quot;You're Gone&quot; are enjoyable on first listen, However I appreciate more the strange timing of &quot;Drilling Holes&quot; and the climax of &quot;Neverland&quot;. This album doesn't rock however it is dramatic nonetheless.  It's a masterpiece. I recommend it to fans of Radiohead who aren't familiar with Marillion. OK, next album I want to here them rock.
B00000JZI9|5.0|This movie is cool because I don't even like western movies but I really like this one. This movie has alot of action and that is what I like to see in a movie. I also really liked it because every where the good guys go or bad guys they start shooting. So if you really like action or western movies I really I mean really recommend this movie because after I watch that movie I started to talk like them such as &quot;This used to be a peaceful town.&quot;So I recommend this movie to everyone.
B000059H9E|4.0|Besides just simple good film-making, I've figured out WHY European dramatic cinema is better than that found in the U.S.<br />They make more REAL honest movies about human behavior. Whereas in the U.S, a great percentage of films are juvenile comedies, trash pop culture flicks or shallow horror movies.  The more you make the more likely you're able to turn out quality- and this film from Spain is no exception.<br />My Spanish cinema experiences are few, but I've enjoyed what I've seen... one of which being the wonderfully creepy movie: &quot;The Devil's Backbone&quot;<br />so, go order this or buy it, turn the lights down, pour your drink, and get comfy for a good quality movie...<br />and hey, it's one of Penelope Cruz's first movies!
B000059XUI|1.0|Very bad film.<BR>They released Spiderman into the 21st century, why not Superman?<BR>I've always found him to be the most appealing comic book character. He is sure for an amazing performance. <BR>RELEASE HIM INTO OUR CENTURY!
1891252089|5.0|This book is awesome - it gives you everything you need to begin or expand on a yoga practice.  Plenty of positioning instructions with a focus on the most important benefits of yoga beyond the physical.  Helps combine positioning, breath, bandhas and flow.  Enjoy! Namaste.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Nightwish uses an orchestra here. Not just any orchestra but the same one that  Howard Shore used for the Lord of the Rings movies. Can and other band say they used that orchestra? No why because no other band has used any Oscring winning orchestra. Nightwish has done what no other band has very been able to do. THEY USED AN ORCHESTRA IN THE RIGHT WAY. A REALLY TO LIFE ORCHESTRA. <br />This is not mainstream. Mainstream would never want to play this. You want crap music then go listen to your dame Britney Spears. You want good music pick up a Nightwish CD. You want crap metal music then pick up a Korn CD. You want good metal music pick up Nightwish. You want a crap singer pick up a Avreil(sp) CD. You want a really good singer who has taken classes in many different kinds of music pick up a Nightwish CD.
B00000JZI9|2.0|&quot;Silverado&quot; was the first western movie I have seen and let me tell you, I was puzzled. If all western movies are that boring and confusing, then I am not  wateing my time watching another western movie again. First of all, the soundtrack was so loud, I couldn't hear what the people were saying. Since this is the first time I ever watched a western movie, I guess the selections of the music was ok. Second,  there was too many characters and problems involed that my brain couldn' t  keep up to the movie. Since I couldn't hear what the characters were saying, I couldn't find any quotes that the characters said. The only thing I remeber was that this one guy said, &quot; All I did was kiss a girl.&quot; That's all I remember and understood form the movie!!!<BR>   But I do have to give the movie &quot;Silverado&quot; some credit. For the people who enjoy watching western movies that  includes gun fighting and action, &quot;Silverado&quot; has many of those things. There were many gun shooting scenes that took me by suprise. Personally, I dont like guns. I think they cause death and is very dangerous, ESPECIALLY when smeone insane or evil is holding one. <BR>   I don't find western movies that exciting because it is the guns itself that turns me off.  To me, I think what blows a movie is if people talk with a high vocabulary, there is too much talking with not much action , or too much action with not much talking. It should be balanced and Silverado had a little too much action and and unclear voice.<BR>   I saw some costumes/ equiptment that made &quot;Silverado&quot; have a good/ bad western scene. First of all, the outfits were a little out of date, but I guess that was ok, considering it is a western movie. Second the background was great, except it made me thirsty when I saw the sand/ desert. The guns, saloons, and the houses was a great addition for the equiptments. Overall, it was good. <BR>   To me personally, I like a thriller or a comedy movie. I wasn't really raised in an enviroment with people who enjoy watching western movies, so this is a change for me. In any movie, it should have a balance of  some funny comments, some romance or any obsession of some sort.  ( example :  in &quot; Lord of the Rings&quot; , the ring is the obsession). The last thing is that a good movie should have is some thrill to it.  what I am trying to say is that  &quot;Silverado&quot; didn't catch my attention. <BR>   So in these ways,  &quot;Silverado was boring to a girl who enjoys a thriller/comedy than a western movie. But for all you western lovers out there who is reading this, PLEASE keep watching western movies. Listen to your gut feeling, not me.

B00005N5S5|5.0|This is the best Terminator movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's retrospect. In the first film Arnold Schwarzenegger is the super cool-factor. He is handsome, masculine, super-strong, seemingly indistuctable, rebellion young appearance Terminator, but most of all, he is bad with a serious 'no body gets in my way' attitude problem.    In the second film he has the same rebellion look, he is still masculine, he looks less youthful and more middle aged, he is no longer seemingly super-strong, he is no longer seemingly indistructable, but worst of all he is no longer bad and his attitude has improved, he now has obstacles that stand in his way.    His cool-factor is completely over powered by the T-1000.  His super-strength is over powered by the T-1000.   His youth is replaced and over powered by the T-1000.  His rebellion look, doesn't seem to matter anymore, thanks to the T-1000.    The third film looks even worse for Arnold, as he is over powered by an arguably less impressive Terminator or \\"Terminatrix\\" than the T-1000. Arnold's age really does show an older man that has had his age doubled since his characters first appearance. He once again admit's he is \\"out-dated\\" and that she or \\"it\\" is a more powerful and far more effective killing machine than himself. Once again HE must struggle to survive as he is decapitated and almost dismemebered, as also with the T-1000. This truly waves his original 'nothing stands in my way' factor in to extinction, or what should I say, Termination.    You can see how they turned it around on poor Arnold, and you can see how the first original and as some would say, \\"the best\\" Terminator film puts Arnold in the ever so cool spotlight, that is taken away a couple of years later and then again over a decade later. Even with the so-called \\"upgraded\\" T-X, the T-1000 arguably proves to be the best Terminator of all time...    Yeah, ok, we all know the T-101 isn't the best terminator to date... mechanically speaking...    ... but which terminator killed the most people??...    ... the T-1000 & the T-X killed around 5 people each...    ... but the T-101 killed over 20 people... on his own...    ... makes you think...    In the end, the T-101 turned out to be the worst terminator, with the highest body count.

0380002930|5.0|I originally read this when I was a child and loved all stories about animals, especially bunny rabbits. From a child's perspective, I remember it being sad and scary at points, but overall cheerful and fun.<br />It was because of Stephen King that I recently picked this up and read it as an adult. Obviously King sees this book as the classic that it is, for this book's inspiration shows in &quot;The Stand&quot; and various parts of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. I'm a big fan of these books and so I had to read &quot;Watership Down&quot; once again because I had forgotten the social aspects and lessons of the story, remembering only the main plot.<br />I'm so glad I took the time to read this again! King's work is mainly about his characters and how they respond to the given situation. Now I know why he was inspired by &quot;Watership Down.&quot; I now see that it's not so much about bunny rabbits as it is about Fiver, Bigwig, Hazel and the rest. It's about social structures and how they form. It's about forming civilizations, striving for a better life, finding leadership, building friendships and trust, and protecting life.<br />If you have children, don't let them read this book alone. Share the adventure with them. If you are a child, share this book with your parents.

B000069AUI|4.0|The sophomore effort from Coldplay is in no way a \\"sophomore jynx\\". It is not an extension from Parachutes either. It is totally different; not so much as a radiohead record but never-the-less different. Instead of coming off as indieish and a complete band effort, it sounds more mature and like a showcase for Chris Martin. This is due to the seemingly more emphasis put on the lyrics and vocals. Both of which are improved from their last outting in terms of meaing at least. Also, there seems to be more keyboard used here especially on the two hit singles \\"clocks\\" and \\"scientist\\", something that is never a bad thing. It is differnet also in that it is much longer than their debut, by over twelve minutes. <br /> <br />This record excels on many levels along with the aforementioned. It works more as a pop record and therefore seems more appealing to the casual listener. It also contains the groups strongest songs to date, in terms as singles possibilities. However, despite its strengths, it is not perfect by any means. Among its flaws lie within lyrics whisch even though they are more meaningful than those on Parachutes, they sometimes fail as conveying whatever message was meant to be conveyed. On a couple songs, like the title track, the lyrics try to be way too philisophical/political something tah a british band really should stay away from. Also, the record contains a couple straight forward rock songs that are not bad but not what Coldplay excels at, smooth ballads with a rock twist.  <br /> <br />All of the flaws seem to make this record feel less complete when compared to their debut, inviting track skipping and quick boredom. Therefore, AROBTTH is a slightly inferior record. I must urge people to pick this up though since it is still very very good. Don't expect the utter brillience from the first album to carry over however.  It simply doesn't have that sound.  <br /> <br />TRACK RUN-THREW <br />Politik- good opener despite sub-par lyrics. <br />In my place-pure pop...good or bad i dont know <br />God put a smile upon my face- best rock song on the record by far <br />The scientist- sweet piano and lyrics, capable of changing lives <br />Clocks- captivatingly brilliant piano play <br />Daylight- worst track but listenable every once in a while <br />Green eyes- good range of vocals and lyrics. <br />Warning sign- beautiful <br />A wisper- driving guitar that goes no where but... <br />A rush of blood to the head- too philisophical but still good <br />Amsterdam- best track IMO, its dynamics are unsurpassed

B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I like the single and I'm buying the cd.  OK, so then I will come back and review.  But in reading these reviews, I feel that I must respond immediately.  People saying that the single rips off Led Zeppelin?  That is a LAUGH.  Robert Plant and Jimmy Page would only pat these boys on the back.  They blatantly stole riffs, melodies, songs, you name it, especially in the beginning of their career.  Music reviewers/ historians all agree on one thing -- Led Zeppelin's first album is full of rip-offs, albeit amazing ones.  <br />Music is a constant evolution, and of course people will rip off others, hopefully take it to a slightly different place, and it'll keep going.  Plus, I think that the Stroke's &quot;Last Night&quot; rips off Tom Petty way worse than these fellows rip off anything.
B0002234LS|5.0|Secret Window was an awesome film- (Especially with Johnny in it) ;p, and i really enjoyed it.<BR>It had a really good twist and the acting was excellent.

0790730960|5.0|Ive always love Batman and his films since I was born. Hes part of my life. I remember that I used to have the poster of this film (Batman returns) in my bedroom; I think I was probably 4 years old. Its my birthday today and now Im 16. It was 12 years ago. I could spend many hours looking at that photograph. This film has always been my favourite, as well - though the others are also great. Michael Keaton is an excellent actor, as you can notice after watching this film. Therefore, buy this DVD as soon as you can and enjoy Batman!
B000002L7J|5.0|&quot;Meat is Murder&quot; is the perfect second album since it considerably expands the Smiths musical scope(now embracing experiments with rockabilly-&quot;Rusholme Ruffians&quot; and haunting dirges-&quot;How soon is now?)&quot;while retaining the quirkiness that made them the most vital band of the 80's.<br />As most would agree the Smiths are an adquired taste and Morrissey's voice is likely either to repel or eternally charm you.All things considered&quot;Meat is Murder&quot; is arguably the second best Smiths album,falling slightly short of the undeniable masterpiece&quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;.<br />The album is by far more consistent and better balanced than their debut with the addition of boasting a handful of their best songs ever-from the vitriol of &quot;The Headmaster's Ritual&quot;to the phantasmagoric&quot;How soon is now?&quot;,the fast pace and quintessential Morrissey of&quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;(&quot;And when I'm lying in my bed I think about life and I think about death and neither particularly appeals to me&quot;)or the underheralded gem&quot;That Joke isn't funny anymore&quot;which should be subject of study by every guitarist of the alternative realm.<br />Outstanding throughout.If you've already liked some other Smiths recording or are interested in 80's indie pop(R.E.M.,Lloyd Cole,Orange Juice,Feelies,...) you can't go wrong with this one.

0805211063|5.0|Whenever asked who is my favorite writer, my response of Franz Kafka usually generates in the inquisitor a look of severity, as if I had responded with the most stifling and impenetrable answer imaginable. I have always been positively baffled by the public perception of Kafka as a &quot;difficult&quot; author, a &quot;serious&quot; author, one of those authors good for no one beyond college professors. This is simply not the case. All of three of Kafka's novels are thrilling, nightmarish, and haunting, to be sure, but they are also downright hysterical, containing countless moments of slapstick humor worthy of the great comics. Furthermore, Kafka's novels are probably the most compulsively readable of any I've ever read. I've yet to spend more than two days reading or re-reading one of the three novels, as once I'm drawn into Kafka's spell I have no choice but to finish (that previous statement obviously fits right in with Kafka's universe). I can't stand it when people consider Kafka &quot;the guy who writes stories about people turning into bugs&quot;. The Castle is my favorite of Kafka's works, a novel so rich and beautiful, so full of crazy characters and imagination, it is the logical precursor to Roald Dahl and Tom Wolfe and Terry Southern and other writers of the comically absurd. Monty Python surely owes a huge debt to The Castle. The Castle is indescribable. There has never been another novel quite like it, before or after, and surely every reader will find it a different experience. It is a masterpiece in that it hints at serious post-modern themes and events, but remains ambiguous enough to take under its wing any number of interpretations. Great 20th century novels like Orwell's 1984 and Nabakov's Lolita probably won't stand up to future scrutiny the way Kafka's will, because Kafka is the only writer of the 20th century to succesfully represent the human experience through the form itself, letting the content and meaning transform entirely according tothe reader.
B00000JZI9|5.0|&quot;Silverado&quot; is a really good movie it has a lot of action.<BR>I really liked this movie even though I don't like western movies because western movies always has the typical good guys fighting the bad guys for justice, but &quot;Silverado&quot; has something unique that makes it different from the others western movies maybe its because &quot;Silverado&quot; has drama, adventures, action, comedy and romance.<br />      The soundtrack  makes it feel like the real old west. The music fits with the film perfect.<br />      I really liked the story of the movie. A lone cowboy trapped in a desert cabin, pinned down by the bad guys, he must shoot his way out with the help of three more guys. These now become friends and heroes as they go after thieves, protect a wagon train of homesteaders, save their families and friends from the land gruubbing Mckendricks, and fight corrupt lawmen.<br />       The scene that I liked the most is when Linda Hunt says &quot;He can't hurt you , if he is dead&quot;. (she said that to a frightened employee).<br />        Anyways you should see this movie if you haven't seen it, but if you have seen it well buy the dvd IT'S WORTH IT.
B000022TSW|5.0|\\"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut\\" should have won the oscar for best picture that year.  No, I don't remember what movie received that honor, but I maintain that it was undeserved.  Trey Parker is a comedic genius and also one hell of a musical satirist.  He has a considerable talent for composition and arranging and his ability to ape various musical styles (mostly musicals here, old and new) is very impressive.  The Les Mis number is outstanding.  That stuff is hard to do.  <br />Parker's humor is sharp and it cuts through all the layers of hardened feces that surround any given issue.  It is wholesome irreverence.  South Park is not just \\"potty\\" humor.  It's intelligent, socially relevant, taboo-crushing, politically saavy potty humor.  Trey Parker is the Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill of modern cinema.  Okay, I am stretching.  But the point is, there's more going on here than farting and cussing, although I must say that all of the profanity is masterful.<br />The point hammered home in the feature film is that the MPAA is a joke and that the ratings system in this country is completely screwed up.  More importantly, this film exposes a culture that embraces violence of all sorts, but abhors dirty words.  All sorts of other hypocricy and stupidity are joyously acknowledged and then put to music.  This movie is downright subversive and one of the funniest I have ever seen.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Nightwish uses an orchestra here. Not just any orchestra but the same one that  Howard Shore used for the Lord of the Rings movies. Can and other band say they used that orchestra? No why because no other band has used any Oscring winning orchestra. Nightwish has done what no other band has very been able to do. THEY USED AN ORCHESTRA IN THE RIGHT WAY. A REALLY TO LIFE ORCHESTRA. <br />This is not mainstream. Mainstream would never want to play this. You want crap music then go listen to your dame Britney Spears. You want good music pick up a Nightwish CD. You want crap metal music then pick up a Korn CD. You want good metal music pick up Nightwish. You want a crap singer pick up a Avreil(sp) CD. You want a really good singer who has taken classes in many different kinds of music pick up a Nightwish CD.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This film is one of the best in psychological thrillers.  It keeps you guessing and re-guessing as the plot moves on and the dead bodies start disappearing.  John Cusack is at his brooding best paired with Ray Liotta.  This is a movie that could have easily been over-acted, but the cast carries the story line well.  There's limited gore and guts but just the right amount of suspense to keep you glued to the the movie.  Don't miss out on this one, you'll be glad you spent your time and money on it.
B00000JZI9|3.0|I   did like the movie a little bit. There was to much background music, and that kind of made it boring. The sound track does help the movie because in the parts where there is action they play the music. in a movie i like to see action and comedy, even if there is a little bit of comedy it can still change the movie. the foreshadowing that i saw was when he showed the money to the cowboys. I also saw when the black cowboy came to get a drink at the bar and they didn't let him. something that makes this movie suck is that they played the music to much. What make this movie unique is that there a lot of action, and that every part of the movie falls in place , to make the movie make sence. That is my review.
B000148KK2|2.0|Half of the songs on &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; are by veteran songwriters Tom Waits, Mose Allison, Joni Mitchell, etc.  They get mostly routine performances, although there is one standout: Chris Smither's &quot;Love Me Like a Man&quot;, which is fairly spritied and enjoyable. <br />However, the moment is short-lived and we get to the Krall-Costello collaborations. These &quot;originals&quot; are being hyped in the advertising as the &quot;real Diana Krall&quot;... in my book, they are not... they are &quot;real Elvis Costello&quot;. They are in his style and are written with his brand of esoteric style to convey often simple and bitter messages. They surely don't sound like the Diana many music-lovers have come to know. It's easy to see why so many potential Krall fans have been so disappointed with this release. The lyrics are irritating and obscure with thin melodic lines and redundant rhythms.  <br />Some are praising this album as &quot;art&quot;. Well, according to William Rubin, director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, &quot;there is no single definition of art.&quot; So the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, this album is &quot;art&quot;... but so are her previous albums, and so are the albums of countless other recording artists from the past and present. So whether this is &quot;art&quot; or not is not the question.... for it is indeed &quot;art&quot; on some level.<br />Here is my deeper (and Costello-esque) metaphoric question: &quot;The famous and very costly painting by the artist Edvard Munch called &quot;The Scream&quot; is indeed &quot;art&quot; ... and it most certainly represents that painters' &quot;inner feelings&quot;... but do I really want this painting hanging on my living room wall? The answer for me is a simple &quot;no&quot;. I also do not care to listen to this austere collection when it is not even close to Diana's previous works. I hope this satisfies getting that depressing stuff of her chest and she gets back to swing and style which made her so many fans, including myself.
140003180X|3.0|I've read all four of the Alexander McCall Smith books centering on Mma Ramotswe and her No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and I plan on reading the fifth, so clearly (to me, anyway) there is something attractive, charming, and addictive about these little literary gems.<br /><br />The gentle wisdom of the main characters, the insights into human nature that are revealed in the succession of episodes, the often lyrical references to life, nature, and culture in Botwana, all of these things render Smith's books fun to read and at times spiritually uplifting.  This latest episode, featuring the professional and romantic adventures of Mma Rowatswe's trusted assistant, the typing prodigy Mma Makutsi, is every bit as charming and readable as the first three books in the series, so one cannot say that Smith is losing his touch as he cranks out book after book.<br /><br />There are, however, some troubling aspects to this series that I confess have come to bother me. Example: in his laudable effort to portray life in Botswana in a positive light, Smith's narrative at times takes on a kind of paternalistic tone, the subtext of which seems to be, \\"these people are simple, yes, but they are gentle, good, and in a kind of salt-of-the-earth way, wise.\\"  A style that apparently seeks to keep the prose simple and accessible ends up making the characters themselves often appear childlike and one-dimensional, lacking in real human depth.  Because of this, I can see how these books have come to be so whole-heartedly embraced by rat-race-weary urban Western professionals daydreaming of a \\"simpler life and a slower pace.\\"<br /><br />This tendency toward flattening out the stresses and complexities of life in rural Botswana would be more forgivable were it not for the fact that this is the nation with the highest rate of HIV infection on the planet. This is a startling, sad, alarming reality that probably will surprise many readers of these books, and yet this overwhelmingly serious problem is mentioned only in passing within Smith's upbeat tales about lady detectives and dedicated auto mechanics.  I certainly don't expect the author to dwell in his stories upon this health catastrophe, but his failure even to allude to the problem seems to me an almost calculated part of his overall strategy of presenting a romanticized, sanitized, they're-poor-but-they're-happy image of life in Botswana.<br /><br />People who have read and appreciated all of the novels will surely interject at this point at least one, \\"Yeah, but...\\"  Noteworthy among these could be the fact that in a previous book the principal male character, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (always, cutely, referred to by this full title), is diagnosed with clinical depression.  Yes, this is strikingly \\"real to life,\\" certainly, but even here the simplistic, dumbed-down approach to human problems advanced by Smith emerges, as Matekoni's apparently severe depression is completely obliterated almost instantly through a simple presciption for antidepressant drugs.  Anyone familiar with the issue of depression knows that overcoming this malady is seldom so simple as is portrayed in Smith's novel.  But problems in Smith's Botswana tend generally toward rapid and total resolution, much in the manner of prime time television episodes.<br /><br />Still, I confess that I find these novels to be soothing and easy bedtime reading, and I'm sure I'll end up buying and reading the next one, despite my growing reservations about Smith's overall project.in passing within Smith's upbeat tales about lady detectives and dedicated auto mechanics.

B00000JZI9|1.0|What I did not like about the boring movie is when the guys went into the house where the lady, the guy, and the litle kids house I think that was really mean cause i dont think that other people would like some big mean guys to go inside their house and disrespect their family just because of something that someone that lives in their house did I think that, that is so mean.  But the part that I most hated was when the guys started heating the lady and the litle kid that was really mean why would they do that if is not their fault that the guy did not do what they told him to do so that is what I hated there was a sad part and that is when the guys took the the litle kid with them so that is why I did not like the movie.
0451450523|5.0|This book is the greatest of it's genre and i would like it known that this review is to a fellow reviewer (Laura Beattie).  The ending of this book is not bad it is called literary drama, and how dare you critisize, as if you could do any better!  No one says everything has to have a SUPER HAPPY ending, that would only make things super sappy!  And just to make you think, perhaps the problem is not, &quot;why many think this book is great&quot;, it's more like, &quot;maybe you should go and find out what the problem is with you&quot;, the majority is not usually the one with the issues.  I'm sad to say that 5 is the highest star rating on here. READ THIS BOOK, despite what others say, it's wonderful!
B0000C8AVR|1.0|I cannot believe some of the hype surrounding this album and this artist.Nobody did what Dylan did in 1965? Really? Did Dylan have a number one song? NO.A number one album? NO.1965 belonged to the Beatles,followed by the Stones and other great acts,not this guy.Another review says Dylan is a great singer...yeah,and I'm a billionaire.Gimmie a break,please.
B000148KK2|3.0|We have all of Diana's CD's and love all of them...until we purchased &quot;The Girl In The Other Room&quot;.  I had read the reviews and took a chance that it wasn't as bad as indicated.  Well, it's not bad enough to keep out of our collection, but it is certainly not our favorite. It's just not the Diana that we know and love to listen to.  I think it's a search for a different sound that she should just drop! It doesn't do her voice and talent justice...we want our fabulous,wonderful old Diana back!
B00000JZI9|4.0|In all my life \\"13 years  to be exact,\\" I never  thought that  this western movie will  be so entertaining.I thought that western movies would suck. But this movie changed my whole hatred in western movies.  It was really good to see that one western movies wouldn't suck. But th soundtrack did suck when there were doing the fighting sceen .Two of my favorite quotes are'Hey,\\" because he wanted a fair fight.  At the end of the movie his friend said \\"I have a job now .\\"<br />  P.S.<br />If you hate this movie  well @#$%^ you.
B00005A0N5|5.0|First and foremost, ignore the ignorant, and immature brats posting the negative one-liners.  They probably heard the 30-second clip in the album description, and realizing it is not the latest &quot;thrasher album&quot; or the latest &quot;&lt;c&gt;rap album&quot;, they immediatly think it sucks.  Just ignore them.<br />That being said, I am a long time metal fan, listening to and having just about everything from Metallica, to Hammerfall, to Kamelot, to Stratovarious, to Symphony X, to Iron Maiden, to Queensryche, to Fates Warning, and several others.  Recently, one of my friends in one of the forums that I frequent clued me into Nightwish.  While running errands around town, I decided to pop into one of the local record stores and see if they had any Nightwish albums.  It turned out they indeed did.  They had this one (Oceanborn), as well as Century Child, Wishmaster, and Angels Fall First.  That particular record store lets people listen to albums before buying, so I asked the attendent if I can give this one a listen.  I was completely blown away at what I heard.  The hauntingly beautiful operatic female vocals was the biggest stand-out on this album.  I also love the nice mix of hard-hitting guitars, and symphonic/ochestral parts.  This is certainly one of the most interesting mixes of ochestral, operatic, and metal that I've heard.  Not only that, it seems to have a bit of sophistication to it, which this 34 year-old really likes, not the typical &quot;thrasing&quot; and &quot;screaming vocals&quot; that grates on me like fingernails on a chalkboard.  I am just so sick and tired of the drek that I hear on the local FM stations (to the point that I ended up getting XM Radio), that it is truly nice to hear something such as this for once.  Also nice to truly get to enjoy an entire album, from the very first note to the final fade-out, and love every bit of it (not the typical &quot;one-hit wonder, and the other 12 tracks stink&quot; syndrom).<br />Also, some ofthe reviews commented on the male vocals/narratives in a couple of the tracks.  Personally, I think they work great as an offset to the beautiful female vocals and give a little more variety to the music (like there is enough already).<br />Also, if you have not already, and if you have access to one, try to play this on a truly high-end &quot;audiophile&quot; type system (not the typical $30 Wally*World boom-box).  Fortunatly, I am blessed with such a system, and I gotta tell you, this disk sounds just friggan amazing on there!  There is a lot of detail and wonderful dynamics throughout!  Some of the bass on there truly does hit hard, but not with the typical &quot;boom-boom-boom&quot; that seems to be popular on most current &quot;mainstream&quot; albums.<br />In the end, I ended up buying all four of the Nightwish albums that particular store had, and also ordered &quot;Once&quot; from right here at Amazon.  Oceanborn is my favorite, followed closely by Centuary Child.  Can't wait to here Once, though, since it seems that one is talked about quite a bit by fans of this genre of music.  Wishmaster and Angels Fall First are also good albums and  definitly better than any of the &quot;mainstream&quot; drek that has been out in recent years.  However, I still gotta give the edge to Stratovarious's Visions and Elements Pt 1 and Pt 2 or Hammerfalls Crimson Thunder album.<br />If you are a fan of power/prog symphonic metal, than this album is definitly worth checking out.  Highly recommend by this long-time metal head.

B000002U9Y|4.0|To me, I always felt that A Saucerful of Secrets was more or less a gap between the Barrett-era Floyd and the more experimental Floyd albums that were to follow. As everyone knows, Syd Barrett was too far gone and was booted out of the band by the time of this album, although he did leave behind &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;. His replacement was of course David Gilmour, and so the best-known lineup (that eventually gave us multi-million sellers like The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall) of Waters/Wrights/Gilmour/Mason was established here. The band more or less decided to continue exploring the more spacy, experimental side of psychedelia in the abscence of Barrett. For example, Waters giving us &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;. Here Wright gives us some truly wonderful spacy keyboards while Mason gives us some nice use of percussion (sounds like kettle drums here). &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; could easily sound like a Barrett song, although I recognize David Gilmour's vocals (although I suspect some backing vocals were by Barrett). The use of kazoos in this song would have been perfect as a Barrett composition. Wright's &quot;Remember a Day&quot; was apparently from the Piper sessions from the previous year (1967) so unsurprisingly it would be Barrett doing guitar duty here, although of course it was Wright handling the vocals. The title track is a highly experimental unstructured piece, which is a really daring thing for a band to do. A lot of use of percussion, then at the end, mellow use of Hammond organ and cosmic voices. If you're familiar with a lot of early '70s progressive space rock and Krautrock acts of the time, you can see where many of those bands got their inspiration from. &quot;See-Saw&quot; is another Wright number and what's really interesting is he used the Mellotron, an instrument usually associated with the Moody Blues (and later Yes, Genesis, Tangerine Dream, etc.). This wasn't going to be the last time a Mellotron could be heard on a Floyd album, as some was used on Ummagumma, and Atom Heart Mother. And then of course the album closes with Barret's &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;. Upon paying attention to the lyrics it was obvious he really lost it. This song is pretty bizarre, especially with the psychedelic noodling, before it ends again with just Barret singing and guitar. It's amazing how this band was like in an era before they became a household name with multi-platinum albums and selling out every stadium and arena. Truly a great, although not-so-easy to get in to psychedelic album.
B00022LRXA|5.0|Car music.  Ride with this music.  Or sit and burn candles.  Or make spaghetti.  Unlike his more backgroundy music this is music to move to as well.  The thing is it is ESSENTIAL.  You must have this album.  And Another Green World.  The album with John Cale - Wrong Way Up completes the triumverate.  These three are must haves.  Which is better?  Impossible to say.  Taking Tiger Mountain and Appllo ... also excellent.  But get Before and After Science and decide which side is 'before'?  Or just ride with it.  Eno is great and this may be his greatest.
B000099T2L|4.0|It's laughable that some people claim Beyonce &quot;can't sing&quot;.  You can not like the cd, but to say she can't sing?!!  Come on, now.<br />Anyway, the cd is decent.  It's great entertainment at the very least.

B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle was the Pink Floyd album were they seemed to have finally gotten rid of many of the '60s psychedelic gimmicks and started going for a more '70s progressive rock sound. Most of the first half of the album (side one if you own the LP) is like the second, more song-oriented half of Atom Heart Mother, although I felt the stuff on Meddle was definately better executed. Some of the more undesirable experiments of Atom Heart Mother (specifically &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfeast&quot;) had been luckily thrown out the window. The album starts off with &quot;One of These Days&quot;, always been a favorite. It's a really heavy piece, with loud use of bass. I have always felt this was the closest to heavy metal the band ever did. &quot;A Pillow of Windows&quot; is an organ-dominated ballad with acoustic guitar with plenty of that '70s Pink Floyd trademark. Roger Waters' &quot;St. Tropez&quot; is a rather upbeat number, although the album does feature one one misstep and that was Wright's &quot;Seamus&quot;. It was basically a misguided attempted at doing country blues complete with a howling dog. It sounds so un-Pink Floyd. I guess the band wanted to be less serious here. But I had always felt the album's other crowning achievement (aside from &quot;One of These Days&quot;) was the 23 minute side-length epic &quot;Echoes&quot;. A lot of the style which would make them famous with &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; could be found here. The album starts off with Richard Wright's use piano. Here you get to hear David Gilmour use this spacy slide guitar, which became a Pink Floyd trademark. When the vocals come in, you hear many of the same vocals harmonies that you recognize on albums like &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. In fact this part of &quot;Echoes&quot; sounds like a pre-cursor to &quot;Time&quot;. Then the band starts going in to a lengthy instrumental passage which then fades in to some truly bizarre use of wind sounds and electronic seagulls. Eventually thosewind and seagull sounds fade with just spooky organ from Richard Wright, then Waters comes in with his bass, then the whole band kicks in before the main vocal themes return. Eventually the song ends once again with those wind sounds. This had been always my favorite pre-Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd album. There is no doubt if you're in to this band, you need this album.
B00024BHTC|3.0|I've been a fan of Nightwish for the last 2 years (being in the US, the only way you listen to them is via MP3's or if you grab the CD yourself since radios do not -ever- play them since they just have no following) and this CD is a bit dissapointing compared to others. Now yes, the guitars are more used in this one than the others, and they've got a theme to it which is different than the others. She sings differently during most of this CD; she's using more higher pitch and singing a little softer. The music itself is a bit darker/harder than the others (personal opinion only, don't quote me on it :) )<br />Those are the main differences between this CD and others. I do like &quot;Planet Hell&quot; and &quot;Nemo&quot; for their own things, however on the whole, its just another Nightwish album. Avid fans may enjoy it just for being what it is (my husband included), but its no Wishmaster.

B000002PH1|4.0|Simply put, Belinda Carlisle's sophomore solo album &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; is outstanding.    The Go Gos lead singer often gets forgotten about when the term &quot;diva&quot; is thrown around.  Belinda Carlisle has a bit more of an unorthodox voice than many of those female singers that are classified as Divas, but no less powerful.    On this particilar album, Carlisle shines thanks to what is an outstanding team effort.   Belinda's role on the album is the vocalist and doesn't play a role in playing instruments or songwriting.  In order for a pure vocalist putting out a solo album to succeed, the vocalist must be surrounded by great songwriting and great musicians.  &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; does not fall short in this area providing Belinda Carlisle the opportunity to do what she best - produce great vocals.<br />The songwriting team on &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; is solid.    The team is led by producer Rick Nowels.   Nowels, who does a great job at getting the most out of Belinda co-wrote 4 songs on the album including two of the monster hits, &quot;Circle in the Sand&quot; and the #1 song &quot;Heaven is a Place on Earth&quot;.    Another notable songwriter is Diane Warren, who is widely respected as one of the best in the business.   Warren wrote two songs, the Top Ten Hit &quot;I Get Weak&quot; and &quot;World Without You&quot;.   When this album was released in 1987, the Go Gos were split up - however some of the Go Gos were still on good terms, namely Belinda Carlisle and Charlotte Caffey.  On this album, Caffey penned 4 songs including &quot;We Can Change&quot; with producer Rick Nowels.  <br />There are some solid background vocalists on this album.   In addition to songwriting talents, Caffey also lends herself to background vocalists.  Also on the album providing vocals are the members of Wilson Phillips (Carnie Wilson, Chynna Phillips, and Michelle Phillips).  This was before Wilson Phillips hit it big.  Nowels also provides vocals ane keyboards.   Another notable keyboard player is Thomas Dolby.<br />There were three big hits off this album.  &quot;Heaven is a Place on Earth&quot; rocketed to #1 very quickly.   This song has a lot of trademark vocals of Carlisle.  Perhaps, Carlisle's greatest trademark is the ability to &quot;dig down deep&quot;,  This is demonstrated in her vocals when she sings &quot;I'm not afraid anymore&quot;.    &quot;I Get Weak&quot;, is a song that really fits Carlisle like a glove.   This song has a slower bear, but showcases Carlisle's vocals as good as any.  When she sings, &quot;I Get Weak&quot; and &quot;Just a kiss, you can strip me defenseless&quot; for the second time, you'll hear the &quot;dig down deep&quot; vocals of Carlisle.    &quot;Circle in the Sand&quot; was the third hit off the album,  Carisle also &quot;digs down deep&quot; when she sings &quot;Baby Can't You Hear Me?&quot;.   This is another outstanding song with almost a mystical romantic quality to it.<br />In addition to the &quot;hit songs&quot;, this collection offers other songs that could have easily topped the charts.  &quot;I Feel Free&quot; is a very catchy remake of the Cream classic.  I think Belinda's version is better..  Belinda starts out by singing &quot;mmmm mmmmm&quot;, then the song transitions into some nice drumming and guitar work.  Carlisle will also belt out some great vocals &quot;.   The song &quot;Should I Let You In&quot; is another song with some powerful vocals.   &quot;I Wanna Open Up...&quot; shows the &quot;dig down deep&quot; vocals and there is some great complimentary background vocals on this song.   Carlisle sings with some incredible passion on this particuular song. This is a Charlotte Caffey penned song and this is one of the better songs on the album.   Caffey shows that she has really matured as a songwriter from her Go Gos days.<br />Another good song is the Nowels/Caffey penned song &quot;We Can Change&quot;.  This one isn't quite as catchy as some of the others, but it still a very good nice song.  Carlisle makes the most of the strong lyrics in the Diane Warren penned song &quot;World Without You&quot;.  This is a perfect example of how given some very strong lyrics and music, Carlisle take it to the next level with her incredible vocals.    There are some nice background vocals in this song as well. &quot;Fool for Love&quot; and the Caffey penned &quot;Nobody Owns Me&quot; each have a very 80s feel to it - but Carlisle shines on these songs as well.   &quot;Nobody Owns Me&quot; has some nice guitar work and might be the best example of the &quot;dig down deep&quot; vocals on this album.  The only weak song is the closing song on the album, &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;.  This song seems to be a letdown.  I keep waiting for some crashing drums or a guitar rift to happen, but it never happens - the song just seems to need a change of pace and it might be a pretty good song.<br />The liner notes on this CD are outstanding.   All of the lyrics are included.   What I like about the included lyrics is that the title of the song is capitalized when it is mentioned in the lyrics.   All of the songwriting and production credits are included.    The outside of the liner notes have some very nice pictures of Belinda.   This album is a very good album.  It just falls short of being a 5 star effort, but I would rate it 4 1/2 stars.   It definitely was a one of the better albums released in 1987 and is definitely Carlisle at her best.
B0000TB050|5.0|I'm pretty critical of music and concerts. I currently don't care for the state of U2 or Bono. I am more in the generation that played my WAR cassette out and bought the CD when it first came out. With all that being said....this DVD simply captures U2's transformation from an incredible young energetic band to the current commercial juggernaut they have become. Even with all of that....the sound, the picture, the energy is top notch in this. The only reason I wouldn't rate this as good as Red Rocks is because of the songs covered. <BR>Is a must have for anyone that has ever liked U2 from the Boy albumn to the current state.
B0002234LS|3.0|After seeing Pirates of the Carribean, I think I would have liked just about anything Depp did that didn't involve him overacting in a bad Keith Richards impersonation (yes, I'm one of the 3 people who despised that movie). So the crackerjack hokeyness of writer/director David Koepp's Stephen King adaptation was a welcome change for the most part. Depp reminded me why he's such a valuable commodity as a star, composer Phillip Glass does an excellent tribute to Bernard Herrmann (redeeming himself for the worst score of the year, Taking Lives), and the whole alone-in-a-lakeside-cottage-with-writer's-block deal is perfect for a popcorn thriller. Secret Window is a blast for its first two-thirds if you get caught up in the trappings of the genre in which it indulges and don't expect much. But even I, who was really enjoying myself, couldn't get over the film's twist ending which simply fails miserably, to put it lightly. (Mild spoilers: if you haven't seen it, stop reading here) Koepp's screenplay and direction expect us to believe two different sides to Depp's character, and when he's played with such likeable nonchalance for most of the movie, his tribute to Nicholson's Jack Torrance just comes off as comical. I guess I could just blame it on the story, &quot;Secret Window,&quot; around which the movie revolves, but that would be letting it off too easily. Someone I know described the end of the film as &quot;annoying,&quot; and I couldn't agree more. Too bad, because it sank a potentially good flick. GRADE: C
B00000JZI9|4.0|I never was a western movie fan. The only movie i saw that was western was &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. When my English teacher Mr. Ponce told us we were watching a western movie i didn't like the idea. I was not looking forward to watching it. Then the movie started and it's title was &quot;Silverado&quot;. As it started I was getting into it. It was full of excitment and drama. The four main characters Kevin Kline (Paden), Scott Glenn (Emmett), Danny Glover (Mal), and Kevin Costner (Jake). All four of them have great chemistry throughout the whole movie. That's what made this movie good. The plot of the movie was also a good one. What makes a movie a bad one? Well, in my opinion the reason is that the actors don't have any chemistry or that the plot is not interesting. How is this movie? This movie is different but good. What makes this movie unique? It's unique in it own way. Meaning you don't everyday see a western movie thats exciting and has you guessing till the end. Did I like the soundtrack? The soundtrack gave the movie more suspense and excitment. If you are a big fan of western music you should buy the soundtrack. The movie overall is very good. I really enjoyed it and I dont regret watching it. One quote I really liked was when Emmett (Scott Glenn) asked his brother Jake (Kevin Coster), &quot;what did you do to get into so much trouble&quot;? Jake responded &quot;all i did was kiss a girl&quot;! I just thought it was a great quote. Well, i hope after reading my review of the movie 'Silverado&quot; you consider watching it. You wont regret watching it!
B000286RKW|5.0|This movie is a true classic, but I'm not going to talk about it.  There are 413 other reviews that drool about how great Goodfellas is.  If you don't know, you are either totally inexperienced with cinema or are living under a rock.<br /><br />Instead, let's talk about 'features.'  The last Goodfellas DVD was a 'flipper,' or a DVD that was so cheap, you had to get up and turn it over half-way through the film.  I can accept that I need to turn Lawrence of Arabia over during the intermission, but Goodfellas is comparatively short.  It is 2.5 hours long, to  be more precise.  A 2.5 hour film fits easily onto a single-side DVD with only a mildly-noticable transfer skip.  That is the only special feature I want from this new version of the DVD.  I'll buy it, just don't make me flip it, God in heaven!<br /><br />Furthermore, Martin Scorsese has gotten the absolute worst treatment of any director this side of Roger Corman on DVD.  Even his last film, Gangs of NY, was subjected to a ridiculous film-ruining stop right in the middle of a love scene that is so abrupt, you have to laugh.  Didn't the jack-a$$es who ruined the Goodfellas DVD years before learn their lesson?  OK, so Gangs was done by Miramax (the worst company on Earth for DVD quality and price,) but why does this trend have to blight poor Scorsese so terribly.  He is one of the greatest living directors, for God's sake!  His movies aren't exactly low-profile.  The only Scorsese film that has been given a proper treatment is The Last Temptation of Christ, but that was a Criterion, and not a Warner DVD.<br /><br />That brings me to my final thought.  Considering the fact that Warner actually does a great job at releasing quality DVDs with a decent amount of interesting features most of the time, it seems doubly stupid releasing some of their greatest back-catalog titles like a lobotomized afterthought.<br /><br />DIE!

B0001DI0FI|4.0|There are more than enough great reviews of the movie Master and Commander, and I agree with them: the film itself was an excellent production. Probably the best that could be made to be both true to the spirit of the books and publicly marketable.  But the widescreen DVD loses something onscreen. I am generally a fan of widescreen format, but the director captured so much activity onscreen that the film is best seen as it was meant to be seen---large.  The beautiful sets, the background action are not seen to best advantage on TV. Similarly, the sound quality is different on DVD. The film is alternately quiet, then loud,and back again, etc., as the plot moves from gentle sailing to battle to storms to island.  At home--at least at my home---we doesn't play the sound as loud as it would be played in the cinema. I never had problems hearing the dialogue in theaters, but did (a little) on DVD. For DVD I recommend playing it loudly.  In fact, try to reproduce the theater experience as best you can. Play it on the largest TV screen you can find, turn down the lights, turn up the sound, and enjoy this wonderful film.
B00000JZI9|5.0|Silverado was a great movie in alot of ways.At first I thought I this is going to be a big snore.But it turned out to have been a really good western movie.I pictured this movie as being full of bar fights and gun fights but tome the was not that much.This movie to me was about four good guys doing what they can to help whats right.<BR>  What makes a good movie to me is one I cant analyze.I analyze every movie I see I'm just an analyzer.I see what can happen to those impossible stunts.Like when a guy is on a horse racing to catch up with a train on a slanted hill the horse could fall over a rock or there could be a hole or pole.But this movie I didn't analyze once.There was one things that happned I didn't like.That was when the bad guy shot the father and took the boy.<BR>  Besides that this was the greatest movie I ever saw.Well greatest western movie I ever saw.The soundtrack was good and it fit the movie great.All the western movies I've seen the soundtrack stunk but not this one.<BR>  The funnyest thing I have heard in Silverado was &quot;All I did was kiss a girl&quot;.So why is this guy always gitting into trouble.But dont go by what I say you should see this movie for yourself and see what you think.
B0000CAQ26|3.0|When Pink broke out of the pack with her sophmore effort, 2001's brilliant MISSUNDAZTOOD, she seemed destined for greatness, someone who could be leading the pack versus someone who was content to merely follow. Sadly, that greatness is nowhere to be found on TRY THIS, a mish-mashed muddle of styles and attitude that ultimately falters beneath the weight of it's own self-indulgence. The disc opens promisingly enough, with the snotty, in-your-face \\"Trouble.\\" All crunchy guitars and snarling vocals, this is the kind of song Joan Jett would have had a hit with twenty years ago. \\"God Is A DJ\\" tries to blend hard rock with dance grooves, failing miserably. With it's oh-so-deep lyrics - \\"If God is a DJ/Life is a dance floor/Love is the rhythm/You are the music\\" - this was expected to be one of the big singles off of TRY THIS. The fact that it completely bombed shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone. \\"Last To Know\\" is a high energy thrasher about a first date that doesn't turn out so well, while \\"Tonight's The Night\\" has a comfortable R&B groove to it. Picture a more laid-back \\"Get The Party Started.\\" \\"Oh My God\\" is a sultry slice of steamy funk, featuring a slammin' rap from Peaches. Pink's breathy yet firm vocals are probably the hottest on the disc, resulting in one of TRY THIS's best cuts. In a more perfect world, this would have been a great third single. \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\" has a nice retro soul vibe to it, but at the same time it also sounds like everything else producer Linda Perry has written in the last year or so. \\"Waiting For Love\\" is a trippy blend of 60's sitar, 70's guitar and stirring lyrics (\\"She prays to the Gods/Telling how she needs someone/Help me find where I am today/Life is looking very grey\\"). The track proves Pink can rock with the best of them, especially when she reigns her vocals in at just the right moment. \\"Save Me\\" features some thoughtful lyrics and a strong percussive punch, but the song is ultimately so light weight that it just kind of floats away. It's at this point that things start to get really rocky for TRY THIS, continuing thru most of the last third of the CD. \\"Try Too Hard\\" does just that....it tries too hard. With it's punky sk8ter boi thrash and cliched lyrics, this song about a pathetic poseur backfires on Pink. By the time she's singing the bridge of \\"You try too hard/You just try too hard\\" you want to scream back \\"YEAH.....ya do! Knock it off!!\\" \\"Humble Neighborhoods\\" is brilliant, though. Picture the big, marching vocals of Pink Floyd's \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\" mixed with one of the Runaways best tracks (say, \\"Queens Of Noise!\\"). Add a nice touch of keyboards and a breakneck rhythm section and you have what's missing from a lot of TRY THIS...rock & roll attitude that's real, but never seems posed or over the top. \\"Walk Away\\" is classic pop, one of Pink's five best songs to date. Punctuated with sassy horns, there's a Philly soul meets 70's So Cal rock groove going on. In all fairness, both of these songs should have been huge hit singles. The same can't be said about the rest of the CD. \\"Unwind\\" is a noisy, whiny piece about rock excess, resulting in a major pity party. The celebration continues with \\"Love Song\\", a treacly ballad that's probably meant to show the deep, human side of Pink, but instead comes across as hollow and calculated. The CD ends with the hidden track \\"Hooker\\", a profanity-laced, god-awful piece of garbage that does nothing more than A) rob three minutes of the listener's life and B) just reminds us of how young Pink still is. I mean, I remember how fun it was to curse and get away with it....in third grade! Here's hoping that lack of maturity is only a minor stumble, and that between now and her next release Pink will once again experience the kind of growth seen between her debut disc and MISSUNDAZTOOD. Said growth should help her to realize that content is much more important than image, something she fails to grasp on much of TRY THIS.st kind of floats away.

B0000C7PSW|5.0|I first recieved this from a friend who burned a copy for me. from the first note I was hooked. I immediately went to the store the next day and bought a copy. and then a few days later I bought  a few more. this record is incredible. it has many happy sounds of memory for me, personally. The best of Elton John circa 1972 Tumbleweed perhaps? and don't get me wrong, i'm not trying to pigeonhole Rufus. he pulls it off while surpassing his influences considerably. It certainly doesn't sound retro, what with the great production, the guitars, everything! I LOVE IT!!!! gush gush... BRAVO!
B00000JZI9|1.0|my opinion on this movie is that it was hard to beleive that none of the &quot;heroes&quot; were fatally shot or killed. They must have been shot at 50000 times for each of them and they were not even killed. They should rename this movie ,&quot;The Invincible Four&quot;. I really find it hard to beleive that the wild west was like that. I look for a movie to stick to the boundaries it was given for ex. if this movie was set on boundaries like the Matrix .. where you can fly, dodge bullets, jump on horses, jump in the air and shoot people.. then it would have made more sense but it was not set on those boundaries making it a stupid , hollywood film that really was just .. terrible. Also you all know that Jake screws around too much and would have been shot.. Mal with his stupid two shotguns fighting 6 people in a bar and winning was absurd.. Emmet getting trampled on by horses and not seeming to break any ribs.. Paden messing around with all the females and not getting hiv.. it was very bad.
B0001AP12G|4.0|So I was looking through the customer reviews to see what were the opinions of people who gave Kanye 1 star, and 99% of them are from \\"a music fan\\" from BKNY.  On one of them, he even said, he was a white girl from the suburbs.  If it wasn't for this guy posting a bunch of 1 star reviews, this album would be even closer to a 5 star average.  Man, if you don't like an album, it's cool, but please get a life and stop hating.  I'd like to get a diversity of opinion when I read these reviews, not 10 of the same person (can amazon do anything about this?).<br />Alright, now about the album.  I'm a big underground hip-hop fan, I basically hate everyone who's on the radio, but I can dig Kanye.  No, he's not the greatest lyricist, and his flow isn't the greatest, but that doesn't take away from the true strengths of this album.  The production is always strong, with no real throwaway beats (I especially like \\"Through the wire\\", \\"Family Business\\", and \\"Spaceship\\").  And even if Kanye isn't the greatest emcee, he does have some songwriting skills, which is a breath of fresh air given that about 90% of hiphop songs have no point whatsoever.  It's almost a good thing that he doesn't have much emcee skills, because he can't rely on freestyling and battle lyrics; instead he actually has to think about what he's gonna say.  And he does a good job of having a wide variety of topics, which is also rare.  Whether he's talking about his car accident (\\"Through the wire\\"), religion (\\"Jesus walks\\"), materialism (\\"All Falls Down\\"), family (\\"family business\\"), or Working menial jobs (\\"Spaceship\\", my personal favorite on the album)the songs are all strong and compelling.<br />This is not a classic, but it's definitely one of the better hip-hop albums of the year.  It's entirely listenable (except for \\"New Workout Plan\\", which I admit is horrible), and the skits are funny (though I do feel Kanye sends the wrong message about education when he starts dissing people who go to college).  Some people are complaining that it's soft.  Well, it sort of is.  It's definitely commercial, and there is no talking about killing people, and he doesn't even really have any battle raps talking about tearing emcees to shreds.  But that doesn't make it bad.  I would still bump this without feeling that is was too \\"pop\\".  As long as you stop trying to label him and just listen to the music, it's a good album.  And if all you guys can't handle the fact that the CD is pink-colored, then maybe you aren't very comfortable with your sexuality.  <br />Kanye is the only hope of me listening to the radio again; hopefully he will use his power for good and get quality emcees like Talib Kweli, Common, Dilated Peoples, and others the radio play they deserve.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I neither love or hate Avril Lavigne. I thought the songs Complicated, I'm With You and Sk8er Boi from her last album were good but sadly not the rest. So when I heard this album was much better, I decided to give it a listen.<br />Frankly, I have to say that I was quite dissapointed. I mean the music (guitars, bass, drums and all) sound great. Avril's voice even sounds good but the lyrics are just plain awful. It's not that they don't rhyme, or that they don't have meaning. It's just that they aren't catchy and there's no deeper meaning that goes beyond the usual teen drama. Therefore making it forgettable.<br />All you have to do is look at the songs that have stood the test of time such as &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Can You Feel The Love Tonight&quot;, &quot;No More Tears&quot;, &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; and so forth. Whether or not you like these songs or the artists is another issue, the point is these songs stand the test of time because the music and the lyrics run across the ages. It is something a lot of people can relate to. <br />Sure, crying about how your boyfriend betrayed you and left you is something anyone can do, in fact Alanis Morissette has already done it a million times. It's nothing new, very dull and gets boring very, very quickly.
0451169514|4.0|As a horror novel &quot;It&quot; works well, to my mind, even better than &quot;The Shining&quot;. Not that I was much scared. I was more touched by a deep sense of childhood, friendship, and the loss of innocense, which are the most important themes in the novel. &quot;It&quot; comprises all our chidhood fears, but most of all the fear of becoming an adult...
B000148KK2|4.0|The reason I bought this CD was for Krall's sultry and seductive cover of Tom Waits' &quot;Temptation&quot;. It's great. The songs she and her husband Elvis Costello wrote are just so-so. But there are two more delights to be found here. Her version of the Bonnie Raitt song &quot;Love Me Like A Man&quot; really rocks. It's got a good honky-tonk swing that's hard to resist. Her cover of Joni Mitchell's &quot;Black Crow&quot; is nice also. Krall obviously has an appreciation for this song and it shows. She's an excellent musician and vocalist. She knows jazz and her talent is on fine display here. However, the tracks with Costello are weak and don't blend well with the good covers she's done for a smooth flowing CD. I would still recommend &quot;Girl in the Other Room&quot; for her covers of Waits, Raitt and Mitchell's songs. The opening track, a cover of Mose Allison's &quot;Stop the World&quot; isn't bad either. It promises something that doesn't quite deliver on the whole. Still, Krall is always interesting and anything she does is worth checking out.
2070518426|5.0|I would recommend Harry Potter a l'ecole des sorciers for  everyone.  I chose to read this book for French class as a summer reading.  It isn't hard and I learned more French words as a result.  It is very exciting.  The cover was nicely done too.
6305971099|5.0|the more i read over the reviews the more i feel it is necessary to properly defend this movie to those who i can sense are not horror movie fans and are biastly saying this movie is bad.<br />ok well first off, some of the acting is bad, yeah, the psychic, connection, well if u saw 4, ud understand, at the end jamie has become michael in a sense, creating the connection, cheesy, yes, but it does, in the horror universe, make sense. the other thing i find people whining about is the whole mystery man, he is explained eventually, so why criticize it? if that is what ruins it for you, then i think the question must be asked, if you're rating this one so low, did you even like part 1 to begin with? if you aren't even a fan of the series, then please do not speak on the quality of this film, i know very many people like that, comedy lovers, who criticize horror. if you are a fan of the series, then i can accept the dislike for this movie, but if you have no room to speak, then don't. this movie is really good, especially to those, such as myself, who were children of the 80s, and this was best to us!
B00008BXJG|5.0|HIGHWAY TO HELL is AC DC's finest with their old lead singer Bon Scott.  The playing is tight, the songs are constructed for maxuim punch, and production is crisp and clear.  <BR>THE GOOD<BR>HIGHWAY TO HELL, GIRLS GOT RHYTHM, SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES, WALK ALL OVER YOU, are some of their finest.  This is the cd to start your Bon area with.  \\"Mutt\\" does a first class job on production, as always.<BR>THE BAD<BR>Including IF YOU WANT BLOOD, YOU GOT IT, which was just released on a live cd at the time.<br />C.P.O.V.<BR>With a song title like HIGHWAY TO HELL, you can pretty much tell were this song and cd is headed.  GIRLS GOT RHYTHM, TOUCH TOO MUCH, BEATING AROUND THE BUSH are all about sex in the first degree.  Lyrics are suggestive for then, but kind of tame for today's standards-EJW
6305971099|5.0|this is clearly the best of the sequels, simply for the fact that it has the most memorable ending of the halloweens, and has its most endearing character, jamie. Yeah it has its flaws, but so do all movies, and these movies should only be judged by those who at least like horror movies. now what sets 5 apart is the atmosphere, it seems so much more like actual halloween then all the others, and has a much darker coloration than the others. 4 has many of the same elements as 5, but 5 just brings you more into the action with jamie all alone without rachel. <BR>now, also u have to consider the other sequels before immediately saying this movie is bad. look at part 2, totally flawed and michael just magically gains superhuman abilities ex. pushing the nurse's head in boiling water, that burns her flesh away and leaves him perfect! now part 3, thats just a sad joke, enough said. 4 reasonably good but with lots of flaws about how michael and loomis are even alive, but overall good, and from what i've heard, the highest grossing of the sequels. part 6, psh, just trash! all new characters, except loomis, and that sad excuse for an actress trying to be danielle harris as jamie. (killing off jamie just made me hate the movie from the start) but it just introduces too much supernatural elements that make little sense and just overall blows. no wonder they made H20 leave that realm and make up a new, even gayer universe, where 4,5,and 6 do not exist. let H20 rot in hell for all time, the hands down worst sequel, not counting the sad excuse of part 3. the least deaths, the least action, the least sense-making plot, and just stupid to bring in a son now instead of jamie, as her daughter. uhg! i hope others realize how wrong H20 is! and last but not least, resurrection aka part 8; the movie that gave me hope in sequels for this series. entertaining is basically all it is, with some actual scare factor. the storyline is decent for getting others (non family related people) for michael to go after. though the writers are kind of dead-ended with this one, no one to really pursue now, but still, if this is the last, let it go out like this, than with H20!<BR>now with all this taken into consideration, any halloween fan should agree, 5 is the best sequel to this series and the combo of jamie, loomis, and michael, will always be the best mix for halloween. if u do not agree, i am sorry, but that's how it is.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|As I write this review,my thoughts float in the calm stream of Idylls end.The soundtrack as a whole is inspiring.From the thought provoking tunes of 'spectres in the fog ' to the heart-stomping shouts of &quot;red warrior&quot;,this is one of Hans Zimmers' best works and it is indeed a must have.
B00003CXCT|1.0|A great trilogy, with a plethora (do you know know what is a plethora?  Why would you use a word you do not know ze meaning of?) of extra tidbits, including color commentary from Lucas and Carrie.  BUT NO OPTION TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL. Lucas is such a control freak he won't give US the option of watching the original OR his bastardized updates?  Isn't that the beauty of DVD formats?  The room to let the viewer decide?  Save your money on this one, or I can guarantee Jar-Jar gets an extra 42 minutes screen time in the version 2.3 edition of Episode I--don't say I didn't warn ya.
B000002UDG|5.0|In terms of record sales and lasting popularity, Paul McCartney has had the most successful solo career out of all the former Beatles. By the time this cd was released in 1990, he had scored 41 chart entries, 22 of which made the top 10. In fact, the firts 37 all made the top 40. Only Elton John can boast anymore in a row. The 17 - song &quot;All The Best&quot; tries to capture all the best, and while it's far from perfect, it's still a wonderful cd.<br />This cd features many of McCartney's biggest solo hits. The bulk of this collection is made up of his time with Wings: the rockers &quot;Band On The Run&quot;, &quot;Junior's Farm&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot;, the chilling &quot;Let 'Em In&quot;, the soulful &quot;Listen To What The Man Said&quot;, the exhillerating &quot;Live And Let Die&quot;, the disco - tinged &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot; and &quot;Comin' Up&quot; and the uplifting &quot;With A Little Luck&quot;. Also, many of his big solo hits are here: &quot;Another Day&quot;, the cheery &quot;Uncle Albert&quot;/Admiral Halsey&quot;, the Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson smash duets &quot;Ebony And Ivory&quot; and &quot;Say Say Say&quot; and the 1984 smash &quot;No More Lonely Nights&quot;.<br />Still, many of his big hits are missing. Here's a list of all the songs that made Billboard's Hot 100 chart that aren't included on this collection:<br />&quot;Give Ireland Back To The Irish&quot; (number 21)<BR>&quot;Mary Had A Little Lamb&quot;/&quot;Little Woman Love&quot; (number 28)<BR>&quot;Hi Hi Hi&quot; (number 10)<BR>&quot;Helen Wheels&quot; (number 10)<BR>&quot;Sally G&quot; (number 39)<BR>&quot;Letting Go&quot; (number 39)<BR>&quot;Venus And Mars Rock Show&quot; (number 12)<BR>&quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; (for me the most shocking omission) (number 10)<BR>&quot;Girls School&quot; (number 33)<BR>&quot;I've Had Enough&quot; (number 25)<BR>&quot;London Town&quot; (number 39)<BR>&quot;Getting Closer&quot; (number 20)<BR>&quot;Arrow Through Me&quot; (number 29)<BR>&quot;Take It Away&quot; (number 10)<BR>&quot;Tug Of War&quot; (number 53)<BR>&quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; (number 2)<BR>&quot;So Bad&quot; (number 23)<BR>&quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (number 7)<BR>&quot;Press&quot; (number 21)<BR>&quot;Stranglehold&quot; (number 81)<BR>&quot;My Brave Face&quot; (number 25)<BR>&quot;This One&quot; (number 94)<BR>&quot;Figure Of Eight&quot; (number 92)<br />But it would take a boxed set to include all of these great songs. Until that boxed set's released, &quot;All The Best&quot; is a perfect sampler for some of Macca's biggest solo hits. Enjoy.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|am i alone in my view that 'room is fire' is superior to 'is this it'?  their debut album has spent many, many hours in my CD rotation, and i know it backwards and forwards, and i must say, i find the sophomore album a bit stronger, actually.  the first half of the disc is excellent.  i tend to think that it fades a bit toward the end, but i think on the whole the percentage of good songs to mediocre ones is higher on 'room on fire' than on 'is this it.'<br />admittedly, this isn't high-end work.  the guitar solos are utterly weak (sophomoric, even), the forms predictable (though are better here than on the first disc -- 'you're talking too much' is quite interesting, formally), the lyrics still often seem a bit childish, but ... it's still utterly enjoyable music.  frankly, it's fun, sing-along-in-the-car stuff.  at the very least, it's certainly as good as the acclaimed 'is this it.'
B00000JZI9|4.0|I think this movie is very good, I usually dislike westerns but this one was great. I liked the fact that this movie was full of action and suspense. The plot was very good also. I'm not a fan of western movies but for some reason I liked this one. This movie was full of action through out the whole 132 minutes of it, to me that is what makes a good action film.  The acting was great , Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, and Kevin Costner did a great job in this movie. One of the most memorable parts of the movie to me was when Cobb(the sheriff) says &quot; this used to be such a peaceful town&quot;. One thing I disliked about this movie was that it was kind of hard to follow along. Overall I give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars.
B00003CXCT|1.0|If you have any love for the original \\"Star Wars\\" Trilogy you WILL NOT buy this set! Lucas knows that even if it sucks, we will pay for anything that has the name \\"Star Wars\\" written on it. By saying, \\"Well, it's the lame-o Special Edition, but it's better than nothing\\" and shelling out hard earned money for this set, you're just playing into his hands! We need to rise up against Lucas! He has gone to the Dark Side! Send a message that he had no right to change OUR movie just because HE wasn't satisfied with it. This trilogy is bigger than him, and it's bigger than all of us! So go forth and protest, and may the Force be with you.<br />PS-I actually give it ZERO stars, but that wasn't an option.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|From Academy Award winning director Anthony Minghella (\\"The English Patient\\", \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\") comes \\"Cold Mountain\\", one of the most powerful, stunning, and unforgettable epics ever to grace the big screen! The direction of Minghella was nothing short of extraordinary! The performances of Academy Award nominee Jude Law (\\"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence\\") and Academy Award winners Nicole Kidman (\\"The Hours\\") and Renee Zellweger (\\"Chicago\\") were, in every possible way, outstanding! Rounding out the cast are Eileen Atkins (\\"Cold Comfort Farm\\"), Brendan Gleeson (\\"Lake Placid\\"), Philip Seymour Hoffman (\\"Punch-Drunk Love\\"), Natalie Portman (\\"Star Wars: Episodes I and II\\"), Giovanni Ribisi (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\"), Donald Sutherland (\\"A Time to Kill\\"), Ray Winstone (\\"Sexy Beast\\"), Kathy Baker (\\"Lush Life\\"), Jack White (of the White Stripes), and Melora Walters (\\"Magnolia\\"), in which they gave excellent performances alongside the three leads.<br />From the best-selling novel by Charles Frazier, \\"Cold Mountain\\" puts the focus on W.P. Inman (Law), a carpenter from Cold Mountain, N.C. who develops an attraction for a proper lady named Ada Monroe (Kidman), while working on building a new church. Ada catches an eye for Inman when she arrives in the town of Cold Mountain with her father, Rev. Monroe (Sutherland). Unable to express himself, Inman finds it difficult to express his feelings for Ada, which she eagerly returns with similar shyness. When the Civil War comes into Cold Mountain, Inman, along with a handful of others, enlists in the fight, leaving behind Ada just as they were about to embark on a passionate romance of their own. Over the next four years, Ada sends Inman letters of love and hope, even as her own life is beginning to fall apart. In the aftermath of the war, not to mention recovering from a gunshot wound, Inman decides to desert the Confederacy and return home to Cold Mountain. Along the way, Inman meets an assortment of colorful characters that alternately help and hinder his progress, including a young mother (Portman) and another reverend (Hoffman) of a town that Inman is passing through. Back in Cold Mountain, Ruby Thewes (Zellweger), a drifter and skilled farmhand, walks into Ada's life and helps her tend to the land, as well as protecting her from the lawmen (led by Winstone) who look to take over the nearly deserted town.<br />\\"Cold Mountain\\", once again, comes from the Charles Frazier's best-selling novel of long-lost love, companionship, and redemption, set against the time of rapid morale loss of the South during the final moments of the Civil War. Writer/director Minghella does quite a job in adapting the book for the big screen. However, with exact attention to detail, magnificent casting, and source material ripe for the picking, \\"Cold Mountain\\" makes for a stirring success in every way imaginable.<br />While the film is exquisitely mounted and written, a good chunk of its power comes from the supporting cast, as Minghella took advantage of planting acting surprises around every corner. As Jude Law's Inman makes his pilgrimage to Cold Mountain, he meets up with the likes of fine actors as, once again, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Melora Walters, Jena Malone, and an excellent Natalie Portman. As for Nicole Kidman's internal journey of Ada, she encounters Donald Sutherland, Ray Winstone, Charlie Hunnam, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Brendan Gleeson, Ethan Suplee, and Jack White (of the White Stripes band). The community vibe of the actors is intoxicating, casting a spell over the film.<br />The three leads of \\"Cold Mountain\\" do not disappoint either, to say the least. Jude Law brings a quiet, hungry determination to his almost dialog-free role of Inman. Nicole Kidman tackles another accent and succeeds. Minghella has chosen her journey of Ada as the most profound of the story, and Kidman rises to the challenge elegantly, adding another notch to her impressive film career, not to mention coming off an Academy Award win for her role in \\"The Hours\\". Law and Kidman both shade their performances accordingly, staying true to their situation, which is even more heartbreaking and ultimately devastating to behold. The real soul of \\"Cold Mountain\\" is found in the Academy Award winning supporting performance of Renee Zellweger's Ruby. The brunt nature of Ruby is an element to Zellweger's acting. There are passionate performances all around, guided well by Minghella, but Zellweger is different and brilliant in her own unique cadence and posture.<br />In conclusion, \\"Cold Mountain\\" comes at a time when big battles and epic landscapes are all the rage. Through Anthony Minghella's ace direction, the film transforms from a prospective thudding tearjerker to something much more enriching and absorbing. \\"Cold Mountain\\" is a remarkable motion picture, and an unforgettable one at that. Especially since the film has top-notch talents from an all-star cast and the characters that they portray, riveting storytelling, and heartfelt emotion. I now own the 2-disc DVD, with features such as deleted scenes, \\"making-of\\" documentaries, storyboard comparisons, and much more. There will be no other film quite like \\"Cold Mountain\\"!
1400032717|3.0|Don't be fooled, this piece is by no means a 4 star winner. Just another case of stars wantonly being thrown around all over the place, which I have been noticing quite often with higher ranked reviewers. What a curious incident....<br />Actually, the book is pretty entertaining, well-written, has an amicable character who somewhat horribly tends to get on the old nerves from time to time. Every now and then, his talking style is tough to take and I eventually found myself able to finish many of his sentences without reading them because I was used to his repetition. This person would be Christopher, the protagonist, an autistic kid who rides the &quot;special&quot; bus to school. He's fifteen, but seems ten, and we are reading his book. He began writing it after finding a dog stuck with a pitchfork and decided to find the killer.<br />I found the approach here very interesting. It starts out as an actual whodunnit and it becomes weird that the author would pick a &quot;special&quot; kid as his Sherlock Holmes. After awhile it becomes more and more evident that its not the author Haddon's book, but Christopher's and it cannot be taken at face value as an all out detective story. It can't be. Because it's just a kid telling us about his mini adventure through the neighborhood. I was almost fooled.<br />This becomes more and more evident as the book goes on. The detective plot takes a different turn and becomes a road story as Christopher is faced with a new obstable concerning the death of his mother years ago. This turns out to involve his father, who loves him dearly, Mrs. Shears across the street, the old lady down the way and his beloved teacher at &quot;special school.&quot; The dog takes the backseat and a human story about love, loss, bravery and trust takes form through the eyes of a mentally troubled kid who seems to be the love child of Forrest Gump and Rain Man.<br />The things I liked most about the piece were the occasional digressions about math(s) which Christopher is a whiz at, of course. His little drawings and ideas about life that he deduced through math(s) problems are often wildly fascinating. I enjoyed this book, but it's simplicity and sometimes annoying main character and his words tried my patience.ich Christopher is a whiz at, of course.

B00006D295|5.0|This is a very outrageous movie. The rock is the background to tell us a horror movie but also spiced with sex , ransvestism and above all a splendid tribute to the movies specially King Kong .<br />One couple strands in an old house full of weirdos . This movie (here between you and me)could have inspired for Tim Burton in Beetle juice .<br />In this decade there were great visuals films too . Sherman built a magnificent story absolutely free , intelligent and sarcastic, irreverent and bitter . You might state that Fellini's influence (dressed of english manners and clothes) is present all along the film .<br />Inmediatly after its release this one acquired the status of cult movie.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is a book that truly makes one wonder about the possibilities of literature. In reading the book, I found out that the theme is not that complex: basically, a tiger and a teenager named Pi Patel get trapped on a lifeboat for many days. This is the story of their survival. While at first, the reader's expectations would expect something magical, he/she will discover that Life of Pi is more like a reality TV show. The book goes into great detail about how Pi survives the unimaginably hostile circumstances (no water, food, salt, toilet facilities, and a 450 pound Sunderban tiger). Also, this book has more than a tinge of spirituality. This would be expected, as Pi later attributes his survival to his &quot;forgetfullness&quot; and belief in God. Moreover, Life of Pi would make a good beginner's guide to understanding the change from a human being to a castaway. Ultimately, I feel, it is the superb style of narration that will last in my mind for a long long time. I was more than once astounded about how much you can write about such a simple situation. But Martel accomplishes much more than masterful narration: he has a truly marvelous sense of humor (at times offensive). Now, after having read the entire book, I am still fascinated by mere thought of Pi's unforgettable journey. <br />Also recommended:  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and RED AZALEA
B00000JZI9|2.0|From my opinion the movie is boring and they need more blood and violence. They need more matrix and the sound doesnt help the movie at all. If anyone wants to take me to the movie i would say &quot;no&quot;. And if  i had to say one word about the movie it would be&quot; BORING&quot;. And i would never pay my own money to go watch the movie. &quot;I didnt understand it and i didnt like it&quot;.
B00000JZI9|5.0|I like many western movies specially Clint eastwood movies &quot;The good the bad and the ugly&quot; and also&quot;For a few dollars more and A fist full of dollars&quot; and other westerns too. But this one is amzing (Silverado) the action was so breathtaking with all the shooting and the adventures it was great, but i wold put more credit on the shooting it was so professional with the tricks I think this movie is more different and unique from other westerns. And the music in that movie was great becouse were ever there was an exiting moment it would have have a tune, an exiting tune! but not only on an action event. There is this funny quote in the movie that i liked, so there is this guy named emmet that finds this man in the desert laying on the ground half dead so emmet gives water to the man on the ground and the man looks up and tells emmet &quot;pleased to meet you&quot; . That quote was just funny  well atleast to me but i know some other people will think its funny too. So yes i do recommend this movie to anyone.

B0001Z52RU|3.0|The surprising thing about The Butterfly Effect is how entertaining it is, considering its flaws. The title comes from a theory that the movement of a butterfly's wings could theoretically cause a hurricane halfway around the world.<br />This film explores the possibility that changing one aspect of the past would have unforeseeable consequences. I found the premise interesting enough that I was able to overlook --most of the time-- the often amateurish way it was executed. Ashton Kutcher plays Evan, a young man who discovers that, by reading journals written as a child, he is able to re-enter the past and change events. These events all revolve around his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh (Amy Smart), her sociopathic brother Tommy (William Lee Scott) and their friend Lenny (Elden Henson). Evan learns that his father also had this ability, though it drove him to insanity.<br /> I found the story engrossing from beginning to end. The problem is, writers/directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber apparently felt compelled to keep the action at the level of \\"B\\" horror movie schlock. Everything is over-the-top. Every time Evan changes something, someone is either brutally murdered or maimed; in one scene a dog is set on fire. Several outcomes involving an accident with a firecracker each lead to the goriest imaginable results. In one scenario, Kayleigh becomes a prostitute, and her appearance, and that of the run-down hotel where she lives is almost a parody. So are several other scenes, including one where Evan is about to be sodomized by Nazi inmates in a prison, and another where he winds up an invalid. Rather than being confident in the basic premise of the story, the film distracts us with superfluous gore and melodrama.<br />Despite all of this, I still enjoyed this movie and remained interested right through the last scene. Changing the past may be like a cosmic Rubik's Cube. Every time Evan changes one event, some other unexpected (and catastrophic) thing happens. The premise is similar to the more lighthearted (and better done) Groundhog Day. Ashton Kutcher's performance in this film has been criticized, but considering the improbable series of changes and misadventures he is put through, he doesn't do a bad job. The other actors (including the childhood versions of the adults) all give good performances. The Butterfly Effect is an interesting and compelling movie that, had it been toned down a little (or maybe a lot) could have been much better.premise is similar to the more lighthearted (and better done) Groundhog Day.

630196697X|1.0|Made during the height of the cold war hysteria,<BR>this film gets sidetracked by mindless red baiting. <BR>It also descends into cheesy melodrama on a couple of<BR>occasions marring the pacing of the movie.  It's too<BR>bad but pickup doesn't live up to its reputation as<BR>top notch noir.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|So there are already a ton of reviews for this movie and while I didn't read all of them, I read enough to realize that no one really addresses the insanity issue.  Doesn't anyone else think that maybe it was really all in his head? Some of the things his neurologist said made some sense to me, especially if you consider his family's medical history.  I liked this film because it was surprising and a bit out of the norm.  I liked the premise and I think it was quite well done-and I agree that Kutcher did a surprisingly fine job. It made me think and yearn for more.  I enjoyed and recommend it.
B00005JMYG|3.0|Will Ferrell is an acquired taste.  You either get it or you don't. Much of what he does in \\"Anchorman\\" reminds me a lot of Bill Murray's moves; but Murray's moves one step removed. Ferrell's shtick is a hit and miss situation: sometimes it works, other times not.<br />Nonetheless, there are a couple of hilarious scenes in \\"Anchorman\\": the \\"Westside Story\\" meets \\"Braveheart\\" hand-to-hand combat scene between all the San Diego News teams is one. Also, Christina Applegate is smart, sexy and pretty and more to the point she is becoming quite the accomplished comedic actress.<br />Ultimately, \\"Anchorman\\" is not as smart, funny and witty that it thinks it is...but hey---maybe that's the point.
B00005JKNC|5.0|I think this movie was excellent.  I was not too sure if I was going to enjoy this movie because I am so use to seeing Jim Carrey playing a comedy role, but he pulled it off and did a great job.  The setting of this movie is in a town I wish I could live in where everyone knows everyone.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Again, New Line and Peter Jackson have given generously to the fans with this extended DVD collection that, as the extended Fellowship of the Ring collection did, betters the theatrical release by miles. Additional scenes, more great and interesting bonus material, along with a great film, add up to a worthy purchase for fans. You definitely get your money's worth. Sure it is long, but its Lord of the Rings and Jackson's epic vision make you want to leap into the film and stay as long as you can.<BR>As for the film itself, it is not as good as the first -- this one is the least like the book and that can be bothersome to many of the purists out there, especially concerning Faramir; also, there are some definite slow parts, such as the Aragorn / Arwen dream sequence and the Galadriel / Elrond sequence. The pace slows and almost gets tedious. But Helm's Deep saves it all with the most amazing battle sequence ever filmed. <BR>So for the film itself I would give 4 stars, but as a complete package it gets a solid 5 stars. Classic.
B000007NYS|5.0|This is one of my favorite Lucinda Williams albums.  <BR>Lucinda is a very talented songwriter.  I love her voice as she sings her own songs.  She also does a a most excellent job on the classic blues songs.  Of these my favorite is `Nothing In Rambling'.  I'd buy the CD for this song alone.
B000089RVX|5.0|First off, I agree with the person who said don't rate Evanescence by just Bring Me to Life.  Although I enjoy the song, it was overplayed and isn't very much like their other songs and overall feel.<br />Overall, I think that this album is one of the better albums out there.  However, hard-core rockers will always find things to say about the band or the songs because the lyrics aren't explicit or some of the band members haven't committed battery, etc, yet I feel that it's nice to have a band with a rock sound whose lyrics can be listened too while in the presence of a grandmother or small child.<br />My favorite songs on the album are Imaginary, My Last Breath, and Whisper.  Imaginary is a quaint little song about about being in your own little world, My Last Breath is a song with potent lyrics, and Whisper is just a great album ender.<br />Evanescence worked well for me as a bridge into some other rock bands.  I don't listen to the lyrics as much as some people, and Fallen is a great album just to have for background noise.  Lead singer Amy Lee has a great variety of voices (I don't care if some may be enhanced), but I especially enjoy the string background.  On the Evanescence website, Lee tells how she has a good knowledge of classical music, and this album shows it.  The cello in Hello is great, and the string melody at the end of Whisper is my most favorite part of the whole album.  I guess I would describe this album for me as ear candy.
B00003CXDB|4.0|Oliver Stone will never be known for subtlety.  \\"Wall Street\\" bashes you over the head with its message- getting to the top in society requires duplicity, dishonesty, and the willingness to destroy any obstacle.  However, unlike Ayn Rand, Stone vilifies rather than lauds this dubious morality.  Bud Fox is a fresh faced, innocent stock broker trying to get ahead through hard work and elbow grease, as he was taught by his father.   Bud soon meets powerful, charismatic corporate raider Gordon Gekko, incapable of love, remorse, or empathy.  Gekko, we are told, sold NASA short 15 minutes after the Challenger exploded (impossible since the shuttle was destroyed in 1986 and the film is set in 1985!).  Gekko predictably seduces Bud with his world of \\"perks\\", and Bud's star rises dramatically the farther he falls into corruption.<br />Throughout the film, Bud serves as a sounding board for the rival values of Gekko and his father.  The speech most cited by critics and fans is the immortal \\"Greed is Good\\" monologue.  While this speech, standing alone, is a vigorous defense of capitalism and selfishness, it is important to note that Gekko is using it at a shareholders' meeting against a lousy, entrenched, and greedy management!<br />Inevitably, Bud is forced to decide whether to follow his father's philosophy or Gekko's, and to pay the price for his misdeeds.  A slight complaint with the ending- the fate of Gekko is hinted at rather than displayed.  Gordon Gekko has become something of a hero for young, wanna-be big shots, who are attracted to the glamour of his lifestyle and his &quot;up your's, I got mine!&quot; attitude much as Bud was.  Perhaps seeing Gekko get his comeuppance could have made an impression.  <br />Overall, Wall Street is a tight, well done character drama populated with iconic characters delivering iconic dialogue that acts as an indictment of a decade.  The movie and its message will stay with you long after viewing it.<br />As for the DVD, the sound, although in 5.1, is relegated almost exclusively to the center channel.  One does not hear the sounds of Manhattan from all directions as Bud navigates the concrete jungle.  The video quality appears grainy in some areas.  This is a great movie worthy of better treatment on DVD.
B00000JZI9|5.0|This movie was a great western movie out of all the movies I seen of western this one had alot of action and I really enjoyed it.&quot;The Silverado&quot;has all the good stuffs that make a great movie to me.The only thing I hate is that they are raises against black.This movie showed that black people could be as good or better than the white people.Mal was a black guy but even though he was black Paden,Emmett and Jake were Mal's friends even though Mal was black.Paden,Emmett,Jake and Mal really proved to the community that always try to have peace on your country to have a nice and long life.Specially Mal prove that black people are as good or even better than white people.JUST BECAUSE I SAY THIS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M RAISES!!!!!!!!!!!                                      <BR>    &quot;The Silverado&quot;showed alot of good action.I LOVE ACTION MOVIES!!&quot;The Silverado&quot;was different from any western movie because most of the western movies are black and white and I hate that.What  think about &quot;The Silverado&quot;sountrack is really good and it go's with every scene.the suspense,foreshadowing and everything else.I personally don't like foreshadowing because I like to be surprise.my favorite quote was when Jake said'I been playing dead.&quot;I really recommend 'The Silverado' to all the people who like action movies because&quot;The Silverado&quot; is full of action.
6305079811|3.0|This review applies to the current Image DVD release.  Most people who purchase Flash Gordon remember it from their childhood and wish to relive a part of it.  No complaint there!  Unfortunately, the DVD is now out of print and a copy can be expensive.  About the only thing commendable about the disc is its widescreen aspect ratio.  The soundtrack clearly warbles in places, the sound mix is not in 5.1 and generally lousy, and the video is grainy throughout.  This is quite a shame, because the soundtrack and effects lend themselves to a great presentation.  There are no extra features at all.  <br />The DVD release rights were licensed by Universal to Image Entertainment.  I have purchased 3 Image DVDs and they have all been massive disappointments.  Fortunately, Universal re-released Sixteen Candles and I hope they will eventually do the same for Flash Gordon.
B000089RVX|3.0|The popularity of Evanescence can be attributed to the idea of a female vocalist in a rock/metal band. It is an idea who's time has come. The trouble with this is that on the international metal scene, this has been going on for quite some time. It is only because american's have no experience with the better bands out there that Evanescence thrives.<br />This is a band who was repackaged to more or less fit the radio/mtv trend of nu-metal linkin style music. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of a member of 12 Stones on &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;. He was obviously included to make this band acceptable to the nu-metal linkin park kiddies. Sort of a spring board which could be used as a transitional piece from linkin park to what Evanescence is all about.<br />In my opinion, unlike bands which are their superior, their *only* vision is dollar signs. Not artistic value. The lyrics can at times be cheesy - with a very american pop radio feel. The guitaring is overly simplistic in that nu-metal kind of way, and there are some obviously gimicky vocal moments.<br />Unlike what others have said, Nightwish sounds nothing like Evanescence. Not one little bit. People who think they do, are simply stuck on the idea of a female singer in metal. However, that aside, one should look towards bands such as Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, Amaran, Bloodflowerz or any of the many other actual and good melodic metal bands out there. The more open minded and courageous among you might also want to look into Within Temptation (the song Beneath from their Exordium album is a good sampler) and After Forever (Ice Queen from their Mother Earth album is a good sampler). After you delve into bands such as all of those and more, you will one day look back and realize that Evanescence is lacking.<br />After all of that, you may wonder why i have given this album 3 stars. I've done this for almost one reason exclusivly: Amy Lee. Her voice and singing ability makes this album worth listening to. And once you accept that this isn't a great or innovative band, you can sit back and enjoy what this album *does* have to offer.
B00003CX96|4.0|Watching \\"Breaking Away\\" is like visiting an old buddy in a familiar town.  The film is about four friends who have graduated high school and aren't quite sure whether to embrace adulthood and the future or to shun it and cling instead to their childhood identities and each other.  There is a great deal of warmth and gentle humor throughout the film, and the performances are winning.  <br />Mike (Dennis Quaid), the leader of the group, clings to his friends as reminders of his days as high school quarterback and fears they will prove to be his best.  Moocher is eager for adulthood and is planning to marry his girlfriend.  The only problem is he cannot keep a job!  Cyril (Daniel Stern) is resigned to the fact he may never leave Bloomington, but remains buoyant regardless.  Dave Stohler is the main character, he knows exactly what he wants to be, an Italian Cyclist.  There is only one problem- he isn't Italian!  Dave learns through a young woman he meets and eventually through his father that simply being Dave is more than good enough, and that he must embrace his natural talents and the future.  There have been countless \\"coming of age\\" pictures, but this one is the most enjoyable!<br />DVD: The production values of the DVD leave something to be desired and therefore I only give the product 4 stars.  The lack of 5.1 surround is a disappointment, as well as the quality of the video.  A commentary track featuring the four leads would have been an interesting addition.  The only extras are a couple of trailers.
B0000009SF|5.0|Thirty years after \\"Grand Wazoo\\" was released, it remains as much a stunning example of Zappa's uncompromising musical vision now as it did then.<br />Although it is accurate to say that it continued the Jazz explorations of \\"Waka Jawaka\\" or deserves to be compared with \\"Hot Rats\\" as one of Frank's most accomplished instrumental albums, this alone does not paint the full picture of what this album has to offer. \\"Grand Wazoo\\" is an astonishinng work of melodic inventiveness and orchestration, each of its tunes can leave you breathless with their wealth of ideas and ironic genius.<br />Zappa, as praised as he has been, remains deserving of further acknowledgement. What do I mean? This guy belongs to a very small and selected group of American composers without whom it would be literally impossible to think of American music, period.<br />Zappa -like Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington or Miles Davis, to name a few- in their own ways, were ... are! ... artists who transformed the musical genres they cultivated, and made them something they have never been before.<br />In Zappa's case, the amazing satirist he was or the tremedous guitar player he could be, often, overshadowed the seminal composer and arranger he's always been. This album does the latter complete and unarguable justice.
B00000JZI9|3.0|I never liked western movies, and I don't think i'll ever like it. well I only like it when there is a shoot-out. Like when there are some people in the bar fighting for some little thing, so they are just shooting at each other or killing themselves with knives. When they start fighting I start liking it a little bit, but then they just start talking and I just ignore it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I only like scary movies because they are interesting they don't get boring because it's scaring you every time. The only thing Ilike about the movie was the soundtrack ( even though it didn't scared me when it started). The soundtrack sounded like ... whoa.                                                                           I think it would have been better if it was louder. I am not sure what I should recomend to the people, just that it was kind of good because of the shoot-out, the rest I don't know I thaught it was boaring because there was no action they were just talking about I don't know what.                                   In the movie I look for it to be scary ( even though I get scare in the night) for it to have a great sountrack and the soundtrack to be loud sothat it could scare the kreep out of you. What amkes the movie suck is if it doesn't have no action, and if they just talk and don't do anything interesting. Like in the movies in black and white, those one really suck no ofense but they don't do anything interesting they just talk and talk.                                                                                              What I also look for in a movie are good actors because some actors are to nervousor forget there lines. I like alot of different type of movies like scary the ones of karate and craft movies. It sounds better with the soundtrack and very loud ( more when there is a scary part , I don't know what to recomend you just that if you like movies with action don't waste your time and money on it.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Oh, so smug. Pretty much exactly what I was expecting but with a higher degree of tongue-in-cheek humor and some stylish violent atmospherics. Brainless homage to cheap violent Asian kung-fu films based on a comic book remains adolescent and entertaining throughout. Personally I'd like a date with the &quot;Hiyeee!&quot; girl with the spiked ball and chain.
B00005JMYG|4.0|To the people that are bashing this movie...I'm not sure what type of movie you were expecting when you went to watch this, but your not going to see any Oscar winning acting..IT'S A COMEDY!!!!!!! I thought it was great, I thought Ferrell was great I thought the cast was great....I didn't think the plot was great but what comedy plot is great, the comedy should cover the fact that it has a week plot and this movie did that for me. The only reason I give this 4 and not 5 stars is because I only give 5 stars to Dumb and Dumber, and Billy Madison, after that...this movie is right up there.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|When I first heard about this DVD I thought &quot;omg Daft Punk has a video with manga&quot;!!! Actually I didn't even read what it was about. So I bought it and I loved it. The songs go with the parts they play in the video. It's so good even without talking. My favorite parts in the DVD are the beginning with One more time because partying at a concert is what you think of when you hear that song. I also like Digital Love because I really do think of him going to get the girl he loves when I hear that song. Then my third favorite part is Something about Us because it is the saddest and best part of the video. Overall the video is really, really, REALLY good. It sounds very good in surround sound and has good sound effects. The storyline is good too and you can watch it over and over again. I'd reccomend for everyone to buy this DVD.
B000294SFW|5.0|It's almost amazing that after a quarter of a century, Lemmy still has enough to kick you in the teeth with something new AND far more advanced than all this junk that people are calling Rock and Roll these days.<br />God Bless Motorhead!!
B00000JZI9|2.0|Well I dont like Westerns but this movie is about of a chance meeting, four cowboys on horseback are drawn together to defeat a sheriff and his bad posse. An unjoyable bad western.I dont really like westerns though this movie had a really bad story to it.This movie was super boring all they do id shoot eachother for money and then they go to bars and get drunk and then then they start fighting for no reason.There are cowboy,horses,and hookers in the movie and I just personaly think it was a stupid movie. But maybe people who like  Westerns might like this movie but I didnt like it at all.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I've seen a lot of Hollywood crap, and I was just getting sick of that whole movie industy when I happened to see American Beauty. I'm a story-line fanatic and I've seen way too many stupid blunders on most movies, but this one was just flawless.<BR>It was absolutely perfect. In fact, the only camparable movie to this one was that Korean film, Old Boy.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Tough one for me.  I love Burton films and am a big fan of most of the actors.  When I watched this, I was ready to be pulled into Tim Burton's dreamy, fairy-tale world and I ... wasn't.  Beautiful to look at, nice score, fine actors - but I really felt the schmaltz come through in a mainstream don't-give-the audience-credit kind of way.  Burton's best makes you feel as sad, happy, schmalzty as the best of them, but without your feeling so commercially manupulated.  There is a depth missing here and sadly, I felt nothing but a pretty surface on this.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Rolling Stones Led It Bleed is indeed a wonderful album. I have the 1986 abkco version on CD were all of the songs are out of order. The new version is just as better including hits like Midnight Rambler, and Gimmie Shelter. I think Let It Bleed is the best Rolling Stone's studio album for so many reason's. So I gave this 5 flaming stars for the worlds greatest rock n roll band. This is a must have for any stone fan Led It Bleed is the real deal. Highly Recomended!
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Beautiful performances from the cast make this one the worthwhile film that is. I enjoyed watching really good actors flex their muscles with strong tragic material, I guessed at the mystery and stayed glued to it until the end.  BUT, I never felt really involved.  A big part of me felt removed from the story so the dramatic and emotional impact was severely lessened.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is a terrible shame that an excellent show like this had to get cut short so early. it had a brilliant cast, with nathan fillion, and jewel staite (my favorite :) )   among others.  The main problem is since it wwas cut short, the thr &quot;river&quot; case was left unsolved.  Nonetheless,  this show is excellent, but it would have been fathoms better if they had continued.  But, after  all this it is still my favorite show!<br />Robert, 13
B00000JLWW|4.0|titanic...The Movie....Is just that.<BR>I enjoy the story, from that perspective.<BR>I appreciate the effort to create a level of interest in such an event. Drama can attempt to capture,   only  you  can  respond! <BR>In reading short 4-5star reviews, and Loooong 2-3star reviews, I believe the connection has been made, as planned!
B00006JDVV|3.0|Many people felt the need to trash this movie just because it didn't have dragons in every scene. While there are better dragon films, Reign of Fire had some good special effects to it. There are a few points of intensity,the violence factor isn't too heavy (otherwise this film would have received an R rating), and the ending seems a bit mediocre but the movie is still worth a look.
0767827716|1.0|This movie was the biggest disappointment of any Stephen Kings books.  If anyone read the book they would know about the deep characters built, and the story line.  Instead the worthless John Carpenter skipped the real story of Christine, didn't even have the Lebay alive at the beginning and just his brother- please.  This is like a movie version if you bought Cliff notes.  I was never more disappointed in a SK book to movie in my life.
B000099T2L|5.0|This C.D. is the BEST...you can tell she put a lot of hard work into it and you can actually feel and understand her emotions through her music!Her duet with Luther Vandross was so good I used it as my wedding song. I'm tired of people hating on Beyonce .......let it go if she can't sing why does she have 5 grammys and more money than any of us can count!!!
B00006EXL5|5.0|Yeah. One of the best damn cds out there. After an...interesting...intro, the album kicks off into sheer amazingness with the first song; &quot;Honey, this mirror isn't big enough for the two of us&quot; (great live, I might add). &quot;Headfirst for Halos&quot; is a dash of inspirational music with a variety of...charmingly morbid lyrics, i.e. &quot;And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling&quot;, while &quot;Demolition Lovers&quot; is simply an amazing tragic love song. Worth mentioning also is &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows, one of the best on the album. This CD makes my top five. And we all know how valued my opinion is amongst you fellows.
B00000IP4H|4.0|Usually bands slow down over time. This obviously wasn't the case with Testament. The first song only plays for about 20 seconds before you realize how heavy this is. <br />Eric Peterson and Chuck Billy are the only originals here. They brought their first bassist, before they started recording back, and they added ex-Death, ex-Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan.<br />The vocals are down right intimidating. They aren't Cannibal Corpse like because Billy doesn't exactly sound like he is puking. The vocals sound like someone who has smoked two cartons a day for ten years. <br />The guitar work is great on such numbers as &quot;The Burning Times&quot; and &quot;Murky Waters&quot; but is otherwise surprisingly experimental (in a boxed kind of way).<br />The drumming is good yet way too generic for Gene Hoglan's abilities. The bass is noexistent for most of the album.<br />I'm a huge fan of the old Testament (pre-1994/Low era) and I like this album quite a bit although I don't know why. Don't let the &quot;Death Metal&quot; label intimidate you from buying this album just beware that this is nothing like &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot;, &quot;The New Order&quot;, or even their album before this &quot;Low&quot;. The album after this (&quot;The Gathering&quot;) didn't even sound that much like this one.<br />Overall there are some great songs like &quot;The Burning Times&quot;, but other than the few standouts (which make the album) most of the work is generic enough. There are probably about five standout songs in my opinion. If you're a fan of the band, tread carefully here. You'll either hate it or love it. Not much of an in-between here.
B00025ETIW|4.0|...but still a worthy successor. Signing to a larger label is bound to have its high points as well as its consequences; and the music simply isn't as good as it was on &quot;I brought you my bullets you brought me your love.&quot; Nevertheless, quite a good album. Definately worth the ten $ I spent for it.
B000002IMG|5.0|Heavy, Brutal, Great backing vocals, great main vocals...IT'S ALL SO GOOD! Where does one start with such a masterpiece?    I believe this is Testament's best album. Regardless of the merits of my position I do believe this is a major step up from thier debut the previous year. The album starts off with Skolnick's \\"Bach-rock\\" errie guitar playing intro only to then descend into a heavy mid-tempo Thrash song.    The Vocals are great. Chuck Billy's talents are showcased here: There are high points where he screams and there are low points where his growl makes you quiver. Very Talented.    The guitar work is one of a kind. Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson make a great duo. The work is overall very heavy (for the time) and insanely complex (listen to some of the solos and intros.)    The bassist does a good job of making himself known unlike in their '87 release. Other than the bass-only parts, he blends in pretty well with the rest of the crew.    The drumming is generic but better than in their debut. Mostly just normal rock beats. There is a little bit more double-bass than in their debut -not much however if you are the usual '80s Thrash fan. The overall speed is mid-tempo, not slow but certainly not fast (exception: \\"The Preacher\\").    I would say that this is their finest effort. If you have even a passing interest in 80s Thrash Metal you need this album NOW. It is more intricate than some of the 80s counterparts but is just as intense.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese Dream(1993). Smashing Pumpkins' Second Album.<br />Around 'Siamese Dream''s release in 1993, Grunge was ruling the airwaves, with bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden achieving massive sucsess, and the Smashing Pumpkins set out to achieve the same sucsess as their counterparts. Instead of combining Heavy Metal, Alternative Metal, and Punk like the other bands, Billy Corgan set out to do something totally original, combining influences of Heavy Metal, Alternative Rock, Goth Rock, Progressive Rock, Goth Rock, and even Psychadelia, mixed with creative and heartfelt vocals, and a swirling, distorted guitar, and frequent solos. Because of disagreements inside the band, Corgan played almost every instrument besides the drums, which Jimmy Chamberlain played. He vowed that if Siamese Dream didn't do well(Like the previous album 'Gish'), Corgan would disband. He didn't have to worry. 'Siamese Dream' quickly rocketed into the Top Ten, eventually selling over 4 Million copies in the progress. It spawned the Alternative Anthems &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;, while the soothing ballads &quot;Rocket&quot; and &quot;Disarm&quot; also became big hits. Although not quite as sucessful or inspired as 'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness', 'Siamese Dream' stands as a definite triumph for the Smashing Pumpkins. Read on to find out why...<br />Track Ratings-<br />Cherub Rock- The Pumpkins start the album well, blending Corgan's distorted guitar and vocals to create Alternative gold. Very heartfelt!<br />Quiet-Chamberlain and Corgan thrash 'Quiet' out, and Corgan's vocals are very soothing behind the chugging distortion.<br />Today- 'Siamese Dream''s biggest hit, and why not? My favorite also, Corgan's oddly symphonic vocals behind the gothic guitar riff blend to create a masterpiece. Not as dark as it sounds, but actually very heartfelt.<br />Hummer- One of 'Siamese Dream's longest, &quot;Hummer&quot; is a blend of Alternative Rock and Prog Rock, and the end result is a hard rocking ballad that is simply beautiful. Love the solos!<br />Rocket- Corgan belts out guitar chords and vocals reminiscent of &quot;Today&quot;, except adding more depth to the chords and riffs. Great songwriting!<br />Disarm- Corgan's brooding lyrics and solemn acoustic guitar, blended with cello's and violin's in the background, create a surreal ballad that is totally original. Superb.<br />Soma- Prog Rock at its best, &quot;Soma&quot; chugs along slowly at the start, but soon the distorted guitars sweep in, and soon Corgan belts out impressive vocals and an even better solo. Another &quot;Hard Rocking&quot; ballad, this song is very good.<br />Geek U.S.A.- After two ballads, the Pumpkins come back with a heavy Alternative Rocker, combining Corgan's spontaneous riff(He changes it often) behind his vocals works well. The song goes through many different musical measures, from slow to fast, and this song shows sophisticated talent. Great solo.<br />Mayonaise- Another ballad, Corgan's pained heartbroke vocals, behind the slow melodic guitar riff create an amazing song. Great solo!<br />Spaceboy- Once again, Corgan blends his syphonic vocals along with the cello and the violin, not to mention the oddly distorted acoustic guitar to craft yet another superb ballad.<br />Silverf*ck-Tied with &quot;Today&quot; for my favorite, &quot;Silverf*ck&quot; is Alt Rock at its best! Corgan's Metallic riff sweeps in at blistering speeds, and Corgan's whispery vocals mix well. The song slows down for a while, but at the end Corgan and Chamberlain showcase their incredible speed. Prog Rock + Alt Rock= Masterpiece!<br />Sweet Dreams- Another ballad, Corgan's melodic vocals, sinfully sweet acoustic guitar riff, and the deep lyrics keep this short song from being filler.<br />Luna- &quot;Luna&quot; ends the album slowly, and the Smashing Pumpkins remind me a little of Coldplay, using Corgan's vocals primarily while adding in odd instrumental beats. Easily Siamese Dream's worst, it's a little too slow, yet it manages to still be good<br />Overall, I found 'Siamese Dream' to be an Alternative Rock milestone, and Corgan's clever mixture of Melodic vocals and Distorted guitars never fail to please. 'Siamese Dream' has a little something for everybody, ranging from Hard Rock, Alt Rock, Hard Rocking Ballads, and Soft Ballads, and the range of the songs is impressive. Though not quite as good as 'Mellon Collie And the Infinite Sadness', 'Siamese Dream' should appeal as much as the other.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENED! FANS OF PROG ROCK, METAL, ALT ROCK, AND THE SMASHING PUMPKINS WOULD HIGHLY ENJOY THIS ALBUM! ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS PEARL JAM, THE SMASHING PUMPKINS WERE ONE OF THE 90'S DEFINING ALT ROCK BANDS!<br />Also Recommended-<br />Mellon Collie And the Infinite Sadness-Smashing Pumpkins<br />Ten-Pearl Jam<br />Superunknown-Soundgarden<br />Thanks For Reading!mese Dream's worst, it's a little too slow, yet it manages to still be good<br />Overall, I found 'Siamese Dream' to be an Alternative Rock milestone, and Corgan's clever mixture of Melodic vocals and Distorted guitars never fail to please.

B000002IKR|5.0|Alex Skolnick (lead Guitarist of Testament 1987-1992) has to be the most talented guitarists of Thrash Metal. He went on later to do Jazz guitar...no easy feat. Simply put, Skolnick is the Eddie Van Halen of Thrash guitar. Anyway...<br />This album is as good if not better than Megadeth's &quot;Peace Sells but who's buying?&quot;, Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, and Anthrax's &quot;Among the Living&quot; -the other four Thrash Albums that dominated at the time.<br />The guitar work of Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson is unmatched. Their intro's are &quot;Bach-Rock&quot; like -that means they place synmphonyesque stuff on their guitars. Fear not, they fuse this feature in with their heavy metal riffs so it is still harsh.<br />Chuck Billy (the vocalist) is also one of the most talented in Thrash history. The range of his voice goes from the low growl to high screams but is never pretentious. The drumming is simple but very fitting. Very little double-bass (exception: &quot;First Strike is Deadly&quot;); I couldn't imagine this album with much double-bass anyway. The bassist is the only thing you rarely hear. (His best quality is that he doesn't bring the band down.) <br />This is a must own if you like late 80s Thrash Metal! No exceptions. Highlights (they're all good) include &quot;The Haunting&quot;, &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;, and &quot;First Strike is Deadly&quot;.
B000006NXP|4.0|Well, it is amazing what this recording has done among melomans as the reactions here prove it. And one thing is certain that this is no usual Brahms recording. On the contrary is a pretty remarcable happening in the recorded music history. <br />Now, let us consider the time of its appearance. It is 1981, some good years after almost all mentioned here as real Brahms achievers, at least on disc, were gone. Neither Furtwangler, Walter, Schuricht or Mengelberg were amongst us for a while then. So this recording came, in my opinion on a very dry land as far as good Brahms interpretations were considered. I might upset some here but Karajan and Abbado are far from understanding enough of Brahms to be real contenders here (Karajan judged well that the strings of Berliner can make a very beautiful sound with parts of this compositions). Giulini was doing a fine job even though he wasn't able to go really to the heart of this music.<br />So, here comes mister Kleiber who makes a new case for Brahms as an outstanding composer. A recording that entered the Big League completely worthy. All the sense, drama and music of the symphony were there, the Wiener played superbly (as they do not all the time). Kleiber masters the music and his orchestra, his control is complete and as usual his artistic intelligence takes out in the open all what is burried within the notes of this symphony. And he does it so energetically with such crispness and control, as many mentioned here. And I think that is where the whole thing suffers from my point of view.<br />It is true that Brahms' music is tragic and full of human passions and conflincting feelings. But can you really see the big beared man as being so crisp, so precise in his burst of energy, so &quot;modern&quot; lets say? I cannot. And that's why I am missing in this recording the warmth and deep yet intense and demanding expression of &quot;humanity&quot; you find in Walter or the very natural and less controled yet more powerful dramatic accents you find in Furtwangler. For me, here, between these two, one can find the ultimate expression of Brahms, as a complete musical and human experience. <br />Mr Kleiber gets four stars for understanding and expressing everything so well, with such perfection but is denied the last star for being to perfect and calculated. Briskness is not something that helps in Brahms in my opinion. As well as two focused energy.<br />But I have to agree with some of the reviewers. Try to listen as many recordings as possible to get the one that really &quot;sings Brahms&quot; to you

B00000JZI9|3.0|I hate western movies what makes the western movie totally suck for me is that when there is a lot of fighting  going on, people are dying and also when it's too long. What I like about western movies is when people are not getting killed.What I see in the movie that makes it western are guns , cowboys, horses, american people and black people. When I first saw the foreshadowing I knew it was going to be a boring movie for me depending on a person if they like fighting movies or not. I think the soundtrack was really good it gave you hints if something bad or good is going to happen. So in the movie they treat black people badly. They don't care if they are dying, they don't where they are dying. In addition, there is a lot of shooting going on in the movie. Anyway if you ask me if Iiked the movie I did not like the movie. Maybe you will depending on you if you like  ' 'WESTERN'' movies .

B000002HMH|2.0|if this was some other band that wasnt as good as metallica, than this would be a better cd. just pretend songs like masteer of puppets and fade to black and one dont exist.
B000002JK2|5.0|You can't any better than this. Pete is at his songwriting and arranging peak. Ronnie is soulful as ever. Clapton plays a beautiful dobro. &quot;Keep me Turning&quot; is a fantastic Townshend showpiece, but it's Ronnie who takes the cake with &quot;April Fool.&quot; Clapton's dobro is particularly poignant on this one as well. But the album as a whole is great.

0425188809|3.0|No matter girls and teenage boys (or right-wing religious fans) may find him likeale, in my book Koontz is one of the weakest authors around...his stories take you somewhere with some cliche-things and prey on soft spots of people-like how our corrupted culture leads to the violence...or morally upside girls and boys will make a poor world in their own...but his characters seem customised cardboards; his romanticism is silly and his dogs are yelping to get real dog-attitudes after all...this is the best and most readable book from him...but you should stop here...and perhaps try Lightning though stomach-churning sentimalism is there...not my cup of coffee. Anyway poor writing, terrible dialogues and silly characters saved by only good suspense and a frantic pace. But his most other books lack these factors so that is it.<br />By the way, I have never read any King book in my life but I plan to read many of him. Why? Because I watched two movies based on his books: One was Pet Sematary (the reviewer below: you should have READ the book carefully before slugging it off &quot;a disappointed&quot; one; you even don't know the TRUE SPELLING which plays a significant part in the movie)which was horror and I thought: A mindless horror hacker should he be, this author called king. But when my husband said  that he was also the author of Shawshank Redemption I was utterly astounded and thought: No, There must be two DIFFERENT Stephen Kings. Any author penning Pet Sematary and Shawshank Redemption from the same mind should be far far away from cliche and must be really intelligent, readable and know something about people and this world. Now today I bought Carrie and even the first page seems to be better from the entire Koontz cannon.<BR>Just my humble opinion. Everyone's taste is up to her or him.

B00000JZI9|5.0|These kind's of western's is what I like. Not the old kind where you can bearly here the sound and even see the picture, you know. If I had this movie I would watch it all day. the characters were all uniqe in there own way. Jake (kevin Costner) was really a troble maker. Paden (Kevin Kline) was more of the calm one inthe movie. Emmett (Scott Glenn) was always the brae one and also saving his brother from problems he is always getting into. Mal (Dany Glover) was an african american that was kicked out of a town because of his skin color. These Actor's had really grrat quotes. &quot; Thank's for giving me a hand.&quot; (said by jake to paden when they were in jail.)<BR>Plus the soundtrack was really somethig. All the song's that they had played in all the scenes was really great they really whent with the scenes. The foreshadowing of this story was well writen and explaind. At  the end all of those predition on your mind saying what wil happend to the characters in the end? Those predictions were answerd at the end. This is a really great movie. I'll recommendthis movie to any one who is a critic.

0060516402|5.0|The next time you see a book that casts a business leader as a mythical or heroic figure, go back to this book and see if the leader passes the 'Level 5 Leader' tests.  Sandy Weill, for example, fails that test miserably, since he cares nothing for his company or its employees, and only about feeding his insatiable appetite for personal profit, self-aggrandizement, and great food, in that order.  Weill is an example of the so-called celebrity leaders who are very reluctant to groom and name their successors, since they care far more about holding onto their power than for the longer-term welfare of the company and its employees.  The last thing you'd see these quasi-leaders do is sacrifice their power or money for longer benefit of the company.  Eisner is another perfect example of Emperor-CEO who got paid obscene amount of money and drove out top talents from Disney, while its business and stock prices languished badly.<br />A perfect business book - erudite, entertaining, and relevant - and a must-read for anyone who ever dreamed of becoming (or simply working for) the true business leader.
B00000JZI9|2.0|I REALLY DON'T LIKE  WESTERN MOVIES BECAUSE THEY ARE BORING AND HAVE NO MEANING TO IT BUT THAT IS MY OPINION. BUT IN THE MOVIE THERE WAS GOOD AND BAD GUYS FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE.THE PARTS IN THE MOVIE THAT I LIKED ABOUT IT WAS THE PARTS THEY WERE FIGHTING IN .THE MUSIC THAT WHEN'T WITH THE MOVIE REALLY FIT THE THE MOVIE BUT NOT THE TYPE  OF MUSIC I WOULD LISTEN TO MY THAT I WATCH ARE HORROR AND  COMEBY. I WOULD TELL A PERSON THAT IF THEY LIKE WESTERN MOVIES THEY SHOULD WATCH IT BUT IF THEY DON'T  I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD LIKE IT. AND I AM LOOKING IN A MOVIE IS THAT THEY ARE NOT BORING AND HAVE MEANING TO IT.
B000062XKL|2.0|good:<br />1. action takes place in a foreign country! Canada and in foreign language (fr)<BR>2. no blood, no one killed (2 shots only)<BR>3. racially correct (fiance of RdN is black)<br />bad:<br />slow action, predictable, schematic, boring, abscence of imagination, non-entertaining. looks like a piece of &quot;lemon&quot; from the hollywood conveyer line. this is not &quot;movie art&quot;, just an example of &quot;movie industry&quot;.<br />and finally, i realized why so high the crime rate in the usa, so low in canada: the canadian criminals never &quot;pee in their own pool&quot;, that's why they come to the usa.
B00005JMCN|1.0|This movie is stunningly awful.  Hollywood took an exciting and terse book and poured five cans of sugar over it.  Each component of the film, barring the acting, is terrible.  Randy Newman cartoonishly narrates the movie with a ridiculous &quot;period&quot; score and yet, out of nowhere, a track from Moby's over-sampled PLAY appears.  The completely misguided voice-over narrative attempts to give the film some historical legitimacy and extra weight.  All it does is add gravity to and repeatedly stall the momentum of what should have been a balls out movie.  This movie lacks every quality that the horse, as described in the book, had.  Its cinematography is grossly opulent, the screenplay is stuffed with self-importance, and the film moves at a snail's pace.  One hour into the film and NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.  Gary Ross, creator of the equally maudlin and hit-you-in-the-face-with-a-message Pleasantville, keeps the unnecessary history of the three principle characters at the expense of, incredibly, some of the horse races.  Worst of all are the horse-racing segments themselves.  The races are strangely uninvolving, and knowing that in most shots Tobey Maguire isn't actually on the horse detaches the viewer from the experience.  By the end, I started skipping chapters of the DVD and found that doing so made ZERO DIFFERENCE except for the pleasure of knowing I'd kept twenty minutes of my life from being trapped on the back of this lame Seabiscuit.  Someone should bar Tobey Maguire and Gary Ross from coming within one hundred feet of each other, because the results of their meetings are excruciating for American movie goers.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I like this movie fairly well, but I have to lower its ranking by a star, simply because of the fact that the filmmakers chose not to include Chekov.  Rick Berman has done so much damage to the Trek franchise, and this was one of his earliest errors.  No matter what Mr. Berman may think, Chekov was a valuable part of the television show, adding a Russian flavor to the show's international stew.  To not include him is not only wrong, it's borderline offensive.<br />Walter Koenig is a fine actor, and I'm glad Berman saw fit to let him participate in the other Trek movies.  His presence here would have made a decent movie very good, at the very least.  If you're looking for your Chekov fix, watch Star Trek II.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is a genious albmum. People say that Slipknot is all about image and gimmic. The hell it is! Slipkot would have the exact same music, same fan base, and same recognition by other bands, with or without the masks. This is such a deep album if you THINK about the lyrics. They are more creative then most bands out today, and have a larger fan base world wide then most metal bands. This album is so excellent, and I suggest it to anyone, reather they like Metal or not, this album will make you appreciate the hard, fast beat, or the one moment calm and beuatiful, next moment screaming and energetic. BUY THIS ALBUM.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I love the original unedited Star Wars and wouldn't mind buying their DVDs but there's no way I'll buy the SE Sar Wars DVDs. After seeing Episode 1 and 2, I'm afraid to see what 3 will look like.

B00005JKES|5.0|All Twin Peaks fans need to buy this set...Season 2 isn't available yet but maybe it will be if more copies of Season 1 are sold.  This first set was really well done and actually has extras unlike a lot of other David Lynch discs.  If you loved the series, you'll love this. <br />As others have stated, the pilot episode is available and the quality is very passable.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|With head bangin' singles such as &quot;Juicy&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, and the playa anthem &quot;Big Poppa&quot; who can deny that the young Brooklyn rapper's first CD &quot;Ready to Die&quot; was going to be a temendous hit. Not only are the singles alone worth buying the CD, tracks like &quot;Unbelievable&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot; show off the great rappers skill with good lyrics. The remastered version only amplifies what was already a great CD. The addition of &quot;Who Shot Ya&quot; and temendouly hilarious &quot;Just Playing(Dreams)&quot; make this CD truly worth getting, especially if you haven't bought it already. Not only are there two extra tracks but the whole CD is digitally remastered and a DVD is included that has 4 of Biggie's video's and unreleased live performance. This is a true collector's item and a great album to boot. If you're a Bad Boy fan, go get this immediately. And if you haven't gotten the first Ready to Die yet, you should have been at the check-out with the CD yesterday.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This movie -- I can watch it each and every day. The characters captured me and they were real people with their faults, genius, heart and soul.  Anyone who enjoys Rock and a fabulously written script exploring Transgender relationships, the transgender mind will fall in love with Hedwig.  ^5 to all connected with this brilliant movie. It is passion, grit, soul, heart, double cross, greed, and a search for love, acceptance. This movie is so great and moving I do not possess the vocabulary to describe the emotional journey the viewer travels. FANTASTIC
B00000JZI9|5.0|I personally think that the &quot;Silverado&quot; western movie was a great, exciting movie. What made the movie good was that their were alot of killing and fighting that's what makes movies exciting especially when they kill with guns. One thing I did not like nor enjoyed was that there was racism against the blacks and I personally think that there would never be peace if their keeps being racism. The good thing was that  NOT everybody was races. What I think makes this movie different from other western movies is that in this movie &quot;Silverado&quot; it really has much more adventure than other western movies that I've seen, in other movies they really don't have any understanding to it. In some other movies they hurt and kill for no reason. In the movie &quot;Silverado&quot; when they kill we atleast know why they're killing and hurting people. <BR>         One of the things I really enjoyed in the movie was the soundtrack. I was really amazed to what kind of soundtrack they came up with. the soundtrack the movie had was really interesting it made the movie sound very  fun to see and it also made it sound very exciting and adventures which is really good.One reason why it was really good it's because the soundtrack that were choosen were very fast and really high and that's why some people love watching movies and listening to music.<BR>        The foreshadowing I didn't  like because sometimes foreshadowing gives away the excitment of the movie.I like and enjoy the movie better when I get surprised.The quote I really liked was when Jake said&quot;I been playing dead.&quot;I really thought that was funny.<BR>        This movie I really recommed because even I like it and I'm not into western movies but the reason why I liked this movie was because it was adventures and exciting so it would be really good for the people who enjoyed those type of movies.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|In all of Rage's defiant individuality, they certainly never created a bad album, but even by lofty standards, Battle of Los Angeles is a watershed that surpasses all expectations.  The drums and guitars that announce the album on &quot;Testify&quot; are as bold as any song they've made, but this time there's something else - the trace of a melody or two!  A move to bold soundscapes and a snarky rhythm section is what really separates Battle and makes their protest something palatable - it didn't need to happen that way, but Rage loses none of its impact because of it.
B00000JZI9|3.0|The movie silverado is just another western movie. A good movie to me is a movie with a lot  and alot of  action and humor. i usually dont see westerns but this western movie cathed my attention because of the action in it. What i didnt really like from the movie was the soundtrack because it was to dramatic. This movie overall had a good plot. This movie is unique because ive never seen a western movie and this one was interesting
B00005JKJA|2.0|Here is a supplement to my previous review:  The whole idea of the movie is to throw as much crudola at the viewer as possible. It is a sadistic film.  Take for example, Naoimi Watts' character's audition.  First you see her going through it with her surprise roomate.  She is basically terrible.  Then, she goes to a studio and does the same audition there and is seemingly much better.  But in reality the acting she displays at the studio is also terrible.  The scripted scene is rubbish, and she acts like crap in it.  Other example?  The Castigliani brothers.  The one played by Angelo Badalamenti has a habit of ordering espresso.  His host seems to have had bad experiences in the past and assures him that this time, he will like it.  Badalamenti takes one sip and spits mewls the espresso disgustedly all over a napkin, much to the general consternation.  This scene is intentionally total baloney.  The host says, &quot;But that was one of the finest espressos in the world!&quot;  This means nothing.  Anybody who knows anything about espresso, as I'm sure Lynch does, knows that there is no such thing as a &quot;fine espresso&quot; brand of coffee.  What makes for quality in espresso is, very freshly roasted coffee - of any reasonably good kind - pushed out of the machine at a rate of one ounce per 25 seconds by water that is somewhat less than 200 degrees farenheit.  This is what makes for fine espresso, and it is almost completely a matter of the skill of the person in charge of it, not at all a matter of looking on the internet for some &quot;espresso&quot; to buy and put in your crummy machine under what kind of grind you do not know.  The movie is full of this BS.  The movie is a series of vignettes whose main purpose is to be good and stupid.  Lynch likes to frig over his viewers.
B00000JZI9|2.0|I thought that the movie was kind of boring and not enught acton . for the movies i like to wacth. i would not watch that movie again if i dont have to the movie silvebapo.is not my kind of movie i like to wacth . i like funny movies because it does not put you to sleep                                                                <br />     i know that this movie was going to be with guns and cowboys. lots of shouting but i dont like western movies<BR>   it kind of mad the movie good with music that thay played.
B00005JKJA|3.0|What many people seem not to grasp is that pure storytelling, literary art, is a story that is not about anything: a story that has no meaning.  This is the essence of real literature and the essence of dreams.  In his work on dreams, Freud ramps up to the subject by giving an historical run-through of archaic, lame-brained theories of dreams, telling the reader about the earlier, knucklehead idea that dreams mean nothing.  He then goes on to provide a means of &quot;interpreting&quot; what dreams &quot;mean.&quot;  But is this what the dreams themselves mean?  Or is it the meaning that is ascribed to them, just as ink blots do not in themselves depict what the patient sees in them.  Here is a test that can be performed:  under deep hypnosis - i.e. a hypnotic state deep enough that the subject has no memory of the content of the session - extract dream accounts from a small group of people.  Then transcribe the dreams.  Then, reassign each dream to a person who did not actually dream it, telling each person, &quot;Here is a dream you recounted to me&quot; and proceeding to analyze it with them.  My bet is that each person will find personal meaning in the dreams that they did not themselves dream.  <BR>What I am getting at is that dreams in themselves do not mean anything and neither does real literature.  Real literature is writing that is antagonistic to the aims of conventional journalistic storytelling.  Mulholland Drive does not mean a goddam thing.  David Lynch knows this full well.  He never even tried to get it to mean anything.  His interest in his movies meaning something evaporated long before Eraserhead.  But David Lynch is an extremely disingenuous person, who likes to pretend that his movies mean something, not so much to sell them, but to further shag over the viewership.  He goes on talk shows or provides liner notes coyly hinting about certain details one might wanna focus on in order to get to the bottom of things.  But this is all nonsense.  Thereis no bottom.  There is no band.  Surely the scene in &quot;Club Silencio&quot; conveys the ultimate meaninglessness of the flick.  Just as DelRio is at her most impassioned, she collapses in a faint and is dragged unceremoniously off stage as the acapella blares on.  What was it the Immortal Bard had to spray onna subject?   A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  How do I know Lynch's movies mean nothing?  Cause I'm a writer, goddamit!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch this excellent mini-series on a replaying on the history Channel because 1.) I don't have HBO and 2.) I don't have over $100 to spend on this box set.  But I wish I did.  This is probably the best war movie I have ever seen.  It follows Easy Company, probably the most famous platoon of world war 2 from their training in boot camp, to the very end at hitler's \\"Eagle Nest.\\"  They were a platoon that suffered 150% casulties.<br />With the exception of its length (over ten hours) this is right up their with  a big bedget movie.  It has great actors, awesome cinemetogrophy, and great war special effect.  Don't let the fact that this tv miniseries is a wimpy piece of junk.  It's not!  Because it was on HBO, the makers made sure to keep it realistic with the violence (lots of blood, injures, lossed limbs, etc...), theirs bad language and even a little nudity.  So don't let a little kid watch this.  The late Michael Kamen provides the excellent score and really provides a ambient backdrop to the sorrow and loss and horrible side of war.<br />If you are at all interesting in Worl War II or like war movies in general.  You must do yourself a favour and check this masterpiece out.  You will not be dissapointed.
B00005JLWN|5.0|WOW..and WOW.. and WOW and WOW and WOW!<br />How have I never heard of this movie before?!?!?<BR>To read the reviews here, I thought I was in for another mindless action movie (always welcome of course) but I was treated to something very much more special.<br />This is a thought searing movie, to say the least. Have you read 1984? Or seen Blade Runner? Or Apple Computer's &quot;1984&quot; ad? This is there. This is great. This is art. It really is.<br />The movie itself was very well thought out and detailed.. down to the shape of the &quot;drug&quot; pills they took. Scenes like the re-organizing of his desk, with the background dialog perfectly syncronising the scene, give testament to the thought and detail put into the movie. It also makes me sad at the shlock that Hollywood turns out these days. Kudos to the director, writer and actors. <br />I didnt expect much going into this, and I was really really surprised. To read amazons comment : &quot;Based on customer purchases, this is the #39 early adopter product in cult movies&quot;, after seeing this movie, that comment makes me shiver - im not sure why. Forshadowing our future?<br />In anycase, Im going to see the Cruxshadows so cant write more, but take my advice, if you're a thinking person, rent this movie. Its worth the time/money.<br />P.S. <BR>Im glad to see the guy from Lord of the Rings/Ronin play a noble part for once!
B00003CXCT|5.0|. . .over the thought of yet another enhanced retelling of the trilogy I grew up with, yet I know that I will eventually get it.<br />Torn, because it won't be the same exact thing that I knew.<br />Some of the rumored alterations include: the insertion of Hayden Christensen's digitally aged visage into both the unmasking of Vader and the Three Holy Ghosts at the end of ROTJ, an enhanced battle between Vader and Kenobi at the Death Star, and a few lines of dialogue not originally heard.<br />In addition to these, who knows what else might be tweaked a bit by the time we finally see it. . .<br />Honestly, I'm going to wait until after Episode III has been released onto DVD. I would just bet my Wookie co-pilot that George will present us with yet another version of these films when the whole saga finally becomes available as a box-set. He's done it before, so I just don't trust him.<br />But I WILL get them.
6305291446|5.0|Before i watched this movie i thought it was gonna be another good installment in the series but nothing special. It didnt even pass my mind that it could be as good or almost as good as the original. It was! I found this to be one of the best horror sequels ever! It is my favorite in the Halloween series , tieing with the first. If you liked the first i strongly recomend this one!
1592400876|2.0|This book had some entertainment value, but it just wasn't that good.  I had heard so many good things about the book that I was looking forward to reading it.  However, this appears to be a case of everyone being afraid to admit they didn't like it - because it's supposed to be a bit intellectual.  Well, call me ignorant (you wouldn't be the first), but it gets old quick.  If you want something entertaining in this genre, try a Bill Bryson book.<br />And a note to the author - it's Two Weeks Notice (not Two Week's Notice) because Two Weeks is describing Notice, not a possessive.  It's Sandra's Two Weeks Notice.
B00000JZI9|2.0|I don't like weasterns becuse they are always the same, a crapy showdown between 2 best friends at the end.  The movie had action but the beggining was almost predictable.  The movie is just like most other weasterns it gets realy old realy fast.  <br />The story some what roled on good.  But it could have been better.  I think there was to much emotion in this .  But the soundtrack sounded real good.
1400032717|5.0|&quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; by Mark Haddon is narrated by Christopher Boone, an autistic fifteen year-old who loves maths and physics. One day, Christopher discovered that his neighbor's dog, Wellington, was killed with a garden fork and he would investigate the matter to find out the killer. In addition, he would document all his investigations in a book. However, Christopher who do not comprehend emotions and human beings in general, this would prove to be a difficult task. Through all this, we get to learn more about Christopher, the autistic boy. Everything to Christopher was about logic and math. He does not like to be touch, he hates places with lots of people and noise and he doesn't like the different food on his plate to touch. <br />I think Christopher Boone is a most fascinating character. The author did an extremely good job in characterizing Christopher and is able to bring him to life. He was able to tell his readers how Christopher's mind works and how he would react to things in general. For someone who has never encounter an autistic person like me, this book is very insightful and I truly feel that I have learn something. It was also interesting how the author charaterizes Christopher's parents; his father was able to handle Christopher's difficulties while his mother was unable to cope with the pressure of having an autistic child. I highly recommend this book as even though the story seems simple, it is actually not. It touches on an important subject that I feel people are in general ill-informed and unaware.
B00000JZI9|4.0|I don't really watch westerns but when I do there almost always good. The type of movies that I like to watch are action and comedy. &quot;Silverado&quot; wasn't really funny but it sure did have alot of action. The movie was great but the part that I leasted liked was the ending of the movie. My favorite parts of the movie was the shootouts and when they fought.<BR>      I think what made the movie &quot;Silverado&quot; uniqe was having two African American characters in it. The sound track of the movie went with what was happening. The movie had many good quotes but my favorite was &quot;This use to be a peaceful town.&quot;. Before I saw the movie I knew it would be good because most westerns are and I was right.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|While I am nowhere near a 50 something, and closer to a 30 something, I can still appreciate an intelligent romantic comedy with a convincing and witty cast.  I love Diane Keaton's character, especially with her quirky hang-ups (no pun.)  Humor, charm, intellect and vulnerability ring true for both her and Nicholson, to whom before this movie, I was not a huge fan.  It inspires us all to develop our skills and talents and to never give up on finding our soul mate, regardless of how late in life he/she might arrive.  It was precious in some parts, and soulful in others.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
0446691437|3.0|I posted a review of this book over a year ago, right after I read it for the first time. I gave it three stars at that time because, other than the first section dealing with resistence in a practical sense, I found the rest of the book to be too esoteric. Since then I have done a tremendous amount of soul-searching regarding my inner drive to become a writer. That search took me back to this book recently, and after reading it for a second time I have to say I don't know what I was thinking when I gave it only three stars. Today I truly believe it is worthy of five stars because it struck deep into my conscience and helped me understand my situation and the situation of others like me. Anyone who is trying to tap into the inspiration they sense burning somewhere inside them that tells them to go out and write - or to create any other kind of art - will benefit tremendously if they open their minds and prepare themselves for rigorous introspection. This is not a simple self-help or how-to book. It is a truly profound examination of the human mind and the quest for fulfillment that we all feel.
0060090367|5.0|This book is very funny.  I really enjoyed it.  It was a light read and entertaining - perfect for summer.  I did find the fact that he left her right after she delivered and his blatant lack of interest in their daughter TOTALLY infuriating.  Claire seemed to focus more on the fact that he left her and not as much on the manner in which he left her.  <br />For those of you with kids - can you even imagine being left hours after you deliver?
B000003TBP|5.0|...and tell us, Beck does, in this sublime mix of hip hop, alternative, country, jazz, rock and pop, with even a Beatle-ish Sgt. Pepper homage tacked to the very end.    Critics of Odelay accuse Beck of being overly indulgent and WAY-overly derivative, but isn't that the whole point of the CD?  Beck has stolen the key to the Fun Factory and is determined to play with every toy in the building before security throws him out.      Over 13 tracks, Beck (with a big assist from the Dust Brothers) treats us to a music mixer's wet dream, from the chronically hook-y (\\"Devils Haircut,\\" \\"The New Pollution,\\" \\"Where It's At\\") to the startlingly touching (\\"Jack-Ass,\\" \\"Ramshackle\\") to the just plain silly (\\"Sissyneck\\").    Odelay holds its place as one of the essential CD's of the 90's.  Years later it still continues to entertain and excite.  This is a joyous celebration of music, period . . . and Beck's best album by far.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I agree with the review below about certain negative losers posting here about this album. Some people are bound to be slightly jealous of Madonna at the moment because she keeps surprising us all and putting out good quality music that has emotional depth, intelligence and integrity, and shes selling dozens of concert tickets at the sametime. <BR>This album has not had a fair hearing, it hasnt had the attention or recognition it deserves, that's an injustice! I listened to the album lastnight and was totally BLOWN away by the intensity of the lyrics of Mother and Father and Nothing Fails. So beautiful, yet tragic at the sametime. That's what American Life is, the title track went from a song I initally hated to one of my most favourite tunes. Hollywood despite not making an appearance on the Billboard chart is one of the greatest songs Madonna has ever done.  I tend not to put great scope on charts and sales! but I figured its the main reason why this album has been knocked to death! which is sad. Its better than anything that's been in the top 5 recently, don't listen to the teenyboppers! buy it yourself one day, and you could be pleasantly surprised.
B00008FLQW|5.0|Long before \\"Farm Aid\\" and \\"We are the World\\", George & Ravi put together this fantastic show. Although I wasn't anywhere near Madison Square Garden, I read an article about this benefit in my doctor's office. The show was billed, George Harrison & Friends benefit for Bangla Desh. Can you imagine the surprise those lucky ticket holders experienced when they saw George's friends? A few weeks later, I saw the show advertised in the local newspaper and that the film was showing at a local movie theater. My friend and I went and stayed all day (watched it over and over). Many people don't realize the reason the sound is excellent. Up to that date, it was the most microphones/tracks ever used to record a concert. The engineer was none other than Phil Spector! Order this concert, it is the Best Of The Best for the era. You won't be disappointed!
B00008J2DQ|4.0|When i got this cd i felt that it would somewhat lack like awake did. However, i was wrong. this cd was a lot better than awake but it's still not better than their self titled album. Awake's first couple of songs were good and then it got kind of boring. nonetheless faceless is a very good album
B00009NOF4|5.0|Radiohead is a group of magicians who will put you under their spell that they cast with music.  Everybody needs this cd.  My favourite songs are Backdrifters, Where I end and You begin, Scatterbrain, and Wolf at the Door.  All of the others are superb as well.
B0000035E7|1.0|No matter what anybody says, Nirvana's Bleach is sub-par by even the most general standards of music And no, Kurt can't get off the hook for being dead, because a lot of what he made in life was awful. Sure, Kurt and da boyz got the best sound $600.17 could buy, but it still sounds like (...). Does Bleach sound good compared to Soundgarden's first SubPop EP? No. Does it have variety to the sound of the songs? No. Is there any creativity in any of the songs? No... unless you consider shouting \\"Gimme back my babyback ribs... um, I mean 'alcohol'\\" twnty times in one song as being creative. In \\"Aero Zepplin\\", Kurt was right when he said rock stars can \\"(...) upon the stage and they'll be fans\\", because it's so true. Rock stars like Kurt can get away with anything. His fans really would pay to buy an album of forty straight minutes of Kurt having a bowel movement, because Bleach is that bowel movement.
B00005B4GU|5.0|The songs on this are all so beautiful, but alas, this is Radiohead's least understood album.  My theory is that anybody who likes Kid A, but not Amnesiac just hasn't listened to it enough.  I have to admit that I hated some parts of this album when I first listened to it... Hunting Bears, Pulk/Pulling Revolving Doors, and Dollars &amp; Cents being the main reasons. Well I now see the folly of my ways.  Every song has its purpose and is unbelievably pure and wonderful.  Listening to this album is a religious experience for me and when I hear of Radiohead fans who don't like it I feel extremely sorrowful for their lost souls.  Buy this!  Listen to it in the right setting and get into it.  There is so much beauty pack inside that you will want to cry, and feel euphoric all at the same time.  Even if you don't feel it to a religious extent, this cd will make you stronger as a person.  Big claim?  Listen to You and Whose Army and let yourself really get into it.  A must have!
B00006LLOB|3.0|Look, I've always liked this album.  In fact, it's how I got my first exposure to the inimitable Howling Wolf.  But what's the deal with this reissue?  I would love to repurchase this CD.  The one I own is a first generation CD release and leaves a lot of room for improvement.  But I am not going to spend this kind of money to get it.  All or most of the &quot;bonus tracks&quot; could have been fit on one CD. This just really smacks of fan exploitation to me. <br />I've got a great soft spot in my heart for the album.  Just to hear the British Invasion boys add their interperatation of Chicago blues to Howling Wolf is worth a great deal....but not this much.  <br />I'll just turn my inferior remaster up louder.
B000006TRV|5.0|this is, possibly the best album ever. And if you feel it is too depressing then maybe you should eat a lollipop or something, anything to make you feel better. because, lets face it, you have to be already depressed to feel depressed about this album. several great songs on hear, almost all of them a great actually. many of these songs have been played on the radio to death but there are other songs not on the radio that are great too. SCREW YOU ONE STAR REVEIWERS!
B0000C83YJ|5.0|When I first listened to this CD,I was so shocked by the pop sensitivity of the BOY GEORGE.The catchyness and the beautiful melody caught my ears.Since then I have been a CULTURE CLUB fan for more than ten years.Danceable beat and commercial hook is the key to this album.So many SOUL POP albums and musicians appeared during the 80s.But this band had the specific vision and ability to combine SOUL MUSIC and DANCE POP.BUY THIS CD, and back to the 80s ,durable melodies await for you.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Firts of all it is a two part band but that means almost nothing. Almost every song has more than one guitar part. I believe Jack White is an amazing guitarist. He may not rip Metalica solos but he plays a good slide and sounds great in my opinion. Sure the drummer is nothing special and the is no bass but that is why i gave 4 stars and not 5.
B00005JA2B|5.0|In the late seventies,PROG-ROCK MOVEMENT was at its best in the USA.So many bands come and gone.This band literally from KANSA had the boogie style,that means southern rock style,and the progressive rock style combined so smoothly into one thread.It was a miracle thing to me.Incredible instrumental parts and the STEVE WALSH's touching vocal appealed to me.In Japan we categorize them as PROG-HARD BAND like DREAM THEATRE.This kind of band is so popular and deep-rooted in Japan.If you like BOSTON,you will like this too.
B00008VGK0|4.0|When I first listened to the track American Life on her most recent album, I enjoyed it however after constant hearing it gets repetitive and kinda annoying.<br />This single has so many good remixes that it makes the song so new and refreshing.<BR>The Missy Elliot remix is a real winner, the rap at the beginning and the whole new layout of the song is really good. Maybe she should have just had Missy do the original recording of this track with her because they would have been a great team, and it seems their friendship is getting closer.<br />Felix da housecat's remix is by far my favorite though. The layout of the lyrics and the music is by far better than the original.<BR>The other remixes are techno-esque but are all good and refreshing.<BR>It also comes hand in hand with a &quot;Die another day&quot; remix which is totally awesome and should have been included on the original set of remixes.<br />This is in my opinion the best set of remixes for a single off the American Life album.<br />Go see Madonna on tour!
0312995423|5.0|Hey, I actually thought this book was better than the Da Vinci Code. The plot twists and turns and the action never stops. It's easy to say things are predictable AFTER the fact. It's really not that predictable. More on this later. The cleverness of the plot overcomes the potential technical flaws. And by the way, some of errors people listed were not really errors. Fiction is not supposed to be entirely real, it just has to fit within the constructs of the reality they are in. Most things seemed to make sense and while not explained thoroughly, it was good enough of an explanation anyway. Just a few possible errors. <br />My chief complaint would be that in classic Dan Brown style, the protagonist is able to dodge bullets better than Neo from the Matrix. But hey that is only mildly ridiculous and kinda funny anyway.<br />Enjoyment of novels are really subjective anyway, so you really can't take anyone's word for it, but go with what you know, Dan Brown writes good books. That being said, I can now begin insulting other people who wrote comments.<br />POTENTIAL plot spoilers to follow:<BR>People were complaining that shutting down million dollar devices came down to simply unplugging it. Brown sorta justified why devices of such complexity took some time to shut down, even if you think shutting down a giant computer is like shutting down a microwave. People have been saying &quot;Just yank it out of the wall!&quot; However, that's not the point. The point is an engaging plot with a reasonable amount of technical flaws which are acceptable BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TEXTBOOK.<br />By the way, to address another issue. Strathmore knew the original writer of the program could not trace the revised version because Strathmore ordered the original writer killed. Dead guy wouldn't know the difference right? <br />By the way, Strathmore didn't ask Susan to just come over to blow his cover (interesting word choice). Actually, He asked her over because he had trouble executing his secret plan and needed her genius to help. Besides she's hot. Wouldn't you want to be alone with a hot genius in a VERY SECURE NSA building with her boyfriend slated to die? Sounds like a good idea to me. <br />How could you say the plot was predictable? The end of one of the chapters has you thinking Hale is going to rape Susan, but then he buttons her blouse back up and it turns out Strathmore the old man is in love with her despite the horniness of Hale!  How clever!<br />I'm an Electrical Engineer and unlike that software engineering guy I'm not trying to impose my 'expertise' on disparaging a great novel. Get a life dude! Enjoy good fiction!
B000002LEU|4.0|When a singer takes one's life right when things were beginning to erupt for both the singer and the band, there is sure to be alot of leftover tunes that will be compiled for an album to make lots of money off the free publicity.  What is surprising is when one of these 'unreleased material' albums have some of the band's biggest and greatest songs.  Throughout Substance you'll notice alot of more unpolished, punkish material compared to their two studio albums. Substance throws in their first album they recorded with the moniker Warsaw, and back then they were pretty much an above average punk band.  But the songs they put on here are something, \\"Warsaw\\" and \\"Digital\\" are rollicking songs that work mostly due to Ian Curtis's backpack full of charisma, kind of like Johnny Rotten and how he saved The Sex Pistols from being a middling punk band or should I saw almost saved.  Yeah, you can tell that their influenced by the Sex Pistols and all those other British punk bands.  But like I said, Ian Curtis's performance and Peter Hook's bass make these songs great on their own.<br />Actually the weak points of the album come from the songs that are more similar to the stuff on their albums.  Songs like \\"Autosuggestion\\" drag because you can tell that the band hasn't yet perfected their song, and it's still a work in progress.<br />However, the album has the two greatest Joy Division songs ever written, \\"Atmosphere\\" and \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" the insanely popular British song.  Other slip ups on the album include \\"Novelty\\" and \\"Komakino\\" probably because they are very similar to previous songs on the album except not as good.  It was a great idea to end the song with \\"These Days\\" which is both a great song and a perfect closer.  I'd say if you want a good introduction to Joy Division go with Unknown Pleasures.
0452282152|4.0|This book is about the economics of art as a commodity in a historical society in which it was exactly that. The point is that every society sees the art produced in its own time as a commodity, and usually not a very valuable one at that. The 21st century is the same as the 17th in this regard. However, we do not know which of our commodities will be the art form of a future age.Neither did they.<br />Vermeer painted to live: whether he also lived to paint is the question. Exactly the question the book asks us to think about. His family depend upon him painting and upon patrons buying and commissioning his work. As a result, everyone is paying. And the symbol of all the payments is the pearl earring. Vermeer trades something to get it into the painting, where we think it should be, but then we are unaware of any paintings of the same girl without a pearl earring. His mother in law pays with treachery. His wife pays with suffering. And the girl pays with personal obscurity, and everlasting fame.<br /> And only we benefit.<br />Makes you think, doesn't it?
B000002H33|5.0|Master of puppets is Metallicas finest effort.Even now it still puts the majority of metal to shame THAT'S HOW GOOD THIS ALBUM IS.Very talented and wonderfully produced.Some people don't like track number 6, well the truth is that song puts all the new Metallicas songs to shame.Buy this album its just a stunner and an all time favorite,RIP Cliff Burton.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|While the dramatic elements in this film are premised around &quot;science fiction&quot; concepts, the fact that they are never adequately explained leaves me to hesitate in classifying this as a science fiction film.  I would, instead, claim that the &quot;time travel&quot; sequences are used as a device merely to carry the dramatic elements of the film, which are really what the film seeks to convey.  If you can keep that in mind, you will most likely enjoy the film for what it tries to do.  Like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, the science behind exactly how Frankenstein created the monster was never really explained because it wasn't the point-- it was the social and philosophical consequences of the creation that mattered.<br />And, wow, the social and philosophical elements that are examined in this film are heavy indeed.  While some of the characters as written in the script may be a little over the top, they are, nevertheless, engaging, entertaining and well-acted by all players, including the surprisingly serious Ashton Kutcher.  I would like to see more of him in this type of role, as he was very convincing, believe it or not.<br />The director's cut ending, while actually fitting more with the darkness of the rest of the film, is so disturbing, you may have to question whether you prefer it to the theatrical ending if only for what it suggests about how we affect the lives of those around us.  The theatrical release ending allowed the main character to redeem himself without leaving the audience in utter destruction.  I am not suggesting that one is better, only that there was likely a very good reason why the director's ending didn't make it into the theater.  It's not that it isn't good; it's definitely worth seeing, but I would suggest not watching it if you are feeling a little down.  It's the more philosophical of the endings, but perhaps not in a direction you're prepared to think about.
B000002J09|5.0|Forget about those idiotic Now thats what i call music compilations.  Forget about rap, pop, nu metal.  THIS is music.  Robert Plant's voice is so unique, Jimmy Page definetly makes the top 5 greatest guitarists, and don't forget about Bonzo and JPJ, they're amazing.  If you're hesitant about buying this because maybe you think its too \\"old\\" for you and thats \\"uncool\\", well, I'm only 14 and there's millions of other kids out there who love Zeppelin. Led's just great for all ages.  There's all kinds of unique sounds coming out of this album. You've got straight rock n roll, a bit of folk, some blues, even a hint of heavy metal.<BR>Oh, and by the way, Stairway to Heaven is a great song. A lot people don't like it just because its played a lot on the radio.  Don't buy into that sh*t.  They could play it every 8 minutes on the radio and it wouldn't stop being a good song.  It's got one of the greatest guitar solos in the history of rock n roll. It's simply a beautiful, inspiring song.<BR>So if your one of those rap or pop fans, open your eyes and buy this album.  If you already like rock n roll, this album is essential. And while you're at it, check out the other albums, they're great as well. <BR>peace out, and dont stop rocking!<BR>Olivia<br />(...)
1563894696|5.0|This is the book that got me back into graphic novels/comics. A lush, noir-esque story with great twists and turns as well as a new take on a classic villian that retains the basic origin while expanding it slightly. <br />It's set early in Batman's career, before Robin and before his role was clear in the eyes of police. The only person who believes in him and what he's doing is Jim Gordon, at this point only a lieutenant in the police force. <br />Fantastic art and a brilliantly written story. Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale have quickly become my favorite tandem in graphic novels. Brilliant work! Brilliant!
B000056WTC|4.0|bruce lee is quite possibly the greatest fighter from moses to royce gracie.un-freakin-stoppable!the story is about bruce going to a island to enter into a martial arts tournament.children will probably not be able to handle the violence.twelve and up should be ok.it is low budget and all crappy looking.any martial arts fan there is will like this one and probably already does.the action is incredible .i dont know what people were saying about this one back in 1973 but the real deal it is the best old school martial arts film .it would definately rate really high on a all time list too.it is bruce lees best also,alrhough in return of the drsagon he fights chuck norris.this  is a close second.
B00005RDAF|3.0|The title itself is misleading but overall, Britney: The Videos is a short, not-that-great DVD release to satisfy Britney's fans, such and me.  Though I did enjoy the videos I thought the HBO section would be the entire concert, so I didn't purchase Britney Live in Las Vegas on DVD.  Don't buy this DVD unless you are a Brit fan!  3 out of 5 stars because it's misleading, and mediocre satisfaction.
B00004STW3|3.0|well theres not much of a story.mars attacks.stars are many.jack nicholson is the president.christina applegate is a rednecks ol lady.is that wyona ryder?maybe not.danny devito plays a gambler.wayne newton as well wayne newton.the kids can watch it,but it could freak out the real little ones.tim burton directs this one so it is great as usual.it is one of his best films.there are many creative ideas and imagination galore all throughout this one.the aliens are abselutely hysterical.christina applegate is in it but only for a second.then theres this chick who cheats on michael j fox with pierce brosnan.is this guy always stealing someones woman on his movies?anyway,shes tacky.the hippie chick in it is hot but very deeply emotionaly disturbed.this is a really funny movie and everyone but jack nicholsons personal best.the special effects are not fantastic but the ideas that go into them are very creative.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Even if you aren't an X-Men fanatic like myself, I suggest seeing this movie. Just... see the first one first. I watched this one with a couple of friends, and they were completely clueless... even with me giving a never-ending commentary on who everyone was, what their powers were, etc.<br />This takes place in an alternate world, where everything's basically the same except that there has been an evolutionary phenomenon: a new species of humans has arisen with special powers. For example: controlling the weather or being able to manipulate fire.<br />Professor Charles Xavier runs a school for these 'mutants', where they're able to excercise their powers and be with their own kind. Professor X even has a machine called 'Cerebro' that has the exact location of every mutant and every human in the entire world. He is the only one that knows how to use it.<br />But things have been happening; the president has recently had an assassination attempt by a person identified as a mutant. The government starts cracking down on all the mutants, and one of the first things that they do is break in Xavier's school. Some students escape, but several are captured... in addition to Professor X himself.<br />Turns out that an evil scientist who works in the government staged the mutant attack because he wanted to break into Xavier's school and steal the plans for Cerebro. Then he gets his own mutant son to convince Xavier to kill all the mutants using the machine.<br />Yada yada, the other mutants of the school arrive at the scene of the crime with their used-to-be-enemies, Magneto and Mystique. But don't think that the beloved bad guys are turning good- the entire thing was a scheme to change Cerebro's mission from eliminating all the mutants to eliminating all the HUMANS.<br />But, of course, the X-Men save the day, but not without casualities. Jean Gray dies saving the crew from a huge flood, and Pyro joins up with Magneto and Mystique.<br />As always, Patrick Stewart (ProfessorX) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) were FABULOUS. Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine, Halle Berry (Storm) lost the crazy accent. <br />One thing that I hated was that you didn't see much of Rogue any more... in the last movie, she was one of the lead characters.<br />Other than that, great movie, all-star cast. PG-13 is just the right rating- a little bit of violence, a bit of language. That's all.
6304913176|4.0|in the far future,the armed forces battle giant bugs on thier planet.one of the drill instructers is played by the pervert in sleepers.this movie is far to violent for chilkdren.i cant belive the second part even came fromthis one.this one rules but the sceond one left a lot to be desired.i think military,action and sci fi fans will all enjiy this one.anyone who is squeamish will not like it,as it is very graphic and very violent.there are 2 basic chicks in this movie.a air force chick whose playing two guys and a sexy red head who pines after one of those guys.i think the first chick is nasty but the red head is awesome.she must be pretty co mfortable without a shirt because she takes it off a number of times.this movie kicks butt!some of its futuristic concepts are neat.the violent parts are very graphic.legs flying,guts spraying...........its great.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|I loved Jack Nicholson in As Good As it Gets, so I thought that I'd see this movie and hope that it was just as great. Well... <br />It started out great. The movie ran along pretty smoothly... but the last thirty minutes or so dragged on SO badly. It made you wonder when the thing was going to end. <br />I was SO irritated at Diane Keaton by the time the thing was over, basically because of the little laugh that she had. Jack Nicholson kept the thing interesting, and Keanu Reeves was pretty convincing, considering.<br />It's about a 63-year-old man (Nicholson) who is dating Keaton's daughter, who looks to be about in her late twenties. Keaton is disgusted with the entire thing, until a young, handsome doctor (Reeves) has a similar interest in her. <br />The ending is predictable, but that isn't such a bad thing ALL the time. It's just that this movie was a big disappointment compared to 'As Good As it Gets'.
B0000X81ZI|3.0|this is a pretty good film.a chick goes to get married and someone comes and wastes everyone in the joint.she is left for dead.she comes out of her coma and goes to exact revenge.this is far too violent for children.quenten tarentino directs it,so its good but unrelenting and quite violent.it is tarentinos 2nd best film.there are 3 basic types who will enjoy this one.they would be action fans,horror fans and martial arts fan.there is one very messed up theme in which the bride loses her baby.they didnt have to put that in there.wasnt her husband and the entire wedding parties deaths adequete reason to seek revenge.so dead babies=not entertaining.hollywood take note!uma thurman stars.shes alright,but theres this jap chick in a school girl unirorm.ooh la la!it is good despite the baby thing.that knocked it back to 3 stars from what could have been a 4.
B00006V9A0|3.0|before i start my review i want to say that the reviewer known as the they cant ban me is actually an alias for the cranky reviewer who keeps slamming great rock bands like pink floyd and the eagles andcountering a cetain reviewer known as terrence.j reardons reviews everyday.please ignore the reviewer called( they cant ban me)'s biased and senseless reviews.get this cd along with pearl jams ten.
B00006RCPM|3.0|this was supposed to be a glimpse into a very possible future.i heard on an hbo special that the directer payed the top experts in almost every field to come to his house for the weekend to discuss the realities that will be in the future.the fields included automative,law enforcement,science,marketing etc.im having a hard time beliving this now.the whole point of this story has any basis in reality at all.there are these 3 psycic chicks who the government keeps in a tank.there only function is to send mental images into these computers that fortell future murders.the murder rate drops to 0 and the system is perfect.well one day tom cruise gets his name as a would be murderer and decides to buck the system.there is a child abduction/murder angle in this movie.i think it is unthinkable enough that this really happens.i think it is an abselute atrocity that moviemakers feel like they have to put that in movies.i watch movies for entertainment not to be reminded how sick and twisted this world really is.or two hours i could escape the  harsh realities.then some jerk says hmmmm we could use any bad guy we want.lets use a child killer.that sucks!i would have rated this movie a 4,if not for that.steven spielsberg is your director.ill give him yet another award.the most overated directer of all time.this is his best work ever though.theres a lot of slow parts in it also.a lot of police detective type work and talk.there are a couple gross parts but if you dont mind watching a movie centered around a child killer youll be alright.when the bad guy is finaly met,a very intense scene goes on.i was right there.the main psycic chick would be sexy if she wasnt so damn wierd.tom cruise does a great job in this one.this is a very good movie all in all but the hype makes it sound better.this is tom cruises 2nd best movie.this movie drags on longer than most.
B00000JZI9|2.0|I think tnis movie sucks. The reason I think it sucks is because it boring, it did not catch my attention at all, and there were really no exiting parts in the movie that I like.If enybody were to ask me what I think about this movie I would tell them to save there money, or there time and not watch it.Personally I thought the scenes in the movie were quite not interesting.So really I think this movie sucks, and I wouldnt suggest this movie to enybody.I think they could make this movie better by changing everything.
B00000JZI9|3.0|I never had really seen this movie but  i thought it was pretty cool for a western movie.But sometimes the movie was pretty boring.  This movie was not my kind of movie .My kind of movie is action and movies that are really funny.This movie had alot of action and shooting .This movie has alot of good actors.This movie will be better if it had more funny parts.I recomend to people if their western movie fans too watch siverado.

B00023B1LM|4.0|The theater release of BOURNE IDENTITY is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I hoped for more of the same when I purchased the extended DVD.  In truth, there's not much extension to this.  In fact, I didn't see one second of extra footage (and I've watched the theater release enough times to notice anything new).  But the story is still wonderful and the interviews enjoyable.  I liked the behind-the-scenes info, but it wasn't anything extra special.  <br />If you're wanting to know what happened between the time Jason confronts Treadstone to when he finds Marie, the alternate &quot;bookend&quot; ending is just a joy.  And the reunion of Jason and Marie in this version left me in tears.  So it was worth the money in my opinion and the four stars I gave it.
1400031087|5.0|I do not believe in addiction.  I believe we all make choices every day on how we want to live.  I am not saying it is not a condition, but it is still a conscious choice.  We all wake up everyday and choice what we want to be.  Some people choose a job and a stable life, and some choose drugs and alcohol.<br />That being, said, I really like this book.  The writing is unique and interesting and really drives the point home.<br />An overall great read.
0385512104|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Poor Christopher had be laughing out loud while I was reading.  I have a family member who has a different form of autism from Christopher and this was a great look into autism.  It is a quick read and definately worth it.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne's &quot;Under My Skin&quot;. Finally, a real teenage girl singing about what she truly feels in this day and age where most of the girls this age in the music business these days are superficial and fake. All the songs on here are showing real emotions and experiences. If that is fake, then I don't know what isn't. Although &quot;Let Go&quot; was good in its own way, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is even better than that album. Without The Matrix, Avril has made the finest album around, doing what she really wanted to do, instead of being bogged down by their demands. The only flaw to this album was that it was a little too short for my taste, but all in all, this is a great album. Anyone tired of the oversexed teen-oriented dance-pop and wannabe singer-songwriters who only write what they think the public wants to hear should pick this up. She'll blow those other performers out of the water. And, just look at some of the subjects talked about in the songs: death (&quot;Slipped Away&quot;), abstinence (&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;), being lost (&quot;Nobody's Home&quot;), relationships that were meant to be but were lost (&quot;My Happy Ending&quot;), and loneliness (&quot;How Does It Feel?&quot;). If you think these things are fake, then you've been missing out. Check this out and see what you've been missing all along.
B000002KAT|5.0|I have only recently got into Van Morrison, I have to say, so this review is coming from a 23 year old from Belfast, who is only beginning to realise the impact Van's music has had. I must also admit that I had a strange bias against Van, for only a few years ago when playing his (and my) hometown he turned his back to the audience for his entire performance... While I was not there, that arrogance and ignorance really put me off the man, and unfortunately, that little portion of his music that I had heard...<br />So now, having given this album a chance; my friend recommended it as one of his favourites of all time; I have to admit that, no matter what stories I have heard of this artist, his music is something absolutely eternal and mesmerising. <br />From the stunning opening chords to the title track, through the absolutely seminal &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot;, &quot;Madame George&quot;, &quot;Ballerina&quot; and &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;, I have found an album with such undeniable heart and warmth that I know it will stay with me forever as one of the very few albums to have changed my perception of music.<br />Perhaps it is the unbelievable vocal talents of the man, the jazzy and superb musicianship or just maybe the fact that I can (100%) identify with the visions this man is painting through his lyrics... It is not something I have experienced before whereby a lyric such as &quot;Down on Cyprus Avenue&quot; or &quot;Sandy Row&quot; can conjur such vivid and mesmerising images to my mind... I live just 5 minutes from the lovely Cyprus Avenue and I know it well. Thankfully I do not know Sandy Row too well; a scummy, horrible area of Belfast these days, I am proud never to have ventured deep into it. I do also know the house where Van grew up however, my father having taken me and my friends many times passed the house (which is now adorned with a brass plaque with his name) in east Belfast, just around the corner from my own house. It is maybe these insider views of the area I know that Van grew up in that help the pictures become clearler and more poignant... But his voice and passion can never be denied... It is truly something to behold, whether it be the vast epic of &quot;Madame George&quot; or the fiery jazz bombast of &quot;The Way Young Lovers Do&quot;, you can never deny this man doesn't hold perhaps the most original, impressive voice in music... ever. <br />This album, it must be said, seems (to me at least) to be his absolute masterpiece... Moondance is an album I have always heard since I was growing up... I never listened to it specifically, but it was always on in the kitchen when I was a kid...and, while I have yet to hear much of his later work, it is a journey I am going to fully enjoy and cherish. A man, a genius and an absolute legend. Beautiful album.
6305428352|5.0|In my opinion this movie is an excellent way for the Hearing In Paired to watch movies like this one.There should be more movies like Mr Holland's Opus.I have read in one reveiw which The Beatles are the main topic of the movie (music)which is crap as there are all types of music in the movie wheather there influence is there or not,watch the movie and love the music or don't watch it at all.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|2 weeks ago I hated Wicked. The word sent the sound of popping gum to my ears. <br />I can't really fingerpoint exactly WHY I &quot;loathed&quot; it... maybe it was because my sister was quickly becoming obsessed and my sad initial instinct is to go against. Likewise, people all over the place (no, not here in Texas - LOL) were raving about Wicked and, of course, the obsessed Wicked fans drove me up the wall claiming it to be the greatest show Broadway has ever seen. All this calamity over WICKED turned me off greatly. <br />I'm a Sondheim head. I love rich, complex storylines with witty and insightful lyrics. I like music with time changes madder than the Mad Hatter. I like a show that will make me think for the rest of my life. SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE quickly comes to mind. The first Wicked songs I heard were &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, and &quot;No Good Deed&quot;. &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; definitely hooked me, but soon grew off me. It didn't have that long-lasting quality I'm so used to. &quot;No Good Deed&quot; was a favorite then and still is now. More comments on it later... &quot;Popular&quot;. This song could have possibly completely pushed me over the edge to hating Wicked forever. <br />I began reading many opinions of Wicked. Pretty split. Many who loved it, many who disliked it for interpreting the book in such a family-friendly, accessible way. <br />Many months I had a complete indifference to Wicked. It was kind of like those knat bugs that don't really BOTHER you, but just won't simply GO AWAY.  <br />I saw the Tonys this year and thought the Wicked performance was awful. Idina Menzel's high pitched gasping after every syllable and the incredibly off key notes at the end. The flying machine was pretty cool, though. <br />2 weeks ago I was in NYC with my family and saw a few shows. A few months ago we were supposed to buy tickets to see Wicked. Never got around to it and ended up being too late. As is, every show through August is sold out. We tried for the Wicked lottery and did not win. The weirdest thing was walking back to the hotel and feeling REALLY upset that we weren't seeing Wicked. What? I'm not supposed to care! What the hell am I doing?? When we got home, I borrowed my sister's Wicked cast recording and just listened. .........<br />I love this music. I love these actresses. (For the most part) I love the story. I feel that it should have followed the dark and dramatic themes of book rather than making it a -respectively- fun-loving pop show. I feel that it could have been a masterpiece this way. And the unborn music it would have created really almost brings a tear to my eye knowing that it didn't turn out that way. <br />This recording has introduced me to who I think to be one of Broadway's greatest revelations of this generation. One with a capturing personality and stage presence much bigger than her petite size. One with a voice of an angel, who's range carries over every spectrum of music with impeccable comedic timing. That of one Miss Kristin Chenoweth. My #1 leading lady is Bernadette Peters and I believe that Chenoweth has the chops to follow in her footsteps. I realize that this is Idina Menzel's show. She does an excellent job with the role and her songs (from what I'm hearing). She has a powerful rock belt and emotion in her voice. I'm happy she won the Tony. However, from first listen, Kristin Chenoweth completely stole the show for me. She transfers well on CD with the crystal clear soaring voice and comedic/dramatic skills. I'm in terrible pain that I have not and will not see her in Wicked ever. All I can do is pray to the good Gods that she will come back to perform on Menzel's final performance in Jan. 2005 because that is most likely when I will see the show. Whatever the case, I will follow what Chenoweth does in the future. I can tell she's something to take note of.      <br />It hasn't been mentioned much, to my surprise, but I am in AWE of the opener &quot;No One Mourns the Wicked&quot;. All of its percussive layers with the harmonies of the ensemble.. And of course that beautiful operatic voice of Chenoweth's. It's my favorite from the show. Other favorites: &quot;What Is This Feeling?&quot;, &quot;Dancing Through Life&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;One Short Day&quot;, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, &quot;Thank Goodness&quot;, &quot;No Good Deed&quot;, &quot;For Good&quot;. <br />4 stars only because 5 stars goes to a recording that has no &quot;skip over&quot; songs. I tend to skip over Joel Grey's songs and &quot;Something Bad&quot;. <br />5 stars for Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Together they are gold. How about a filmed performance of Wicked to preserve this great chemistry they share.<br />This has probably been the fastest I've ever fallen in love with something... especially after really despising it. I don't get it.
0142000671|5.0|Deceptively short and simply written, John Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; actually offers any reader quite a lot to think about. The relationship between the two main characters highlights a number of issues relating to the themes of mental illness and friendship. The story takes place in Depression-era California. Lennie is a very large, strong man, but not too bright. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body, but because he fails to comprehend his own strength, he frequently does harm to others without meaning to. He loves to pet soft things, like mice and rabbits and puppies, and then becomes distraught when they die, not understanding that he has been too rough with them. Lennie's companion is the brains of the pair, a small man by the name of George. He fills the role of both caretaker and friend to Lennie, and does his best to keep him out of trouble, though he doesn't always succeed.<br />The two men are traveling laborers, moving around as the availability of work dictates. To keep Lennie motivated and obedient, George pacifies him with stories of a future bright with luxury and free from worry. They'll buy a small farm, he tells his avid companion, and live off the fat of the land. They'll have their own crops and their own livestock, and go to shows whenever they feel like it. And if Lennie stays out of trouble, he can even have some rabbits of his own to take care of. Captivated by this vision, Lennie does his honest best to obey George and avoid doing anything that might jeopardize their dream. But his best just isn't good enough, and just when their plans look like they might actually be falling into place, Lennie makes the biggest bungle of all, leaving George with an extremely hard decision to make.<br />One of the social problems Steinbeck seems to be commenting on here is the place of the mentally ill or impaired in society. What was their place at this point in time? Did they even have a place? This story makes it clear that there really weren't many avenues open to the mentally ill at the time. They could be institutionalized, but such places had little merit during the 1930s, when mental illness was not yet really understood. Patients were treated little, if at all, better than criminals. The other option would be for such people to try to get along in the outside world of &quot;normal&quot; people, as Lennie does. When Lennie's Aunt Clara dies, he is left with no family and so falls in with George, who becomes his new guardian. But the outside world is no more understanding of Lennie's handicaps than the doctors of the time, and provides countless pitfalls of its own.<br />The other major theme of the story is friendship. What is true friendship? To what extent does one have responsibility to a friend, and what does this responsibility entail? This is something George must struggle with every day. He feels obligated to care for Lennie and help keep him out of trouble, though he clearly realizes that his own life would be far simpler if he were on his own. In the end, when Lennie commits the ultimate, irredeemable blunder, George must sort through this inner conflict to decide what is best for both of them. Should he continue to protect his companion, or should he save his own skin? And if he chooses to put Lennie's best interests first, what course of action would be the most just? The conclusion he arrives at is both intricately complex and, in another light, quite obviously simple at the same time.<br />Aside from these two overriding themes, Steinbeck also gives us glimpses into other issues of the time, among them racism and labor conditions. On the farm where the bulk of the story takes place, one of the characters is a black stable hand. Nicknamed &quot;Crooks&quot; because of his crooked back, this man is estranged from the rest of the workers (all white). The only one who fails to comprehend why Crooks should be treated any differently than anyone else is Lennie, whose simple mind doesn't grasp the idea of racism. We also see what life was like for Depression-era vagrants, moving from place to place in search of work. The living conditions were not ideal (though those in this story are far from the worst imaginable), the food provided often lacked proper nourishment, and employers could treat their hired help in just about any way they pleased. After all, the laborers were lucky to find any paying work at all. Even if they didn't like the conditions, where else could they go?<br />I'd definitely recommend this book to any reader. Though times have changed somewhat, the issues Steinbeck comments on are still very relevant today. The ideas presented in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; are many and deep, and much time can (and should) be spent contemplating them, but the book remains very accessible. It is a very short story, and can easily be read in one day. The style of writing is simple and direct, while retaining detail and a startling depth of feeling. However, it is by no means a feel-good story, so don't read this one at a time when you're already down in the dumps. While the ending has a very nice sense of resolution, and one is left feeling that George made the best decision he could under the circumstances (or, at least, this is the feeling I was left with), it is still rather depressing.rasp the idea of racism.

0786915749|4.0|If you look at this book, then you might believe what you have in you're hands is a Lord of The Rings rip off. After all, it contains dwarves, elves, all of the essential things. Well, you would be wrong. Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the first of three begins with lifelong friends meeting in a bar within their home town, but their quiet evening of reminiscing is interrupted by 2 mysterious wanderers called Riverwind and Goldmoon. Goldmoon saves a man's life with a mysterious rod, after the man falls into a fire. As it turns out, goblins are after the rod for reasons unknown, so after saving the man's life, she gathers together Tanis, Sturm, Raistlin, Caramon, Flint, and Tasselhoff to help her escape the town before she is Goldmoon and Riverwind are both killed. Upon escaping the city, the group is in danger, as now they are being followed by the goblins. They venture across the land of Krynn, until they reach a forest in which Raistlin unleashes his powerful magic. By the end of the first book[ the book is divided into 3 parts] much has happened. When book two begins, they open a slave caravan, and release many prisoners. They then go to a castle where a great battle begins, and one of the prisoners they released from the slave caravan by the name of Fizban dies. I don't remember everything that happened in tis book, as I read it about 2 years ago, but I do remember that there is an extremely gory part in which Riverwind is severely injured. This is a wonderful book, and I advise you to read it now.

B00006L3S3|5.0|Mind Games has always been my favorite John Lennon solo work, going back to '73.  But I was always disappointed by the mediocre sound quality.  Thank God, John, and Yoko for this current version, which is not only remastered, IT IS REMIXED!  The sound quality has been greatly improved!  So if you ever liked this album, or like John Lennon's solo work, this CD MUST be in your collection.
B000066C1N|5.0|When I saw the movie, I noticed Bryan Adams' music right away.  I didn't realize how perfectly matched the soundtrack was for the movie until I bought the CD and listened to it, then watched the movie again.  It's wonderful!  You almost can't help but to sing along, and Adams' vocal performance is particularly poignant.  Since the movie is largely about non-speaking characters, the music is particularly good at conveying the feeling behind certain scenes such as when Spirit is in the train car and imagines he sees his herd in the snowflakes.  You'll listen to this cd over and over.
0446613444|5.0|I really enjoyed the first in the series, The Black Echo; but this one is even better.  The main character, Harry Bosch, is developing nicely.  The mystery was intriguing.  The only predictable thing is Harry seems to become attracted to all the women.  Not very discriminating, but that might be a typical male trait.  Overall, an excellent read!
B000008H1U|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums from the 80's.<BR>Included on this disc is the singles 'Steel Monkey' and 'Farm on the Freeway'.<BR>As always great musicianship and vocals by Ian Anderson and great guitar work by Martin Barre.<BR>It is definitely a Tull album that's worth giving a listen to.<BR>Check it out.

B0001WTUH6|1.0|23 minutes of new/remixed material, the glossy slipcase boasts.  New bonus features, it boasts.  Don't be a fool (as I was) and allow an attractive package to convince you that you need to buy yet another version of a pre-existing DVD.  I, for one, am getting rather sick of this \\"release-one-version-then-release-another-one-six-months-later\\" deal that movie studios and DVD distributors pull to squeeze even more money from our pockets--I'd much rather wait extra-long for a definitive version of something than buy multiple versions of it.  I am not the biggest \\"Underworld\\" fan, either, but what this version had to offer seemed intriguing--considerably less so when I watched the actual film.  The recut/new scenes are mostly pointless filler, adding additional weight to an already heavy film, and do nothing to further develop characters or enrich the plot.  \\"Underworld\\" plays best as a guilty-pleasure in the vein of \\"Ghosts of Mars\\"--put your logic on the back burner for a few hours and just obliterate your senses with some art-directed action.  Those fans of \\"The Crow\\" will undoubtedly love this cooler-looking version--complete with a comic- and storyboard book--but for the more casual viewer, I'd merely stick with the stripped down, original DVD release, which is sufficient, and undoubtedly cheaper.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|buy this album if you like watching grass grow or if you are a mindless thirteen year old. Like many have stated before, the lyric really suck. I know that some of you like shallow songs about breakups and crappily written songs that try way to hard to have meaning, but you're probably a thirteen year old :) There is, however, one remotely good track, &quot;My happy ending&quot; which I initially liked because it had a nice melody and I could ignore the silly lyrics, but now it just gets annoying. so this album gets two stars, because it entertains its target audience (thirteen year olds and people who like watching grass grow ie boring people) quite nicely.
B00009IEDC|5.0|I am not sure about the first reviewer of this CD but it is one of the best groups to come out in awhile. At least Amy Lee can sing unlike Britney Spears!!
B00005JN0A|1.0|I saw on the box, &quot;From the makers of Old School and Road Trip&quot;, two movies I found to be hilarious.  I figured I'd give this a shot, the Unrated version of course.<br />Pathetic.  There isn't one decent gag in the movie.  Well, depends on what you mean by &quot;gag&quot;, because that's what I wanted to do when I saw the nude beach scene.  Let's put it this way: there is much more full-frontal male nudity in this movie than there is female nudity.  If that's your thing, go for it.  Not mine, I'll take naked chicks thank you very much.<br />I really could hardly believe how painfully unfunny this movie is.  The fight with the robot mime sucked.  The soccor team scenes sucked.  The &quot;Scotty Doesn't Know&quot; thing got driven right into the ground, it wasn't funny the first time.  The exchange rate thing where U.S. currency got them all kinds of fancy stuff was not funny.  None of it was.

0446608955|2.0|This is the first book I read by Nicholas Spark, after hearing many good reviews, and many translation of his work to movie screen.  I pick this as the first book because of its size, a bit longer than 200 pages, so that I can finish it in 2 days.  <BR>I must say I am disappointed (not a bit, but quite a lot).  Not only the plot was HIGHLY predictable, I don't think it is good on character development.  <BR>In Hong Kong, such similar themes have been repeated in the movies in the 50-60s .   About 10 years ago, we had a movie called &quot;C'est La Vie Mon Cherie&quot; with similar theme, but with a much much much moving plot, much much much better characters. The female lead earned a best female actress award in the HK Movie Acadamy Award.  <BR> <BR>I know this review may piss some of the fans of the author, but I will keep on reading one or two more of his books to see whether I can change my mind.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I pretty much agree with everyone else about this movie....but did you know that this is NOT an OFFICIAL James Bond movie?  It is not part of the series.  Need proof?  Just search for any James Bond CD's in the Music section of Amazon.com and look through the playlists of the Theme Song CD's.  Never Say Never Again is not on any of the lists.  That's why this movie seems like a duplicate.  It is a cheap knock-off of Thunderball.
B000031XCR|3.0|Celine Dion has an amazing and beautiful voice, and the songs here showcase it wonderfully. Although I feel a few essential songs have escaped the collection, ie. 'All By Myself' and 'Think Twice', the majority of the songs here are great. Highlights include 'The Power Of Love', 'Beauty and The Beast', 'Because You Loved Me', 'That's The Way It Is' and the incredible and beautiful 'To Love You More'. The massive and Grammy-award winning hit 'My Heart Will Go On' is nice as well. The only reason I didn't give this album 4 stars is that I feel some of the songs are fillers, but all in all this album is an essential addition to any record collection.
B000003TA4|5.0|if ever there was a cd that everyone, regardless of musical taste, could enjoy, this has to be it. What is not on offer here?? Theres pop, grunge, punk rock and even some acostic ballads thrown in for good measure. Its also catchy as hell, has intelligent lyrics (which you dont need to understand to enjoy the music, although 'in bloom' will make a fool out of you) and is altogether just a very strong, consistent set of songs. What more can you ask for?? <br />If you dont love this album then you dont know wat good music is. Period
B000002UA7|4.0|The womans voice is incredible and her songs are very different and mystical. My personal favourite is the completely haunting song 'Wuthering Heights' as it is delicate, the vocals are ethereal and the song stays in your head for a long time, its is a very beautiful song. Other highlights include 'Babooshka',  'The Dreaming', The Man With The Child In His Eyes', 'Wow' and 'Hounds Of Love'. Every song is enjoyable, a wonderful album.
B00007BH5C|5.0|this is some of the most beautiful music ever composed for a film or otherwise.  \\"Gollum's Song\\" is probably the most heartbreaking piece of music I have ever heard.  It sums up his sorry existence perfectly - \\"where once was light, darkness falls\\".  The vocal by Emiliana Torrini is wonderful.      I cannot recommend this CD high enough!!
B00000IPAX|1.0|This album sucks, Blink 182's weiners are small.
B00005JMYG|5.0|How could you not love this film? It has a 5 star cast! Will Ferril from old school, Christina Applegate from Married with Children, and special appearances by Ben Stiller, Vince Vaun, Jack Black, and Luke Wilson. The performances were hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing. As watching the film I noticed that there is other cast members from SNL in this film. Will Ferril plays Ron Burgundy so well. Will Ferril would have made a great anchorman for an actual T.V. These actors/actresses play there characters so well its hard to believe this is a movie. <br />[the plot] Set in 1970s San Diego, this is the story of local TV anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell), God's gift to the ladies and the area's most respected reader of the teleprompter of the news fit to be known, who finds his position challenged by an ambitious female newscaster Veronica Corningstone (Applegate) who, unlike Ron, actually knows something about journalism. Ron and Veronica then begin dating and fall in love. But when Ron couldn't make it on time for the news they needed a replacement, which was Veronica. Veronica nails it and Ron gets mad because he didn't really take her serious when she said she wanted to be an anchorwomen. Then it becomes a fued between the two. A hilarious film.<BR> <BR>If you love Will Ferril you will not be disapointed by his performance in this film. He is funny through out the whole film and doesn't get annoying. If you love comedies, this film is definitley for you. A must see film!!!!

B000268QB2|5.0|Nice guys, amazing &amp; energetic live show, incredible album!!  I've found people who liked 80's Brit music will love this band. They are definitely a breath of needed air in the industry! The album's title is exactly what you will find within the lyrics of the album. Tom Chaplin &amp; gang has no qualms being vulnerable with lyrics or music so it's an album one can definitely relate to. Seeing them live is even better so if you can catch them, do it!!
0316921173|5.0|It might be a better idea to skip the reviews and just read Infinite Jest.  Sometimes expectations ruin an experience... countless times I've watched a movie or listened to an album that I would have enjoyed if only somebody hadn't ruined it for me by giving me some hope of an experience that would reset my life.  With this book, I was lucky to stumble upon at just the right time in my life... I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />I believe that the fact you are aware of Infinite Jest's existence is enough cause for you to read it.  Maybe you won't enjoy it.... maybe you will...  if you don't have money, maybe you'll find it at the library or a friend's house.<br /><br />That said; a brief description:<br /><br />This is a very thoroughly written book... seriously, I've heard it referred to as 'macrofiction'.  It's rumored the unedited appendix would dwarf Anna Karina.  Even so it's a relatively breezy read... you can expect to be given near comprehensive descriptions of many many subjects, but in an obtuse and meaningful way (comparatively, say, with the turgid and repetitious descriptions of the typical supermarket fiction \\"sally sue may felt that if he left her alone for one more minute her heart would burst like so many shards of glass.  she was swollen with longing, her stomach would also burst, she panicked knowing a single full lipped deeply voiced word of his would throw her over the edge\\").<br /><br />If, like me, you haven't the benefit of higher education type vocabulary and are completely oblivious to context, it might help to have a pocket dictionary handy.<br /><br />Narrative-wise, it's neither exactly concise nor particularly coherent (which is a characteristic I find common to most of the reading I enjoy) ... vaguely speaking, it's sort of a serious non-serious parody of Freudian family-sports drama and teen non-angst fiction slash treatise on the multitude of addictions that shape our becoming. There were times when I physically laughed.... which almost never happens, especially not while reading.<br /><br />So yah... it's a good book.reading.     So yah... it's a good book.

I totally agree. :)<br />Anyhow, for everyone else, if you're interested in female vocals, you should listen to some of these bands.<BR>More than likely, you'll put your Evanescence CD in the trash. In my opinion, they're not a _bad_ band; they're just average. I think most the following bands would be in the same genre and they have more talent.<br />Lacuna Coil<BR>Within Temptation<BR>Theatre of Tragedy<BR>After Forever<BR>Nightwish<BR>Tristania<br />And for female vocals that resemble male vocals, we all love Arch Enemy

0811729117|5.0|The famous Tiger Ace, Otto Carius, has provided a valuable memoir of his experiences in WWII.  This book is an asset whether you are a professional soldier, WWII historian, or Tiger tank afficinado.  <BR>     Valuable lessons are gained by learning the problems associated with fielding new technology in the time of war.  While the Tiger tank proved to be an awesome weapon while operational; its' Achilles heel was the tremendous amount of logistic and maintenance support required to keep it running.  <BR>     I was reminded of Stephen Crane's &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; when reading about Carius' first engagement as an officer, but by the end of the book one thing that is not in dispute is the personal courage of Carius and many of the tankers he led, especially Albert Kerscher.  They would slug out the battle from extreme close ranges often so close that traversing the main gun was not possible!  <BR>     The drama of tank warfare on the Eastern Front is simply told in this book and valuable lessons can be learned by those in the profession of arms. Much like Patton, Carius relays his frustration that the German and Anglo-American forces did not join together and turn on the forces of the Soviet Union.  The desperation of German forces to retard the advance of the Red Army allowed many Germans to escape and avoid Communist 0ppression is noteworthy.<BR>Yet these brave German soldiers were an embarrassment to the Post-War Germany and unlike the US where our veterans are dubbed the &quot;greatest generation,&quot; German veterans are shunned and instead monuments go up to the draft dodgers and deserters.<BR>In light of the recent prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison, his comments concerning the treatment of Prisoners of War by the Americans are interesting.<BR>     I am fortunate to have met Otto Carius, who is still alive and active as a pharmicist at his Tiger Apothecary.  A generous man, he personally delivers medicines to those homebound.  <BR>     One of the most telling comments he made to me concerned his leadership as the Company Commander of 2d Company, 502d Heavy Tank Battalion; while in command he did not have one soldier killed in the company - many were wounded, but all lived.  That fact, tied with his successes on the Armor battlefield in high intensity conflict truly makes him one-of-a-kind.
B00005S6K8|4.0|In addition to this movie I've also seen the older one starring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, and I found that both can be enjoyed almost as two different kinds of films.  Though not without its moments of drama, the Bogart/Hepburn film was lighter, more sparkling and witty, but also a little more shallow.  In that movie, I couldn't understand the attraction between Bogart and Hepburn; they never seem to connect across their age gap.<br />In this remake of Sabrina, Julia Ormond gives a performance that's more mature and has more depth.  Once she goes to Paris and grows up, she truly grows up (unlike Hepburn, who is loveable but too childlike).  The love that develops between her character and Harrison Ford's is more believable; the movie takes more time and trouble to develop a plausible relationship between the grown up chaffeur's daughter and the billionaire without a social life.  In addition to that, it also has witty dialogue and funny moments, just like the original.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Swanson deserved the Academy Award for this picture.  The ending shot alone shows this.<br />A superb film all the way around except for the casting of Nancy Olson.  Inexplicably, Olson won a supporting actress nomination from the academy that year, but I fail to see why. Her character gets on my nerves, especially making goo eyes at William Holden.  But this is just a little quirk I have.<br />The film succeeds brilliantly mainly because of Swanson.  It has an effecting score, great cinematography and great acting from the principle characters (Olson notwithstanding).<br />You will not be disappointed with this one!
B00003CY5J|4.0|When watching this film you can't help but think about the missed opportunities.  A movie with De Niro, Norton and Brando should have been great, like something never before seen.  In that sense, The Score is a letdown, though if you're a fan of these great actors, you'll still have a good time watching it (be warned though - Brando doesn't appear all that often and usually he's in some dim, shadowy environment...)<br />What I liked about The Score, other than the actors, is that it takes its time providing us with all the details of the heist.  So many heist movies have stunts that seem entirely implausible; they don't explain much to the viewer and just count on the fact that we won't think too deeply about what's going on.  This one builds things slowly, while providing us with the tension and contrast between the characters - steady dependable De Niro and the hotshot, Ed Norton.  Don't expect much violence; this movie is about people using their wits and trying to trip each other up.  The ending is also deeply satisfying.
B000001EGA|5.0|I could hardly wait in 1975 to acquire Elton's new album, one of the hundreds of thousands of people who bought the album as soon as it was available in record stores. I placed the record on the player, sure that I was going to hear another \\"Yellow Brick Road.\\" Then I was puzzled. What kind of music was this? It was not simple pop with catchy tunes. It was, well, complicated, and sophisticated. It was also Elton's first concept album, and it took me a while to realize that this album was the story of Elton and Bernie's rise to fame, in what appeared to be a relatively short period of time, but which actually took from 1966 to occur.<br /><br /> As I said, this music is very complicated, sophisticated, and beautiful. There are some faster songs, but some of Elton's most carefully crafted music is here as well. The album begins with the title tune, a rock song with a bit of country flavor that represents the flamboyant heart of Elton, and the quieter, western-loving style of Bernie Taupin. The song alternates between a style reminiscent of \\"Madman Across the Water\\" to a style that was more fully realized in \\"Rock of the Westies.\\"<br /><br /> In \\"The Tower of Babel\\" and \\"Bitter Fingers\\" the dynamic duo lament the difficulties of getting into the entertainment industry. The first song is about the difficulty of entry, the second is about being a stable hack for a record company, churning out songs by the basketful to make ends meet, never seeming to work fast enough or to earn enough. \\"Bitter Fingers\\" has a beautiful piano entry, which extends into the song. Elton at his performing best.<br /><br /> \\"Tell Me When the Whistle Blows\\" can play on several levels, depending on which part of the song. The style of the song is quite similar to songs such as \\"Danny Bailey\\" or \\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\" from \\"Yellow Brick Road.\\" There is a fast rock beat, but the violins give a rich, lush feel. Part of the song longs for being home, and part of the song wonders whether the maturing individual in the song still has the talent and enthusiasm he had when he was a wild kid.<br /><br /> Then comes \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight,\\" one of the most phenomenal songs that Bernie and Elton have ever written. This song is about a time when Elton was nearly ready to get married.  He made a weak attempt to kill himself, which Bernie and Long John Baldry stopped, and then Baldry talked him out of it. The complexity of this music is symphonic. The piano chords and the harmonies are full and show Elton John having fully mastered the art of creating music.<br /><br /> The next two songs, \\"Gotta Get a Meal Ticket\\" and \\"Better off Dead,\\" are faster, and are about aspects of being starving artists. Both are decent songs, but they are preludes to the last three songs of the original album.<br /><br /> \\"Writing\\" is a song about success. Once we are successful, how long can we sustain that success? Also, what will people in the future think about what we did. Will it have meaning for them, and will they think it is good? Bernie's lyrics tell a story, and Elton does an outstanding job complementing the lyrics.<br /><br /> The last two songs remain among my all-time favorite Elton John songs. \\"We All Fall in Love Sometimes\\" and \\"Curtains\\" transition from one to the next. Though the topics are different, the tenor and beauty of the music is common. When Elton allows his piano to come to the forefront of his music the result is nearly always wondrous. \\"We All Fall\\" also has one of the best bridges ever performed in an Elton John song. Elton also plays a harpsichord and a mellotron, used so effectively by the Moody Blues in the previous decade. The results can only be appreciated by listening.<br /><br /> \\"Curtains\\" begins so beautifully that when I am mellow it brings tears to my eyes. The lyrics are brought to life by Elton's vocal and musical interpretation, striking into your heart and soul. Only the emotionless could fail to appreciate this fragile, emotional music.<br /><br /> This album was the culmination of years of effort. The music is mature and well-crafted. Beautiful seems a paltry word to describe much of it. The production was the best ever of any Elton John album to date. The skill of the art was theirs, and they capitalized on it to create one of the best rock albums of all time.<br /><br /> Included on this remaster are three bonus songs. \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" was a big hit in 1975 for Elton John, and featured the talents of Elton's friend John Lennon. \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\" was another big Elton John hit, and was written as a tribute. \\"One Day at a Time\\" is another quite good song that helps fill out the potential time of a CD.<br /><br /> Unfortunately I am inadequate for the task of adequately reviewing this CD. While Elton had many creative moments and beautiful songs prior to this album, and had many other excellent compositions, for one magical album the music, the lyrics, and the production all came together to create an album for all times and all ages. While I generally feel that people are silly for saying they want to give a CD dozens of stars, this album would rate more than five stars if I could give them.ic.<br /><br /> This album was the culmination of years of effort.

0743424425|4.0|The main reason that The Shining is so effective as a horror story is that the horror stems from both the characters' environment and the characters themselves, namely the father, a man struggling to recover from alcoholism and struggling to establish himself as a well-respected writer.  The father's demons come alive in the creepy Overlook Hotel.  And what's terrific about the book, in comparison to what I thought was a more mediocre movie version, are the unexpected moments of humanity; even when the father is beastly, you can see glimpses of his guilt, his remorse, and his overwhelming love for his young son, whom he keeps hurting.<br />In addition to all this human drama, the supernatural qualities of the hotel are terrifying.  Let me put it this way - weeks after reading this book, I would pause before drawing open a bathtub or shower curtain.  I could not look at playgrounds the same way.  Stephen King knows how to toy with all your senses, and it's very disturbing.  This is one of his best novels, if not the best, that he's ever written.
B00005JMCT|3.0|American Pie will always be a good classic wild comedy to remember. If you've watched the good old time classic of \\"Revenge Of The Nerds\\", \\"Porky's\\", \\"Road Trip\\" and \\"Van Wilder\\" then you'll like American Wedding which also can be called American Pie 3.<br />The only flaw of the movie is some characters are missing. Oz, Heather, Vanessa and that other chick that had no interest with Finch. The Sherminator was left out too. What's the deal with that?<br />But it still was a good flick. Stifler still made us laugh like never before. He goes in to ruin Jim's party. He was almost convicted of raping a dog while Stifler fell down because one of the dogs knocked him down and licked off the cake frosting to you know where.<br />Makes you wonder if Stifler is gay. Well, he didn't hesitate to kiss with Ashton in \\"Dude where's my car?\\". And poor Stifler lost the wedding ring while the little dog ate it and \\"dumped\\" it in the grass. Boy was that funny trying to play it off like it was chocolate and you should've seen Finche's reaction.<br />Once again, it hasn't lost its touch where Finch scores with Stifler's mom at the end. But poor Stifler ends up scoring with the band chick's grandma-Uuuggghhh! Gross!<br />A good comedy indeed.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|There are things worth seeing in Tim Burton's Big Fish.  Some of the scenes are visually stunning.  There are some colorful minor characters (especially the poet/bank robber played by the wonderful Steve Buscemi).  And the ending is pretty moving.<br />Other than that, there seems to be something aimless to the film.  It was difficult for me to get interested in what was happening to the characters; I never felt that I truly got to know them, and though perhaps this is part of the point, it was frustrating.  Also, Ewan MacGregor's insistently upbeat performance would occasionally get on my nerves.
0316666343|5.0|I have yet to read the last few chapters of the book, and I have to admit it has been a struggle putting it down.  However in places I have found it so heart-wrenching that I had no choice but to find something else to do for a few hours!  Yet despite the stomach churning account of Susie's rape and murder and the pity evoked by her poor family, particularly her father, The Lovely Bones is the sort of book that has a feel good factor somewhere amongst the pain and tears.  If you choose to read this book, be open minded - I don't believe in Heaven myself but I found the idea of Susie sat in her Heaven looking down at her loved ones both creative and warming.  Obviously most readers will find this quite unrealistic and if you don't believe in ghosts or the afterlife prepare to put your own views on hold in order to enjoy the story.  The true beauty of the story is the way it deals with real loss and the grief of losing a daughter, sister or friend in such tragic circumstances.  The way Susie Salmon narrates the story puts the reader in her position - the only thing I found slightly annoying was her lack of anger at what had happened to her.  But read the novel for what it is - a beautifully crafted and poignant story - and you will find the subject matter stays with you for a long time after.
6305313687|5.0|This movie will, quite simply put, blow you away.  An incredible look into the mind of Derek Vinyard(a skin head) and his little brother Danny Vinyard(a up coming skin head).  You will find yourself repulsed at times as you catch yourself actually findng their convoluted arguements for white supremecy to make sense.  Edward Norton took this part and made it his own and drags you into the movie in such a way that by the end you really feel like you've known the characters for years.  This is not for those with weak stomachs, nor those who, for example, have trouble sitting through the first few scenes of a movie like Clockwork Orange, it has near the same gut wrenching effect.  But like a Kubrick film, once you get past the initial nausea you truly learn something about a societal battle.  This is an amazing work on the foundations of racism in America and how a family overcomes it.
B000001FKY|3.0|In 1985, after putting the five then-current members of Def Leppard into a freeze-dried chamber, Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange began the follow-up to his last studio effort, &quot;Pyromania.&quot;  His vision was grander this time, and the work on the new songs was slow but precise.  He recruited '80's-era T-1000 Robots to complete his singular vision, but the sessions were fraught with problems.  Some of the T-1000's rebelled, and Lange, who was suffering through a terrible bout of stress, perhaps because he had not met Shania Twain at this juncture, soon had to take a leave of absence.  <br />When Lange came back the T-1000's were in full control of the monumental &quot;Hysteria&quot; sessions, and he could do nothing but wallow in drug-induced self-pity.  His only real contribution to the album was the opening riff on track 12, which the robots granted him.  (It's really not a bad riff, Mutt!!)  <br />By August 1987, &quot;Hysteria&quot; was ready to roll for public consumption, and the members of Def Leppard were released from their concubines.  A tradgedy occurred when something went wrong with drummer Rick Allen's thawing process, and the young man lost his left arm.  Luckily, the stilted beats the robots had concocted on &quot;Hysteria&quot; suited Allen's new playing style just fine, and everbody was anxious to proceed.  <br />In another unexplained tradgedy with the band, singer Joe Elliott contracted the mumps while frozen, but he lived to tell his tale.  <br />If you caught this tour in '87, '88, '89, you've caught history, no??
0380789019|5.0|this a good book. it is reaeally good fool. It is like fantasy, but not really. it is good. it is a good book that is good and it is a book, see, it is a good book and i liked this book beacuse it was a book that was a good book that was good.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|A lot of people who have reviewed this album have said that Slipknot have changed their style for the worst and blame Rick Rubin for ruining their sound.  Four words for all of you, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  How could you possibly say that Rick Rubin (for those of you who don't know, he is the super-producer that brought us most of Slayer's albums, including \\"Reign in Blood\\", all the Deftones albums, almost all the Pantera albums) can ruin a band's sound.  I think this album is by far the best Slipknot CD yet.  They have a great heavy sound and \\"Duality\\" is one of the best songs of the year so far.  I think this album is definitely worth purchasing.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|this is a good album. that is it, just good. 12fifty1 is a good song, so is reptilia. this is overrated.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|A definite surprise - I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would.  Very well acted, especially Paul Bettany as Dr. Stephen Maturin and Max Pirkis as the very young midshipman who loses his arm in the opening battle scene.  While the special effects of the movie are amazing, they didn't overshadow the depth of the characters protrayed.  Unless you are a reader of the O'Brian novels (which I recommend even more highly than the movie), you wouldn't notice one major change.  The Acheron was really the USS Norfolk - an AMERICAN ship - not French.  I guess the producers figured we wouldn't put down our dollars to see a movie where we were the losers.
B000003TA4|5.0|the complex songwriting of this album and the furious and often superflous percussioning of Dave grohl makes this album a worthy dudical thing to be collected.
6301763041|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this film. I think I got bored. It was so long ago, but I believe I was bored.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think the first time I saw Being John Malkovich, I didn't dislike it but I didn't like it either. It certainly kept me interested throughout as a concept, very very bizarre.  I read Susan Orlean's The Orchid thief and was interested to see Adaptation which was equally bizarre but easier to get into.  I didn't know what to think about Eternal Sunshine when I saw the previews but I knew I had to see it, and to this point in 2004 it is bar none my favorite movie.  The plot line is intense and interesting througout never allowing you to feel comfortable until the credits start to roll.  Extremely well acted and layed out, the cinematography is first rate.  Characterization in this film is different from his other works because the majority of moviegoers can relate to the feelings and predicament Jim Carrey's character ends up in.
B00005NGZX|5.0|In my honest opinion, this is the single best hardcore record to emerge, and possibly, one of the best to emerge period. It has something that is difficult to find in other hardcore bands...it is like a sense of poignancy and utter beauty through noise. It is emotional but has nothing to do with emo. The musicianship is superb, most notably the drums...they are unbelievable. Jacob Bannon doesnt sound like a human at all, but screeches like a feline, and even yells more on tracks like &quot;Distance and Meaning,&quot; and with the occational singing. It does things without doing them almost, like, it has melodies here and there, but with other bands they are melodic (obviously) and kind of soft, but converge sounds as intense as ever...like in &quot;Broken Vow,&quot; at the &quot;It all reminds me...&quot;, there is just nothing light and soft about it. This is a very poetic, original peice of music, which is very well executed. The production sounds like it was all recorded with the same equipment on the same settings, but the songs are all incredibly different...so what you get instead of either a disjointed set of songs or a monotonous cd that all sounds the same, is a unified ALBUM, that all fits...alot of the songs blend together, as if they were written to fit together like that perfectly...Jane Doe definitely has a feel to it, and it is unlike anything they have done before...it is much sharper and tighter than &quot;Forever Comes Crashing,&quot; which was one of my main complaints with FCC, it was just too loose. Converge is intense as music gets, and all it takes is one listen to &quot;Concubine/Fault and Fracture&quot; to understand that. Literally every single song on this record is breath taking. I cant say enough about it. It is complex without being rediculize; it is fast without being monotonous; it is heavy without being macho...it is just amazing. Though i do agree with other reviews that it is definitely not for everyone...it is very, very extreme music, and that is the nature of it...i happen to be one of those who think this is one of the most amazing records to be created and one that never leaves my cd player for more than a day or two...i dare say that this is a perfect record.
B00007GZRA|5.0|This set is a must for all Bra'tac fans - and people who think<br />Jack could use a sock in the mouth for some of his uppity<br />behavior :)  Bra'tac in &quot;The Serpent's Lair&quot; pretends to capture<br />the team then reveals himself and chews them out.<br />They come up with a plan, or as Bra'tac would say,<br />&quot;You will do as I tell you&quot;.<br />The other episodes on the dvd are great as well, we get<br />introduced to Jolinar and the idea of a Tok'ra, and get to<br />see the group get tormented in The Gamekeeper.<br />But basically - get this dvd if you are a Bra'tac fan!<br />*does Bra'tac glare*
0812550706|5.0|ENDER'S GAME is my all time favorite book. Having been introduced to this book roughly 20 years ago, I have read and worn out many copies, and couldn't even tell you how many times I have read it. I have given away many copies as well, buying new ones as I use up or give away the old. At 226 pages (hardcover) the book is so compelling it can easily been read in one sitting.<br />It always amazes me when I run accross people who list this book as their favorite because to me the Sci-Fi genere has always seemed too obscure, and there are not many Sci-Fi books I enjoy reading.<br />As the Harry Potter series has successfully emerged, I have often drawn some comparisons between the two series and why they have attracted so much attention. <br />Both Ender's Game and Harry Potter have attracted an audience that would normally not indulge in the generes of Sci-Fi, Fantasy, or Children's books. While the Harry Potter series had attracted many adult readers, Ender's Game (which is not a children's book) has attracted many adolecent readers and acts as a bridge moving them into adult literature. Both Harry Potter and Ender's game tell the story of a young child (Ender is only 6 when the book starts)entering a dark and scary world, with a power neither one of them knew they possess. Both have enemies that they as children must conqure, with the fate of the world on their shoulders.<br />As a child (I believe I was eight or nine when I started reading Ender's Game)I believe it was those themes, along with the powerfully written characters that drew me to the book. As an adult I particularly enjoy the social issues the book raises, and seeing some of the science fiction become reality (the internet plays a heavy role in the book, even though it was non-existant at the time). Over time I have only grown to love and appreciate this book and would recomend it to anyone who loves to read fiction of any genere.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This record is much deeper, more artistic, and more bold than the previous slipknot releases. Stripped is the name of the game, in just about every aspect of slipknot's new sound and new image. In concert, there's no more explosions or flaming 666's, just lights and raw energy. The only element of the music that hasn't been stripped down are the guitars. In their self titled national debut, it was hard to tell that there were two guitars being played. In &quot;Iowa&quot;, a second guitarist was evident, but Mick Thompson still stole the show. Now, two guitarists are obvious in the seeming dual throughout the cd where it seems Mick is challenged by second guitar Jim Root. This makes for a much more interesting sound that's harder to lose interest in. The drums have been stripped down to the point where they almost sound humanly possible, and percussion is much more complicated and rhythmic, although there are a couple tracks where drummer Joey Jordison display's some of slipknot's trademark &quot;random&quot; drumming that occasionally doesn't seem to go with the rest of the song. Vocals by Taylor are much more complex and deep than the previous two tracks, which has been a constant trend through the years. Overall, this album is the best slipknot album to date, and it's not one that's you'll fall asleep to in the car. Buy a copy today, this might be their last album, as publicized by many rock magazines, although it's not too likely.
0812550757|5.0|SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, along with ENDER'S GAME both rate as some of the best books ever written.<br />I remember when I discovered SPEAKER as a freshman in high school. Ender's Game had been one of my favorites since childhood, and over the years I had heard rumors of a second in the saga. On a school trip I entered a book store and discovered not only was there a second book in the Ender Series, but a third. I felt like I had discovered a buried treasure. I rushed back to my hotel room, ripped open the front cover and was shocked by what I found.<br />Ender was no longer the child that I loved, but a 45 year old man. The book takes place 3000 years after the first (Ender is still alive due to almost constant near-light speed travel). Instead of being the savior of the world as he was in the first book, Ender is the equivallent of satan, and he is the one who wrote the &quot;scripture&quot; that is used against him. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the book.<br />To make a long story short...I loved the book, but it did take some getting used to, as I had grown very attached to a much younger and different character. The book had moved onto more of a philisophical tone, a tone that as a child I had completely overlooked (but is still present to a minor degree) in the first book. I can't say I completely understood the philosophy in this book, but the intrigue and mysteries that were unravled by Ender helped to keep my interest, and as I have read it many times over the years, social issues continue to emerge that I had not considered before.<br />After finishing SPEAKER, I tried to compare it to ENDER'S GAME. It is like comparing apples to oranges. Both book were great in their own way and it is extremely difficult to decide which book was actually better. <br />I leave it to you. Decide for yourself.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I just watched this one within the last week, and I must say I was duly impressed.  This offering is fast-paced, high tech, very sexy - a wild ride from beginning to end.  I found it rather reminiscent of a James Bond movie, but much grittier and without a clearly defined enemy - at least early on.  One of the elements I most enjoyed was heavy sense of mystery that pervades the first half of the movie.<br />Matt Damon does a slightly above-average acting job as Jason Bourne, who doesn't even know his own name or identity when he is dragged half dead out of the Mediterranean by the crew of a French fishing boat.  The only clue about his past is a micro-laser embedded in his hip, which reveals the name of a bank in Zurich, along with a numbered Swiss account.  Weeks later, still no closer to overcoming his amnesia, he is put ashore and makes a beeline for Zurich, where he finds a safe deposit box containing a stack of passports in various names (one of which is Jason Bourne), as well as lots of cash and a gun.<br />Still quite confused but unsuspecting of any trouble, he heads to the American embassy with hopes of getting some answers.  His reception there, however, is less than cordial, and suddenly he finds himself the object of an intense manhunt for reasons he cannot begin to fathom.  To make matters worse, his pursuers obviously would rather see him dead than alive.  Thus begins a non-stop, pulse pounding race across Europe as Bourne tries both to stay alive and find out who he is and why so many people are after him.<br />Ultimately Bourne does figure out the answers to all his questions, but not before leaving in his wake a string of dead would-be assassins, along with a bunch of stymied police and covert operatives.  Unfortunately, he doesn't like what he finds out, and its clear that his past will never leave him alone.  This leaves the stage wide open for the sequel, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", which should hit the theaters quite soon.<br />Overall I thought this movie was extremely riveting and entertaining.  The acting wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't a liability either.  The story line definitely carries the movie, much more so than the actors.  If you haven't seen it, please do.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I can't wait to see the sequel.s movie was extremely riveting and entertaining.  The acting wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't a liability either.

B000002GQE|5.0|Well yes, of course it is.  'Days of Future Passed', released in 1967, followed on the heels of 'Sgt. Peppers' as one of the first concept albums, and though The Beatles also beat The Moody's to the punch in merging their rock instruments with a full orchestra, The Moody's did so more extensively, and arguably more expertly than The Beatles.  That isn't to say 'Days of Future Passed' is as good as 'Sgt. Peppers', but it is a purer vein in the genre of the concept album.<br />The Moody's made use of the London Festival Orchestra in several ways.  On a number of the compositions, such as John Lodge's 'Time To Get Away', the orchestra exists 'in concert' with The Moody's guitars and drums.  Throughout the suite the orchestra also provides musical commas and dashes, interludes between the pop compositions.  Unfortunately, these are the only 'dated' segments of the production, sounding at times like soundtrack music for 1960's movies (and we're not talking '2001' either...).  At other times, such as in the opener 'The Day Begins', the orchestra gives us cameo's into themes that will dominate later in 'the day'.<br />Ah yes, 'the day'.  What could be purer than the simplistic concept 'Days of Future Passed' is based upon: translate the stages of a prototypical day (morning, afternoon, evening, and night) into their musical equivilents.  Interestingly, The Beatles did something of a 'Days of Future Passed' mini-series on 'Sgt. Peppers', in the form of 'Good Morning' and 'A Day In the Life'.  Obviously the concept was not as pure as The Moody's take, and The Beatles version gets lost in their grander vision.  Grander isn't necessarily better, however, and The Moody's simplicity is a large part of the appeal to 'Days of Future Passed'.<br />The Moodys apparently are not morning people, because the album starts out slowly.  Rather than bounding out of bed 'The Day Begins' and 'Another Morning' are bright, but generally soft passages dominated not by The Moody's rock instruments, but the soothing strains of the London Festival Orchestra.  It really isn't until 'Lunch Break (Peak Hour)' that we can conclusively confirm that this is indeed at least partially a rock and roll excursion.  John Lodge's 'Peak Hour' is a driving number, however, and it begins a six-song sequence that is probably the best in The Moody's extensive catalog.<br />'Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)', which became more commonly known as 'Tuesday Afternoon', follows 'Peak Hour'.  The song was the only single release from 'Days Of Future Passed' until 1972 when 'Nights In White Satin' was released and rose to number two on the national charts.  'Tuesday Afternoon', though every bit as appealing as 'Nights...' only rose to number 24 in 1968.  Each song in this progression has an uncanny knack for musically mimicing its time in 'the day', and the lyrics give us insight to how we, as people, respond to that progression.  More than anything else, this is what makes 'Days of Future Passed' a masterwork.<br />The remaining songs on the disc, 'Time To Get Away', 'The Sun Set', and 'Twilight Time' are indispensible to the whole, and as wholly entertaining as 'Tuesday Afternoon' and 'Nights...'.  Each number accentuates and complements the others.  Pure magic.  Almost as though it had to be.<br />1967 was a remarkable year for music.  Along with The Beatles and The Moodys, Jimi Hendrix released another seminal work, 'Are You Experienced?'.  Albums such as these have an impact that reverberates for many years subsequent to their release.  Each is an essential componant to understanding the artists and the eras that produced them.  This album is a must-have, regardless of your musical penchants or peculiarities.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|When I first saw this on an IMAX screen, it was intense - I had to look away several times to avoid being overwhelmed by the images.  And I can't say as how I enjoyed it - I loved how the first movie dealt with the transformation of the reality of the matrix and how the second one told more about how the matrix came to be (except that whole dancing/sex scene - that was just weird).  The third one I had higher hopes for.  I thought maybe that the movie makers would explain why the machines allowed zion to exist.  I thought there was a chance that it would turn out with zion being a second matrix on top of the first and so no one was ever really free from the machines.  Now that would have been mindblowing if they had done it right. <br />All in all, if you ignore the first and second movies and put this movie on its own, it's pretty good (though it doesn't have too much character development) and it's a very good hollywood action movie.  Put with the first two movies and it doesn't quite measure up.
B000002KOJ|3.0|Joni Mitchell's 'Clouds' is her second album, released in 1969 after 'Song To a Seagull' (originally titled 'Joni Mitchell') which was released one year previous.  However a review of the liner notes reveal that the copyrights for 8 of the 10 songs date back as far as 1966 ('I Think I Understand'), concentrate in 1967 ('Tin Angel', 'Chelsea Morning', 'I Don't Know Where I Stand', 'Songs To Aging Children's Come', and 'Both Sides, Now'), and finish up in 1968 ('That Song About the Midway' and 'Roses Blue').  So only two songs, 'The Gallery' and 'The Fiddle and the Drum' date from the same year as the album's release.  Thus, what we are getting is an interesting cross-section of the development of Joni Mitchell as a composer, a thoughtful poet in a turbulent era.<br />'Clouds' is, in my estimation, a weak link in Joni Mitchell's early works, but that criticism must be tempered by the recognition that 'Ladies of the Canyon', 'Blue', and 'For the Roses' are all classics of the era.  It should also be noted that the album does include what may well be Joni's finest composition, 'Both Sides, Now', which is to Mitchell what 'Like a Rolling Stone' or 'Blowin' In the Wind' is to Bob Dylan: a defining composition.  Judy Collins, whose status as a performer was advanced well beyond Mitchell's at the time, turned 'Both Sides, Now' into a Top Ten hit, but despite her undeniable vocal talents the charting version has nothing on the take Mitchell offers here.  Interestingly Collins also took another of Mitchell's songs from this disc, 'Chelsea Morning', and parlayed it into another hit song.<br />Sad to say, most of the rest of 'Clouds' does not live up to these two quality tracks.  The one exception is the a capella 'The Fiddle and the Drum'.  Mitchell's stark delivery of this thoughtful, persuasive composition draws even greater poignancy to an anti-war song not steeped in anger, as most anti-war songs are, but in self-contemplation.  Two key verses in the song, &quot;and I askyou why&quot;, and &quot;so we ask you please&quot; alternate twice in four stanzas.  In 1969, at the height of the Vietnam conflict, the first question was looming deep in the psyche of America, especially those most likely to be listening to Mitchell, and the second question was provided a lyrical response: &quot;find the peace and the star&quot; and &quot;trade the handshake for the fist&quot;.  The song doesn't demean the war-maker, but draws him to a higher calling.  Like Mitchell's 'Woodstock', the attempt is to turn the bomber planes into butterflies above our nation.  <br />The remaining songs on 'Clouds' have melodies that are less distinct, and lyrics that are less compelling than what we are use to from Mitchell, or deal with themes intimate and personal to Mitchell, but perhaps of less consequence to the typical listener.  'Roses Blue', for example, deals with a woman's descent into &quot;mysterious devotions&quot;, such as Tarot card reading and Zen.  Many of the songs of course deal with Mitchell's favorite topic: romantic entanglements and the nuances therein.  All are draped in Mitchell's trademark piano or guitar accompaniment.  In fact, there are no credits to contributing musicians on any of the tracks.<br />In assessing 'Clouds' I'm tempted to tap that familiar bumper sticker that says, &quot;A bad day ________ (fishing, shopping, etc.) is better than a good day at work&quot;, because a weak Joni Mitchell album is better than what most artists produce in a good day in the studio.  It's all relative, and it's instructive to note that Joni has never produced anything inconsequential or lacking gravity and substance.  Lyrics are included in this, one of Mitchell's few early works available in a High Definition configuration (go configure).
0618260587|3.0|After watching the first two movies I was enchanted to read the books and I wanted to finish them before &quot;Return of the King&quot; came out on the theatre. Well, I finished all the books and they were kind of a chore to finish. If you are big into scenery more than action then these books are for you. I probably wont read them again because of the extreme detail of clouds, mountains, underground, rivers and such. I'd rather get more of the character's feelings and emotions and it was just hard for me to get that with these books. But the story is excellent otherwise and there are plenty of fighting and treachery.

B00005JKN9|4.0|&quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; was a film with huge expectations when the movie hit the screen in december of 2002. The fans of the great director Martin Scorsese were eager to see his latest film in years. Well, finally &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; was in theaters and the movie got a lot of mixed reviews, and I think it's obvious why that happened. You make a movie with a long running time (almost 3 hours), with a plot based in a controversial book, you throw graphic violence and racism, and obviously you will offend a lot of people.<br />Those are the controversial elements in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot;, however the movie has a lot of things to talk about. This film has depth in almost every single technical aspect: the sets are beautiful and above all, they are very real. The costumes and makeup are very specific and believable. The music score was made by the always efficient Howard Shore. Most of the performances are excellent, specially Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill &quot;The Butcher&quot;, he created one of the scariest villains in recent years, also he got a lot of acting awards for this role. Liam Neeson is outstanding in a brief, but essential role, he plays Priest Vallon. John C. Reilly as Happy Jack and Jim Broadbent as William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed are also highlights in the cast.<br />Of course, there was a lot of controversy with the selection of Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role, some might find him too weak and some might find him outstanding, I think that he did a good job in this movie, but this is not one of his best performances. The acting talent of Cameron Diaz had little use in this movie. The direction of Martin Scorsese was very good, because he had a lot of elements and he made a complex movie, not a lot of directors can make a convincing work with such a complicated material.<br />Now, the plot does have highs and lows. The opening scene is one of the most impressive battles in recent years, overall all the battles in the film are excellent. But I think that the movie could have been edited more efficiently, there are a lot of scenes that doesn't add continuity to the plot. The movie lengths almost 3 hours, I think that 130 minutes could have been more effective, but at the end of the day there are more good things in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; than flaws.<br />The DVD features are very interesting (if you liked the movie, of course), the audio commentary by Martin Scorsese is the highlight of the DVD features. The documentaries are very detailed and informative, they offer a lot of different perspectives. The Five Points study guide and the multi-angle sets are just amazing, almost make you feel like you are in there, so if you liked &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; you are going to love the bonus disc.<br />&quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; may offend a lot of people because the movie tells a story about violence and obviously says that USA history is plagued with violence and racism since the beginning, but the movie also says that a lot of brave people fought to create the USA. So yes, the movie may be controversial but &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; has too many good things, so rent it first, if you like the movie, this DVD is a must-own. Specially recommendable to fans of Martin Scorsese.
0064407667|2.0|Maybe if I hadn't heard so many wonderful things about this book (as well as the entire line of follow-ups) I wouldn't be reviewing it so harshly.<BR>This book is nothing but pointless, weightless children's fluff.  Amusing if you are under 10 years of age & looking for some light (ULTRA light) reading, but completely unsatisfying if you crack the cover expecting something more along the lines of 'Harry Potter'.<BR>The plot is very thin, and I can only assume it's due to this being one of a series, and thus the overall tale of the Baudelaire orphans is spread over the 10+ novels that have since been released.  But this left the first book with very little substance, and left me feeling like I didn't care enough to give it another go with the second installment.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw this movie the weekend it was released. I was very intrigued to see it, partly due to the hype, but mostly due to the fact that I grew up in a Traditional Catholic household and was happy to finally see what I believed being portrayed in the mainstream. <br />I thought the movie was very well done and I applaud Mel Gibson and all those involved in the movie for taking the risk that they did to make this movie. Yes, a risk. If most people haven't noticed, Hollywood is full of gas bag liberals interested in destroying anyone professing a faith in God from a Christian perspective. They will destroy your careers if you open your mouth to say you disagree with the mainstream media.<br />That aside, the movie was intense, but those of us who believe Jesus Christ is God and died for us, know that it was a blood bath. There are descriptions written on the what truly happened. And normally when you are whipped that many times, have thorns pushed into your skull, and are beat to the point no one really recognizes you, there will be a bit of blood.<br />And for those people who think it was a bad movie because you didn't get more of what Jesus was all about or His teachings, you really missed the point of the movie. It's about Jesus' LAST 12 HOURS of life on earth. During that time, He really wasn't preaching to the general public. He did that before those last hours. Gibson is a Catholic. He knows the teachings of Jesus. I am a Catholic and grew up being taught those teachings as well. I have an understanding of Jesus and His teachings. For those lacking that knowledge and wanting it, I suggest picking up a book.
6304698682|5.0|yes the story is similar to shane (although the preacher was<BR>(likely) dead before the film starts, compared to shane who<BR>was (likely) dead as the film ends)<br />but if anything this was more like a retrospective of clint's<BR>western characters, with a hint of Dirty Harry thrown in <BR>for good measure<br />the parallel with High Plains Drifter is obvious; the ending<BR>where LaHood gets shot is straight out of Joe Kidd. the character<BR>of the preacher is a pastiche of the man-with-no-name; the way <br />the last deputy is dispatched looks like a scene from Hang 'Em <BR>High (and after all, by then he had fired 6 shots -- or was it <BR>only 5?)
B00000K3CK|5.0|Don't let cute little Natalie Wood and the heartwarming plot fool you... this is a wickedly funny comedy that is easily the best Christmas movie ever made.<br />Maureen O'Hara is wonderful as the scorned woman (isn't it funny how a female character in a romantic comedy from the 1940's is so strong and independant, while nowadays the romatic leads are usually scatterbrained flaky blondes?), and Natalie Wood steals the show as the perfectly well brought up little girl who confuses imagination with schitzophrenia (&quot;it's when you think you see something that isn't there&quot; she tells Kris Kringle).<br />I remember loving this movie as a child, but it is actually a grown-up movie.  Politics, pop psychology, and commercialism all take a wicked beating... if you are looking for treakly magical endings, you might be surprised at the motives behind what finally 'saves the day.'<br />If you've never seen it, or if you've only seen the 1994 sacharine-sticky-sweet remake, then you must see this movie.  It is great for all ages: the kids will see the heartwarming plot, and the teenagers and adults will understand the delightful cynisism that crops up in the most surprising places.
B0001L3MI0|3.0|This fulfills all of the expectations of a summer blockbuster;<BR>things flying around, stuff blowing up, flag waving, etc etc<br />and yes it is escapist and all good fun<br />all good stuff (although a little over done, as others have <BR>pointed out, with the flag waving bits -- but then given the<BR>title, i think people must have known that before going in)<br />but it does fall foul of the usual fault of having one <BR>supremely bad plot element. i'm referring to the odd idea that <BR>the alien shields can be taken down by injecting a computer <BR>virus (oh so easily). in this case, it is a cop out -- a cheap<BR>way for the screenwriter to get from point A to point C without<BR>bothering with B<br />a wise man once said never let the facts get in the way of a<BR>good story. and a writer once said he never checks the technical <BR>aspects of a screenplay (for the same reason)<br />the problem with this (and many films suffer a similar problem)<BR>is that it pulls me right out of the film. the suspension of <br />disbelief of an action rah-rah film can take you to a certain <BR>point, but it is easy to step over that line. the virus did it <BR>for me in this one<br />any film that uses classic dialogue such as  &quot;this is real <BR>life -- not a film&quot; is almost guarenteed to suffer this sort<BR>of problem
B00003RQNJ|5.0|I remember seeing this movie at the cinema as a kid (many years ago)and being knocked out by how COOL Redford and Sundance were. You know the scene in Blues Brothers, the doorway of the transient mens refuge and the rocket launcher, and they just get up, brush themsleves off, music resumes and go on as if nothing happened.  That cool.  And so when they get to the stage of being concerned &quot;who ARE those guys&quot; we have substance for the actions they take afterwards.   Now watching this movie on DVD with my kids, they didn't get enraptured as I did at their age.  As you might guess, not enough action for their generation - and yet, when there is action, it plays with as much emotion as the best of hollywood today.  A tremendous cast delivering a tremendous performance, this will always be one of my favorite movies.
6305232660|2.0|...if you are gonna have a film about an ELE, with the slightly<BR>more serious approach that covers the sort of lottery in this<BR>one (which all seems perfectly believable), you ought to have <BR>some emotional impact to the story<br />maybe it's been been too long since i saw it, but it just seemed<BR>like no one in the film really cared about what was going to <BR>happen. seemed a little odd to me...
0743454529|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this thought-provoking book.  In fact,  I started it around 4 p.m. and finished it at 10 p.m. - (I made supper with one hand and one eye!!) <br />Picoult writes a very engaging story - one that could be true, in today's society.  Because it could be (and probably is) a true story, I think this books would make a great book for a discussion group.  Reading this book caused me to consider my own ethical and moral feelings about the subject of genetic engineering.  <br />I was disappointed by the ending.  Shocked, yes.  And part of me was happy that there was a &quot;good&quot; ending to the story.  But, mostly, I was disappointed that Picoult took the easy way out - the moral dilemma was solved.  Life is not always like that.  We often need to make moral decisions and I was disappointed that Picoult's characters didn't have to make THE decision or answer THE question that the book was based on.   I would have preferred Picoult to have made her characters make a decision, so that I could have reacted to their choices.
B000000H4V|4.0|Not quite as good as Arise but it is different. So buy Arise first and then buy this. This give a more South American sound with out going overboard like Roots and maxs new band Soul Fly. The music is still good. Just not as good as Arise.
0446530891|1.0|A Total Disappointment<br />I have been a Baldacci fan since reading Total Control, The Winner and Saving Faith, all good books and worth the time.  But, Split Second?  All I can say is, infuriating.  An  unbelievable plot, a cast of confusing, cliched characters, and an absolutely ridiculous ending.  It all adds up to a real waste of trees used to make the paper for this thing.  <br />I almost wonder if this wasn't something he wrote in high school and now that he is famous, he thought he could pull it out and pass it off as a \\"real novel.\\"  His editors and agents should have stepped in and stopped this before it got to print.  After trying and trying, I did eventually plow though it all, because as I told my wife, \\"I can't believe how confusing and dumb this is.  I just have to read to the end, to see how he is going to work himself of this morass of a plot.\\"  In a sentence? The ending was as dumb and confusing as the rest of the book.<br />The few people on here who have given this book four or five stars must work for the publisher,  be relatives of Baldacci, or are cult followers ready to swallow the Kool Aid.  I've never seen so many negative reviews for a book on Amazon.  I only wish I had read them before I started it and not after.<br />If you must read a Baldacci book, go for Total Control or The Winner, they are both page turners.  Well actually, Split Second was a page turner also.  You had to keep turning them back and forth to try and figure out this confusing mess.<br />I'm sorry to be so negative, but I liked Baldacci, enjoyed his other books, and had high hopes for this story.  After reading this I am hesitant to try any of his others, but will probably give him one more chance to make up for this clunker.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|This movie may not have the same tone or feel of the first film but hey, its an 80's zombie gorefest complete with another slimy Trioxin zombie. This film gives the zombie epidemic more effect b/c it's not just limited to the graveyard and its surroundings.....these zombies reak havoc(albeit silly)on the city. The music in this one isnt as good as the original...no Cramps or 45 Grave this time. Not much else to say other than its a good zombie film. Not as good as the first but it still goes well with it. Hell, I thought the third one was decent and gory despite the love story...we need more zombie love stories..right? right?! Get this on dvd and enjoy until you too become (un)dead
0805211063|3.0|I disagree with many of the reviews of this work.  &quot;The Castle&quot; is deliberately cumbersome to get across the feeling of bureaucracy; this makes it perhaps a good read when you've got nothing to do and are feeling a bit philosophical or pessimistic, but it's not something you can read after work.  I liked &quot;The Trial&quot; a lot; it blended a bleak view of the world of guilt, punishment and self-righteousness with some good humour [&quot;Are you a house painter?&quot;]  There is much less humour in &quot;The Castle&quot; and Josef K's character does not develop anywhere near as fully in this book.  It is hard not to put this down to the fact that it was far from finished and the text breaks off mid-sentence, whilst &quot;The Trial&quot; [though still unfinished] has an ending and was nearer completion.  There is still the surreal interactions with women in this book and the stubborn conversations that don't go anywhere, but they are in a much less animated tone.  Also, the chapters where the procedures of bureacracy are described or K's &quot;story so far&quot; gone over are terribly boring.  Some may say that this is to build up a sense of the bureacratic nature, but doing it in this way was no better than just reprinting the criminal code of Russia.  I'd say the last few chapters are amongst the best, such as when he talks to an official that can never get to sleep.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I do believe this is one of the rare movies that every member of the cast gave a stellar performace. But applause must go to Pitt for his portrayal as both Death and the human Joe Black. The subtle changes in his character was performed masterfully. Forlani did well as the youngest daughter of the media mogul Parish, going from daddy's little girl to seductress. But besides it, this movie also raises some deeper issues, like highlighting the small things we take for granted in our everyday life. Do make an effort to watch it, you'll find yourself profoundly touched by it.

B00005JNA2|5.0|Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reprise the roles of Jesse and Celine in this sequel to 1995's enchanting, romantic and chatty \\"Before Sunrise,\\" a movie I adored and didn't think needed a sequel.<br />That said, \\"Before Sunset\\" is an excellent, stand-alone romance in its own right.<br />The lead characters are older, more reluctant to share yet they still have these unresolved feelings for one another. They're wondering, as the audience does, if there's still a chance for a long-term relationship with each other.<br />However, as with the first film, Jesse and Celine only have a short time together. This time, he has only a couple hours with her before he has to catch a plane.<br />Will romance blossom again? Will their conversation be as good as it was?<br />All of these questions are answered, but, additionally, other things are left up in the air.<br />\\"Before Sunset\\" is absolutely beautiful, so lovely it will make your heart ache.
B000022TSW|4.0|I remember when I rented this movie a few years back,  and I tried to watch it at about 1 a.m.  I had to turn it off....it was TOO funny....too much for my senses that late at night!!!  The usual guys are here....Kyle, Cartman, Kenny,  etc....with one very big difference.....they curse a LOT and dont bleep it out!!!  As usual theres the fast rapid fire humor that South Park is known for.<br />  So if you like it fast and raunchy,  get a big bag of popcorn,  a nice cold soda,  and take a few deep breaths cause you will LAUGH!!!

The people that are writing these reviews are just trying to sucker people into buying this record, which is an abuse of the Amazon review system.  Before anybody considers buying this and parting with their hard earned cash, download a few MP3's.  Then you can decide.  I personally think this is a biggest piece of 'metal garbage' going.

0142000663|5.0|&quot;The Grapes Of Wrath&quot; is an American Classic.  You've got to read this one.  Although it isn't as colorful as much of Steinbeck's work, it is a wonderful story of a very important part of our nation's history.  It's very much worth your time.
B00008RV1L|5.0|While American Psycho may seem a little dated now, it is still right on the money when it comes to corporate America's greed, corruption and materialism. If you want some top notch satire with a dark and violent twist, American Psycho is your film. The surreal nature of the film brings it to a higher level than your run of the mill social commentary. American Psycho is a must see for any non-conformist who appreciates cutting wit.

All I am going to say is that this CD/Band offers pure happiness for me.  Whenever I hit play, and Pink Floyd comes out...all I can do is listen, everything else stops.  Some people say they cant catch the riffs on Pink Floyd's work, but I guess everyone is different.  I am a younger listener, and believe that the music of today is complete crap. Crap, crap, crap.  Every now and then something good rolls along, but it seems to me that the effort being put into music these days just isnt what it used to be.  Every single musiccal note of P.Floyd and the bands of their age is crisp, clear and sharp. A+

Each track is unique in its own right. As the biggest selling remix album of all time with 11 million copies sold, the album has much to offer. Remix albums historically don't sell well, but this was marked down as the most successful remix album in history. <br />The album offered 5 new tracks and remixes from his the previous album in 1995, History Past Present and Future, which sold well over 21 million copies. <br />Most of the remixes on this album are great, a few are poor. The five tracks are unbelievable and outstanding. <br />The new tracks show his new genre as he changes within every album.<br />Here is a review for the entire tracklisting:<br />Blood On The Dancefloor: Wow! Great track. The lyrics are haunting and very shocking. I love it!<br />Morphine: The dark side of Michael Jackson as he opens up honestly about his painkiller addiction in 94'.<br />Superfly Sister: Great R&B track. A true highlight of the album. It reminds you of his 1980's work.<br />Ghosts: I love the song. The chorus is very catchy and contains meaningful lyrics: \\"Who gave you the right to shake my family tree....are you the ghost of jealousy\\". It is a clear attack on the evil Tom Sneddon who is getting people to extort money from Michael Jackson who is innocent of all allegations!<br />Is It Scary: Similar to Ghosts, but this version is more enjoyable.<br />Remixes are great. The best and most unique remix was the remix for Stranger In Moscow and History.<br />This is worth every penny. The first five tracks are worth the purchase alone. I love this album and you must have it for your collection if you know true music!

B000002LAC|3.0|Dolly, Linda and Emmylou teamed up to sing vocal harmonies on traditional country style songs.  The arrangements are good and they sing well together.  But for some reason, I only found it to be moderately entertaining.  I know I should love it, and I can't explain why I don't.  Please don't hate me.
B0000203YT|5.0|&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; is a triumph, pure and simple.  With screenwriters Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman at the top of their game and feeding immortal lines to a top-notch cast, &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; could not fail to succeed.<br />The film opens with young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) struggling with writer's block . . . he is clearly not yet the magnificent WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (insert trumpets here), the world's most famous writer.  Indeed, the top playwright of the age is Kit Marlowe (Rupert Everett), as Shakespeare is reminded several times.  And young Will is also hopelessly infatuated with Rosaline, a woman completely unworthy of his affections.<br />After some psychotherapy that anticipates Freud, Will is no better.  Still, heavily in debt, Will attempts to stage his next opus, &quot;Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.&quot;  Working with Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush, who would have stolen a lesser film with his perfect performance), who's also heavily in debt, Will seems headed for disaster.<br />That is, until he sees his muse, young Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow, never better).  Smitten, young Will begins to write the romantic poetry that becomes &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;  Viola, who recognizes Will's genius, meets Will through some classic Shakespearean disguises and mistaken identities.  Of course, Viola is betrothed to a true slug, Lord Wessex (a plump Colin Firth), who plans to take her to Virginia in seek his fortune across the sea -- essentially sending her into exile.<br />Despite the roadblocks, Will and Viola are soon hopelessly in love.  Viola, daring to breach the silly rule that only men can play parts on stage, has taken the role of Romeo by day.  By night, Will and Viola write Will's most romantic play together.<br />&quot;SIL&quot; keeps the wheels turning mighty fast, and one of the joys of watching this movie over and over is catching a quick joke that you didn't get the first time around.  <br />It's also a pleasure to watch this stellar cast go through its paces.  While Judi Dench won her Oscar for her surprisingly brief performance as Queen Elizabeth, other actors turn in equally entertaining performances.  Tom Wilkinson, Simon Callow, Martin Clunes, and Imelda Staunton each bring amazing proficiency to the supporting cast, and even the much-maligned appearance of Ben Affleck elevates the movie -- he is perfectly cast as a self-absorbed theater star (first line -- &quot;What is the play, and what is my part?&quot;).  Affleck's comeuppance, when he realizes that he, as Mercutio, doesn't have the title role, is handled wonderfully well.  <br />This is simply a movie that doesn't miss a trick.  The film is shot beautifully, the extravagent costuming gets at the ridiculous conformity that we associate with jolly old England (and makes the torrid romance of Will and Viola that much more intimate), and the music is uplifting. <br />The film's final shot, as Viola walks along the beach and we realize that we've just seen the birth of arguably Shakespeare's greatest heroine, Viola of &quot;Twelfth Night,&quot; is a masterpiece of powerful understatement.  <br />This movie is simply a must for the film library!
B00000J7JO|5.0|&quot;Californication&quot; is top notch Chili Peppers, but the best tracks on the album are definitely in the beginning.  'Around the World' is one of the best openers ever, and it rocks hard.  'Scartissue' is a radio hit and so is 'Otherside', and 'Easily' is easily (sorry) one of the best tracks on the album.  The title track is the best track and speaks of West Coast superficiality.  The rest of the album is scattered and not very cohesive, but it includes a variety of different songs and some sound a little experimental.  &quot;Californication&quot; was one of the most successful rock albums of the 90's and rightfully so.  Highly recommended.
0451450523|5.0|This is the first book by Peter S. Beagle that I ever read and it remains my favorite.  Beagle has such a beautiful talent to depict good and evil, not only very well but also in such a light that you end the book with a renewed hope and beautiful view of life.  I rarely read a book more than once but I have read this about half a dozen times and am about to read it again.  The world is just more beautiful when I read it and colors seem to become more vibrant.  Any book that helps you look at life, even when it's a fantasy, in such a way that you see the bad but you retain that hope for the good and dreams seem possible is one I want not only on my shelf but several more copies to give out to friends and family.
B000002AS3|5.0|Hands down the greatest debut album released by any artist, ever.  Musically, this is Oasis at their rawest, hungriest, rather than sophisticated and musically advanced.  The tracklist reads more like a greatest hits lineup as almost every track is memorable and unique.  'Rock 'n' Roll Star' is a fantastic beginning, and tells people to reach for their dreams.  'Shakermaker' is a Coca-Cola ripoff, but a damn good song.  'Live Forever' put Oasis on the map and remains one of their finest songs.  &quot;Up In the Sky&quot; is the one song that's different than any others on the album , and it's a good one too.  'Columbia' is one of my personal favorites, simple lyrics and great execution musically.  'Supersonic' is one of the most popular Oasis songs till this very moment and their first single ever, solid drum intro until Noel tickles the Gibson.  'Bring It On Down' rocks harder than any song on the album, and Noel busts out the Gibson again for an amazing guitar solo in the final frame.  'Cigarettes and Alcohol' is about rock star excess, and still one of their best songs lyrically.  'Digsy's Diner' is the first in a line of bouncy late album tracks (She's Electric, Be Here Now) and it has very nice Liam vocals.  Speaking of nice Liam vocals, 'Slide Away' is ten times better, and still one of the most heartfelt Oasis song, &quot;Let me be the one/That shines with you/In the morning/When we don't know what to do&quot; Noel pens and Liam pleads.  Album ender 'Married With Children' is a mellow number, and it discusses discrepancies between lovers.<br />Overall, a fantastic album, and there is nothing like Oasis when they were young, very hungry, and also very talented.  Not to say they're not talented now, but the raw energy that comes from reckless youth is induplicable (is that a real word? it is now!), and their music is far more mature and couth now so there is no use comparing apples and oranges.  &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; has definitely stood the test of time,and continues to do so.  Oasis is hated, and highly underrated in the States but our  English speaking buddies across the Atlantic know what's up, and they know and believe Oasis is a great band.  &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; is very highly recommended.
B000000H66|5.0|Great metal songwriters typically come in 2 forms. One's who craft the songs to fit a certain ambiance(Black Sabbath, Katatonia, Tool, Emperor...) and ones who achieve greatness through the exhibition of mastery of the instrument.(Randy Rhoades, Children of Bodom, In Flames, Slayer...) I'm a fan of both types of songwriting and it is extremly rare that a cd will satisfy my taste for both. Death's Symbolic is one of those rare albums that does. This is damn near perfect, and while there is a great deal of showmanship, it never goes over the top and over shadows the music. Chuck's growling is the best it's ever been and this album can single handedly be used as the case for including him among the best death metal vocalists ever. There's plently of amazing solo's among a somewhat progressive rhythem section. Gene Hoglan's drums are well done and drive the album along nicely. While Hoglan does hold back a bit, it's done with the purpose of playing what the songs require. This album is what pure death metal should strive to be: Intelligent and aggressive, heavy yet focused and just melodic enough to make it fun to listen to. Defitintly one of the top 20 albums of all time. Would recommend this to any death or melodic death fan. I also recommend checking out In Flames(lunar strain/subterrianian), Cynic, Mithras, Hate Eternal and Amon Amarth in addition to this. <br />On a different note, check out Within the Mind: In homage to the musical legacy of Chuck Schuliner, coming out later this year. It's directed by former Death guitarist James Murphy and features people from Six Feet Under to Mudvayne paying their respects. Proceeds go to help James Murphy who has a brain tumor. <br />R.I.P. Chuck Schuliner
B000000OSG|5.0|The Use Your Illusion albums were perhaps the most widely anticipated albums, EVER! Hundreds of thousands of fans waited at record stores until midnight so that they could get the album right when it was released. And while most people were expecting more Appetite for Destruction, the new, more sophisticated sound that appeared on the albums kept most fans happy. While Appetite was dominated by Izzy Stradlin and Slash's double guitar attack, this albums had a different sound. Slash had great solos on 80% of the songs and Axl's piano playing added a new sound to the dirty punk-influenced rockers. Izzy Stradlin also emerged as not only a great guitar player, but an extremely talented songwriter.<BR>1. Civil War 10/10- A great song that has comments from little known revolutionaries and also a quote from &quot;Cool Hand Luke.&quot; These tie in perfectly with the song. Sounds like an anti-Vietnam song, so it's hard to take it seriously since Axl wasn't even a teenager when the war was going on, but it is so good. Axl sounds great on vocals, and so does Slash with the wah-wah pedal. A masterpiece.<BR>2. 14 Years 10/10- Similar sounding to Dust N' Bones, they are also both written and sang by Izzy, who sounds great. It is too bad they didn't keep to this sound: heavy guitars and Izzy's vocals, balanced by Axl's piano and harmonies. It's a shame that when Izzy released his solo stuff that he did not use this sound instead of that Stonesy road music similar to John Fogarty. <BR>3. Yesterdays 7/10- Thought of by many as a great song, but comes off as sappy aand phony. Released as a single, but didn't do anything thanks to Nirvana. Still has a good guitar solo.<BR>4. Knockin' On Heaven's Door 8/10- Definitely the better of their covers (the other one being &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;), kinda sounds different than what Bob Dylan was aiming for when he wrote it and probably has him jumping in his grave (no wait, he's still alive). Still is pretty good, but Slash should have done a better solo.<BR>5. Get In the Ring 5/10 Basically a platform to call out (by name!) the people who wrote bad stuff about Guns N Roses, is still pretty good and Axl bring up a good point on how the music industry screws us hard-working Americans over.<BR>6. Shotgun Blues 2/10- Terrible song that has nothing good about it. Way too much profanity and one of the only true filler songs on the album.<BR>7. Breakdown 8/10- A different sound for Guns N Roses where Slash plays a major part in the entire song instead of just taking the spotlight in the solos. A quote from the film &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; is unnecessary and keeps this from a ten.<BR>8. Pretty Tied Up 10/10- Sounds pretty cool with the sitar in the beginning. A great guitar solo by Slash and hard rocking guitar riffs by Izzy as well as good bass by Duff make this song worthwhile.<BR>9. Locomotive 6/10- The first two minutes are great, but the weird chorus and lack of a good Slash solo keep this from being a good song.<BR>10. So Fine 10/10- Written and sang by Duff, who sounds great. Why didn't he write more songs in GNR? Slower, with good piano and guitars. Written for and dedicated to Johnny Thunders.<BR>11. Estranged 10/10- One of the greatest songs ever written. Is really a two part song. The first half (should be called something like &quot;Illusions&quot;) goes on for four minutes and is made spectacular by Slash's guitar (you will know what I mean when you listen to it). The second half (should be called &quot;Estranged&quot;) sounds great too with a great guitar solo by Slash. A moving song grabs your heart and doesn't let go until it is over; 9:23 later. Slash and Izzy together sound great, but Slash proves that he is one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Axl proves he is a great songwriter and sounds great on piano. A true masterpiece. This alone gives the album five stars.<BR>12. You Could Be Mine 10/10- The big hit off the album and the only real heavy metal song, is often overlookedeven though it is the second highest selling Guns N Roses song; it just  never received any airplay for some reason. It starts out great with pounding blues-driven guitars, and has a raw blues power that is non-existant in today's music. I did not truly aprreciate this song until I saw Slash doing the guitar solo for this on the Use Your Illusion II tour DVD and it is truely amazing the way he does those 16th notes.<BR>13. Don't Cry (alt. version) 9/10- Unnecessary, but still sounds good, basically is the same melody as the original, but with different lyrics. It would have been great if Guns N' Roses had combined the two versions together for a November Rain-like ballad.<BR>14. My World 0/10- Awful, either filler or something else that did not work. Rap sounding, is no good and unacceptable.<br />Besides a craptacular ending, this is really good and a must own for any music fan. Had they put more time into the album and taken out &quot;Shotgun Blues,&quot; &quot;Locomotive,&quot; and &quot;My World,&quot; this could have been even better than Appetite for Destruction, but if they had waited longer, maybe no one would have cared since everyone was listening to Kurt Cobain whine in &quot;Nevermind.&quot; It is too bad that controversy tore them apart, because anyone can tell after listening to the other projects done by GNR bandmembers that aren't named Axl (such as Slash's Snakepit and Velvet Revolver) that they still have great music left in them.

B00004YYDI|5.0|I don't usually like to watch movies about hit men or cops and robbers.  I remember I got interested in this movie because of two things:  Luc Besson's movie the Fifth Element, which was so wildly different and fascinating that I wanted to see what else this French director had done; and secondly, seeing Natalie Portman for the first time in the Star Wars: Phantom Menace movie.<br />Behind all of the dense make up and bad script and horribly non-existent directing from George Lucas in Phantom Menace, I sensed in Natalie Portman one heck of a terrific young actress struggling to come up with a meaningful performance.  In \\"Leon - The Professional\\", working with a superb director, her acting talent is on full display.<br />When one thinks of modern day child actors, Anna Paquin comes to mind, in \\"The Piano\\", because she aced out some terrific adult actresses in 1993 to win the Oscar.  Well, Natalie Portman, at age 12, had Anna Paquin beat by a mile in this movie, since her character takes up about half of the movie.  If not for the truly unusual and off-beat story line of this movie, Portman would have gotten a lot more attention for her role in this movie, I think.<br />If you just focus on Portman's facial expressions and the way she carries herself in this movie, she goes through an amazing acting range in this movie, from hurt, terrified, bored, stuck up, cool and calculating, manipulative, sweet, child-like, and pubescent sexual allure.<br />As mentioned by other reviewers, the uncut version restores scenes that basically give a harder edge to Natalie Portman's character.  The additional scenes of her assassin training with Leon and her efforts to attract and get closer to Leon definitely put her character in a harsher light.  I remember from my first viewing of the cut U.S. version that Mathilda came across as a much more sweet and innocent child.  The uncut version shows her more to be a hardened child of the mean streets of New York.  Given the usual Hollywood propensities, it's not that surprising that these scenes got cut for the U.S. release.  The uncut version does show the fullest acting range of Natalie Portman, even if they make her character less sympathetic.<br />Basically, the movie skates close to, but avoids the pedophilia controversies of the \\"Lolita\\" movies by having the character of Leon adhere to a strict code of ethics that firmly blocks all of Mathilda's advances.  Even at the end, when he kisses her good-by and says that he loves her, it is clearly in the vein of being her protector and a big brother/father surrogate figure.<br />All in all, this was a great movie.  Jean Reno was just so hauntingly sad as the loner-assassin Leon.  Gary Oldman was definitely over the top in his portrayal of the crazed DEA agent - you almost expected his Dracula fangs to come out and his eyes to glow red when he popped those pills into his mouth.<br />So all of you Natalie Portman fans, this movie is a definite must-see.  All of you Phantom Menace/Attack of the Clones haters who think that Natalie Portman can't act, you've got to see this movie to understand that no, Natalie Portman is a terrific actress.  It's just really, really tough to play opposite total stiffs like Hayden Christiansen and Jake Lloyd,  working with an idiot director like George Lucas.llywood propensities, it's not that surprising that these scenes got cut for the U.S. release.

B00001U0E1|5.0|The DVD casing claimed in big bold letters &quot;Best Screenplay&quot; Academy Award winner. I can surely see why! Must have been some deviously creative team that crafted this crisp comic period-piece.<br />The film is really two love stories: one a bawdy romance between two smitten humans, and the other an ode to the art of theatre. The writers'/director's love for showmanship is loud and evident throughout the brilliant screenplay, and if you're a fan of wordplay in any way, well then this is a surefire delight.<br />Both Paltrow and Fienners turn in lusciously romantic performances in their respective roles -- she pulls off the formidable order of gender-switching without a hitch, and he has just the right pitches and patterns for a young, struggling Shakespeare. Geoffrey Rush is magnetic as usual.<br />Don't be fooled by the Elizabethan accoutrements, this film and its arsenal of laconic quips could easily shoot several contemporary romances to dust. Buy this one in fact, don't just rent, it quite comfortably stands the test of more than one viewing..
B00001PE4D|1.0|This is the most homophobic movie that I have ever seen.  The director should be ashamed; ok, he hates gay people, we get it, but does he have to presume that everyone in the audience is equally homophobic?
B00003CWL6|5.0|On the surface, this stunner from Sam Mendes is such a relentlessly bleak look at the vacuity of the supposed &quot;American Dream&quot; that viewers may just turn off to it en masse. And it shows in the acute polarization of reviews here on Amazon.<br />But if you can be a little less knee-jerk and not shut off all rational thought when confronted with what's disturbingly familiar, you may also find that the film is genuinely, voraciously amusing, and directed with such breathtaking flair that Spacey's bravura performance seems like a career-defining one.<br />Beneath the surface of all the seeming pettiness in our daily  idiosynchrasies, the theme points out, is an entire world of such simple elegance that chortles to be seen and heard, but is neither recognized nor heeded to.<br />An interesting visual device in the film is the use of windows. Not just a use, but a splurge, come to think of it. Almost everything important happens in front of, around, or through windows. Could this be a metaphor perhaps for self-examination, for viewing one's life from the outside?<br />What I do not understand is why most films in this genre (Ice Storm, Ordinary People) end with a dramatically tragic finale. Does it take a shattering turn of events to break everyone out of their daily reverie? Something to think about.<br />Any rate, long story short: an evocative gem you need to own.
B000066C6Z|5.0|YEAHHHH!!!!!!!! this movie is flat-out FUNNAY! It's about this &quot;American Rock 'n Roll Star&quot; (kilmer) who helps a German girl find her father along with some pretty kewl cats. This movie has awesome not-obvious jokes and quotes you'll seriously LOVE until your dying day.
B000000OQ5|5.0|This is awesome! <BR>One of the most important album.s <BR>Why? Read on.<br />I was 11 in '86 and just getting into metal. Unfortunately  was too wrapped up with Judas Priest and Iron Maiden at the time - both in their hey day.<br />I discovered this great band in '91 with &quot;Don't De Rock Me&quot; - an anthemic, balls to the wall track full of hard rock, great vocals and duelling guitars of a high calibre.<br />Oh yes! Bring it on!<br />Cut to this year where I pick up &quot;Mechanical Resonance&quot; at a car boot sale for pennies. So disgusted am I with the state of metal and rock these days of noise, rap/metal or 3 chord wonders (Slipknot? Noise. Good Charlotte? Talenless clowns) that I have been re investigating the 80's for the bands I overlooked at the time.<BR>Unfortunately not too many stood up to scrutiny.<BR>Most were weak sounding, with aged production, cheesy lyrics and cheesy images.<BR>Eg:<BR>Ratt had just two good tracks and a singer that couldn't sing.<BR>Songs sounded like they were recorded on an 8 track.<BR>Twisted Sister had a few good ones but were too similar in style, too simplistic and again had dated production so that they didn't seem heavy anymore.<BR>Tyketto with their &quot;Don't Come Easy&quot; album were absolutely fantastic though and i recommend them heartily.<br />Where were the in yer face rockers that were heavy AND melodic at the same time? And &quot;love songs&quot; that still had balls? Was everyone sat at a piano back then?<br />So I took &quot;Mechanical Resonance&quot; home, expecting to be disappointed but boy was I shocked.<BR>This album grabs you by the nuts and throws you around!<BR>As all the reviews have said, it's a hard rocking anthemic album with no filler. Even the so called ballads have attitude and fire. Even when being emotional they are still heavy with it.<BR>One of the most inspired tracks is &quot;We're No Good Together&quot; as it starts off all slow and moody but then picks up pace and the whole damn thing thretens to take off!<br />The singer is phenomenal! He looks and sounds like Steven Tyler and it's his voice that makes the tracks rock - especially the ballads. He doesn't take it easy and croon :-)<br />Heavy, attitude, fire, musicianship is all here.<BR>Most of all it mas been married with amazing melodicity.<BR>How many bands can claim that?<br />For those who wish metal was how it should be, look no further.
B00004RF9I|5.0|'Network' should be seen together with 'EdTv' and 'The Truman Show'. They all show the effect of television on people and also what goes on behind the scenes, the eternal fight for higher ratings, no matter what it is about.<br />Faye Dunaway wants to try everything to get higher ratings, she is so obsessed that even life has become a scenario to her, she almost has no ties to 'normal' life anymore, everything has become a spectacle.<br />When a newsbroadcaster tells his audience he is going to kill himself on tv in two weeks hell breaks loose. No one cares about human life, it's all about ratings. They would go as far as they can possibly go...
B000002AT6|5.0|It seems that most people that have posted comments really enjoy this soundtrack.  A lot of people have also mentioned that it sounds a lot like Titanic and Braveheart.  Most of you don't see that as a bad thing, but I get the impression that a few of you think a little less of James Horner because he may use music that sounds like material from a previous score.  Something to keep in mind is that movie producers and directors know the style of music that these big-name soundtrack composers create and they keep that in mind while they work on the film.  Film directors hire certain soundtrack composers because they know the style of each composer and they know what will fit the movie.  A lot of directors actually request that the composer write music that is similar to a previous film he or she did because that is the sound they are looking for.  Just keep all of this in mind for the next time you listen to a soundtrack and think, &quot;Eh, this sounds just like his/her last soundtrack.  This must be the only style this person can write in.&quot;  If you want to hear a James Horner soundtrack of a completely different style, try listening to the score from A Beautiful Mind.  It's amazing.
B00006F7S4|2.0|Wow. Has Beck ever changed. This &quot;Yer Cheatin' heart&quot; style music is hard to listen to.It's so depressing. It's like someone ripped the creative spark from Beck's brain.  Sure there's still musical genius there, but the point of listening to music is enjoying it or connecting with it. Oh well, Beck always does his own thing. I can't bear to give him one star when all of his other CDs are fivers.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Butterfly Effect revolves around Evan, who since childhood has experienced blackouts that break some of his memories. Some of the things that haunt him from his childhood are seemingly vanished from his recollections. From childhood he has kept a journal of his everyday life. He discovers that by reading these journals he learns to recall his memories and even to change them in order to alter history into a way that suits everyone, although he finds out that every choice he makes affects a loved one in ways he never could have predicted. Ashton Kutcher gives a good performance in this movie and shows he actually has talent. Infact most of the cast is great, switching from characters with different personalities as Evan changes the events of his past. The critics panned this movie when it was released, but it really is a film worth checking out. If nothing else, it will make you think about a lot of things, mainly if you could change your life and affect those around you, would you?<br />The dvd is packed with many extras. You get 2 versions of the film--theatrical and director's cut. The ending in the director's cut was shocking and disturbing and still is. I still think it was fitting and it is the better ending. Just be prepared to deal with a much more dark ending that some would prefer not to see. It is great to have both versions on one disc though, and with some good extras I recommend picking this one up. It is not a movie you can love or hate. It really is too dark of a movie to give it either of those titles. But it was a mind-blowing film in my mind so I think you should at least rent this movie and judge it for yourself.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's Under My Skin cd is great. When 'Don't Tell me' came out on the radio i liked it. Then when 'My Happy Ending' came out on the radio i liked it even more than 'Dont Tell Me' So I decided to go get her cd. I had bought her first cd 'Let Go' and i liked it a lot. So i figured I would like this one too. When i brought it home and listened to it... welll... i kinda thought well thats a waste of 14 bucks. but i listened to all the tracks over the couple days and i really started to like them. its more deeper than 'Let go'. All i can say is I really like Avril because shes herself and i really like her music cause its all her stuff... i dont care what people say about the lyrics not making sence... i think they do... you guys prolly dont even listen closely.... i hate people like britney and christina who dont write their own stuff. so far i really like 'Nobody's home' 'Slipped away' and 'freak out'. hopefully youll like the cd. and avril's a canadian! just like me~ lol~

B00004RF8J|5.0|Can you imagine Barbra Streisand in this film as Audrey? Although everyone familiar with this movie (and stage musical) immediatly sees Ellen Green in the part, we find out from the documentary on this disc that Babs was offered the role first. Thankfully she wasn't interested.<BR>The film itself is the best stage-to-screen musical adapt. since Grease and none (even Chicago) have since come along to beat it. The music by Alan Menken and the lyrics by the late, great Howard Ashman are fantastically intertwined to evoke laughs as much as the required early-1960's atmosphere. This talented duo went on to score Disney's The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and (in part, due to Ashman's death) Aladdin. When listening to Little Shop's Somewhere That's Green it's easy to see where Mermaid's Part of Your World came from.<BR>The cast are uniformly excellent and succeeded in making their parts their own (meaning that any production now seen on stage features clones of Moranis, Green, Martin etc.). Rick Moranis as Seymour seems to have been born to play the part and his singing voice comes as something of a revelation! Green, as I have already said, IS Audrey but Steve Martin just about manages to steal the entire film from all of them in an extended cameo as Orin the sadistic dentist. Other cameos include James Belushi, John Candy and (brilliantly) Bill Murray.<BR>Audrey II (the plant) is a wonder of engineering and puppetry and watching the film now, I couldn't help but think that if this movie was made today Audrey II would be CGI - impact lost! Thank goodness then, that Frank Oz, director and some-time Muppet-man, gathered a group of talented people together to create a truly startling character. Although the character would be nothing without Levi Stubbs so wonderfully providing his voice.<BR>Wisely it was decided to change the ending from the stage shows bleak (and, frankly, poor) conclusion to a more up-beat and 'Hollywood-style' finale. The original ending is glimpsed in the all-too-short deleted scenes section of this disc, as a couple of Audrey IIs attack a building, but it would have been nice to see the scene in tact perhaps with an option to swap it for the actual ending when watching the film. Also the inclusion of 'Mean, Green Mother' really helps the second half of the film which sadly sags in the show due to the absence of such a show-stopping number.<BR>The 'making of' was made of the time and so is light and fluffy. I would have prefered a little more depth on the realisation of Audrey II. The trailers are worth watching - mini masterpieces of campy kitch but Oz's commentary is a little on the ponderous side.<BR>So, in conclusion, the extras are acceptable if a little dull, but who needs extras when the film is as thoroughly enjoyable and toe-tapping as this! Just remember: - whatever they offer you - don't feed the plants.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|why the hell does everyone say that??<BR>good movie dont see shrek 2 looks dumb
B0001HAISQ|5.0|When I first saw this in the movie theater, I loved it. It was very interesting and the special effects were great. It was much better than I thought it would be, quite a bit different from the cartoon! It makes an especially great family movie seeing as there isn't much fighting or violence.
B00008H2LB|5.0|i listen 2 about all the songs on this cd wich means this is a pretty good cd
B00000JZI9|4.0|I'm not a fan of westerns but \\"Silverado\\" was a good one. It had a lot of action and it never became boring. A good movie to me is something I can watch over and over and not get bored I wouldn't mind watching it again. \\"Silverado\\" in my opinion had something unique to it, it had an African American and it had someone funny in it too. Not all westerns had a cowboy that was funny, they where all serious and I think that more western movies should be like \\"Silverado\\" in some way. Jake ( Kevin Costner ) was my favorite character and my favorite quote was said bye him too! \\"All I did was kiss a girl\\" I like this quote because he said it funny and it's the reason why he got in trouble. Well the sound track in the film was in my opinion to dramatic, but it wasn't to bad it fit into the movie perfect but they should tone it down just a bit. But Silverado over all was a great movie and I recommend that you at least see it once.
B00005AQF7|3.0|this is the best of snoop right here.  Ever since he left deathrow his music just aint as good.  However he did very well on Dr. Dre 2001 &amp; The Marshal Mather's Lp.<br />Oh well, thats just my opinion
B00005JMYG|3.0|If you have a choice between watching stupid pet tricks and stupid human tricks - Anchorman. Take the pets for they know not what they do. Stupid humans know what they do and still do it anyway. However, one has to agree certain network Anchor \\"persons\\" come to mind while watching this film..which upon further consideration is more of a documentary then Moore's \\"F 9-11\\"! Oh..just go see it and decide for yourself!
B00004XOWM|4.0|This  is a good albume and i think all limp bizkit fans would like it.  Favorite songs are rollin, rollin remix, my generation, and get your groove on featuring xzibit!<BR>buy this u wont be dissapointed!!!!
B00024BHTC|5.0|I admit that this music does take some time to warm up to. When I first heard Nightwish, I was amazed by the unique sound, but I wasn't really pulled into it very quickly. After listening to the album more, I realized how much I did like it. You don't hear bands like this very often. Very unique sound, and the lead singer has a very unique voice. It just takes an open mind to enjoy it.<BR>For the person who said that they would be on TV if they were that great, they are on TV. Not in the US because they are a foreign band, and usually we see more local bands on our TV shows. However, the song &quot;Nemo&quot; from this album has been number one on the MTV charts in Brazil multiple times.<BR>And no, TV doesn't make a band great. The bands make TV great. If every great band was on TV, we wouldn't have room for them all. If you're limiting yourself to that, then you won't ever discover some great talents. This album is really great and original and has some strong lyrics, as well.<br />However, I do think that if you are new to this band that you should first listen to one of their other CDs like Wishmaster. Once sounds a bit different than their other CDs normally do. However, still a great CD.<br />And I don't normally like metal music, so this is saying something..
B00001IVOR|5.0|This double CD compliation, will never just be &quot;shuffled&quot; into any kind of pile. If you were to sit down, focus and actually listen to the album you would understand what i mean. This double CD complilation is TIMELESS. No matter what comes out it can never reach the poetic balance that Wu tang have. This compilation could be listened to from beginning to end dozens of time, and each time would be a brand new experience. My ears have never heard such a masterpiece, except for 36 chambers which was the building blocks for &quot;FOREVER&quot;. Both cds flatter each other, neither is &quot;weaker&quot; then the other. Disc 2 may be longer then Disc 1, however with tracks Triumph, MGM, and Projects, it is hardly &quot;overdone&quot;. Listening to the compliation is like eating Burger King for the first time over and over again. A definate buy for anyone who wants to hear what real, calculated Hip-Hop sounds like, stories from the real, genuine artists. A timeless classic, an everyday enjoyment. <br />GO OUT AND BUY IT, YOU WILL APRECIATE ITS PERFECTION.
B0000D96NW|5.0|A year ago, I was probably reading on smnnews that Machine Head was getting ready to release a new album in Europe. Most likely I would have said, &quot;who cares they've become total nu-metal.&quot; After some very dissapointing releases, Machine Head have redeemed themselves in the metal world. Now, I don't hate Machine Head's earlier albums, they just weren't amazing. I didn't really pay attention to the release of Through the Ashes of Empires until it was released here in the United States 6 months later. I figured I'd give the new album a listen, and its great. Rob Flynn's vocals are much rawer than on previous albums, it is not as &quot;radio-friendly&quot; as Roadrunner has made most bands, and Machine Head have definitely strayed away from the nu-metal scene. The drums are very prominent on this album, especially in &quot;Imperium&quot; and &quot;In the Presence of my Enemies.&quot; The guitar work is very good, including a few solos, and some great intros. The American version of the album also includes a bonus track called &quot;Seasons Wither.&quot; My least favorite track is &quot;Elegy&quot; because the chorus annoys me...I don't know why, but it just doesn't seem to fit into the rest of the album.<br />Stand out tracks: Imperium, Bite the Bullet, In the Presence of My Enemies, All Falls Down.
B00020HEL6|5.0|My 22 yr old daughter works at a major chain that sells CDs, books, &amp; coffee. She brought home this free CD with 3 tracks on it. I put it in my CD player and listened to these 3 tracks off and on for a week. I liked it right away. The more I listened, the more I liked it. I went on Amazon (like I usually do) and bought two of her CDs for myself. When I took the free one to work; others really liked it too. One of my employess took the time to read the liner notes. Boy was I surprised that learn from him that Renee Olstead was only 14 yrs old! I was impressed. She has a beautiful voice! She is a beautiful redhead! This is a great selection of songs! I rate this CD 5 STARS. I have been listening to Jazz, rock, and classical music for at least 50 of my 53 years. I have played in folk groups, rock bands, and even in church when I was a kid. I've spent hours in practice halls and recording studios. This is great music sung by a great voice and I love it.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Great movie I have to say, paying respect to crazy asian cinema. My only gripe is Uma Therman being in the movie. I would have like to see Quinten dig up and unknown actor or maybe some B movie or expoitation actress. And although I like Lucy Lu I can think of a hundred different asian actresses that would have fit the role better. ANyway, great movie! If you like this movie check out any movie by Takashi Miike like: Iche the Killer, Dead or Alive, Dead or Alive 2, Dead or Alive Final, Audition, Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl.... any one of these movies makes KILL BILL look like a Walt Disney film!!
B000003TA4|5.0|the main point of this review is to tell you lovely people that this album - Nevermind by Nirvana, is the greatest album that has ever been produced and that ever will be produced. All this talk of how Pearl Jam's Ten is a better record is absolutely rubbish. Don't get me wrong, 'Ten' IS a great album, but is nothing compared to the pure brilliance of Kurt Cobain (R.I.P.), Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic. Of course most people will note 'Teen Spirit' as the stand-out track, but I beg to differ. As good as 'Teen Spirit' is - I beleive 'Something In The Way' to be a more revealing song. It talks of Kurt's supposed time living under a bridge in Aberdeen, Washington and is a genuinly moving song. This group of three - Kurt Cobain (greatest musician ever), Dave Grohl (greatest drummer ever) and Krist Novoselic (greatest unrecognised hero ever), have produced an album of pure intensity and passion that in my mind - and hopefully in many other minds, is the greatest album EVER !
B00005K9LK|5.0|After much pondering, I've decided that Screaming for Vengeance is my favorite Judas Priest album-edging out Stained Class, Defenders of the Faith, and British Steel. This 1982 release is one of their most solid albums and the best tracks on this album are also THE best Priest tracks of all time.  <br />\\"Hellion/Electric Eye\\" (the first track being a short instrumental introduction to the second) is classic Priest.  \\"Electric Eye\\" is my all-time favorite Judas Priest song!  The haunting lyrics, the verses that build up to the chorus, the killer guitar solos; I can't write enough about it!  \\"Riding on the Wind\\" is a catchy rocker. It begins with a furious drum intro by Dave Holland (now in prison for a sexual assault conviction). It bugs me a little because parts of it sound like another Priest song but I can never figure out which.  Maybe \\"Heading Out to the Highway.\\"  Still, it is one of the better tracks on Screaming.  \\"Bloodstone\\" is awesome!  It is another favorite of mine.  It is a driving rocker and the guitar riffs are unbelievable!  \\"(Take These) Chains\\" (written by R. Halligan Jr.) is a slower, catchy track.  I'm sure a lot of fans find themselves singing the chorus.  The line \\"Take them off of my heart\\" I've always thought was a little sappy but I like Halford's vocals in the line \\"I can't sleep at night.\\"   \\"Pain and Pleasure\\" is a monster track.  I don't like it quite as well as the others, but a below average song off Screaming is better than most average tracks elsewhere.<br />The title track is the most furious song Judas Priest has ever done before or since.  It kicks so much butt, words cannot do it justice.  The fast and screeching \\"Freewheel Burning\\" off Defenders of the Faith has nothing on this track!  \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" is classic Priest.  Next to \\"Living After Midnight,\\" it is probably their most played single.  Unlike \\"Living...,\\" it is not commercial rock 'n roll, but powerful metal.  \\"Fever\\" is an interesting track.  It is slow in parts and then rocks.  It has a beauty to it and is very catchy with excellent guitar at the bridge.  \\"Devil's Child\\" is another rocker with killer, screeching vocals at the bridge.  As for the bonus track \\"Prisoner of Your Eyes,\\" I have a 1988 article from Blast! magazine that states that Glenn Tipton called the ballad one of the best songs Priest has ever done.  \\"Devil's Child\\" as the live track is a bit disappointing as it is not nearly the best song off Screaming and it plays so close to the studio version.  Still, with or without the bonus tracks, Screaming for Vengeance is awesome (it also sports the best Priest album cover).  If you own only one Judas Priest album; this should be the one!
B000056K04|3.0|I have been in love with DMB for a while now.  I love how their songs are usually half instrumentals and 8 minutes long but never get boring or dull.<br />Well, this CD didn't give that to me.  I love pretty much every song on it, but dmb just doesnt sound like they used to.  The songs are very short; it's mostly just Dave singing, theres hardly any instrumental break; and I really think they were trying to change their style.  It sounds more pop than anything else.  I still enjoy this CD, but if you want to get a real feel of what DMB is about, pick up Before These Crowded Streets, which was amazing.  Also, all their live CDs are terrific.<br />Busted Stuff, the release after Everyday, shows that DMB is back to their old familiar ways.  That was a great CD also.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Does this constant tweaking and reworking remind anybody of Winston Smith's job in Orwell's 1984? Smith was constantly updating old news stories so that they would always reflect the current political climate. I don't mean to read some deep heavy meaning into George Lucas' reworking of these classics, but he should let people remember these movies as they were, warts and all. As for the movies themselves, what can I say that everyone doesn't already know? The movies are great and the effects were charming by today's standards, but 25+ years ago they were cutting edge.
B000002UAR|5.0|I loved this album from beginning to end. It's full of great music written by the greatest band of all time. Songs like &quot;And your bird can sing&quot; and &quot;For No One&quot; reminded me why I love this band so much.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I just saw this movie on DVD after not getting a chance to see this in the theaters. 5 stars for Gordan Leu and Sonny Chiba!! Awsome to see these 2 great legends of asian cinema!

B00005JM0B|4.0|T3 takes off from where T2 ended. John Connor(Nick Stahl) is now a nomad, invisible in the society with no connection at all to his past. He is still paranoid about his reclusiveness and the future, which he views with trepidation. Yet it isn't enough to ward off another threat by Skynet, the AI super computer that unleashes a new bot called the T-X in the form of a woman (Kristanna Loken). Only one thing stands in its way to setting the course of Judgement Day....Arnie.<br />T3 on its own is a good movie. Really. It is astonishing to see Arnold this fit even at this age. You cannot diffrentiate him from his appearance in T2. Nick Stahl as Connor and Claire Danes, who acts as his love interest,as Kate Brewster, take their characters to heart . However, I wouldn't say the same for Kristanna. She is a bit too lame for a role that Robert Patrick immortalized as the amazing T-1000. She doesn't have the fierceness that Patrick had. Only one expression, is carried through the entire movie.<br />Neverthless,T3 is surprising in many ways. The movie is wittier and more subjective. The story takes a total U-turn from the original theme. Judgement-Day 'does' happen and Connor and Kate are the one of the few left to contemplate the horrors of the 'nuclear-mad' Skynet. How they cope and what will be the final Judgement Day could be the story of T4, if ever it does come out.<BR>Johnathan Mostow (Director) may not have the flair of James Cameron (T2). But he brings in all his experience from 'Breakdown' and 'U-571' in creating genuine tension and one truly jaw dropping chase sequence at the start of the movie. The SFX is superb and thankfully not overshown. I'd say Mostow preferred story to SFX in pushing the franchise forward and it is the right decision. It remains to be seen how this new and exciting story will be realised in the next installement coz' I dont see how T3 would be viewed as the last of the Terminator series.<BR>Watch the movie and have fun.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Judas Priest's 1984 release Defenders of the Faith is my third favorite 1980s Priest album behind Screaming for Vengeance and barely behind British Steel.  Many of the tracks off Defender are better than British Steel but it is not quite as solid as the 1980 classic.  <br />Defenders offers some of the best all-time Priest tracks: &quot;The Sentinel,&quot; &quot;Love Bites,&quot; and &quot;Some Heads Are Gonna Roll.&quot;  They have a unique guitar sound that is difficult to explain in words.  The sound gives me images of a futuristic gladiator arena where metal gods do battle overlooked by the feared Sentinel.  What would that sound like?  Listen to this album. My favorite track, however, is the power ballad &quot;Night Comes Down.&quot;  It is beautiful with, as one would expect, amazing Rob Halford vocals.<br />The rest of the album is fairly solid.  The single &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot; is fast and furious.  Although it is not one of my favorite tracks, hearing Halford sing at breakneck speed is incredible!  &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; is a Sentinel-style song with that unique guitar sound. &quot;Rock Hard Ride Free&quot; is a catchy rocker.  &quot;Eat Me Alive&quot; got the PMRC leaders' pantyhose in a knot with the highly suggestive lyrics (probably giving some guys the creeps now that Halford has officially &quot;come out&quot;) and the line &quot;I'm gonna force you at gunpoint.&quot;  It is not one of their better tracks.  &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith&quot; starts out like &quot;Eat Me Alive II&quot; with some risqué lyrics but ends up being a salute to metal.  The title track is just a 1:30 chanting of &quot;We are defenders of the faith.&quot;  I'm not a big fan of songs that celebrate the band, its fans, and what they do (Ram it Down has a lot of self congratulatory songs like &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and &quot;I'm a Rocker&quot;).  It's disappointing that this song was chosen as the live bonus track.  The bonus studio track does not seem to wowanyone either.  Though it ends on a low note, most of Defenders of the Faith is excellent and one of Priest's best.
B00028HBKM|5.0|If your not a Christian this movie is not for you.  You may not understand the point.  If your not a Christian, and want to see this, then see the Jesus Film first.  Then, you might appreciate it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this album was very powerful and it is a lot mature than the last one but the last one was great also.       This album is the best one yet, because it has more choice in what you are into the mood to listening to , from electronica, hip hop, trance to rock.       I was very impressed and happy with this album compaired to the last one because the sound is so much better and the music is deeper than past albums.       These six guy bring diffrent types of music into one genre and make it there own
B00004U45G|5.0|Rock 'n' Roll is all about fantasy, mostly about sexual fantasy (e.g. AC/DC's \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\"), but sometimes it is just about Rock 'n' Roll  fantasy. Such as, what if Jimmy Page found himself at a lose end and wanted to go out on tour? So who could he pick as a backing band? Perhaps his long time admirers and possibly America's tightest jamming band The Black Crowes? And what could they pick as a set list? A selection of Led Zeppelin's finest and just for good measure some of the finest standards laid down? Well, for once it was not fantasy, but reality. Rehearsals took place and dates were set and this amazing combination hit the road, playing to packed arena's the length and breadth of America, with astounding results. Fortunately plans were made to record the event for all time and here are the results. At first only released on the Internet, but sense was seen and the whole Shishkerbang was let loose on the eagerly awaiting Rock Public.<br />For those amongst you who may feel that it is sacrilegious for anyone else to perform these songs, especially for old Robert (Percy) Plant not to be singing, hollering, and cajoling every nuance out of these classic's. Fear not. Chris Robinson, the Crowes' vocalist, does not even attempt to imitate the great man, singing everything in his own style giving each song a new slant. The rest of the Crowes play with such abandon, I have never heard them play with such verve and panache, and this is somebody who has been a huge fan of the band for over ten years. The rhythm section of Pipien and Gorman keep a lock sold groove going whilst losing nothing of the looseness that keeps the music spontaneous and alive. Probably the biggest sound difference on the Zeppelin classics is that although John Paul Jones used to double up on bass and keyboards (an exemplary job he did, too) in that band his use of piano was very sparing, whereas Ed Harsch is not frightened to push the piano right to the front of the sounds cape, soloing when any opportunity arises. But it is the three pronged guitar attack that floors you. Combining together to give the raunchiest guitar sound that has ever been heard on this little planet. (Lynard Skynard are stunning, make no mistake, this is just one step beyond) Obviously it's Jimmy Page that steals the show. I doubt he has ever played better. However, the playing of Chris's brother Rich Robinson, and new at the time Crowes guitarist, is of outstanding class, pushing their guest player to the outer limits of his ability.<br />The Song selection is spot on. The guitar duel in \\"You Shook Me\\" is nothing short of jaw dropping, specially as it follows a version of that old Elmore James classic \\"Shake Your Money Maker\\", which rattles the roof tops and would bring a smile to even the most stern of anorak Rock 'n' Roll connoisseurs. Chris Robinson turns in a truly saucy version of \\"The Lemon Song\\". The choice of Jimmy Page's contemporary guitarist/songwriter Peter Green's  finest song written whilst in Fleetwood Mac, \\"Oh Well\\" is a pure delight. There has never been a better version of \\"Heartbreaker\\" with Jimmy Page really stepping out on this one. So topped and tailed with \\"Celebration day\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" across  two hours of music spread over two CD's. You get Six cover versions and fourteen classic Zeppelin tracks (all with credit due to Willie Dixon and C. Burnett), played by a bunch of guys, who are having the time of their lives. This is certainly one of the top three Rock 'n' Roll Live albums of all time.<br />As an extra - if you have a computer you can watch theb performing snippets of the songs live from your disc drive plus some very good stills taken from the Greek, where it becomes even more apparent how well they all gelled as a unit and what a good time they were having.<br />After this tour the Black Crowes went back into the studios to record their next album, the very heavily Zeppelin influenced \\"Lions\\", since when, it's been rumored, they have disbanded, probably feeling it would be hard to top the Jimmy Page tour. One is also left to reflect what a shame it was that \\"Led Zeppelin\\" never recorded a decent live album. \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is not a bad album, but hardly a  killer. \\"Live at the Greek\\" leaves it for dead.<br />  Mott The Dogisbanded, probably feeling it would be hard to top the Jimmy Page tour.

B00005QDW5|2.0|Although this album has some great songs, I recommend buying their albums, not their individual songs. The meaning is lost on songs from &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Animals,&quot; among others, because the entire album is more like one song, telling a story. Each song, like &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Mother,&quot; are only segments of these terrific pieces of art, so it appears that the songs have no meaning. And even if you disagree, where are other classic hits, like &quot;Dogs?&quot;
B00005K9LN|5.0|The track &quot;Grinder&quot; is a perfect description of British Steel.  Most of the songs off Judas Priest's first release of the 1980s sound like guitars thrown in a grinder.  Those who know this album chiefly by the two singles &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; and &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; will be surprised at how non-commercial the rest of this album is.  Rob Halford, through much of the 1980s, called British Steel the best Judas Priest album.  As a fan of 1980s Priest, I'd give the nod to Screaming for Vengeance and I may even put British Steel behind Defenders of the Faith.  Still, British Steel is a classic 5-star album and a must for any metal fan.  &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; aside, any fan of raw, grinding metal who does not like too much of the good time rock 'n roll sound, will be a big fan of British Steel.<br />&quot;Breaking the Law&quot; is one of the more well-known songs by Priest receiving a lot of play with the cool retro (although rather silly) music video.  It is a very accessible and fun rocker.  &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; is one of those grinding songs.  It is my least favorite off British Steel as it is very repetitive and doesn't seem to go anywhere.  It has no chorus to speak of.  &quot;Metal Gods&quot; and &quot;Grinder&quot; also have a very raw sound but are also very catchy.  The former is classic Priest and &quot;Grinder&quot; is one of my favorites on this album. &quot;United&quot; is a chanting anthem which was probably more appropriate live with audience participation.  <br />The most played Judas Priest track is definitely &quot;Living After Midnight.&quot;  It is a good rock 'n roll song, but it is also very commercial and not really what Priest was/is all about. In terms of the best songs on this album, I put it in the middle of the pack.  To me, the best song on this album is &quot;Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise.&quot;  It is a powerful track with excellent lyrics and incredible vocals.  Rob Halford really demonstrateshis range on this one!  The album ends with two more grinders, &quot;The Rage&quot; and &quot;Steeler.&quot;  The former is the better of the two as it actually comes to a climax.  &quot;Steeler,&quot; like &quot;Rapid Fire,&quot; just grinds away and is mostly instrumental with driving guitars and drums.  Metal purists will probably enjoy it.  This remastered edition has the bonus studio track &quot;Red, White, and Blue&quot; is Turbo/Ram It Down era.  I have a 1988 article in Blast! magazine where Halford stated it (as well as &quot;Prisoner of Your Eyes&quot;) did not make Ram it Down but might &quot;surface in 1989 or 1990.&quot; Well, it surfaces here and &quot;Prisoner&quot; (a nice ballad) surfacing on the remastered Screaming for Vengeance.  I don't agree with some reviewers that British Steel is Judas Priest's best album, but it is still a classic and essential for any metal collection.

0393324818|5.0|One of the best books i've ever read  its brilliant.Michael Lewis is a terrific  writer.The way he analyzes everything done by smart yet maniacal Oakland Athletics GM Billy Beane is excellent. Everything from ripping off other GM's to drafting 15th round prospects in the 1st round is described great.
B0001CCXGG|5.0|For those of you who like a bit of rock 'n' roll guitar played at 100 mph with loads of whammy bar, stretched licks, and five hundred notes played a second, when a mere mortal would struggle to get fifty into the same time frame, the sort of guitar playing that is only possible by some of the world's greatest gurners, then this is the album for you.<br />Back in the year 2000 Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson went out on the road in the United States of America doing what can only be described as guitar workshops in rock 'n' roll. Each artist had his own band with him and would do an hour's set, followed every night by the G3 Jam, where all three guitarists would get up on the same stage, giving full reign to a three way guitar battle. Magnificent stuff.<br />Then in 2003 they did it again. This time we still get Satriani and Vai, but the very talented but uncharismatic Eric Johnson had been replaced by the equally talented, but way over the top exuberance of Sweden's favorite rock 'n' roll sons, Yngwie Malsteen. The results are explosive to say the least.<br />The first CD of this double CD package is broken up into three parts, where we get a twenty minute section from each artist. First up is Joe Satriani. Quite right that is, too. After all he is the senior guitarist. Satriani sets a remarkably high standard of twiddle for the others to follow. Sticking to basically greatest hits formula, he attacks the frets with the enthusiasm of a teenager. The man is the master of his chosen instrument, even giving us a taste of his acoustic playing on 'Midnight', which gives great balance to his segment of the CD.<br />Completely undaunted by this first set, Steve Vai takes to the stage with a lineup that most people only dream of. Apart from his playing powers, Vai's confidence levels must be at an all time high to bring this lot on tour with him. (However, I suppose being a Frank Zappa prot&eacute;g&eacute; must help.) Sharing the stage with Vai are Jeremy Colson on drums; Dave Weiner on rhythm guitar (now do not forget that this guy plays lead guitar in his own band); and then on bass guitar is none other than the five time winner of Guitar Magazine's `Bass Guitarist of the Year', Billy Sheehan, ex of 'Mr. Big', etc. Sheehan played with Steve Vai for a couple of albums and toured with David Lee Roth when he put together a super group after his departure from Van Halen.<br />Then on second lead guitar and keyboards Steve Vai has gone for the talents of Tony MacAlpine. Tony MacAlpine would be worthy of a place in the G3 lineup on his own ability. Just take a listen to any of his solo albums for proof, 'Edge of Insanity' (1986) being probably the pick of the bunch. Hearing these three superstars jousting musically at the front of the stage is a real treat to the ears. Let's hope that some record company suit has the intelligence to release the full segment of the show from this lineup on a separate CD.<br />Whereas both Satriani and Malmsteen, split their sections into five parts, Vai sticks to three, giving his band plenty of space to breathe life into their music.<br />There is only one way for Yngwie Malmsteen to go after that, and that is pull all the stops and let it all hang out, which he does with spectacular effect, dispensing with a large band. He comes on with a stripped down trio, Patrick Johannson on drums and Jocke Svalberg on keyboards. However, their role is purely to support this guitar genius. He opens with the aptly named 'Blitzkrieg' before leading us through his complete repertoire, partly classically influenced, but with a lot of Blackmore and Hendrix mixed in. His version of 'Red House' gives the governor a run for his money. If Malmsteen's set leaves you breathless as it should, wait till you open CD two.<br />On disc two you get thirty minutes of all three guitarists on stage, all trying to outshine each other. It's anybody's guess which star sparkles the brightest. But if you have your air guitar handy, grab it. You'll need it to join this lot on stage in your mind. Again Hendrix is given a huge nod of respect as they start out with two of his classic songs before they all rip into the final number, Neil Young's 'Rockin in the Free World'. This leads to a final battle to see who can get the last notes in. They may be trying to outplay each other, but you can still feel the friendship and respect for each other shining through the grooves of your disc.<br />The original idea for G3 was supposed to have included Dweezil Zappa with Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, but prior commitments made this impossible for Zappa, so Eric Johnson stepped in. May I suggest that Dweezil Zappa makes time (listen to his album 'Automatic' (2000) for an idea of what Frank Zappa's son can do with a guitar in his hand.) so that the next time these three decide to go out on the road together, they invite Dweezil along and give us G4.The mind positively boggles.<br />If you like this CD, there is also a DVD of a different concert from this tour with different set lists, so you can fill your ears and your eyes if you so desire. Three brilliant young men caught at the top of their game. Enjoy.<br />Twiddled by Mott the Dog<br />Whammed by Ella Crew. You'll need it to join this lot on stage in your mind.

B000003TA4|5.0|If you ask me Nirvana is and always will be the best band in history period. The is one of the greatest albums ever and to me it's not even their best (In Utero is to me). But anyway if you're a fan of early 90's grunge music you really can't find a better band than Nirvana (Soundgarden comes at a distant second, Alice in Chains is above average, while Pearl Jam is the worst band ever created yeah I said so what.
B0000025RQ|5.0|After much pondering, I've decided that Screaming for Vengeance is my favorite Judas Priest album-edging out Stained Class, Defenders of the Faith, and British Steel. This 1982 release is one of their most solid albums and the best tracks on this album are also THE best Priest tracks of all time.  <br />\\"Hellion/Electric Eye\\" (the first track being a short instrumental introduction to the second) is classic Priest.  \\"Electric Eye\\" is my all-time favorite Judas Priest song!  The haunting lyrics, the verses that build up to the chorus, the killer guitar solos; I can't write enough about it!  \\"Riding on the Wind\\" is a catchy rocker. It begins with a furious drum intro by Dave Holland (now in prison for a sexual assault conviction). It bugs me a little because parts of it sound like another Priest song but I can never figure out which.  Maybe \\"Heading Out to the Highway.\\"  Still, it is one of the better tracks on Screaming.  \\"Bloodstone\\" is awesome!  It is another favorite of mine.  It is a driving rocker and the guitar riffs are unbelievable!  \\"(Take These) Chains\\" (written by R. Halligan Jr.) is a slower, catchy track.  I'm sure a lot of fans find themselves singing the chorus.  The line \\"Take them off of my heart\\" I've always thought was a little sappy but I like Halford's vocals in the line \\"I can't sleep at night.\\"   \\"Pain and Pleasure\\" is a monster track.  I don't like it quite as well as the others, but a below average song off Screaming is better than most average tracks elsewhere.<br />The title track is the most furious song Judas Priest has ever done before or since.  It kicks so much butt, words cannot do it justice.  The fast and screeching \\"Freewheel Burning\\" off Defenders of the Faith has nothing on this track!  \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" is classic Priest.  Next to \\"Living After Midnight,\\" it is probably their most played single.  Unlike \\"Living...,\\" it is not commercial rock 'n roll, but powerful metal.  \\"Fever\\" is an interesting track.  It is slow in parts and then rocks.  It has a beauty to it and is very catchy with excellent guitar at the bridge.  \\"Devil's Child\\" is another rocker with killer, screeching vocals at the bridge.  Screaming for Vengeance is awesome (it also sports the best Priest album cover).  If you own only one Judas Priest album, this should be the one!

B0000CEB4V|5.0|This DVD concert never comes across as a sad Memorial concert for the late great George Harrison, more of a celebration of the life ,love, music ,and most of all faith of a wonderful human being.During George Harrison's tragically short life he touched many people. Obviously he was one of the lovable Moptops from Liverpool ,who's music and attitude changed the world as we know it. He also started the charity music culture with his concert for Bangla Desh in 1971. ( Would there have been a Live Aid etc with out the Charity concert held for the starving people of Bangla Desh if he had not been for George Harrison's groundbreaking concert a decade before?0 He almost single handedly made the world AWARE of whole new cultures from the Asia. Not forgetting his own solo career, at first the most successful Beatle to go solo, his first releases back in 1970 went to Number One all over the world with his magnificent triple album &quot; All Things Must Pass&quot;,and the single taken from it &quot; My Sweet Lord''.<br />George also formed Handmade movies which saved the masterpiece &quot; The Life Of Brian &quot; by Monty Python ( George actually has a walk on part as the Mayor if you look closely.) the world would definitely be a sadder place without that little Python masterpiece.<br />This double DVD package has the first DVD devoted to the whole concert in it's correct running order, so that all of us that were not able to be there on that magical night at the Albert Hall in London on November 29 2002 can get an inkling of what was going on . The second DVD gives you snippets of the concert intererspersed with interviews from Georges friends,rehearsals and backstage footage ,interesting and sometimes hilarious stuff. There is over 2 hours and twenty minutes of material on DVD Two , whilst the concert on Disc One lasts for nearly 2 1/2 hours.<br />There are too many musical highlights to mention them all. But before I list the group of friends that turned up to celebrate Georges life ,and what songs they decided to play, I shall try to point out a few.<br />The concert starts out with a specially composed piece by Ravi Shankar written for George 'Aspan',where what I can only call a blend of Asian Folk/Orchestra meets western influences the results are quite stunning, with Ravi's daughter playing the sitar as beautifully as she looks , and she is very beautiful, matching Eric Clapton when he joins her on acoustic guitar. The Monty Python team, get on stage for two songs, the wonderful irreverence of the songs would have had George rolling around the aisles in laughter, notice also Tom Hanks the movie star having the time of his life as a Mountie in the chorus line.Eric Clapton does a wonderful job as musical director as well as contributing some stunning guitar work ,especially in recreating his solo from&quot; My Guitar Gently Weeps '' from the Beatles 'White Album'. Poor Ringo barely keeping his emotions under control whilst singing 'Photograph'. It is also the first time that Paul McCartney , Billy Preston and Ringo Starr have all performed on the same stage together since a certain legendary roof top concert over thirty years ago.Although the concert would not of been the same without Paul McCartney, he for once does not dominate proceedings leaving plenty of room for others to shine ,and shine they do. George Harrison' son Dhani himself a fine musician is often allowed center stage.Whilst George Harrison's old mucker Joe Brown brings the concert to an emotional climax. The set from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in the middle of the second section is simply stunning. Tom Petty was in George Harrison's other group the Traveling Wilburys with Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne,and Roy Orbison.Look out for the guitar solo from Albert Lee during &quot; Honey Don't&quot; it raises the Albert Hall Roof a few inches higher.The singing of Sam Brown and Gary Brooker are as ever highlights of any concert.<br />This DVD delivers in every possible aspect,and would not disappoint anybody with even a passing interest in the life and times of George Harrison. There is also a double CD of this concert which is nice to have whilst driving the car , but you get so much more with the DVD.<br />By Mott the Dog.

Let them hate the new versions, but I myself am looking forward to the fruition of George's vision of having a saga of six films that you can watch 1-6 that reflect the continuous story that is seemless and timeless.  The DVDs are a perfect way to tie everything together.  I may not agree with all of the changes, but the majority of what has been done and hopefully what will be done, will result in a monumental saga that will be enjoyable to watch in order.  Kudos to Lucas.  Too bad for y'all!!!

B0000DBJ2B|3.0|Perhaps *beautiful* is the wrong word, for this movie is rarely aesthetically beautiful. Don't get me wrong on this point, beauty is not necessarily a good thing. What I mean to say is, atmospherically this is a triumph... but not beautiful. The 'characters' blend in perfectly(... beautifully?) to their world. The landscapes are... well... dark (which is fitting). It's aesthetically perfect, and in a movie like this, perfection demands there be little beauty.<br />The creatures are organic. 'Nuff said. They're wonderful. They're believable. They're just plain... wow.<br />So what's missing?<br />Terry Gilliam is quoted as saying a children's movie should be &quot;Exciting enough for adults, and intelligent enough for kids&quot; (Re: Time Bandits). The Dark Crystal is an imaginative masterpiece, but I couldn't help but feel the simplistic plot, 2-dimensional characters (I appreciate that making puppets' mental workings visible must be one of the hardest tasks in a movie with a fully puppet cast) patronizes the intelligence of all but the youngest children. They're a lot brighter than we treat them, and they're getting brighter by the day ;)<br />But, I suppose a great movie can do without great characters as long as the focus isn't on the characters, as long as it compensates atmospherically. And &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; more than compensates.<br />So what's missing?<br />I'll relate this to another adventure movie: Dune. Dune was atmospherically beautiful, but it took itself too seriously. It was a massive undertaking, granted, but I can't remember laughing... or even smiling once. 137 minutes without smiling is a long time.<br />And it's the same with &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. The only slightly comic break from the plot is the antics of a round-furry-dog-thing, but this isn't enough. &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; Takes its battle-between-good-and-evil far too seriously, and unless one's awe at the world Jim Henson created can last one the full 90 minutes orso of the movie, one becomes impatient. Humour is an important tool with infinite potential - especially in a movie aimed at children, but it's a tool almost entirely overlooked in &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. Even in a story as serious as Macbeth takes a moment to let its audience step back and chuckle towards the beginning. &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; doesn't give us this opportunity.<br />In conclusion, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; is a... beautiful movie, but one that takes itself far too seriously. I became impatient with the simplistic plot, 2-dimensional characters (as 'beautiful' as they may be), and almost total lack of humour, but... clearly from the other reviews I've read, other's did not. <br />RE: the DVD<BR>It's a lovely little package, but for the price you pay for it, it better be. I'm particularly fond of the little note-pad included. I would have liked to see more documentaries on the DVD, perhaps audio commentary, but alas - it shall not be.
B0000025YM|5.0|Judas Priest's 1984 release Defenders of the Faith is my third favorite 1980s Priest album behind Screaming for Vengeance and barely behind British Steel.  Many of the tracks off Defender are better than British Steel but it is not quite as solid as the 1980 classic.  <br />Defenders offers some of the best all-time Priest tracks: &quot;The Sentinel,&quot; &quot;Love Bites,&quot; and &quot;Some Heads Are Gonna Roll.&quot;  They have a unique guitar sound that is difficult to explain in words.  The sound gives me images of a futuristic gladiator arena where metal gods do battle overlooked by the feared Sentinel.  What would that sound like?  Listen to this album. My favorite track, however, is the power ballad &quot;Night Comes Down.&quot;  It is beautiful with, as one would expect, amazing Rob Halford vocals.<br />The rest of the album is fairly solid.  The single &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot; is fast and furious.  Although it is not one of my favorite tracks, hearing Halford sing at breakneck speed is incredible!  &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; is a Sentinel-style song with that unique guitar sound. &quot;Rock Hard Ride Free&quot; is a catchy rocker.  &quot;Eat Me Alive&quot; got the PMRC leaders' pantyhose in a knot with the highly suggestive lyrics (probably giving some guys the creeps now that Halford has officially &quot;come out&quot;) and the line &quot;I'm gonna force you at gunpoint.&quot;  It is not one of their better tracks.  &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith&quot; starts out like &quot;Eat Me Alive II&quot; with some risqué lyrics but ends up being a salute to metal.  The title track is just a 1:30 chanting of &quot;We are defenders of the faith.&quot;  I'm not a big fan of songs that celebrate the band, its fans, and what they do (Ram it Down has a lot of self congratulatory songs like &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and &quot;I'm a Rocker&quot;).  Though it ends on a low note, most of Defenders of the Faith is excellent and one of Priest's best.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I bought this right after it came out, because I thought her last cd was pretty good.  Granted her lyrics can sound kind of silly sometimes, some of them are really good.  The first time I listened to this cd, I didn't really like it, because the only songs that stuck out were the bad ones, &quot;Take Me Away&quot; and &quot;Freak out&quot;.  I think &quot;Take Me Away&quot; was an awful choice for the opener. So I thought I had wasted my money.  Well I waited about a week and then listened to the whole thing again.  But this time I heard some songs that caught my attention in a good way.  &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; is a good mellow song even though the lyrics sound kinda silly.  &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; were obvious choices for singles.  They are both really good even though they sound a lot alike.  The standout songs on this cd come close to the end.  &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; is great. I loved how her voice sounded in this during the verses. But &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot; and &quot;Slipped Away&quot; are by far the BEST songs she has done.  &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is my favorite. So if at first you don't like this cd, wait awhile and give it a second try.  It will definately grow on you.
B00006AW2J|1.0|Yeah, the music is great.  Blah blah blah.  We all know the music is great.  But seriously, what's up with this SACD junk?  I'm not gonna pay $20 CDN for a hybrid-SACD.  And I don't have a SACD player and refuse to get one.  I really don't think the sound quality is gonna be what they market it to be.  It's definitely not going to be that good that it covers the ridiculous price that they charge.   If they're gonna remaster it like this, at least keep on printing the originals so they're affordable (kinda like with the Bob Dylan catalogue).  And if you're gonna remaster it and charge this high a price, AT LEAST PUT SOME BONUS MATERIAL IN THERE.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Anyone who appreciates beautiful music would love this album. It's not something you listen to when you're drunk in the club, or jamming in your car down the boardwalk on the beach, but its something to listen to and enjoy by yourself. These songs make you think of life, of past relationships, of God, and of the world. The only problem with this is, if you are mainly for lyrics, and you don't speak the language of this band, you will not understand a word, let alone spell a song's name. Do not listen to this album to find meaning in the words. Let the singer's voice and sounds be part of the music instead of focusing on what he is saying. I believe this is an album where you will either REALLY love it or it just won't be for you. If you are strictly into American pop music, hiphop/R&amp;B, metal or hard rock, or close-minded to a certain hardcore sound, this album might not be for you. If you are open-minded to music that isn't just screaming and hardcore riffs, and isn't filled with hot beats with someone yappin about ridin on dubs and 24's, this might catch your ear. This is what music is supposed to be. I'm not saying this is what all music should be. I am saying that all music, whatever genre, should be on this level. If that were possible, the world would be a much more enjoyable place. If you have time to listen to this album, I strongly strongly strongly recommend it.
B000060P79|5.0|I love this CD.  I love the energy.  I love the lyrics.  I love the attitude.  I love it all.  It makes me laugh.  It makes me cry.  It makes me happy in a dismal world.  <br />Is it &quot;real punk&quot;?  Who cares?  <br />Punk is like Zen.  Take it too seriously --- obsess on it --- and YOU have missed the whole point.  Rock genres are not distinguished so much by technicalities within the music as they are by attitude.  Metal is an attitude.  Punk is an attitude.  But try putting it into words, try sticking it in some pigeon hole, and you're going to find yourself becoming what punk ISN'T.  Let go.  Enjoy it.  It's awesome.    <br />These lyrics are what almost every teen has experienced at some time.  The &quot;whininess&quot; is CARICATURE ... exaggeration ... parody ... comic relief there to put a SMILE on your face in the midst of a grim and morbid reality.  It's the most excitingly optimistic music you can find in this tragic world.  You want SERIOUSLY whiny?  Listen to country!!! <br />I'm 53.  I remember when the Beatles came to the US for the first time.  I've heard a helluva lot of music.  And to my ears and my music loving soul, Simple Plan is one of the best groups I've ever heard.  I love this album.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I'm a long time Marillion fan and it definitely took me a while to get used to their new style. I own over a thousand CD's and Marillion is probably the band I enjoy the most. Once I started listening to music for what it was and tried to picture what the band idea was, I really opened my mind and can enjoy music on a whole other level no matter what band it is. I've found that there is very little I dislike anymore, assuming its written and recorded by a band.<br />As far as this Marillion CD, they just took this one to a whole other level. They've exceeded what I expected from them as of let and I feel they are showing what veteran musicians they really are.<br />Trust me, if you appreciate music as much as I do, you won't want to miss this one. My fav's are Clutching at Straws, AOS, and now this CD!

B00024BHTC|1.0|What's this guy on?  Why so many a** licking reviews for Nightwish?  Is this a member of the family that can't sing, write etc etc???<BR>I have heard this album and it is crap.  Perhaps I should have been stoned when I first heard it.  Then I would be able to harp on about how 'good' they are????!!!!  To anybody who is thinking of buying, 3 words - SAVE YOUR MONEY!
B000060P79|5.0|I have read a few of the reviews for this CD and I decided I hate the word &quot;punk&quot;. I am so sick of people dissing this album because it's not the most hardcore genre out there. Who cares! it's a good cd so just live w/it.<br />AND IF YOU DONT LIKE THIS ALBUM, DON'T WRITE A REVIEW!!!!!
B0000024JN|4.0|its awsome like (fight for your right) but just a few sucked but i did not hate the fact i bought it i love it still i think its a good product here at amazon so i recomend it to all of you

078401213X|5.0|This movie is excellent.  The direction is phenomenal. In all honesty this movie actually has the ability to drive a sane person out of their mind.  It's creative and takes math to a whole new level...and i hate math, but i did love this movie, mainly because i like chaos theory and other interesting philosophical viewpoints.  It's always interesting to explore these ideas.  I watched this movie once, and then watched it close to three more times before i finally understood everything that was going on, but honestly i think it was well worth it.  The acting is top notch, and on top of all that, the direction is superb.  Incredible film, but not everyone's cup of tea.  If this review has sparked your interest...don't miss it.
B00024BHTC|5.0|If you think a band needs to be on TV to be good then you don't know what good music is. Britney Spears is on TV does that make her good? Korn is on TV does that make them good? No it does not make them good. A good band does not need to be on MTV or the top ten pop radio to be good. You want good music listen to Nightwish. You want crap music listen to what is on MTV and the top ten radio.
6305537321|5.0|I loved Breakfast at TIffany's. I had read about it from all of the gossip girl books and eventually became curious about the movie. I figured the movie would be good but I didn't expect to fall in love with it as much as I did. It is one of the best romantic comedy, chick flicks I have ever seen.
B000001DTM|5.0|Many great bands achieve perfection on one album, a high point of epiphany and clarity that is so obvious that it can't be denied - though that band's avid fans often like to. Be it the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper, Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon, Led Zeppelin's fourth album or Elton's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - all of these albums transcend time and genre, and are immediately and eternally accepted as classics by almost everyone, far beyond the bands' fan base. That happened for a record number of artists in 1991 - perhaps the greatest year rock had since 1973. Guns n' Roses had their Use Your Illusion; Red Hot Chili Peppers had Blood Sugar Sex Magik; Nirvana scored with Nevermind, and the list goes on - Pearl Jam, Temple Of The Dog, Spin Doctors. And U2. U2 achieved perfection on Achtung Baby both in their songs and in their sound. Much of the thanks should go to the production team; Achtung is the last U2 album produced by Daniel Lanois, but Brian Eno's (the master-producer who worked with David Bowie, Talking Heads, Bryan Ferry, Robert Fripp and Devo, among others) influence is at its strongest here, and with the help of Mix-artist Flood (techno-wizard who helped Nine Inch Nails and Smashing Pumpkins to the top) he creates a new sound for U2, a sound that is rougher, harder and more electric, but also more captivating and more powerful than they ever were before. U2 dragged themselves kicking and screaming out of the 80s, emerged out of pop-rock and into the alternative and the avant-garde, and created an album that is at once catchy and groundbreaking.<br />From the very first sounds of the album's opening track, `Zoo Station', it's clear that this will be a very different experience from The Joshua Tree or anything else they released before. The song is by far the heaviest and hardest track on the album, which makes for a great opener and a great introduction to the `new', more produced, more experimental U2. That is not to say that the band mates' celebrated skills are nowhere to be seen; in fact, The Edge's guitar sounds better than ever, but he abandoned the clean tone that made him famous during the Joshua Tree / Rattle & Hum period for a much harsher, more distorted sound. What attracted me to U2's music was always the sound rather than the songs, and on Achtung Baby the sound is all around perfect. That can be felt on the album's catchier, mellower pop tunes, like the hit ballad `One' and the successful single `Mysterious Ways', as well as on the more experimental pieces - `The Fly', `Love Is Blindness', or `Even Better Than The Real Thing'. U2 made a completely new band out of themselves in 1991, in terms of both music and subject matter; politics are nowhere to be found on Achtung Baby, and even the love songs have become more complex and sarcastic. U2 and Bono are darker here than they ever were.<br />But all that does not mean that they lost they skill for making catchy tunes; on the contrary. Each song on Achtung Baby is a perfect pop song, and it produced a number of hit singles that equals its massively successful predecessor. Thus the ideal balance is struck between the qualities of each member of the band and the production team - Bono's pop poetry, The Edge's explosive guitar, Eno's always expanding experimentation, Flood's electronics. That balance will not - could not have - lasted for more than one album; Eno would take over on Zooropa, then Flood would have his own on Pop, and Bono would reclaim the group on All That You Can't Leave Behind. All of these albums are great for their own reasons, but not one of them could be compared to the inspiration of Achtung Baby. Even the most cynic of U2's haters should give it a listen; it really is one of the masterpieces of its time.
1884737994|5.0|I am brand new to the world of mountain biking and this book has been my bible. If it isn't covered in this book then you don't need to know. With this book I have been able to make adjustments and alignments to my bike I would have normally taken to a shop to have done.<br />My wife doesn't care for the book too much though because she has now become a mountain bike widow. I spend about an hour or two a day rereading this book and tweeking my bike. The must have spares part of the book saved me from pushing my bike home one day as I would not have normally had a spare chain link with me. Unfortunately I also went on to break my collar bone that same day and this was not addressed in the book. Seriously though, I'm contemplating buying a second book, a working copy (the dirty one) and a reference copy (the clean one) I can bring in the house.<br />You won't be sorry if you buy this book.
0743454529|5.0|This book was so enthralling at one point I took it upstairs to my bedroom, put it in a drawer, closed the door and started about doing things in the house. I did not want it to be over! The only problem with this enticing, excellently written novel is that it was over too soon. A very close second to my other favorite book of all time. The Pact by Jodi Picoult as well. I am glad she puts so much into her novels at the same time I wish she would write faster...
0446677450|1.0|The only way to describe this &quot;book&quot; is as a collection of useless drivel. Seriously! I found nothing in this book to be of any real value - all you get from Kyosaki is a lot of chest beating and tall talk, but you get little to no actual INFORMATION.<br />This is one of those inspirational &quot;you can do it if you decide to do it&quot; books, which is big on promises but is very short on real advice that can be followed.<br />I am actually pretty surprised by the number of positive comments. I can only surmise that (a) we were each reading a different book; or (b) that some of these positive reviews were not written by actual readers.<br />Do yourself a favor: if you want to get rich, start by doing some real research. Set yourself some actual goals and then go meet them. Do not waste your time reading useless collections of fiction, which is what this book is.
B0001LYH9S|4.0|i love this album.  i think the remastering is beautiful.  however, if it's quality of packaging you're looking for seek out the original issues, namely the japanese outside version 2, which has all this on disc 1, and a bonus disc full of other b-sides.  i compared the art on this to the original cardboard sleeve, which i thought was gorgeous, and this issue does not do it justice.  the transfer is weak, the images flat and fuzzy, whereas the original art is full of color and very lively.  5 stars for the album, 1 star for the packaging, or should i say the lack of care in reproducing it.
1592400876|4.0|What I mean is this is a book about pretty much nothing.  The Economist raved about it last fall when it wasn't even available on Amazon-US.  Six months later it's in Costco for $9.99.  Some of the Amazon-UK reviewers found it snooty so I lost interest at the time.  Now, however, I can assure you that Lynne Truss is indeed quite snooty, and occasionally very funny.  You might think there isn't a lot you can say about punctuation-and there isn't.  But what there is to say about history and usage and the current state of flux on the whole matter is all said in a very entertaining and showy way in this wisp of a book.  She reminds me of Miss Manners, or parts of Mark Twain's work.  Getting the content right, but consciously playing the wise guy.

0446677450|5.0|Without a doubt, Rich Dad Poor Dad has influenced more people and gotten more people to exit the rat race, significantly change their financial lives than any other book in history! How is that JBQ shill doing? Here is a guy who is on the internet 24/7. That should tell you how he is doing!<br />The reson for the attacks on Mr. Kiyosaki is simple--he is a best selling author; mediocre authors detest that. He also is telling people the truth about their employers, banks, brokers, mortgages etc. The financial industry is huge. They don't like that either.<br />You employer wants you just as you are---at their mercy as a &quot;yes master subservient type&quot; they detest people like Kiyosaki. How dare Kiyosaki encourage you to go on your own. No they would rather have you working for them where they pay you what they have to to keep you from quitting (usually just barely)<br />So there are a lot of people who will do everything th ey can to discourage you from reading this book. The 1 star reviews will continue as will the websites. But hey, trashy tabloids have been around for decades too. There is a market for that junk. But look at how the people who believe in that junk are doing---I rest my case!<br />Better yet, look at how Kiyosaki students are doing---those who read the book and applied the knowledge. Again--I REST MY CASE.<br />Good book. Highly recommended for achievers.
B0002858YS|5.0|With all the crappy played out music that is around today I am so glad bands like The Killers release albums.  Hot Fuss is just a wonderful album jammed full of catchy tunes with LOTS of retro style synthesizer, and when combined with Brandon Flowers masterful voice it makes for a wonderful listen.  The entire album is solid and there is not one bad song, thats why I give this album a 5.  Go buy this album is you are thirsty for a new sound that is unlike anything out.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|It's amazing how someone can take all the best things about this movie and turn them into negatives.<br />&gt; &quot;I'm going to be open-minded,&quot; I told myself at the video <BR>&gt; store. &quot;Even though it seems a little quirky, I like quirky. <BR>&gt; That's cool.&quot; This isn't. Despite its critical acclaim, those <BR>&gt; of us who are actually looking for a purposeful story in &quot;Lost <BR>&gt; in Translation&quot; will come out emptyhanded.<br />More than any movie for ages, we came out discussing what had happened. We knew already that many people would see nothing in it, but we were able to identify with the characters.<br />&gt; Basically, the film is about two American losers (Bill Murray <BR>&gt; and Scarlett Johansson) who are in Tokyo and hate it. They<BR>&gt; hate the people, they hate the sights, they hate the food, <br />If you travel internationally on business you will find that many people are like this. I don't actually think the characters were particularly extreme in this. They are jaded with travelling, and would rather not be there; that's normal.<br />Not that I am that type. I try to make the most of the location, but it's not always easy.<br />&gt; they hate communicating with their spouses--basically, they <BR>&gt; think their lives are unbelievably stupid.<br />There has to be some premise for the story; some tension. That's how stories are built.<br />&gt; Then, in a chance <BR>&gt; meeting at a hotel bar, the two forge a friendship, just <BR>&gt; because there aren't too many other English-speakers nearby. <br />Obviously you have never been away on business, wishing you could see a friendly face in your hotel. It may be fine by day when you are with your colleagues, customers, whatever, but at other times...<br />&gt; They go around the city together, complaining about their <BR>&gt; pathetic lives and attempting to further dig themselves into <BR>&gt; depression.<br />When you are placed in what seems a vacuum small things become very important. That is excellently observed.<br />&gt; I can honestly say that &quot;Lost in <br />&gt; Translation&quot; has become my least favorite movie of all time. <BR>&gt; It is so bad that I can't even remember any of the characters <BR>&gt; names.<br />Far better to remember the emotions the movie creates than the details of a trivial story-line.<br />&gt; this flick is full of so many dark emotions--sadness, <BR>&gt; irritation, longing, depression, hate.<br />...which are presented in an authentic and appropriate way.<br />&gt; Bill Murray doesn't <BR>&gt; smile once in the movie.<br />How would that be appropriate to the storyline?<br />&gt; they should go back to the States, divorce their <BR>&gt; spouses, and do whatever it is they like to do. Don't complain <BR>&gt; about their idiotic lives if they put no effort into changing <BR>&gt; them.<BR>&gt; If he and Johansson's childlike <BR>&gt; character can't stand their lives so much, why don't they do <BR>&gt; something about it?<br />...because their problems are trivial; amplified by their situation. When they return home they will probably realise that their lives are fine. This is a movie about two people put into the pressure-cooker situation of a business hotel in the pressure-cooker situation of Tokyo.<br />&gt; They moan and whine and pass judgement on <BR>&gt; everything in Japan but never try to make themselves happy. <br />In my experience of Americans (and British, and...) abroad, many of them try to measure a foreign country by their home values. It's not fair, it doesn't work, and they would be far heppier if they just absorbed the culture, but they don't.<br />&gt; Instead of inspiring feelings of joy and <BR>&gt; excitement, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; made me feel gloomy and <BR>&gt; upset.<br />The aim of a movie is to generate emotion in the viewer. It obviously succeeded. Why should every film be bubblegum for the brain? If you watch films to be made happy, I can understand that, but you should obviously avoid 90% of the best films ever made.<br />&gt; Nearly everyone would love the opportunity to travel <BR>&gt; freely or appear on TV or stay in world-class hotels--I would <BR>&gt; do anything to visit Japan--and here are these two ingrates, <BR>&gt; in Tokyo of their own accord, loathing every minute of it.<br />Travel is great, it's one of my favourite passtimes. Even business travel can be enjoyable, but it's sometimes difficult to realise it... If you were on your seventh trip this month, in a hotel where you knew no one, and few of them spoke a language you understood, you missed your family, would you be looking forward to the next trip?
B00004W199|4.0|Carnival of Souls was made on a shoe-string budget by industrial filmmaker Herk Harvey and stars the enigmatic and beautiful Candace Hilligoss as the lead character who manages to be constantly isolated from everyone around her.  There are so many excellent transitions and shots in the movie it was obvious that who ever put it together had been an excellent film editior at the very least.  As the film has been extensively reviewed here I want to focus on the DVD releases.  Aside from the original cut of the film, 82 minutes, there where several prints that had been trimmed down both by the director and perhaps for TV although I have seen the complete film on cable as well as edited versions.  The Image &quot;movie-only&quot; release (by the way Image also co-produced the Criterion Collection release) has the complete version of the movie and best print that I have seen.  There is an active menu with some of the spooky organ music with icons for chapters and the films trailer.  At first I thought the icon for &quot;recommendations&quot; was just a link to a one page marketing promo.  However, if you click on the title boxes you get a trailer for each of the other Image releases shown.  Quite a nice little &quot;Easter Egg&quot;!  <BR>     I am glad I have the other versions as well because I think the edited prints are also interesting.  The Alpha Video version actually has a slightly higher bit rate than the Image edition and only a tiny amount of pixelization here and there detracts from a very sharp picture, it clocks in at 77 minutes and is a great bargain.  The Diamond DVD release has an identical running time, but a lower bit rate and still some pixelization in a couple of scenes.  However considering that you get a copy of 1960's &quot;Horror Hotel&quot; with Christopher Lee included it is a great buy for just a few bucks.  Curiously, the Diamond edition &quot;Carnival of Souls/&quot;Horror Hotel&quot; is supposedly out of print yet I found a copy in a store recently and got another new copy on-line for my little brother's collection.  Goodtimes has released &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; with a high bit rate and sharp picture but a few more skips and pops.  Also, the running time is the shortest, 75 minutes, as it cuts out a couple more scenes such as when Candace Hilligoss stops for gas and directions entering Salt Lake City.  However, my Goodtimes edition is a two sided disc with &quot;Carnival&quot; on one side and a decent print of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; on the other.  For those of you who don't like two sided discs, Goodtimes has also released both films seperately for just a few bucks each.  Criterion Collection has released the utlimate edition with two cuts of the film and loads of extras including a commentary.  However, it you are on a budget you do have other options.  So make some popcorn and enjoy the show.  Thanks, CAL
B00005JMYG|4.0|Chalk this one up with Dodgeball and Starsky and Hutch as another in a string of dumb, low-concept little comedies of 2004. Of course, like those other two movies, this one's funny, and like Dodgeball, it works. Then again, like Hutch, barely and not all the time. I can't deny that Will Ferrell is emerging as a premier comic talent in his post-SNL days, and if you aren't laughing so hard you're wiping away tears - at least a few times - then check your pulse. Yes, this movie is stupid and yes, it draws on a pretty cardboard concept for 90 minutes. But Anchorman spruces things up occasionally with wacky, oddball little additions that don't make sense but are hilarious (a violent brawl of anchormen, involving great cameos, comes to mind). Will Ferrell's first movie as the total centerpiece (Elf was a kids movie, so it's on technicality) isn't as funny as the man himself, and it would have been better to completely embrace its stupidity like the slightly better Dodgeball. Luckily, though, there are enough moments of tear-inducing, knee-slapping comedy to keep this one afloat. By the way, the music freaking rocks. THE SOUNDTRACK: A+; THE MOVIE: B
B000089RVX|5.0|This is my favorite CD. Amy's vocals are just so powerful and beautiful and haunting. I love tourniqet, my immortal, and everybody's fool, they are just flat out better music than other stuff on the radio. I love this CD.
B00005JKED|1.0|I first of all am not a Denzel Washington fan. So my review is a little biase in the sense that I went in thinking this movie was going to be bad....and boy was it. I first want to say that Denzel Washington is a good actor he just doesn't do anything for me. I thought this movie was waaaayyyy over the top unrealistic and I could not in good consious recommend it. For one thing all the singers and rappers in the movie who can't act took away from any beliveable scenario. Ethan Hawkes character was such a wimp he had literally no back bone. Every &quot;bad&quot; thing that Denzels character wanted him to do he did it. I think this is one of the worse movies I ever seen. And the ending who didn't see that coming a mile away.

B0000AOV85|4.0|This is one of the best &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series on video. I think for people just discovering the band and picking up the SACD CD, it's a nice way to see how they made the album and what it took (lots of teamwork behind the console as well as in the studio). The video has the original made for TV part, but the best parts are in the extras, which are about as long. <br />It's unfortunate that the band never filmed the &quot;Dark Side&quot; tour, and resorted to using a &quot;Set the Controls&quot; promo from the same time period, even though there is 8MM footage out there. Thankfully, some of the &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot; film showed the making of at the time, which they used to great effect, and then showed them in the present day.  It's too bad PF neglected to film any of their shows from DSOTM to Animals... there's probably some &quot;lost&quot; footage floating around somewhere that they never knew about. But a lot of the &quot;video&quot; footage they used for the screen during the shows is also shown throughout the show, hopefully one day can be used as part of a video collection (supposedly, Nick Mason is putting one together). <br />It's too bad they weren't willing to be in the same room with each other during the filming of the show though. A lot of it is really interesting to see Roger, Rick, and Dave break down their songs. But I did think that Dave's voice is starting to show wear, which may be why he is reluctant to do a full Floyd tour and is doing the acoustic shows. Hopefully they can do one show together for posterity at least, covering all eras. <br />Overall, I don't know if this is something that will be played on the DVD player that often, but it's definitely worth watching at least once.
B00000JLWW|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORETE MOVIES OF ALL TIME!THE ONLY GROSS PART IS WHEN ROSE TAKES OF ALL HER CLOTHES!?YUCK!BUT ANYWAY,IT`S A GREAT AND ROMANTIC MOVIE!
B000002H33|5.0|look what he said about st anger<br />1 of 12 people found the following review helpful: <BR> their only good cd July 1, 2004 <BR>this cd kicks ass, every song has atleast 2 solos and cliff burton has a 9 minute long bass solo! nick menza has the best doubel bass around today... god i love the NEW metallica <br />what the hell is cliff burton doing a 9 min. bass solo when he isnt even alive. every song has atleast 2 solos my ass. i think there might be one on the whole cd...but im not sure.trapped under ice has 3 times as many solos as that entier cd anyway WTF
B000059MEK|4.0|I got this before I got Homework, an in spite of hearing One More Time on the radio (I say in spite of because the vocal work on this album by what's his name sucks).  Daft Punk still like tweaking compressors, but they've graduated from modwheels to vocoders and a much more layered sound that starts out just too perfect to hold up for too long.<br />Aerodynamic is great at being funky and having that totally shameless guitar thing in the middle.  Digital Love is the corniest piece of dancefloor magic I ever listened to over and over, and Harder Better Faster Stronger has enough vocoder tricks for an entire decade and and irresistible beat to match.  Even Superheroes, a bass heavy song where a one bar vocal sample fades out for some arpeggiation of some interesting chords, has enough disco magic for miles.  Short Circuit is pretty cool as long as you keep imagining Herbie Hancock's early 80s hit Rockit (this is a total ripoff of Rockit).  Even Voyager is fun in a kind of moody way, and Face to Face is pretty trippy until some idiot starts singing and I have to skip to the next track.<br />In short, Crescendolls, Night Vision, Verdis Quo, and Too Long should never have been attempted.  Okay, Too Long is cool about five minutes when that guy's voice disappears for a while, but Daft Punk smelled themselves a little too much on Discovery.  The disco fun time thing gets out of hand when it is mixed with Bach or broken up by half-a** interludes, and vocal work is only admissible under cover of vocoder and in limited doses.  But the songs that work, work incredibly well, which is what makes Daft Punk so great.  It is kind of surprising to hear how much they've grown since Homework, but they don't control things as well.<br />And remember what I said: it's all fun and games until someone stops using a vocoder.
B000002UAX|5.0|You will always find people who say this is an overrated album (most of whom have never heard the complete album or have heard it only once or twice).<br />Besides the greatness of this album (which I think is below Abbey Road and Revolver) you have to notice the superior Production work.<br />The use of the stereo system is simply outstanding. I have never heard such a great sound in any other album (although Pink Floyd were very close, thanks of course to their mutual friend Allan).<br />I invite you to place you speakers to your sides, 180º, I guarantee you will hear the sound comming from 4 different places!!<br />You can clearly distiguish every instrument, every voice, every different person clapping in Bungalow Bill, the sing of the bird in Blackbird, the guitar and voice in Julia.<br />The experience of listening to the quality in recording of this album alone deserves the title of one of the best albums ever.<br />Delight yourself with the best produced album ever.
0066620996|5.0|Collins' curiosity and clear study brings to light some of those factors that contribute to greatness. These findings are grounded within individual, teachable 'points of view' which are easily applied to large organisations and applicable to small busness as well.<br />Collins puts his findings in clear accessable language. Including the finding that is responsible for the title... That good is the enemy of great.<br />I highly recommend this book/CD to leaders that are enaged with designing futures and those that work with them. It is core reading for key teams. It has made a significant difference in being able to articulate powerful conversations with teams about that which is tacit and critical to success. Giving common language and principles to engage with. A great study book for learning teams.
B00008OLIC|5.0|This album captures Motley at their peak and proves that while they didn't have the same hard and dark edge that they had with their first two albums, they could still make great and really fun hard rock party anthems. This one has something for everyone, featuring the metal masterpiece &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;- an anti-drug song, the stylish power ballad &quot;Without You&quot; and the adrenaline rushing rock anthem &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;-my personal fav on this album. Even if this C.D. doesnt have the macabre and heavy feel that &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; had, it still has the same great feel and sticks to simply having fun and partying, which was what Metal was really all about.  This album also features some of Mick Mars' best guitar work, being he gives great solos on each track. If you like hard rock from the late 70s or 80s, you'll love this one.
B0001LJCMK|3.0|A music fan is a complete waste of man jam. You wouldn't know good music if it was sitting on your disfigured face. Ohhh yeah the CD is ok. Bare bones r'n'r mixed w/a little boogie woogie. It's a big stretch from J. Homme's other side projects, but it makes it sorrta sweeter.
B00008CLOA|5.0|this is great music. truly a masterpiece put out by a brilliant band. there was once great music like this...now that i'm 15 today's music sucks up the bung hole...take advantage of this one in a lifetime masterpiece and grab it before it's too late. this is really good music. i apologize for the crap that my generation is putting onto radio stations these days...support progressive rock bands like these and buy this album
B000060P79|1.0|Attention morons: &quot;Punk&quot; is a sound, not how the band dresses.  And these guys fail the definition on both counts.<br />Also, &quot;Perfect&quot; is one of the lamest cliche dung-logs of a song I've EVER heard.  EV-VER.  Suck suck suck.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Many who gave this movie a bad review were basing there review on their expectation that this was going to be a bloody action movie similar to vol. 1.  It's funny because this is where the story starts to unfold.  So if you sit there, not listening to a word thats being said and only paying attention to any blood thats shed, you will be bored. Many great movies are given bad reviews such as rosemary's baby, which is a 100% horror movie but people found it boring because they sat for two hours waiting for action. actions \\" speak louder than words\\" is a very inaccurate phrase. If you listen to whats being said you can find more action in kill bill 2  than you think.
B00005U122|1.0|Roger, get back with the Floyd. Your solo career is pathetic.
B000021XS0|5.0|This album and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence are my most favorite albums; these guys know how to make music.  This nice long \\"play\\" of a murder mystery is what helped get me into my ways of appreciating real rock and falling away from Blink 182 and Green day and all those bands I can't stand anymore.  Whenever I play this around my friends, number one: Regression, they think that I've gone wacked with this mental stress stuff.  But when Overture of 1928 comes on they like it.  John Petrucci on his Guitar, Mike Portnoy on his Drums, Jordan Rudess on his keyboard, John Myung on his Base Guitar, and James La-brie with his singing makes this a very successful album. These guys can do every level of rock, soft, hard, metal, medium. And they do it. I've gone to their concerts, and it's a blast watching these guys with their awesome talents.  I just can't get sick of them.  I give Dream Theater 5 out of 5.
B000089RVX|4.0|Just when i was getting tired of metal because all new bands come up with something thats been done before and sounds like any other rock gig. Well now there's evanescence, which contrary to some criticism is a band with a unique sound. Yeah sure, goths been doen before, But hasd it been done with a female vocalist at the helm. Thats what makes this a great band. Amy lee has soaring vocals which add another dimension to songs which already have depth and gothic lyrics. The cd opens with tracks like &quot;going uder&quot; and &quot;bring me to life&quot; two tracks which give goth rock new meaning. And tracks like &quot;hello&quot; and My Immortal add variation. Everything's been done right here, from the amazing vocals to the upbeat rythms of the songs and great sounding guitars. Evanescence surely brings much needed innovation and creativity which is found lacking in most of todays bands.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album expresses everything about rock.  Dream Theater can express pretty much every mood in music with just five expert musicians.  John Petrucci on his guitar blows me every time I listen to his solos.  This shoots right up with Scenes from a Memory, equally matched. When I first heard Glass Prison, I thought it was impossible to make such a combination. If you're interested in Dream Theater I recommend this album along with a few others.  The guys know how to make a good ballet; they've been doing it for about 12 years.  Their technicality and talent is one that's lead them to my absolute favorite band.  These guys brought out the way of Metal in this album, including the mixture of soft, hard, and medium level songs. Once again, I highly recommend this album to Metal and Rock fans.
0671027387|1.0|I assumed when I bought this book I was purchasing a novel with a story line that would entertain me along with stretching my imagination... you know ...a novel. Nope, not what I got!  What I got was a never ending, liberal bias view of his definition of any and all Republicans. His bias is both trite and infuriating. After less then 100 pages I threw the book out. I'm out eight bucks, but my gain was I now know to never buy another Dan Brown book.
B0000931QR|5.0|well , i have to say my favorite one is EL VIAJE DE COPPERPOT but this one is really awesome  greats songs and good lyrics , amaia and her powerful and beautiful voice including  the boys with all the mixes of sounds for the songs , very original , you won`t find music like this anywhere , it really worth your money!!
B00008EY65|5.0|As far as Comic book movies go, this was extremely well done. Del Toro did a marvelous job in bringing this to the big screen. Ron Pearlman was superb in the title role as Hellboy, just as Michael Keaton was to Batman. The plot was great, taken right from one of Mike Mignola's stories. This is pure escapism at it's best (as all comic book movies are). Just enjoy it for what it is. If you want to go further, just head to Borders and read a copy of any of Mike Mignola's Hellboy graphic novels for free (there are about 6 available). In closing, I really enjoyed the film and will buy the DVD, although I'm hoping for a directors cut extended version (I'm hoping they'll do one). Like I said, just enjoy it folks!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Let's hope Lucas changes his tune and includes the original versions at the last minute... maybe that's his plan... get the average joe excited about the DVDs, and then turn the rest of the fans rabid with an announcement a couple of weeks before the DVD release date.    Give me wires over bad CGI any day.  I won't watch these DVDs, rent them, or accept them as a gift.  I'll make due with the laserdiscs, and if they wear out, I think I've got the Little Golden Books with accompanying 45RPM records in the basement...
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is incredible , amazing . It doesn't happen very often one recording reachs so cosmic heights .<br />You may consider a simple account about this statement.<br />Think in I love Paris (Michel Legrand)(see my review) . In this case Davis is present in the recording session , and we are just talking about the supreme jewel of the instrumental music in any time . I mean , if I love Paris (made in 1954) reached this status (years before A kind of blue) , you must agree with me that Miles Davis owned the magic playing , moreover, the poetic level (and when I talk about poetry , I mean the greek sense of the term , which is creation ).<br />Specifically , Davis was a very illustrated man , with a strong introspective approach . The notes are there , but the scope is the difference , the velvet touch , the exact expressiveness and the precise instant in what the note must sound vibrato or languish . Davis played music as he would be making a film, writing a book  or painting , his trumpet was a brush , a pen or a script according the case .<br />Notice for instance the Davis sound . I mean Davis was original because he goes to the origin , and transforms the notes , making them &quot;sing&quot; . There are other examples in jazz such as Stan Getz in the saxophone , Wes Montgomery in the guitar or Bill Evans in the piano .<br />In Davis there was a deep sense of the expression and the wholeness meaning about jazz represents : this sense of freedom , and also a wide spectre of changing sensations , loneliness , happiness , sadness , anguish , desperation or seduction . This gradual sense of the tonal color about every note he played , you may find in the classical music giants , like Casals in the cello playing the Bach suites , Sandor Vegh conducting Mozart or Furtwangler conducting Beethoven or Bruckner , or Lipatti playing Chopin waltz . The sense of the expression and the real presence of commitment to achieve one specific sound and no other one.<br />A Kind of Blue will be a reference standard not only for many years but also centuries .<br />I have not any kind of doubt about that.be a reference standard not only for many years but also centuries . <BR>I have not any kind of doubt about that.
B00005JMYG|5.0|Awesome haliarious movie, I was crying most of the time!!! I would definityl recomend it to anyone and everyone.
1400034779|4.0|Smith underwrites in the most effective way, letting the characters take over the book, never imposing himself or manipulating. He manages to say so much about Africa without ever hitting it head-on. Really snuck up on me how much I liked this book.
B00005V1WO|4.0|I haven't seen any of Ken Russell's other works, but this one is the only one I need to see.  This interesting thing about this movie is how similar all of the characters look to their real-life counterparts, or at least their portraits, with the sole exception being Shelley.  Even without the fictional aspects being mixed in, the historical accounts of Percy and Mary, Claire, Polidori, and Byron are quite fascinating as well as entertaining in the movies, as evidenced by Haunted Summer.  But it was Coleridge who once coined the term &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;, and taking a compelling real-life account of how Mary Shelley came to write Frankenstein and mixing in generous elements of the fictitious in order to turn reality into a horror story can be fun indeed, especially when the story is capable of allowing you to suspend your disbelief.  And that's what this story does so wonderfully.  I remember loaning a copy of this movie to a friend many years ago, and then several days later she called me to express her disbelief that Polidori had drank a beeker filled with water and leeches.  But that's part of the lure of this film.  Fans of the account concerning the origins of the story Frankenstein might, if their imagination allows, truly enjoy this work of art.
1400032717|5.0|A straightforward, easy read that could appear at first glance to be simple--but it is actually skillfully rendered, an unblinking look at life through the eyes of someone who sees everything literally. . . the result is funny, sad, and extremely fresh. I felt such pathos for the narrator and related to him in more ways than I expected to. Raises profound questions about parenting, love, what it means to lead a life of 'value.'
B00004RYZT|4.0|Great DVD, Reaction to the editorial reviewers:<BR>Heirate mich means Marry me<BR>Du Hast means You Have. <BR>My english is not perfect but these misstakes are unforgiveble especially when you're referring to columbine.
B0000784XP|5.0|I immediately fell in love with this group the first time I listened to their songs &quot;High&quot; and &quot;Lifted&quot; from my friends. I have to say that to date this is my favorite &quot;Best of&quot; CD and Lighthouse Family CD that I own.   I own 2 of their CD's Postcards from Heaven and Ocean Drive.  The selections just superb and to me Lighthouse Family music is timeless.  I can play this CD anytime or as many times and I'll never get tired of it.  <br />This group is a diamond under the rough.  Especially here in the US, there's probably not very many people who have heard of the Lighthouse and they don't get as much airtime but I tell you once you hear them, no doubt you'll get hooked.
B00009W0WM|5.0|From the first frame of &quot;Casablanca&quot; you know you are about to watch something special.  There is not a moment in the film where you will find yourself bored or overwhelmed.  It is perfect in every way.  I have seen many films in my time and I am only 17.  I have an extensive collection of over 180 DVDs and this is by far my most prized.  I saw this film for the first time exactly one year ago and purchased this Two-Disc Special Edition the day it came out.  Not a day goes by when this film does not pop into my mind.<br />There are many movies but very few great films.  The few include Gone With the Wind, Wizard of Oz, Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's List, The Godfather, and, of course, the rarely seen Imitation of Life.  This is at the head of those.  It is at the head of all films.<br />&quot;Casablanca&quot; is about Rick (Humphrey Bogart), the owner of an American bar in Morroco, who is visited by Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), the object of a love affair in Paris a few years earlier.  She is accompanied by her husband (Paul Heinreid) who knows nothing of this but is only interested in acheiving two exit visas because they are both wanted.  What follows is the most romantic and thrilling film of all time.<br />The DVD transfer is nothing short of miraculous.  The film looks like it had been filmed today in B &amp; W.  Even the mono soundtrack sounds breathtaking.  The DVD does not shy away from some amazing special features.  I don't want to spoil them but anyone will find them interesting.  I promise you this is one of the finest DVD packages on the market.<br />So go out now and buy the film that recieved three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay; the film that was called the Second Greatest Film of All Time on the AFI's 100 Best List (it's second to Citizen Kane); and also called the Most Romantic Film of All Time by the AFI's 100 Most Romantic Films.<br />&quot;Play it again, Sam.&quot;
B00005LC1H|5.0|You are invited to the vist the worst-run hotel in England to enjoy a mixture of slapstick and word-wit. Each episode is based around the mental unravelling of the co-owner, Basil Fawlty, as his ill-conceived schemes spiral into the ground with the aid of his long suffering hapless helper Manuel.
B00005176F|5.0|My music-buff cousin bought this for me a few years ago as a birthday present. I listened to it and instantly loved the CD.  These songs give a general idea of what Blur is about with an eclectic mix of the hyper and dance-able (&quot;Song 2&quot; and &quot;Girls&amp;Boys&quot;) to the more tame and temperate(&quot;The Universal&quot; and &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot;), not to say that any of the songs by Blur lack substance.  To sum up, it is great music with a message and I highly recommend it. <br />*The second disc is a Live Blur Concert and gives you a taste of what they sound like in concert.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I loved this movie. Really, that's all that needs to be said. It is one of those films where you know there are flaws here and there, but it is so utterly engrossing and the tone is so perfect you forget that there are moments when there should have been more drama, but it was toned down for inexplicable reasons.    This is one of my shorter reviews, but really, there isn't much you can say except:    -Kate Hudson was mysteriously intoxicating. You believed every guy wanted her.  -Frances McDromand made you feel sorry for her despite some unnecessary strictness. And she was hilarious.  -If you find rock awesome (like I do), you'll appreciate this portrait of the genre, the bands and the fans, and what drives it all.  -The writing was often clever and involving, if a little on the lighter side (sometimes, not for the best).    There is nothing left to say except...well...have fun!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|\\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" is Sergio Leone's epic masterpiece.  While it is part of his Spaghetti Western Trilogy( all three films have different characters and plots), the film stands on its own and really shows you how good a movie can really be.  This movie has it all.  It has action, drama and even some comic relief in it.  It is a timeless classic that is unforgettable.  When I first saw it, I was a little kid and couldn't truly appreciate it as I can now at age 22.<br /><br />Blondie (The Man with No Name) isn't your typical good guy.  He mainly does things that suits his own agenda.  However, when compared to the murderous Angel Eyes and the greedy Tuco, Blondie is a saint.  This tale involves bloodshed, shoot-outs, search for treasure, and double-crossing.  And it all takes place while the Civil War is going on, which makes things a lot more \\"interesting\\" for the notorious three.  The West has never been wilder or more unpredictable than it is now.  With an incredible score, excellent acting, and superb story-telling, this is one memorable film that you will never forget.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, the first time I saw this was when I was a little kid.  When I just recently purchased this new edition of the movie, it truly was like I was watching it for the first time.  Coming from a guy who isn't a big fan of Westerns (I don't mind them, but I don't watch too many of them), I absolutely LOVED this film.  In fact, I wanted to give it a standing ovation when it was all said and done due to how moved I was by it.  This really is filmmaking at its finest.  I wasn't terribly impressed with Leone's \\"Once Upon a Time in America,\\" but he is absolutely flawless with this amazing and timeless Western.  It is slower than the second film (\\"For a Few Dollars More\\"), but I think that makes this all the better.  The build up of tension is much more present in this film, and you really get the sense that these characters are real people.  Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are brilliant in their roles, and a lot of props need to go to Lee Van Cleef as he is absolutely chilling in his role.<br /><br />This new edition really does the film the justice it deserves.  The film has been restored to the director's original vision as much as possible, giving you an extra 18 minutes.  You will notice the added scenes as the voices have been re-dubbed (the first time you will notice this will throw you, as I think that specific part has the worst re-dubbing, but the other added scenes are done a lot better, even if you still notice it).  The picture looks incredible and the sound is great.  Extras included are commentary from Richard Schickel, a couple of documentaries and featurettes, poster gallery, deleted scenes and the original theatrical trailer.  Along with the nice packaging, you get an 8-page booklet that includes pictures from the film along with Roger Ebert's most recent review of the film.  And, you get some mini-posters included inside the packaging as well.  A superior edition of the movie, without question.<br /><br />\\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" is a pure triumph in filmmaking and should be seen by everybody at least once.  Don't let the fact that this is a Western throw you.  I think this can be enjoyed by everybody, and even by those who are not big fans of Westerns.  A film filled with authentic emotion and action, this is one that shouldn't be missed by anyone.  I LOVE this movie, and I cannot express that enough. -Michael Craned Eli Wallach are brilliant in their roles, and a lot of props need to go to Lee Van Cleef as he is absolutely chilling in his role.

B000002J6H|5.0|It was the beginning of a new decade and, as Dickens wrote &quot;it was best of times, it was the worst of times,&quot; CSN&amp;Y has made it clear there would no more &quot;Deja Vu&quot;s and it was impossible not to be sad as having such stunning encounter of four songwriting talents stop their four-way magic at one single album.<br />And then there were four solo beauties -except for Young's &quot;After the Gold Rush,&quot; first albums for Crosby, Nash and Stills- that returned a smile to many of our grieving faces.<br />Although if compared to his feuding amigos I would not rate Stephen Still first solo recording the best of all four, there's nothing here that could not be considered absolutely impeccable.<br />Furthermore, as musical breadth goes, this album show unequivocally Stills' capacity and deep understanding of what Rock was becoming and practically every well it drunk from.<br />And everything it's realized perfectly, the soaring chorus and sweeping organ of \\"Love The One You're With;\\" the Gospel beauty of \\"Church\\" and \\"To A Flame;\\" \\"Old Times Good Times,\\" where Stills trades licks with Hendrix himself; the horns launching \\"Cherokee\\" into its own outer space, the sensuous cadence of \\"Sit Yourself Down;\\" the tequila-soaked blues of \\"Black Queen;\\" the quiet folk of wisdom of \\"We Are Not Helpless\\" ...<br />Well, you definitely get the picture. This is Stills' solo masterpiece, a work of such greatness that made his follow-up solo recordings -very good albums indeed- impossible to match it. Perhaps Manassas' debut is the only other album Stills put out -then as a band leader again- that can be compared to this one.<br />This is an album that belongs in any serious Rock worshipper's CD collection, not because of its possible historical significance nor any prior sentimental attachment to those times, but exclusively on the strength of its musical content, as relevant and soulful today as thirty-odd years ago.
0618526412|5.0|I was disturbed to read so many negative reviews of Carson McCullers' The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter. This book is one of the finest works of literature in the American canon. Oprah's bookclub has lately been doing the admirable work of resurrecting old classics - McCullers WAS, in fact, quite the sensation among her contemporaries. I feel that Heart' is the book around which all of McCuller's other pieces orbit. I'll agree with a few other reviewers in saying that this is not an action book, it is not &quot;funny train station&quot; literature, and the impetus is psychological, and often quite intangible. <br />As a master's degree student in writing at Sarah Lawrence College, I love this book. As a high school student, I adored it. People picking up something for fluffy entertainment value should probably not read this book. People looking to experience a different kind of life, to read a beautifully written social commentary, to experience psychological empathy pertaining to the human condition...those people should read this book. <br />It's great writing. Don't bash it because it's not your type of reading material.<br />To drive my point into the ground, people who enjoy authors in the vein of Flannery O'Connor, Katherine Anne Porter, Tennessee Williams, Anne Tyler, Annie Proulx, Katherine Dunn, William Faulkner, Harper Lee, possibly Jeanette Winterson...these readers, and readers looking for great literature, should sample Carson McCullers.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|**1/2 In the wheezingly old-fashioned \\"Mona Lisa Smile,\\" Julia Roberts joins the ranks of Robert Donat, Glenn Ford, Sidney Poitier, Sandy Dennis, Robin Williams, Edward James Olmos, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kevin Kline, all of whom have played inexperienced teachers who manage to win over and inspire their initially recalcitrant students.  It matters not whether these pupils are hardened inner city gang types or snooty prep school geniuses, the arc of the story is always the same.  The teacher, armed with a sense of optimism and a zeal to \\"make a difference\\" in the students' lives, arrives at the institution nervous and unsure of whether she is really up to the challenge (or \\"he\\" in the case of many of these films).  After a predictably disastrous start, in which the students belittle her idealism and efforts and attempt to take advantage of her inexperience, the teacher invariably throws out the standard, stuffy, boring curriculum and finds a way to make learning relevant, fun and engaging.  This, of course, makes her the most popular teacher at the school, but also a threat to the ossified educational establishment, which throws up endless roadblocks in an effort to keep this know-it-all upstart from upsetting the applecart.  Undeterred, the teacher manages to get down to the students' level, rapping with them as if she were one of their own, helping to solve their problems and inspiring them to take their rightful place in society as freethinking, morally upstanding individuals.  Then comes the inevitable moment when the teacher must decide, midway through the term, whether or not she will be returning for the next semester, with the student who gave the teacher the most trouble at the start pleading with her to stay on and work her magic for generations of students to come. All of this invariably culminates in a tear-soaked finale wherein all the students gather in worshipful adoration of this almost godlike embodiment of Learning.  A number of the movies that have utilized this storyline have been quite good, actually, but \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is not one of them.  By bringing nothing particularly new to the formula, the film can't help feeling derivative and clich&eacute;d. Where is Miss Jean Brodie when we really need her?<br />\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" begins in 1953 with Katherine Anne Watson's arrival as an art history instructor at Wellesley College.  The school, as it turns out, is a haven for elite snobs - and its educational philosophy of rote, tradition-bound learning shows that the school is more concerned with turning the girls into dutiful, supportive wives and mothers than freethinking career women (the only classes we ever see the girls attending are art history, Italian, table setting and synchronized swimming, not exactly a rigorous course of study for a bunch of young ladies we are led to believe graduate with some pretty impressive degrees).  Enter Katherine Anne, fresh from a state school in \\"liberal\\" California, who clearly does not buy into the false value system she finds here.  After some initial resistance on the part of the girls and the powers-that-be at the institution, Katherine begins, slowly but surely, to win people over to her modernistic, iconoclastic way of thinking.<br />As a social document, \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is yet another film dedicated to exposing the \\"Stepford Wife\\" mentality of the conformist 1950's.  The problem is that \\"Far From Heaven\\" did a much better job of that two years ago.  In that film, the main character experienced a gradual awakening as to both her value as an individual and the societal prison in which she lived.  During the course of the film, we grew along with her.  Katherine, on the other hand, feels like a 21st Century woman transported magically to the 1950's.  Not that there weren't such forward-looking women at the time, of course, but it's not very illuminating watching a person, spouting ideas no one in the audience could possibly disagree with, bringing knowledge and enlightenment to the ignorant masses. The acting is good but the characters are all either shallow stereotypes or straw men designed for Katherine to knock down easily.  Ironically, the film is every bit as conventional as the conformity it's railing against.<br />Now that Ms. Roberts has gotten the Messianic Teacher Syndrome out of her system, perhaps she can move on to bigger and better things.

B000003TAW|5.0|In a magical era of music history, when grunge had conquered the universe, WEEZER seemed to fall softly and solidly into place as an undeniable staple of 90's rock.  The Blue Album revolutionized the mainstream music industry, swerving the idea of `coolness' from sadly suicidal to humorously honest, somehow making the genre `fun' again.  And from the almost boyish vocals of Rivers Cuomo to the playful basslines and venomously addictive guitar hooks filling the album, it's safe to say that WEEZER has also managed to create one of the most enjoyable albums ever recorded.<br />The playful tone of the album is swiftly set with that AWESOME opening song, \\"My Name Is Jonas\\", which arrests a brilliant guitar melody with those trademark madly-catchy vocals from Rivers.  It's a great song that nearly everyone on the planet has heard, I'm sure.  Other songs that have infested the radio over the years include my favorite track \\"Undone-the Sweater Song\\", which contains one of the GREATEST choruses ever, as well as that pumping king-of-all-geek-anthems, \\"Buddy Holly\\".  \\"Say It Ain't So\\" also adds a great vocal point on the album, which could also be said for \\"Holiday\\", a song that sounds like a remnant of the 50's musical era.<br />Other standout tracks include possible the stupidly greatest love song ever written, \\"Only In Dreams\\".  With lines like \\"She's in the air, in between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide . . .\\", who could even dream of disputing it!?!  THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!!!!  \\"Surf Wax America\\" and \\"In the Garage\\" are also among my favorites, with slow, thoughtful, churning idiocy that make my ears bleed with joy every time I give'em a listen.<br />Obviously, if you have NOT heard of this album, something is seriously wrong with the alignment of the planets and must be remedied by obtaining and listening as loud and as long as inhumanly possible.  This truly is an album of a lifetime, a magical and special plastic tool used to unlock the endless questions of an impossible human existence.  If you ever want catchy, fun, and oh-so-true songs of the geeky human soul, than this album is a mandatory requirement.<br />And as the WEEZ once said, \\"If the music's too loud, turn it down\\".impossible human existence.  If you ever want catchy, fun, and oh-so-true songs of the geeky human soul, than this album is a mandatory requirement.<br />And as the WEEZ once said, \\"If the music's too loud, turn it down\\".
B0000X2EOW|5.0|Rather than relying on modern cinematics and special effects, Labyrinth instead relies on the talent and imagination of it's creators.  It combines the talents of Set Designer M.C. Eshcher, Producer and Director, the infamous Jim Henson, and of course, the talented fantasy artist and designer Brian Froud.  This combination creates an absolutely fun, and magic filled journey through the naivete of childhood that can be shared by the young and old alike.<br />Jeniffer Conolly is superp as Sarah, and David Bowie even more superb as Jareth, The Goblin King.  The casting couldn't have been more perfect, as both artists became legends in their own right in that their appeal has lasted through the decades, and so, has the film.  It remains a cult classic.<br />If anything, the lack of special effects has made it's appeal even more undeniable, as it cannot be dated.  Too many times has it occured with films that as speical effects develop, the films lose their appeal.  As the film relies on the fantastic nature of not only the genre, but the spectacular muppetry, the film retains it's beauty, despite it's simplistic cinematics...<br />A must see for all lovers of the fantsy genre...and of course Jim Henson or David Bowie fans...
B0000214F0|1.0|Every fan of movies should be forced to watch Caligula as an ascetic exercise at least once.  For only in discovering how bad cinema can be are we able to fully appreciate how good it can be.  And the good news is that the film has a message- absolute power corrupts absolutely!  That is the end of the good news.<br />As an historical drama, Caligula completely fails to capture any sense of time and place.  While some of the scenes depicted (such as the Emperor Tiberius swimming with his \\"little fishes\\") are based on historical sources, it seems as though it could have taken place on Mars.  The sets and costumes are incredibly garish or silly, sacrificing any suspension of disbelief.  The camera work is amateurish- it zips around, losing its subject, and often delivering an unclear picture due to what seems to be inadequate lighting or a failure to focus on the subject.  The picture is grainy throughout and tough on the eyes.<br />As an \\"artistic\\" hard core porno flick, Caligula is boring and not the slightest bit titillating.  The sexuality is displayed between frequent and extremely gruesome acts of violence (the multitude of which I will not catalogue here, suffice it to say the movie should not be watched while eating).  Also, when trying to advance the plot (if Caligula has one), the hard core scenes are exasperating in their ability to delay the progression and break down whatever narrative quality the film might have had.<br />Other reviews speak adequately as to the story of how this train wreck of a movie occurred, so I won't go into it.  I can suggest, however, that you will likely never see such an A-list cast in such an awful movie ever again.  The included documentary is laughable- Guccione is really convinced he is making a truly important film, and the casting reflects that.<br />Now, the only dramatic alternative I know of to Caligula that covers the same period is \\"I, Claudius\\".  While Claudius runs 668 minutes and Caligula runs 155, I can guaranteeyou that the latter seems to go on much longer; forever, in fact.  You emerge from viewing it wondering what in the world you just watched, and whether or not viewing a film can actually make you a less noble person.  But I know you are curious... so have at it, just remember you were warned!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Before I got this album. I had never heard a real Beatles song. I had heard a modern hard-rock-style cover of A Hard Day's Night (which, while not comparing to the origional, was still awesome), and in my vocal class at school, I sang A Hard Day's Night (which, by the way, made me something of a singing sensation at school; people everywhere were asking me to sing for them).<br />When I first got this album, I liked about sixteen songs. But as I listened to it more and more, the more it grew on me, until I liked every single song on the CD.<br />This CD made me a total Beatles fan. Before I really knew the Beatles' music, I listened to country music on KNCI (which I still do admittedly). Now, I listen to the Eagle, Sacramento's classic rock. In my vocal class, instead of just singing A Hard Day's Night (which I still sing, of course), I also sing Eight Days A Week, Something-the best song of all time-, I Want to Hold Your Hand, All You Need Is Love, and She Loves You.<br />The Beatles remain the greatest band of all time, and this CD is a true legacy to them.
B00005JNA2|4.0|I have only read an interesting article on \\"Before Sunset\\" where I learned that it's a sequel to \\"Before Sunrise\\". The idea that two strangers met and had a brief yet powerful encounter and finally is reuniting after 9 years perked my interest. I decided to check it out. Having no expectations except a good review, the movie opened with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) talking about his new book. Then a stream of conversations exchanged between him and Celine (Julie Delpy) follows with no end and slowly the characters unveiled and their past revealed. I very much enjoyed the conversations, some stimulating, some funny, some simply flirting and yet there are also serious moments and then there are things that have no real purposes except to share with each other. The conversations seem so real and the characters can be people around us. Through the endless conversations, there were no physical intimacy, not even a kiss, but their emotional connection was so powerful that they continue to share their thoughts and not willing to part. Love without physical intimacy isn't complete, but love without emotional bonding isn't love at all. In \\"Before Sunrise\\" (I have not seen it and plan to see it soon), the characters have found the attraction so great that they fell in love, I think in \\"Before Sunset\\", they really built up the emotional bonding and thus make their love even more stronger. And both actors did a wonderful job in portraying the awkwardness, the uncertainties, the longings, the regrets, the anger and ended with the last scene where the chemistry between the two were escalated to the highest point in the movie, then the movie ended, leaving the viewer feeling exactly the same way as the characters, contradicted with powerful feelings and difficult decisions ahead of them.<BR>A wonderful movie I thoroughly enjoy, but I do agree with some reviewers that if you are not up to endless conversations without much action happening, this may be not your cup of tea.
0676973779|3.0|I had read so much praises about this book that I was expecting something brilliant. The beginning contains a lot of humour, but is overall very slow. I would say that the book is divided into two parts: Before the ship accident, when Pi is in India, and after. I was very disappointed, because I saw no connection between these two parts, especially after having fought through the first part. There is no mention of religion anymore in the second part, so I didn't understand why it was such a big thing at the beginning. I agree on the fact that this book is original and unique, but in the end, I was disappointed. Maybe I am not the reader to enjoy this new sort of book! I would still suggest to try it.
0451529308|5.0|The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture.  Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death.  This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters.  My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on.  It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women.
0446310786|5.0|Thanks to readers' suggestions that I found on amazon.ca, I started to read this book and I finished it in about 4 days! It is an amazing book, well worth all the praises that it received. Everyone can read it (English is not my first language) and the characters are very touching. However, I was surprised to observe that the story was relatively &quot;soft&quot;. I had read many other books about segregation and racial intolerance where aweful things happened, with many details, that maid me really cry. This book touched me deeply, without terrifying me as much as others did. The debate about more racial tolerance and humanity is still up-to-date in my point of view... This story could still apply in the 21st century, if we changed the setting and the characters. Sadly.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Hm, I'm not exactly sure what to say that hasn't already been said about this CD. It is Converge's best release by far. It's technical, dynamnic, emotional, chaotic, and experimental. So many of those adjectives are things hundreds of hardcore and metal bands strive to achieve, but can never accomplish (let alone tightly packed into one CD). I guess it was inevitable for them to turn out something this epic, as the band has been gradually maturing for over a decade. Honestly, the only fault I can find is that they will have a near impossible time topping it.<br />On a lesser note, Converge has been getting much more exposure, likely due to their signing with Epitaph. With more exposure comes a more diverse crowd of listeners. If you are not used to more unmelodic and abrasive music, you might want to steer clear of this release. As much as I love it, I can't say it's for everyone. I think the review previous to mine illustrates this well.
B00007AJF9|3.0|Elizabeth is a well acted and entertaining movie, with some very well done performances and is visually stunning.  The problem is that the writers decided to change so many events, that it ends up unnecessarily distorting the actual history.<br />To see a factual, well-acted, and still superb movie of the same era, get the 1971 film &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot; with Vanessa Redgrave.  Not only does this follow the actual events, but the drama of 2 queens battling for power is so forcibly played that you can watch it over and over
B0001UL7RY|3.0|When I bought this cd I didn't really know what to expect. Her first cd was really good at first and then after a while it got really boring hearing the same old songs again. But in the end, I am really glad I bought it. Here's what I think about each song. Hope this helps you guys out when trying to decide if you should buy this or not.<br />1. Take Me Away - This song is okay. I liked it at first, but after a while you start to think about the lyrics and you're just like what in the heck is she talking about??<br />2. Together - Once again, this one is just okay. The first two songs just aren't that good.<br />3. Don't Tell Me - I love this song. It honestly will never get old to me. The lyrics are so awesome and so many girls can relate to them.<br />4. He Wasn't - This song reminds me of one that would be on her first cd. It's more little girlish then the rest of the cd. But it's still a good song and it's fun to rock out to.<br />5. How Does It Feel - This song makes no sense and it's annoying. It seems like she says the same thing over and over again.<br />6. My Happy Ending - One of my favorite songs on the cd, this song is great. And so many people can relate to it, because everyone has felt like what they thought was going to be their forever turned out not to be. And that's exactly what this song is aboud and i adore it.<br />7. Nobody's Home - At first I didn't like this song, but now I love it. The lyrics are very deep and I dunno. I just really enjoy this song.<br />8. Forgotten - I didn't like this one much either when I first bought the cd, but I warmed up to it after a while and now i love it.<br />9. Who Knows - My favorite song on the whole cd. It's just wonderful!! When you're down this is the best song to put on and just jump around your room and listen to. The lyrics really put me in a happy place.<br />10. Fall To Pieces - I love this song. It's a love song with a twist and it's just amamzing.<br />11. Freak Out - This song is okay. It's not asgood as some of the other songs on the cd, but I can listen to it without hitting the next button.<br />12. Slipped Away - This is for her grandfather who passed away. I lost my grandfather about 6 years ago and hadn't really thought a lot about it recently and then I bought this cd and before i even read that it was for her grandfather it reminded me of him. I instently started crying and this song just blew me away. It's amazing.<br />I give this cd 3 out of 5 stars. It's better then her first cd, but i think she still has better in her. Hopefully her next cd will have a couple of better songs on it.
B0000CFW87|3.0|I expected to see some variety in Josh Groban's second solo album, but I was disappointed. Even with French and Irish tunes exploited, still they were arranged in the same style and therefore sound very much the same, plus the over producing, in the end it is Josh Groban debut all over again. Some tracks, had they been produced simpler, could retain more individuality and the beauty that comes with it. Having said this, I think Josh Groban has obviously put more of himself into the singing, and we now hear more of his high register. His \\"Caruso\\" is good, although really not in the same league as Andrea Bocelli.
B0000509BZ|5.0|HIGHLANDER was undoubtedly among the best of the medieval/fantasy/Dungeons and Dragons sort of movies that proliferated in the 1980s. The choice of the brooding Christopher Lambert was perfect for the part of the Highlander, Conner MacLeod. There is a quiet intensity to his acting, and it works well here. Sean Connery, as his mentor and fellow-immortal, Ramirez strikes just the right balance of swashbuckling and seriousness. His acting is perfect. (So what else is new?)<br />For me, however, Clancy Brown's Kurgan steals the film. His physical features and bug-eyed grin are dead perfect! And his way over-the-top performance, at times, makes you a little afraid of his character, but he makes you laugh, as well. The confrontation between Kurgan and Conner in a church is a great balance of wit and tension.<br />The battles in Scotland, at the beginning of the film, and the mayhem in the streets of New York City at the end are priceless. My favorite moment: Kurgan steals a car and takes Conner's love interest for a ride. As he careens through the potholes and traffic, he quietly sings &quot;New York, New York&quot;. Now I know where all our cabdrivers take their lessons from. HIGHLANDER is a great piece of quality mind candy that actually tackles some deep issues.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Sounds like the angry young men grew up and reached their goals.  All the rage and angst is gone - and so is the impact of their music.  Blah.  No offense to Hahn - but give it up and go back to the turntables.
B000000W6X|2.0|The only thing I got out of listening to the title track, Protection, is fleeting remembrances of the movie The Bodyguard.  This was not a good film.  I am a great admirer of Tracey Thorne's voice and, as I said elsewhere, would listen to her sing the phone book; but this is not the phone book.  This is teenage emotionalizing.  Though I resonate with the idea of self-sacrifice, the whole point of self-sacrifice is to actually DO it, not to talk about how you would or should or might do it should the situation arise.  The track is basically like listening to somebody saying, &quot;You know, I'd like totally run in front of a bus to save somebody, knowwhamsain?&quot;  The whole point of self-sacrifice is that it is difficult to do.  It certainly is not difficult to talk about doing, though.  I don't know Tracey Thorne, but I am not really uplifted by the thought of her hypothetically jumping in front of someone to take a bullet for them.
B000084T18|2.0|I'm not a big fan of 50 Cent, but I can tolerate this CD. The reason it gets 2 1/2 stars is because the CD gets old and repetitive, but it's tolerable. ALl 50 Cent really raps about is street violence and being the best. I can't really hate 50 Cent, because he dissed Ja Rule, which made him stop making more irritating music. It's bullcrap that 50's getting so much hype from the media and the so-called fans. How the hell could this CD sell more than Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle? I'm sure some of you remember when Vanilla Ice was cool. Then people started thinking he sucked (which he did anyway.) That's probably how 50's career will end. Everybody has to take MTV seriously on what's cool and what's not. Half the reason 50 Cent gets so much attention is because he got shot nine times. Too bad none of the bullets were fatal, then I could have saved $10.
B00006CXXU|5.0|There are few cd's out there that you can sit down and listen to all the way through.  You know... most cd's have particular songs on them you like and you skip the rest.  Stripped, however, is not one of those cd's.  Every song on the album has a distinct sound, beat, and mood.  It's never boring. Christina truly has come a long way from her first cd and I feel she's put out an album that really showcases her talents as an artist and how she's matured musically. I truly love this cd and I don't know anyone who's given it a chance that hasn't liked it.  Christina has staying power and Stripped is the proof.  I highly recommend that you buy this cd because you won't be disappointed.  Despite the crazy image Christina sometimes puts out she is one of the best artists out there right now and Stripped is worthy of our praise.  My personally faves are Can't Hold Us Down, Walk Away, Infatuation, Cruz, The Voice Within, I'm Ok (the raw emotion! wow)Beautiful....ah, what am I doing?  They ALL rock! Have fun!
B00006GA4C|3.0|Well some people must think that I am crazy to say something like that, but well, the album does not have real highlights (with of course the notable exception of Inside Looking Out, which actually is a cover from the Animals). The recording does not sound very well to today's standards, in other words it sounds real dated. There are not really classics in this album. If you are looking for GFR's best, take my advice and choose another album instead.
0790729342|5.0|This is quite possibly the greatest MAN movie ever made.  Cars, guns, blood, exploding heads.  I can't even begin to say how much I love this movie.  It is truly a fantastic spectacle and the best sequel I've ever seen.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When I first saw previews for this movie when I saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I immediately thought that &quot;great if ashton retard is in it it will suck&quot;, man was I wrong.  This movie was one of the greatest movies I have seen with some terrific acting and casting calls, I felt for the kid in the movie and even for ashton when he grows up in it. This is the best movie, and with the dvd you can see the alternate ending which is astonishing. great movie after wards you will hate watching &quot;punk'd&quot; and any other show or movie where ashton kutcher is a retard (all of them)
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I must say that this album kicks butt. Not only am i impressed by the lyrics and beats, which astounded me even more on how fluent these girls are at english and russion, but the fact that these girls dont give a $hit about what other people think. One thing that puzzled me though was why Japans album got bonus tracks, but not europes or the US one.
B00006879E|3.0|OK this is not a perfect cd, but perfect for people who buy cds because of the first a second singles. What I mean by that is it's obvious that &quot;This Love&quot; did what &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; couldn't do; it pushed the album to success. People obviously bought the album for that song only, and they all recieved a big return because the majority of the album sounds just like the single &quot;This Love. That will please irregular cd buyers who occasionally purchases cds for the first or second single, basically, the hit single. Well for me it isn't what I wanted it to be. . . .<br />True all the songs are well crafted and the lead singer has the most beautiful male voice I've ever heard, for right now. But I wish the cd had more songs like &quot;She Will Be Loved.&quot; Yes, the funk/pop/rock was brilliant, but the lack of ballads is what killed the cd for me. Well not killed, but I wouldn't be buying it when there are only a couple of songs that catches my attention, and one of them blow the rest out of the water . . .&quot;She Will Be Loved.&quot; But this is one of the best rock/pop cds I heard in a long time. Here are some of the cds that are my favorite rock/pop cds to listen to in the past 2 years:<br />1. John Mayer (Heavier Things) This is by far the best pop/rock cd in the last two years. His voice may not compare to the finesse of Maroon 5's lead singer, but the song selection on this album is to die for. I believe their are a lot of John Mayer fans . . .if not, buy this I Love This CD.<br />2. Keane - I don't remember the name of this album but all of the songs are good. This cd. isn't for people who likes more upbeat songs than ballads on an album, but it's damn near well done. <br />3. Mew (Fringers) This cd. is beautiful. As well as Maroon 5 the lead singer has a very unique voice. The song selection is good too. Again, this isn't for someone who likes an upbeat pop/rock album over ballads.<br />4. Mae (Destination: Beautiful) I love this album too. It's my second favorite. All of the songs are good. It's a shame that they get no airplay or airtime.<br />5. Sigur Ros () - This album is atmospheric, but superb. Trust me it's a sleeper, but a must buy. It's worth the price for something new. Just listen to &quot;Untitiled 4&quot; which is really called &quot;Njosnavelin&quot; in some cases.<br />If you don't believe me about all of these albums just go to CD Universe where you can listen to all of the song clips from the entire albums . . .but buy from Amazon.com if interested . . Trust, nothing compares to their service.<br />This cd is worth the purchase, but it isn't what I would have liked it to be. If their were more songs like &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; then this cd would have been a must buy. This cd isn't for everyone, but it's a good cd though. I reccomend at least a listen before reviewing it. I don't buy singles so I guess I'll have to download the song &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; instead. I might buy the album in the future because this is like the most popular pop/rock album that's out right now. Trust me I'm sure this album will get a couple Grammy nods, maybe even album of the year, because so far, this year we have seen some very average if not bad albums. I'm sure I'm not the only one that agrees that &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; is the best single on the album. GOD I love how that guy sings.<br />Bottomline, wish it had more ballads, but it's a damn good album.

B000002LMK|5.0|In the first chapter of the grunge and garage Bible, it is written that Neil told his followers to turn the amps up to 11.  But master, said his disciples, &quot;the amps only go to 10&quot;. When they looked back down, the amps had miraculously been turned way past 10.  In the next chapter, Neil told his disciples to lay down a mostly country music style backbeat, and they did. But, the scripture from the gospel according to Neil that is most widely quoted among those preaching his gospel to this day is the one where he proclaimed &quot;You will play till your fingers bleed, and then you will play some more!!&quot;.  Make no mistake, this is the holy scripture of any band that even has a remote connection to garage or grunge.  While there are many musicians preaching the scripture according to Neil today, no one will ever be able to replicate the feeling of Ragged Glory. It will stand as a testament for generations to come on how massive double lead electric guitar rock is supposed to sound. This CD may sit in the CD stack unplayed for periods at a time, but it's always going to sound glorious, just as the title implies.  There isn't a bad song on the album. You'll be looking for that proverbial &quot;11&quot; on your stereo too.
0679745203|5.0|My in laws took us to see the film when it played at the Rialto in South Pasadena. The cinematography was beautiful but the movie was missing substenance. It felt like someone had taken a wonderful story and shreaded it. A couple weeks after seeing the film I ran across a copy of the book at the Book House (an excellent used book shop if you're ever in South Pasadena). I bought the copy and read the book in one or two settings. I LOVED the book. The movie then came to life for me in my mind with the book filling in the details.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|is he mad?  or is life just nuts?  pretty shallow.<br />important elements are<br />key: &quot;how long have i been asleep?&quot;  &quot;the whole movie.&quot;<br />repeated reference to the last temptation of christ (as a horror film in a kentucky-fried christian town), a replay of  hallucinatory time-travel and alternative future in dialogue with the devil at the moment of death, in a mickey-mouse version of christ's choice in his last temptation<br />mock allusion to elements of christ's life <BR>- donnie's denunciation of a false priest, and subsequent persecution<br />increasingly magical life events, confronted by <BR>- the inevitability of isolated death (roberta sparrow's demented loss of both fear and love (of god) which are inseparable and lost together) <br />- the sudden finality of death (donnie chooses either himself, or else gretchen, both in a deus ex machinae mode). <br />good ideas, but needs some mature reorganisation and representation
B00006AW2J|5.0|To the person who wrote the Stones were poking fun at &quot;let it be&quot; (with their masterpiece &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;) Only one problem - LET IT BLEED was out BEFORE &quot;let it be&quot;
B000050FEN|1.0|I'm obviously in a minority here. But IMO the movie just sucked. The thing that irritated me throughout the movie was the darkness and by that I mean the absense of light. The lighting is artificially dimmed for effect and it just doesn't work. Nobody works and lives in such poor light. The black and white film noirs work beautifully, but this movie seems stage-managed. Amongst contemporary movies, the lighting in &amp;quot;Dark City&amp;quot; was very natural and fit in well with the theme of the movie. This is a one gimmick movie and it got old within the first 5 minutes. I count this, along with &amp;quot;Absolute Power&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Behind Enemy Lines&amp;quot; as amongst the worst 10 movies I have seen.
B00000DR5I|5.0|Tangerine Dream followed their masterpiece Phaedra (see my review) with Rubycon, an album that is just as beautiful. The two works share numerous traits: an emphasis on vast and free soundscapes rather than on tightly constructed songs, the inclusion of perpetually morphing sequenced basses, and a calm, flute-driven conclusion. Rubycon does introduce several new constituents in the Tangerine Dream canon. 'Part 2' in particular shows the influence of some of Gyorgy Ligeti's music (used by Kubrick in 2001): it begins with dense, swirling mellotron and synth parts which echo Ligeti's sound clusters, and they gradually melt into a mystical chant of modulating voices. (Incidentally, the titles of two Ligeti pieces, 'Atmospheres' and 'Apparitions', would be very adequate subtitles to 'Part 1' and 'Part 2', respectively.) It is impossible not to think of 2001 while listening to Rubycon, because this music irrestibly evokes the mysterious and ineffable. Both 17-minute sections are remarkably coherent and sustained works, filled with detailed interlocking episodes. A sublime album.

B00008YLV2|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than this. I've seen this film 4 times &amp; it never ceases to astound me. The acting is exceptional, Ridley Scott is directing here at the peak of his powers &amp; Pietro Scalia should have received an Oscar for the outstanding editing job. The film itself functions more like a rocket ride than just a war film. The word visceral comes to mind. Violent? Frightening? Absolutely! But to demonstrate the true impact of war, for the soldiers &amp; for us, there is no alternative. I noticed a fellow customer said this film is better than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; am I the only one who noticed the huge hole in that film's storyline? Move over THREE KINGS, FULL METAL JACKET, THE THIN RED LINE...BLACK HAWK DOWN may just be the greatest war film ever made. Why? Because a war film isn't just bullets &amp; the terrible death of comrades. Ridley Scott has shown us the true horror. I know it will haunt my dreams......
B00003CXCT|4.0|Over twenty years ago, George Lucas created the StarWars trilogy and changed the way we thought of movies.  The saga was completely diffrent from the previous movies of its age as both special effects and story drove people to watch the films countless times in movie theaters over and over again.  These movies truely defined a generation of movie goers back then and are still classic films now.<br />With the birth of the DVD format, fans were sending out countless requests to Lucasfilm for DVD versions of these films and after years of waiting, Lucasfilm has given in and will finally release the films on DVD.<br />Most reviews I have seen on this website by \\"fans\\" has been completely and utterly annoying.  Some claim that Lucas just \\"doesnt get it\\" by altering his classic films.  Were they perfect the first time?  Of course, but that was over 20 years ago.  For those who argue that changing film history is wrong, throughout the course of film history films have seen slight alterations as the years passed with whole scenes being removed or changed.  \\"The Shining\\" by Stanley Kubrick had most of the original ending changed after its first week at the box office, but fans who have seen the altered product feel that its better.  Those who argue that Lucas has \\"raped\\" their childhood memories by altering these films are just looking for reasons to dislike the man because they feel that the prequels havent measured up to thier name sakes. Hell, the film was changed as far back as as its original release as Han Solo's girlfriend Jenny was removed from the bar scene.<br />In the end, the films are the same story you enjoyed.  A farm boy becomes a knight, a princess becomes a warrior, a rogue finds something to believe in, and a father finds redemption.  Lucas could put in Luke Skywalker cutting grass on Yavin before going off to do battle against the Deathstar and its still the same story.  Altering the lighting during a lightsaber battle....putting in another actor to replace one who was in the film a total of 1 minute....altering dilogue to help it better fit the prequels?  In the end, its your choice on if your going to pick up these DVDs, but to give the films a rating of 1 out of 5 stars because you dont like the changes, it makes you wonder if those same people are actual fans or just LOTR fans trying to trash the competition.
1400034779|4.0|This book was a light read but an enjoyable one.  The story is of  Precious Ramotswe, a &quot;traditional&quot; African woman in size but &quot;untraditional&quot; in her ambitions.  She opens Botswana's first ladies detective agency.  Her character is strong, has high morals and when it comes to the truth she is refreshingly blunt.  Her frankness and matter of factness had me laughing out loud sometimes.  The book is set up in a way where the first part describes her father's life, her life, and a bit of history on Africa.  The rest of the book is set up in a format where it's short chapters on her cases.  These aren't suspenseful cases with twists and turns like you would find in a mystery novel, but they are more simple and quickly resolved.  This isn't a book were the plot thickens and evolves.  It remains pretty constant in its plot, speed, and energy level.  I suggest sitting down in the bookstore and reading the first 20 pages.  If you enjoy it then you'll enjoy the rest of the book.  If you don't enjoy it then don't read it as it doesn't change much throughout the rest of the book.  This was a different read than I normally choose but I still enjoyed it.  Its perfect summer reading!  I will definitely be reading the rest of the series.
0446677450|5.0|Man, that John T. Reed is really emotional. I can't believe he takes it that seriously. I read all three of those reviews, and I think they skimmed over the surface of the book ready to hate the man writing the book. I'd never even heard of the series, I just saw it on the library shelf and thought I'd read it. The book is pretty corny, but under the corniness is a lot of interesting conversation about pursuing a proper education in business and finance. Those articles are actually misrepresenting the book, as they all imply that he is &quot;making it sound easy&quot; or &quot;telling people not to get an education&quot; - when actually that is precisely what he is suggesting.<br /><br />He recommends:<br />  a proper financial education at college<br />  finding a mentor that is already successful to help you along and teach you things that only experience can bring<br />  attending educational training seminars in business, investing, marketing, and real estate<br />  at least 7 other financial books - and not a &gt;single one&lt; is in the Rich Dad library<br />  educating your children, because public schools are designed to create workers, not investors and business owners<br /><br />He has a section at the back (prologue) that is selling his materials. He is also pitching his game throughout the book. The game look interesting, and has an excellent resale value on Ebay. I might get the computer version.<br /><br />While a fanatic and two paid reviewers is interesting, I think the 1477 individual reviews on Amazon provide a broader picture of what Kiyosaki is trying to accomplish with his books. For me, I am reading his second book, a few of the suggested reading titles, and enrolling in Intro to Business at the County College this fall - instead of the speech class I was going to take. I take a couple classes every semester. It beats spending 6 hours a night in a mindless video game with you nerds, that for sure. ;)
0783226837|5.0|The best movies are those in which you don't expect much and then it blows you away. I've read the other reviews and all those that are five star are on target. What can I add? Some of the banter, and curse words (that are not just the f word over and over) are orginal. The pseudoscientific stream involved with seismology, and sensitivity to sound is wonderfully written. All in all a classic tongue firmly in cheek movie.
B0000714B5|5.0|I first saw this movie on television in the UK in the late 1970s. I remember being non-plussed by the first thirty minutes or so of the picture but, to be honest, I was more of a fan of action TV and comedy then. As the story progressed I became more and more entranced by the tranquility of the film, I also felt as if many of the struggles the leading character was facing echoed the changes I was undergoing in my own life at that time. Were I a man of literary leaning or a devout and knowing Buddhist I may have seen the faults that other reviewers have pointed out but, as a &quot;simpleton&quot; in these matters, I remember finding the film to be simply and truly moving.<br />The spirit of the film remained with me lifelong and I felt driven to enquire if the film was to be released on DVD. I was delighted to discover that the release was imminent. While waiting I dutifuly read the book and was delighted that the story was still so familiar.<br />Twenty five yeas later the film does not dissapoint. Occasionaly it is a little strident in an architypal 70's way but, other than that, it remains quite enchanting and a tribute to the plaintive existence.
0790729407|5.0|Liam Neeson is absolutely magnificent.  The movie is heart-joltingly rivetting.  If you are interested in 20th Century Irish History at all, you will want to see this movie.
0618526412|5.0|Light reading, whimsical - no!  Realistic, introspective, entertaining, a wonderful enlightment into the soul - yes! Don't pick up the book if you don't want to think.  Otherwise, experience, enjoy and appreciate the brilliance of the characters, the story and the author.
1565117794|5.0|The first thing I did before writing this review was to sort all reviews by the lowest ranking to see if there were people who did not like this book.  I guess there were.  Wow!  I guess thiy didn't get it or got lost somewhere along the way.  This book is a wonderful tale of survival and endurance, both physically, emotionally and spiritually.  The book does get a little trying on the nerves and intellect as you near the end, it is supposed to, push on it is worth it.  I believe this is the best ending to a book that I have ever read.  I also believe that the storytelling has to have you a little aggravated for you to truely enjoy the ending.
B000056H24|5.0|This film is often compared with the 1961 &quot;King of Kings&quot;, and &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, but this one is by far my favorite of the three, because of the exquisite beauty of it, and Max von Sydow's powerful portrayal of Jesus; his performance has a strength and boldness that is lacking in the other two, and therefore for me much more believable. Sydow was only known to fans of Ingmar Bergman's films at the time, having starred in the Swedish director's &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; among others, and was a surprise choice to play Jesus, and a good one. He does a marvelous job, and I especially like the scene after Lazarus has died...it is brilliant, and very moving.<br />George Stevens' vision of the story has a stark majesty, and is taken at a leisurely pace; it is also quite verbal, with some of the major events in the gospels not pictured, but spoken of instead.<br />Filmed in Arizona and Utah, the cinematography by Loyal Griggs, who took over from William Mellor when Mellor passed away during filming, is glorious. There are scenes that have the composition and balance a fine painting, with extraordinary detail, often framed by doorways or windows, and it's a film I never tire of just looking at. Graphic artists should make a point to see this film, as there is much that can be learned from it. Alfred Newman also wrote a lovely score (with a little help from G. F. Handel) which adds to the aesthetic appeal of this film.<br />In the huge star-studded cast, some performances are truly memorable, like Claude Rains  as a bitter and devious Herod, and Jose Ferrer excellent as his son Herod Antipas; Charlton Heston's ferocious, wild-man John the Baptist is impassioned and perhaps more like the actual Baptist than some of the tamer portrayals.<br />With its huge budget (over 20 million in 1965 dollars) it was a critical and commercial failure when it was released, but it has had a long life, and is being watched today while some successful films of the mid-'60s quite forgotten, and will continue to be appreciated by everyone who likes Bible epics.

B0002858YS|2.0|I don't see how someone here could actually mention these guys in the same breath as modest mouse.  Sure, they demonstrate a knack for melody on a few songs, but their music is hindered by blase, crappy lyrics, such as &quot;I like soul, but I'm not a soldier.&quot;  Not to mention that a few of their keyboard and synth lines are blatant Cure rip-offs,  and that there is no real complexity to the music on this album either, unless you consider just adding more keyboards and guitars to be complex.  All in all, the Hot Fuss successfully illustrates what happens when a band spends more time cultivating their image than their songwriting abilities.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I was incredibly disappointed with the Indiana Jones DVDs because they included really what was a pathetic amount of special features. When I saw that Lucas wanted to put Star Wars on DVD, I was exicted, but then I learned that his motivation for doing so was the success of the Indiana Jones Trilogy. I was immediately nervous that he would use the same 4-disc formula. Unfortunately, he has.<br />How could they possibly not fill up at least two discs with bonus material? This is the Star Wars Trilogy, after all! Answer: money. That has been the sole thing guiding Lucas since he began releasing these prequels that don't even deserve the label of \\"Star Wars.\\" Undoubtedly, years from now Lucas will \\"re-release\\" the DVDs with extra bonus features or something along those lines. Seriously, one bonus disc? I'm disgusted, and if you're a long-time Star Wars fan, you should be, too.
1400034779|5.0|This is not your typical mystery story, but then again Precious Ramotswe is not your typical detective.  Rather than recounting her attempts to solve a single overarching mystery story, this book is a collection of vignettes dealing with mysteries both great and small, woven in with the details of daily life in Botswana.<br />Alexander McCall Smith knows Botswana intimately, and the strength of this novel is its tremendous sense of place.  Reading this book makes you feel like you have actually visited Botswana, and are sipping a cup of bush tea as Mma Ramtoswe recounts her cases to you.<br />Like Miss Marple, Mma Ramotswe's sleuthing success comes from her observational skills and her tremendous sense of the fundamentals of human character.  She sees people as they are, whether they be clever or lazy, greedy or hardworking.  The people she meets spring to life with all their virtues and imperfections.  <br />The short chapters mean you can read the book in short breaks, making it easy to fit into even the most hectic of schedules.<br />A wonderful change of pace from your typical mystery novel, and a treat not to be missed.
B000059Z8J|4.0|The Man of Steel flys into the spectactular motion picture, Based The DC Comic and also appearing in Action Comics, Christopher Reeve stars as Clark Kent.Reporter in Metropolis,Illnois for the newspaper the Daily Planet,And trouble emerges Clark Kent flys to the rescue as Superman, a blue suited red caped powerful wonder. He takes on Lex Luthor played Gene Hackman and falls for Lois Lane played Margot Kidder and Marlon Brand as the Krytonian father of Superman Jor EL. This Film is a Great Superhero movie and great film all around, probably the most imaginative thing the Man of Steel has been in. Superman began as the comic, then a radio show,animated shorts,two serials,  a TV show and in 1978 the true Superman Movie. Superman is imaginative in everthing because hes an imaginative character. A pop culture icon on screen and in everthing else. the Special Effects are incredible, This a Super high flying ride. You Want a good superhero movie before Batman and Spider-Man this is it. If it wasn't for this classic we would'nt have superhero movies like Spider-Man 1&2,Batman,Hulk and X-Men 1&2. Thank Hollywood for making a great superhero film that lauched other superhero films. A thrilling Film of one of the greatest heroes of the 20th century, The Man of Steel, SUPERMAN.
B00005MKA1|5.0|This album has got to be the best one.  Every song is just jammin' and can be played at any point in time.  You know how some albums just rock from beginning to end... this is one of those.  No skippped over songs or &quot;I wish this song was on it instead of that one&quot; (that what other albums are for).  <br />You feel down?  Put in Kaya.  You feel happy?  Put in Kaya. It can solve all of your problems and answer all your questions. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Food for the soul! :)
B00024BHTC|4.0|First thing worthy of mention about Once is the beautiful cover art, which contrasts sharply with the classical \\"dark\\" covers found on previous Nightwish albums. Well, this contrast is apparent only in color, for the cover portrays an angel crying with his face on a pedestal. <br />From the very start (Dark Chest of Wonders) the listener is pummeled with an extremely raw guitar that is soon joined by the drums and the orchestra, the latter which has become an integral part of the music. This piece is highly epic, with male voices chanting in the background during the most critical parts of the song. Dark Chest of Wonders features an extremely good chorus and is a good start for the album. The way the orchestra is used throughout the track is just amazing, giving orchestra-fond bands like Rhapsody a run for their money.<br />After the amazing start, we now move to I Wish I Had an Angel (which, by the way, is going to be part of the musical score of Alone In The Dark). Compared to the opening track, I Wish I Had an Angel is much more simplistic, featuring a duet between Tarja Turunen and Marco Hietala, and yet more raw guitarwork. The chorus is somewhat catchy and extremely aggressive, making the song fairly good. As always, Hietala impresses in the bass department. Next in line is Nemo, the single of the album. Nemo is an extremely good song, featuring an excellent chorus and a stellar vocal performance by Tarja. Near the end of the song the orchestra builds up greatly, giving the listener a good feeling of achievement and happiness.<br />The next track, Planet Hell, is my favorite of the album. A chorus chants in tune with the orchestra, which gradually builds up into a beautiful crescendo. The band then joins the orchestra in full force, creating an extremely epic and powerful sound. Hietala and Tarja sing together in this track, providing a beautiful contrast between their voices as the orchestra builds behind them at an alarming rate. The chorus is just amazing,with Tarja singing a couple of lines and the chorus chanting behind her at key spots. Planet Hell also features a beautiful yet short keyboard solo that sounds so Nightwish (if you are a fan you'll understand this). Overall, Planet Hell is an excellent track.<br />Some tribal chanting leads into Creek Mary's Blood, a sound about the destruction of ancient Indian tribes. Creek Mary's Blood starts off slowly, with a good performance by Tarja. The song quickly builds up into a beautiful chorus backed by the orchestra, and then a lengthy instrumental part ensues. Like the chorus, the instrumental section rapidly builds up only to give way to the chorus once again. A very beautiful song, and my only complain with it is that by the end, a man starts speaking in a tribal language. That would not be a problem with me, except for the fact that the speech lasts for over a minute.<br />The Siren follows, featuring a very Egyptian sound. The song starts with an alarmingly-sounding orchestra that is soon joined by the band, and perhaps the first hints of melodic  guitarwork in the album. Even though Tarja sings most of the song, the chorus is done by Hietala with Tarja chanting on the background. The solo is lengthy and very mysterious, with a very Egyptian sound to it. The Siren is another good sound that does not cross the border to excellent or spectacular.<br />Next is Dead Gardens, which is another favorite of mine. The song starts in a very mysterious way, with a nice beat and strong guitar riff. After the short intro a very raw guitar sticks its nose and Tarja starts singing. The chorus and Tarja's performance are good. Out of all the songs found in Once, this is the one that most resembles Nightwish's earlier material. Romanticide follows, and is the first track to feature those thundering double bass drums that are a trademark of Power Metal. Unfortunately, the chorus just falls flat and the song goes through two of them before morphing into a rawfest, with Hietala almost growling (kind of like in Century Child's Slaying the Dreamer). <br />Almost near the end of the album, we find Ghost Love Score. This is an epic piece clocking at over 9 minutes. I will not go into the details of the piece because of its complicated nature, other than saying that here we find perhaps the second guitar solo of the whole album. Now, I have listened to many bands that user orchestras, and I have listened to many songs that build themselves around orchestras. However, Ghost Love Score just BLOWS them all to Hell. This song alone can make Blind Guardian's and Rhapsody's entire orchestrated epics sound like crap. And the best part of all? After the song is over, there's no cheese lying around on your room (or your car)! In my humble opinion, this is the way orchestration should be done in a song, without resorting to the extreme cheesiness that is characteristic of bands such as Rhapsody. You can actually play this song to a friend without feeling ashamed of it. Without a doubt, the shinning gem of the album.<br />Closing comments:<br />Once takes on a completely new musical direction. Most of the songs (with a few exceptions) build heavily around the orchestra which serves to accentuate the music in an incredible way. I usually have many complaints when metal bands use orchestration in their songs, because most of them go over the top. However, Nightwish has managed to do it just right without sacrificing that \\"epicness\\" that the orchestra adds to the music. I'm quite pleased. My only complaint lies in Tarja's voice. She has proven to be an extremely good operatic singer, but in this album operatic vocals have vanished almost completely. On top of that, the production of the album doesn't favor her voice that much.
B000002LEU|4.0|I have become pretty obsessed with music in the past few years. I visit music forums and discover new bands daily. I buy CDs all the time and it isn't slowing down. I am into all different kinds of music including Joy Division. I'm only 15 and I am trying to catch up on all the music I haven't heard yet.<br />I bought this as my first JD CD and I couldn't be happier. I popped it in for the first time and it kept me interested the whole way through. This is not a CD that's up and down really at all. Every single track has something to offer. I don't own any other JD albums yet but I plan to buy Closer and Unknown Pleasures soon, and I have Substance to thank for that. <br />Buy this!

158799190X|3.0|I really wanted to like this book because the it discusses an important topic.  The role of randomness in our everyday lives versus our innate (lack of) capacity to deal with it without careful education is one that we need to talk about more in the popular culture.  However, the problems with this book are several.  Its casual and meandering exposition is supposed to make it more accessible, but it actually makes it harder to come to terms with the topic.<br />Also, Mr. Taleb is a bit difficult to warm to, although there are occasional flashes of wit and humor that help.  For example, he is so proud of his personal achievements that he both disparages them (he is ashamed of his Wharton MBA), and uses them as proof of his superiority of almost everyone (he read a lot at the library).  He also has some strange peccadilloes such as his passionate and disproportionate dislike of George Will because he interviewed Robert Shiller (Taleb?s friend and author of ?Irrational Exuberance?) in a rather feckless manner.<br />In the second half of the book he does explain some interesting phenomena about human psychology and randomness in interesting ways, but he goes completely overboard on certain points.  On page 173 he states that Khaneman and Tversky have exerted the most influence on economic thinking in the past 200 years.  Come on!  Name any major economics department that has become behaviorist in any major way.  (Taleb might find such resistance to acceptance a proof of concept ? but people weighing evidence seriously would find it a chink in Talebs case.<br />I think the reality is that what Taleb points to is important and does exist, but that it is something like a second order effect in the big scheme of things.  It may matter an extreme amount in the narrow world of options trading where Taleb indicates he lives, but for most of us it is a minor issue.  Not one of no consequence, but not a determinative effect in the broad sweep of our lives.<br />So, I continue to look for a really good book on this topic.  If you know of one, please email me with information about the book.to look for a really good book on this topic.  If you know of one, please email me with information about the book.

B00008S2VG|5.0|People who say Madonna is fading has no clue. Here in Toronto Madonna has three shows on her current tour, and they all sold out under an hour! I was on the phone all morning trying to get tickets and only to realize that she had all 3 shows sold out, and there was still tons of people clogging up the line who wanted tickets. This does not sound like a fading pop-star to me...<BR>So American Life wasn't a big hit, big whoop. This doesn't make it a bad album, actually it is one i constantly listen to and never get tired of. <BR>People remember, for almost 10 years of Cher's career she hadn't had a big hit, then in 1998 she released &quot;Believe&quot; and it became the biggest dance hit of the year, and it is still playing at clubs. And guess what, she was 51 when this was released, and was giving Britney a run for her money.<BR>And this is Cher, not Madonna the ultimate female success in pop music. Madonna has always had her highs and lows, but she has never disappeared and that is what is truly important.<br />I think it's a trend personally, people are just kinda dishing away successful female singers for the time being, not just Madonna. Remember Kylie's Body Language flopped and Janet's Damita Jo's album flopped, so it's just not Madonna. It's people and critics who claim these women are washed up that these albums don't sell, however they are the pillars of popular music as we know it.<BR>Who knows maybe even Michael Jackson will hit the top again, but don't degrade Madonna when you have no clear vision of her future. As she says &quot;nobody knows me.&quot;
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have to respond to those who freak out about the &quot;superstitions&quot; of this film.  Being a totally non-magical thinker myself I can understand the first-order reaction.  But frankly, you need to see the metaphors.  When the spirit gods express anger at &quot;humans&quot;, this is metaphorically our own conscience questioning and evaluating what we are doing.  It's that simple.  If you can do that, you will be able to LOVE this film. SEMI-SPOILER:  The first great thing about it is that there are no mustache-twirling villains.  Everyone's motivations are human, they're doing what they think is best.  That's just the appetizer.  Great stuff!
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie, although not out on DVD yet, is a MUST SEE.  It definitely made me fall in love with my Lord all over again!  He loves YOU and this movie will show that!

She uses the same handful of high, drawn out belting notes over and over and rarely mixes things up by going into her low range or high operatic range. The songs start to blend together. The only song I enjoy now is \\"Going Under.\\" The rest are just too boring.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|This movie did not resonate with me. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it provided jobs to a whole lot of people. I think this movie expressed wishful thinking in being able to change your past to alter the present. The movie shows how messed up the present can be when you tinker with the past to get revenge for those that hurt you.<br />Even though there are children in this movie, it is still not good viewing for the little kids. There is one boy that is swearing in this movie which is wrong and there is the suggestion of child porn. which is also wrong. I would of liked to see this movie be slanted toward being a little more G rated. This movie is so bad, that I would not even suggest renting it for fifty cents for seven days
B00004VWA7|5.0|Jasco is the best bass player ever. come on over has sam and dave ov vocals. all the songs are amazing. it is so hard to say how good it is. he is the master of the bass. he does stuff only people dream of. this cd is a perfect 10. if you like fusion jazz or the bass go buy this.  i would say this is one of the best jazz cds ever. jaco went before his time. R.I.P. Jaco
B000002UAU|5.0|this album was released in 1967, the flower power era.Beatles music is limitless now. in this album they use so many instruments no other artist of their era could think of. not only sitar this time, but a complete symphonic orchestra plus a circus organ. every song of this alboum is a complete artwork...plus one really magical one. \\" a day in the life\\" the best ever song Lennon/Mc Cartney made
B00004X01U|4.0|On \\"Music\\", Madonna's continues on the path set by her last CD, \\"Ray of Light\\", yet the result is anything but repetitive.  On \\"Ray of Light\\", Madonna took on the limp genre of techno music, a world where generic fast beats back up meaningless lyrics and artists rarely outlive one hit wonder status.   Yet on \\"Ray of light\\", with beautiful and unique beats produced by Mirwais Ahmadai, Madonna proved that techno music can be meaningful.  She took the techno ditty formula to its ultimate height with the soaring title track and filled songs like \\"Nothing really matters\\" with intense emotional meaning.  On \\"Music\\", Ahmadia is back and along with him his techno beats and Madonna brings a new emotional state to this album.  \\"Music\\" and \\"Don't tell me\\" were the big hits off this album and they're perfectly delightful ditties.  Madonna's voice is still reaping the benefits from the vocal lessons she took for the film \\"Evita\\" and as on \\"Light\\", she's able to manipulate her small range to turn the songs out.  Yet it's the other tracks that help this record keep its shine years later.  On \\"Paradise\\" Madonna indulges herself in over dramatic speeches in both French and English but somehow it works and the playfully delivered chorus \\"your paradise is not for me\\" proves again that for all her consumerist shallowness, there is more to Madonna.  \\"Gone\\" also shows great strength, as Madonna soulfully sings about following your dreams.  What really made \\"Light\\" and \\"Music\\" so interesting and artistic, was the deep regret Madonna reveals.  There's something very imploring and even human that as she enters her 40s, Madonna regrets some of the shock and scandal she indulged in at the beginning of her career.  On \\"Nobody's perfect\\" and \\"I deserve it\\", both backed intermittently by acoustics and electronics, Madonna tells of how her faults drove a lover away.  Yet, while the few happy revelations on \\"Light\\" came from the birth of Madonna's daughter, on this record, Madonna's new husband, Guy Ritchie, provides her with more cheerful fodder.  On \\"Amazing\\" backed by an airy thumping, Madonna sings girlishly \\"It's amazing what a boy can do\\" and her mature joy seeps through to the listener.  But for all this, the most genius song may be \\"what it feels like for a girl\\".  The beat is sweet and catchy and the lyrics are filled with sensual descriptions of the female physique.  Yet just when Madonna has you thinking the song is a crude sexual exploitation, leading up to the chorus she lets loose the lines \\"strong inside but you don't know it/ good little girls they never show it/ when you open up your mouth to speak could you be a little weak\\" with deep hurt ringing through her voice.  This is what makes Madonna one of the most unique pop stars ever.  For all they're false claims that skimpy outfits equal feminism, Madonna proves here that Britney and Christina don't know the meaning of that word and legitimizes her lasting presence in pop music.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Definately the best Clint Eastwood movie ever made. You got alot here raw emotion from a very good cast, The direction is superb too because when you watch the movie it will force you to make a judgement about a certain charector and what you may believe he is capable of. It will drive you into coming to the conclusion that you may believe is rational. But is the person who is supposed to have done it? It brings new meaning to, cooler heads prevail.
B000002A3T|5.0|pogo needs an ass beating.dont you think so?????.just check out his foolish reviews and you will see that while he has given great albums like wish you were here by the great pink floyd one stars,he has on the other hand given crappy albums by talentless overrated filth like britney spears and madonna five stars.i would advise you to ignore this joker's(pogo) stupid recommendations and buy this classic immortal album which has stood as a classic three decades after it was recorded.five stars.
B0001I55OC|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this film, it could have been longer, providing more details, like how they arrived at building the aparatus in the first place, why the first guy was killed, and by whom, Why Deckar was left behind, and felt compelled to kill the person that left him behind.  Just develop it more, it has great potential for what might have been, but is still really enjoyable the way it is.
B0000029GA|5.0|\\"Illmatic\\" is basically one of the top five rap albums ever created.  There's so much good in this album that I can't even write how much.  I'd have to write a paragraph for every song.  <br />My favorites:(NY State of Mind, Life's A Bitch, The World Is Yours, Sittin In Da Park, One Love, It Ain't Hard To Tell, and Represent).  The other songs are also good.  There's only 10 songs, but they're all listenable and so it provides no filler.  Nas is prolly one of the greatest rappers of all time and Illmatic is his most memorable classic(other classics are Stillmatic and God's Son in my opinion).
0783240236|5.0|The Birds is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films. Perhaps that has a lot to do with the beautiful Tippi Hedren, who shines in everything she does. The gorgeous scenery, adorable costumes, and lavish colors also add to the surreal atmosphere, which quickly gets disrupted by a flock of killer birds. Like many firsts Hitchcock introduced with his films, this is the first &quot;nature run amock&quot; film, just like Psycho was the first &quot;slasher&quot; film. This Psycho follow-up was yet another ground-breaking addition to the horror genre and further revealed the master director's darker obsessions. <BR> <BR>Like Hitchcock's fabulous Rebecca and mediocre Jamaica Inn, this is based on a story by the extremely talented Daphne Du Maurier, but Hitchcock was left with the task of fleshing out the short story into a feature film. He did one hell of a job. Hitchcock and screenwriter Evan Hunter borrowed only the title and basic conceit of Daphne du Maurier's 1952 short story, &quot;The Birds.&quot; Du Maurier's tale, conventional and utterly humorless, is a Cold War parable that uses the unexplained bird attacks as an apocalyptic metaphor for nature thrown out of balance by technology and warfare. It's told from the perspective of Nat Hocken, a disabled war veteran and farmhand living in a cottage with his family in the British Isles.<br />The film version is set in  Bodega Bay and follows bored, spoiled socialite Melanie Daniels (Hedren) as she romantically pursues dashing lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). Tension soon develops among Melanie, schoolteacher Annie Hayworth, Mitch's former flame (Suzanne Pleshette), and Mitch's domineering mother (Jessica Tandy). The emotional interplay is interrupted (and reflected) by the sudden and unexplained attack of thousands of birds on the area. <BR> <BR>Hailed as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces by some and despised by others, THE BIRDS is certainly among the director's more complex and fascinating works. Volumes have been written about the film, with each writer picking it apart scene by scene in order to prove his or her particular critical theory--mostly of the psychoanalytic variety. Be that as it may, even those who grow impatient with the slow build-up or occasional dramatic lapses cannot deny the terrifying power of many of the film's haunting images: the bird point-of-view shot of Bodega Bay, the birds slowly gathering on the playground monkey bars, the attack on the children's birthday party, Melanie trapped in the attic, and the final ambiguous shot of the defeated humans leaving Bodega Bay while the thousands of triumphant birds gathered on the ground watch them go.  <BR> <BR>Eerie, scary, and suspenseful, this is a great film and classic Hitchcock, which highlights his genius. There is no sound track to cue the audience in as to when to be scared. And what other filmmaker could take the simple sound of wings fluttering in a house and turn it into the sheer sound of terror?
0553573403|5.0|This novel is incredibly unique in the sense that I was never fully supporting one house over another.  In most fantasy novels, you have a strong hero, backed by his men, and you have the wicked demon or evil king or something to that effect.  You don't necessarily have that in this book.  Yes, Eddard Stark has the qualities of a hero, to be sure.  But what about Tyrion Lannister?  He's done no evil, and he is, at times, portrayed as a hero (and his quick-witted remarks are simply hilarious).  Come to think of it, many characters are portrayed as heros.  Was Joffrey not a hero to Sansa? Even Daenerys is a hero, and look at how King Robert (yet another hero) hates the Targaryens!<br />Mr. Martin, however, is not without a few tricks up his sleeve.  He has a staggering ability to change the way the reader looks upon a certain character.  A character can go from the bravest of men to a lowly craven, or from angry to kind, or from evil to good.  And they can all be switched right back, too, quickly as they were switched the first time.<br />This book is not 800 pages of sorcerers casting magical spells and elves dancing to the music of the forest.  No, this story is about men, which is why it's so fantastic.  Just read it; you'll love it.
B00008G9JM|5.0|Wow, how to begin.  &quot;A Passion Play&quot; was one of the first four Tull albums I bought, which my family sarcastically calls &quot;the four corners of Hell&quot; (the other three being &quot;Stand Up,&quot; &quot;Aqualung,&quot; and &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;).  All four have very different moods about them, and &quot;Passion Play&quot; is by far the strangest.  When I first popped it in, I thought, &quot;What the hell is this?!&quot; especially the middle part featuring &quot;The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles.&quot;  Many have drawn similarities between &quot;Passion Play&quot; and their earlier concept album &quot;Thick As A Brick,&quot; but let's be honest.  Besides being two sprawling, challenging, 45 minute plus albums, the two have nothing in common.  &quot;Passion Play&quot; is a lot darker and deals with issues such as life after death.  The atmosphere of the reecord can sometimes seem tense and creepy, but there's also a calming quality about it that's hard to describe.  It may be a hard pill to swallow at first, but &quot;A Passion Play&quot; really grows on you and you'll find yourself playin it again and again.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Honestly I just don't understand why people are so mad at the whole \\"original\\" vs. \\"Special edition\\" thing. These aren't even going to be the special editions, they will be yet another version of the film (though it isn't confirmed yet, we all know they will have changes). I've been a star wars fan for twenty years, and I can truthfully say that I'm going to be very, very happy on September 21st. And what I'm about to say will enrage some people, but I'd rather have new editions for the DVD release as opposed to the original trilogy. Why have I gone crazy, you ask? Because different special effects and a few scene changes don't affect what makes this trilogy so great. It is the characters and the overall story that we all fell in love with in Star Wars, not the way the X-wings looked when they were attached to poles in front of the bluescreen. I'd rather have modern special effects replacements to go along with the improved quality of the DVD format. I think that the obviously outdated special effects would be way too cheesy looking when you have the picture clarity of modern DVDs. Don't get me wrong, I do love the original versions of these films as well, but I can't help but stare at the black bar attached to the nose of X-wings as they explode over the death star's trench. It just takes you out of the whole experience when you look at it today. <BR>Anyway, this is more of an opinion than a review, I know, but I had to respond to posts like \\"Outraged\\" (a couple below here) with my take on the whole DVD thing. To sum up, I love the movies for the characters and story, not the old special effects, so on September 21st I'll be gleefully skipping work to sit down with a whole new version of my favorite movie trilogy of all time.

B00005JNA2|3.0|I liked watching this film simply because the encounter feels so real in a way that very few films that are made convey.<br />However, seeing the exact same people 9 years later, their schtick seems tired and old.<br />Personally the first film was also worth watching but nothing really revelatory. I find mad romance more along the lines of what Punch Drunk Love could have been (not actually that great a movie) or Leaving Las Vegas to be far more interesting.<br />Delpy actually gets rather annoying after awhile, and the worst thing about the movie is how short it is (80 minutes). Although Hawke and Delpy reveal quite a few things, it did not get as deep and involved as it should have..<br />Had it gone deeper and lasted a week instead of 80 minutes before a flight....(ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS, you write a book in order to find a woman. You find her and you can't take a day or two to spend with her???? This from Hawke who has obviously been thinking of her for the past 9 years.
B000002UAO|2.0|&quot;...a starting point for music..&quot;, &quot;...one flawless package...&quot;  What Goes On?  Run For Your Life?  If you like a few tracks then fine, but get real people.
B000000JO3|5.0|This is the definitive collection of any PUNK Music.  Early 80's at the best.  If there were only 5 bands to choose from from these days(the original days) it would be Minor Threat, The Dead Kennedy's, The Sex Pistols,  Black Flag, and the Subhumans.  The Ramones were awesome as well as the Clash<BR>(but neither were really true Punk music).<BR>Anyone saying this is ripoff music or anything else negative about this is a true loser who knows nothing about music.<BR>This is the best Punk CD ever!  EVER!  Nothing touches this!  Nothing!  Ian McKaye is a true straight edge god.  The best Punk to come from America(with the DK's following in second).  If you only own one Punk CD this is it.  truly amazing music that transcends any time or age barrier.  Hard, exciting, brutal, real, confident, pure, traditional, angry, true, the best!<br />Screw anyone who says this new garbage is good music(blink 182, Good Charlotte, Offspring, or whatever other crap that exists today).  This is it.  the best.  Own it or suffer the consequences of being a total loser!<br />I love this CD and I loved it when i first owned it on cassette in 1986.  All posers must die!!(...)
B000002UAU|2.0|&quot;...they use so many instruments that no other artist of their era could think of?...&quot;  No one had ever played of a sitar?  They were the first to use a symphonic orchestra?  The statements made up by people regarding this album are incredible.  There are three good songs on this release. At the going download rate of 99 cents per song, I might buy this if it were marked down to $2.97.
B00023BLXK|4.0|The only good things about this movie were the lead actors and the dancing.  The writing was horrible and the background story was annoying.  Despite all of this, I will buy the DVD.  Im a sucker for sequel/series and it was a cute movie as long as you have no expectations past cute leads and fun dancing.  The soundtrack is great, not very fitting to time/place of the film, but its got some good dancin music.
B000084T18|1.0|What are with most of these rap artists? All of their songs are about killing or hoes or how much bling he or she has. I mean i dont mind a little bit of showing off about how much bling ya got or chicks you have or hell even a track or two about getting even with someone you dislike, but all of 50 cents tracks and i mean all of them have to do with killing someone or getting high or stoned. But even past all of that the beats arent that good and kinda sound the same and his lyrics kinda suck. If your a so called &quot;Hardcore Gangsta Rapper&quot; i would suggest picking this CD up but if your not to in to the &quot;These streets is hardcore crap&quot; then i would suggest something from the Rockafella family artist.
B00002Z88D|1.0|I really do like Metallica , also I like live albums and greatest hits albums. But ever since Metallica caused such a stir in the music Industry they have not been putting out very good music . So I guess it is there cheap way to try to make a comeback . I have all of there C-D's so I am not or was not downloading any of they're stuff nor would I old stuff is the thing I think should be alloud. But Metallica is a great band but S&amp;M sounds like a cheap try for a comeback to greatness that they once had.
B00005RHGK|1.0|One of the worst movies of all time. The acting sucks, the plot sucks, the monster looks just stupid, the 2 kids acting were almost as bad as the movie. What sane person is gonna see somebody throw a body down a pipe covered up and tied up and then go look whats going on. C'mon thats just stupid nobody in this world would do that. Save your time, money, sanity, and self respect dont watch this stupid sh*t Its one of the worse movies ever made
B000286SCO|5.0|This DVD set is really wonderful. If you're a recent dream theater fan (i.e. Scenes from a Memory and beyond) and would like to know about the band's works during the early 1990's, this is the DVD for you! While it's true that the video editing is not at its best (although quality is amazing), you will still be amazed by the live performances... these guys can really pull a show. <br />2 DVD's for such a cheap price and beautiful content... Every progressive fan should get it.
068484267X|5.0|This book is simply incredible and the inclusion of the patriotic and doleful poems of the Irish make it simply the best and stand out from the rest. Frank Mc Court has retold the story in a perspective of a child and I wonder how could he retell each and everything so clearly and touchingly.... so hands up for him... Mc Court is one of the greatest Irish writer ever.... This book has broken my heart, made me laugh, brought tears in my eyes and has made me obsessed with Little Frankie and his sore eyes....I never wanted to finish Angela's Ashes and wish I could continue reading it forever and ever.... If you are keen about Frankie's life then Tis' is a must read book...<br />I wish I could invite Frankie during Christmas so that he didnt have to eat the pig's head....
B0001UL7RY|1.0|&quot;Inconnu&quot; by Zen Sauvage is one of the most solid works I've ever heard from an artist. While it would be easy to pin this album under the glitch aesthetic, there's an expansive, organic undercurrent that keeps this album from being a workout in funny noises. Muted analog beats drive slowly under vast washes of decayed house synth lines in the most natural of fashions. For moments, you forget this is an electronic album. Imagine Biosphere's &quot;Cirque&quot; at a more glacial pace. Best of all, the album is free. &quot;Inconnu&quot; is the sounds of life, the common and the strange. People are just a form of ant, the clouds orchestrate the mood the day, the drone orchestra of wind rattling through the trees, and the subtle realization there's so much being missed.<BR> So where does this leave Avril Lavigne, you might ask? I don't care. I'd rather write a review of an album worth my time. This crap is low, even by teenage girl pop standards. Don't settle with this mediocrity. I beg of you to go buy an album of an artist you've never heard. Download the one I mentioned above from the Internet, it's free and actually dares to stimulate a form of higher thought in the individual. Avril Lavigne, well, we get a song about her not giving up her, uh, virginity. Yeah... umm... I hate you, Avril.<BR> The album cover for this one says everything for me: Avril is a dull shade of gray in a vivid technicolor universe.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter is a great movie that the whole family can sit down and enjoy.  And the Harry Potter series has a big future.  This is the first one in the series that introduced the school of withcraft and wizardry that Harry Potter would be going to.  It's called Hogwartz.  It introduces many characters such as Harry himself, Ron Weasley who becomes Harry's friend, Hermione Granger who also becomes Harry's friend, Draco Malfoy who is Harry's enemy, Albus Dumbledore who is the headmaster of Hogwartz and many more.  Get your kids, get this movie and watch it.  Trust me your going to love it.  It's great fun really.  Then when your done this one go to the store and get Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and then see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in theatres.<BR>10/10<BR>Rated PG for Some Scary Moments and Mild Language.
0375823360|5.0|This story is characterized as \\"fantasy\\", but it is really just about real life. If I can count on what I read, Pullman has said he doesn't like labelling books as this category and that group, however you ARE most likely to find this on the \\"Fantasy\\" shelf of any bookstore. The very intense \\"theme\\" is as far from fantasy as possible, this story goes fathoms beyond its label. <BR>     I cannot stress enough how important it is for everyone to read this book! If your house catches fire, I HOPE these will become the books that you decide to throw out the window first, but even if you let them burn, Pullman is brilliant and this story is changing, you will come away from it different and better for having read and experienced it.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This has to be the funnoest movie ever I watched it like 100 times and never get tired of it infact after this imma go watch it again, so if u didnt see this yet u better rent because this movie will make u laugh ur ass off
B00023B1LC|2.0|No, really. Please read the book, so you can see it's almost impossible for a movie to compete with a book. Just as the &quot;Lord Of Rings&quot; trilogy (Jackson), is to the book, so is &quot;The Bourne Identity (Liman). Both very good ADAPTATIONS of familiar works. Of course Jackson's is a better one in my opinion, but Liman does get it  gone done in 2 hrs, so i don't have to piss my pants to watch the whole movie. This movie is still excellent despite it's errors, especially the car chase seen with the Mini. I really think think a VW GTi would been a more suitable car. Or maybe a Lancia. Anyhow, it comes off as a &quot;Italian Job&quot; knock off , (we already have one, by the same name coincedentally.) There is really no chemistry between Damon and Potente, which does make the romantic subplot feel tacked on. So why should you buy this movie? You shouldn't......................-Pause for Effect-....................The fight seens are very good, with several twists on old tricks and the sound is excellent. Incredibly, except for the the dialogue, the whole thing is synthetic. The music is good too, setting the pace of movie. Just don't buy this one. Get the &quot;Widescreen Collectors Edition.&quot; It has better sound (DTS 5.1)  and the new bonus material isn't worth the price. With the exception of the short Ludlum documentary and the $13.95 coupon to see the new film I consider this disc completely  valueless . Here's the best part. Last year I spent about  $300 on a Panasonic DVD player. (The picture sound are noticeably better then my Toshiba and my PS2, even wth both hooked up via digital audio and component video.)  This disc doesn't work in it. I don't know if they used a lower grade disc than the collectors edition, but my dvd player just says, &quot;disc scratched or dirty.&quot; Do yourself a favour and buy the Collector's Edition.
B000005YZM|5.0|So, you enjoy psychedelic-pop from the late 60s?  Of course you've heard of The Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and The Beach Boys' &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.  Perhaps you even have found lesser-acknowledged psych-pop albums such as The Who's &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; and The Small Faces' &quot;Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake&quot; (among several other overlooked albums).  But, if you are still not satisfied and keep looking, you'll find a criminally-overlooked album...The Zombies' &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;.  Perhaps most well-known for containing the most famous song the Zombies ever put out, &quot;Time of the Season&quot;, the album is chock-full of psych-pop goodness.  However, after listening, you'll realize why many of the songs most likely never got radio airplay.  The Zombies often had hooks to songs that sound perfectly innocent unless you pay attention to the lyrics.  Songs like &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot; - about a boyfriend writing letters to his girlfriend in jail (yeah, I'm sure that would've gotten mainstream radio airplay in the 60s)...also &quot;Butcher's Tale&quot; - boyfriend is writing letters to girlfriend during World War I.  I doubt any review could do this album justice...just find it, buy it, and listen to it...you'll be doing yourself a favor.
B00000DBXL|1.0|My god, when was the last time you looked at reviews for anything for sale by Amazon.com that wasn't glowing?  This album can't hold a candle to Fashion Nugget yet somehow there are numerous reviews proclaming how wonderful this album is.  It's awful.<br />Don't fall for the machine.  All these reviews are written my Amazon marketing staff.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Them music has a great beat with a nice rhythm and the singer gives a special touch with your uncommon voice. Its a new band that began make success because someone says that was good.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Intellectually fascinating, emotionally enthralling and musically uplifting, this performance is perhaps one of the finest operatic experiences yet available on DVD.  David McVicar's production is absolute magic and a brilliant focus for Colin Davis's extraordinary music-making.
B000000W6R|4.0|It's hard to believe that a disc made up of B-sides would be this good.  Most bands just throw away their B-side material, so unless you picked up the singles, fuhgeddaboudit.  Not Smashing Pumpkins.  Billy Corgan and crew churned out music on a level not seen since the '70s, when bands built their reputations on tours and constantly playing and recording, not stringing people along with a handful of videos from one album.  In fact, they'd later up the ante with the &quot;Aeroplane Flies High&quot; box set.<br />Anyway, this disc has some classic Pumpkins moments that shouldn't be ignored just because they're not on a &quot;proper&quot; album.  &quot;Landslide,&quot; the Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac cover, was a moderate hit, being the only song from this disc that made it to radio.  But all the songs are good, and follow the traditional Pumpkins formula of quiet, introspective numbers and distortion-laden rock fests.  &quot;Pissant,&quot; &quot;Plume,&quot; &quot;Frail and Bedazzled,&quot; and &quot;Soothe&quot; are all great, but &quot;Starla&quot; is probably the centerpiece of this disc.  The song plunges through the first couple of minutes as one of their best straight-up rockers before pummeling you with some riff-heavy jamming.  This song was also very popular among fans, apparently.  I ended up adopting a cat named after this song, and some neighbors of mine also had a cat named Starla, with the same story behind her name.  Kind of scary, if you ask me, but if a band can have that much impact on their fans, more power to 'em.<br />Finally, I have to mention the liner notes on this.  The pictures, the haphazard typewriter font on the impossibly thin paper...it all adds up to kind of a slipshod package if you ask me, but it works perfectly on a B-side collection.  It makes you feel like you unearthed some real buried treasures, or maybe like Billy Corgan himself put together a mix tape of rarities just for you.  Maybe I'm reading too much into that, but it's cool nonetheless.
B000001Y42|2.0|Before Fred Durst managed to sell out and drag the reputation of Nu Metal with him, Limp Bizkit released this album.  While the album isn't terrible like Chocolate Starfish, New Old Songs and Results May Very; 3 Dolor bill isn't that great.  The songs Counterfiet and Pollution are actually pretty good, unfortunately Durst turned out to be both of these.  Stuck is a song that is fun, but once again nothing special.  The rest of the songs fall along these lines except Indigo Flow (it was recorded at Indigo Ranch),  all it is Fred thanking everyone who helped get them this far, but its quite pointless.  Everything is a song that is over 15 minutes long, is very quiet/boring and you can't make out what is being said.  The shotgun effect found on Leech is actually quite funny, that demo is actually pretty cool.  But once again I say that this is limp bizkit's only good album.  Everything after here was a downward Spiral.  This is the only Limp Bizkit Album I ever bought.  If you are interesting in what the &quot;good Bizkit&quot; sounded like, just download it.  Limp Bizkit will be remembered as Korn's Curse.  Korn is one of the only good Nu-metal bands out there.  This album is sub par to everything Korn has done.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I don't know why so many people love to diss CC and put it down saying they suck. In fact, when I read or hear any oppinions like that I always fail to see any valid point or argument. There is nothing wrong with this band. Actually they are way more creative than other bands that change the music style or lyrcis during their lifetimes (like Sepultura).<br />Changes in the way you write lyrics or the way you compose music can't be always called progress or evolution. It's really really hard to put trust in a band praying that they don't change and keep playing that kind of music you'd expect from them and for which you admire them. Well, Cannibal Corpse does that and much more, bringing a perfectly &quot;designed&quot; technical death-metal that is true to the style they helped creating and the fans plus a new level of musicianship and composition evolution that can't be seen everywhere.<br />Of course, CC will always be a band most people love to hate because of their lyrics and so but to deny their talent and creativity, their well-deserved place in music history, their respect for the fans and for their style which is unique is to be single-minded and one of those &quot;I hate these guys cause they draw attention to themselves and are popular&quot;.<br />Well, after all these years, and with all of the success achieved, they could really have turned into major sellouts. The Wretched Spawn is a proof that they still kick @ss and disappoint those who wanted to have another weakness of them to talk about.<br />I like to think that CC is &quot;thematic band&quot;. You are transported to a horror/bizarre/gore movie, more brutal and with a quality only good musicians can achieve. I don't really dig those slow-morbid death metal bands, I love fast-brutal-technical ones and Cannibal is simply on top of them.<br />That all being said, Wretched Spawn is a beautiful work of art from start to finish, no fillers, no slow parts, no clean voices, no Slayer ripped riffs like many other bands, and real quality just like they show in concert. Simply the best Death Metal record of the year. In my oppinion, of course. Thanks for your time. Ditto.
0793518326|5.0|The massive undertaking of this project makes it a gift from Rock and Roll Heaven. Every major instrument on Beatles records written out for the needy to learn and the curious to discover. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!     Of course, it's impossible to take what was never written down in the first place and write it all down perfectly, (not to mention, infusion of character!) but this book will get the average musician more than half the way there. That's something I could never do on my own. The rest is in the fingers!    Sometimes when you listen to the \\"thickness\\" of the sound on guitar and bass, it doesn't seem to always be exactly the same string, fret, etc. But, it'll get you quickly to where you can flesh it out on your own. It'll also send your fingers in new musical directions they've never gone before.    Although I'd like to keep this book as my own little secret, I might as well reward the guys who labored so hard on it. Unless you're already a master of your instrument, it's a book that can teach you so many little things. It is a lifetime's worth of jamming, practice, reference and study. Yes, it's a Beatles Bible!
0792842499|5.0|It took an Italian to revolutionize the American Western. Everything was strange and new about the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Perhaps the strangest was that it was not a contest between good and evil -- the white hats and the black hats -- as was the typical western, but instead had a plot driven by the greed of the three characters -- one of whom is charitably called good, the other two certifiably bad and ugly.     The music is extraordinary -- one of the best and most original soundtracks ever. The photography is weird -- no one had ever focused so close-up on people's eyes or the pores in their skin. The violence is brutal and surreal. The three-cornered gunfight is one of the great scenes from cinema. The scenery is off. It doesn't look like the American west -- and in fact it isn't. The movie was made in Spain. The characters are incredibly seedy. Most of them look like they took a bath about a decade ago and haven't changed their clothes since. And nobody gets the girl -- because there isn't any girl.     I love this movie! It makes my all-time top ten list. Clint Eastwood is cool beyond belief; Eli Wallach is a hoot; and Lee Van Cleef is really, really bad.
B000002MY3|1.0|If you like the sound of someone dragging their fingernails across a blackboard you'll love the sound of Alanis Morrisette's voice. Bad does not adequately describe this disaster of an album. I recommend playing this loudly and contiuously to death row inmates and then releasing the inmates...........they've suffered enought.
B00007AJF9|3.0|If you're not bothered by historical inaccuracies, then go ahead and check out this movie.  It's extremely well-acted for the most part, although Fiennes's Dudley turns milksop in an entirely fictitious turn of events that aligns him with a Catholic plot to replace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots (whose death in the movie is all wrong, too).  Events from decades later are all condensed into what is clearly supposed to be the first year or two of Elizabeth's reign (which begain in 1558): Norfolk didn't rebel until the Northern Rebellion in 1569; Elizabeth wasn't excommunicated until 1570; she didn't even enter the Anjou courtship until 1578; and Mary, Queen of Scots was beheaded in public, not murdered in her bed, and that not until almost thirty years later, in 1587!  Furthermore, in 1558 Lord Robert Dudley was not yet Earl of Leicester (he wouldn't be until Elizabeth gave him that title in 1564, and he was NEVER a duke!), and as another reviewer has pointed out, there's certainly more drama and intrigue in his REAL story than the movie allows -- he was rumored to have murdered his wife, Amy Robsart, after all.<br />I won't go on, but my point is that there is a hell of a lot wrong with the storyline that didn't even need to be wrong.  It's still an entertaining movie, as I mentioned before, and Cate Blanchett really does deliver an exceptional performance.  But at least some sort of gesture towards a measure of historical accuracy would have been appreciated.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie.  Based on the bestselling novel 'The Killer Angels' by Michael Shaara, Gettysburg is an engaging and [MOSTLY accurate] retelling of the events surrounding what was probably the most major battle of the War of Northern Agression (no offense to anyone, I AM a southerner, but I harbor no serious prejudices toward anyone).  Some minor details, such as Chamberlain's position during the battle are slightly off, but most of the historical action is dead on.  Martin Sheen delivers an excellent performance as Gen. Robert E. Lee.  Although this movie was released earlier, 'Gods and Generals' by Jeff Shaara (same name as the book, and Michael Shaara's son) precedes Gettysburg in historical order.  Recommended to anyone interested in the American Civil War and history buffs alike.
B000065V41|5.0|This is probably the best of the Muppet Movies. It was a time right after Muppet creator, Jim Henson had passed, and everyone was determined to keep the Muppets alive. This determination shows in every performance. No one settled for less than perfection. The result, a WONDERFUL movie.<br />Unlike &quot;Muppet Treasure Island,&quot; which was heavily altered from the original novel, &quot;Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; remains faithful to Dickens' classic. Very few liberties were taken (the most noticable is Jacob Marley has become Jacob AND ROBERT Marley, roles perfectly suited for Stater and Waldorf--the &quot;balcony guys&quot;). Other than that, much of the prose and dialog from the original novel is intact.<br />Granted, the DVD version is not the original widescreen version, but manufacturing flaws aside, it is still a GREAT movie.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Aragorn is a Major Hottie!!!!!! Shadowfax rocks!!!!!!!! Pippin is adorable!!!! I wish Eomer was MY brother!!! Faramir is a hottie, and did I mention that Aragorn is Hot?!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006LI26|5.0|this album ROCKS. i remember buying this on cassette when it first came out. i would recommend this to any metal fan. as well as keeper of the seven keys parts one and two. as for the reviewer &quot; death metal patron &quot; he OR she, obviously is tone deaf, all the bands they were sayin' was better, is in the same vain as helloween.. double bass and ALL.
B00020X88O|4.0|Showgirls is one one of the most universally panned movies of the nineties. Everybody hates it, or laughs at it.<br />Frankly, I don't know why. Or rather, I do know why, and it is not because it is bad. OK, granted, it is pretty bad when you consider some of the acting, and most of the story. But how many movies is this not true for? Certainly it is no worse than most action flicks, and you don't see Jean-Claude van Damme being drop-kicked all over Hollywood.<br />The thing is that this film is obviously eye candy. And today you cannot be politically correct and not attack something like that. I notice that it moved straight to the third place nationally when it came out on video, and that it has an average rank of four out of fives stars with the audience at Amazon. Critics; can't live with them.<br />See it for the girls. What girls! They can even move. Elizabeth Berkley's moves are smoking sexy.<br />And that's all I have to say about that... (Lahf is lahk a box of chokolates.)
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Can the guy that reviewed this CD be for real?  What a sophmoric effort at reviewing what is, all in all, an incredible album.  Its so rare that an album has even a few good singles on it but this thing is packed with some real honest to God rock.  Radiohead comparisons are moot considering that Thom and Co. are making bad Moog rock, and I can't remember an album that was so consistently good from Radiohead (remember Hunting Bears).  The powerful bass lines and seering vocals make this a stellar buy. Hell, if you don't believe me, go to Muse's site; they give it away for free.  Don't listen to this guy;  he probably though Maroon 5 was groundbreaking.
B0001IN080|4.0|Michael Buble is taking the music world by storm - weaving his way through the masses of manufactured two-bit pop 'stars' and the hip-hop onslaught, and proving that big band jazz vocalists can still make it in the 21st century.<BR>This DVD also proves that it is possible to watch such music on film and not lose complete interest in the genre. Buble is the sort of guy record companies must live for - good looking, crowd-grabbing, popular, youthful, and then there's that little matter of his voice. This concert DVD is focused solely on Michael Buble, and rightly so. The guy is a master. He oozes personality and class, and has you in the palm of his hand once he's warmed up.<br />This DVD is very well produced, combining live stage performances and interviews with Buble and his band members. Unlike some music DVDs that do this, the interviews do not cut into the music, and all tracks are shown in full. The interviews show an insight into the man behind the microphone, and Buble is displayed as a fun, humorous, easy-going guy - much like his singing. <BR>The audio is very good, except in some parts where Buble sings very softly and words are hard to understand, but he quickly breaks out into his trademark blow-you-away finishes, so this is not too bad. <BR>The visuals are very good. Filming a concert where all the crowd remain in their seats, and there is not a lot of electricity coming from them other than end-of-song applause means the star must be entertaining. And Buble does not fail, especially since the editing is done with shots fading in over the top of each other to keep things interesting - lots of angles, crowd shots, band member focus, and an effective use of black &amp; white footage in parts. Very clear, and quality watching.<BR>The CD is an extra bonus, with previously unreleased tracks and some live stuff - just more incentive to buy this item if you're umming and aahing.<br />Great stuff for Buble fans - it'll only consolidate your love for the man andhis voice. Much recommended.
B0000028UK|5.0|This IS HANDS DOWN, NO AND'S IF'S or BUT's about it, the BEST PEARL JAM ALBUM available. All but one track to me, is great. I never tire of this record, and recommend it over ALL of their others. It's seminal, heavy, artistic, and without a doubt, MINDBLOWING in consistancy. Progressed through the last &quot;gasp&quot; of the grunge ending.<br />BUY IT!, MONEY IS NOTHING FOR THIS@
B000002UAO|5.0|This is an elegant collection of songs that was a starting point for music. Here excellent music composition was combined with thought provoking lyricism and affective production. The guitars, pianos and bass play complementary melodies to the tunes, resulting in one flawless package that simply doesn't date.<BR>Along with Pet Sounds and Mr Tambourine Man (Byrds) here is a the new intellectualism of Bob Dylan combined with a production that emotionally frames it's lyrical content. Every track is a winner, although 'Run for your life' is somewhat lightweight. 'Norwegian Wood', 'In my Life', 'Nowhere man' and 'Girl' are probably the finest examples of songcraft here.  Anyone interested in music must have this album.
B0000027RL|4.0|Ten, is to me, by far, WAYYY overrated. WIth that said, I CAN say it was a great debut. I mean, the releases were awesome, and Once, and MAYBE Black, which I am sure was NOT a release is great too. The other songs didnt seem to approach me as good as the listed ones here. Yet, if they had to put Yellow Ledbetter and Footsteps on here, and took off some of the filler towards the end. Not bad, I wouldnt pay anything over $15.00 for it,<br />Try &quot;VS&quot; instead. Their Masterpiece
B00005JME0|5.0|Kutcher's performance was very realistic and believable. He really was using mannerisms that we see in other people in day to day life in his performance. Perhaps that's why the movie was panned- him being in shows critics percieve as \\"teenybopper\\" and then coming off as so casual.Some reviewers mentioned various interpretations of the film. Check out the director's cut, listen to the narration. They spell out their intent and maybe that will fill in some holes.There really weren't a lot of \\"holes\\" in the script. Obviously you have to be accepting of the premise, but once you accept the main premise it flows nicely. There were a few goofy things that divert attention for a second, mainly caused by budget and time constraints. Like a scene that's set at night but is clearly filmed at dawn. The directors fess up in their narration and to similar occurences. Prosthetic beard at one point after Kutcher shaved. A few lines that just don't jibe, then you find out they let Kutcher ad lib them.Other than those minor knocks, I'd have to warn some people that if they don't like creepy movies like Jacob's Ladder, this probably isn't their bag.The director's cut is even creepier, that's the one I watched and I understand the ending was different in the theater. The ending I watched was almost sickeningly creepy and sad (but not gory), so the movie can be a downer for some.But for those who do like this type of movie, I give it 5 stars because these good and creepy psychological thrillers are basically once every two year finds.
B00005JN0A|5.0|This was a great movie. It was funny all the way through. They were not afraid to show nudity which is something that seems to be avoided by other comedies. It was a great movie.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This is, at the moment my favourite album. I will tell you the best songs on the cd. I love Testify, Guerilla Radio, Calm like a Bomb, Sleep now in the fire, War within a breath, and ashes in the fall. the lyrics are great politicly charged and angry. This album establishes rage's place as the best by far rap/metal band of all time. that may sound repetative but it doesn't even say it enough. Zack DeLa Rocha is the coolest guy in the world. tom morello is in my opinion one of the best guiatists ever he is insane (i base that on nothing ha ha just kidding). rage may not be around any more but they popularized rap/metal and for that they will never be forgotten. if u r interested in the members of the band are now 3 of them are in the band audioslave. thank you for your time. ROCK ON!
B00000I01A|5.0|Out of all the Rocky movies, the third sequel to the Oscar winning original movie Rocky (1976) has the best soundtrack. Rocky IV came out in 1985 in the midst of the 80's synch pop and hair bands. But there is little or no indication that Stallone or whoever put these songs together was highly appreciative of that dreadful music scene. <br />Survivor returns to the soundtrack of yet another Rocky sequel  after their successful 1982 Rocky III theme song Eye Of The Tiger. This time they contribute Burning Heart, an even more ambitious and powerful song about the east and west clash (america and the soviet union). James Brown offers Living In America. John Cafferty's adrenaline fueled Hearts On Fire shows up twice in the movie and that only indicates that it's the highlight on the soundtrack. Kenny Loggins, the king of 80's soundtrack hits such as Footloose and Danger Zone, makes a modest appearance on Rocky IV with Gladys Knight on the bluesy Double Or Nothing. Go West's One Way Street is another bluesy pop song that fits the soundtrack quite well. Finally, there's the instrumental tracks: War and Training Montage that are memorable as the movie itself. Of course, I'm not forgetting Robert Tepper's No Easy Way Out which comes on in the most engaging scene in the movie, when Rocky is remembering his past, Apollo Creed, and the frightful face of Drago coming to end his life. <br />Rocky IV is one of the most bankable movies of the 80's. It also is one of the best soundtrack albums of that decade.<br />A

B0001LJC2K|5.0|It's been awhile since a band has come along and smacked me upside the head with the sheer amount of force that Muse has.  My brother literally tossed this CD at me a few months back, and to understate matters, it's left a mark. <br />&quot;Absolution&quot; is as stellar as the name suggests - a literal wave of sound and energy crashing with a calculated intensity; intricately planned chaos that unwinds itself a little more with each listen.  <br />Matthew Bellamy sings his heart out with a voice that is raw, melodic, and dynamic all at once.  His range is incredible, and his piano arrangements are masterful.  Not to mention the guitar work - just listen to the solo on the bridge to &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;.  Quite underappreciated is Dominic Howard's drumwork, which is jawdropping at points, kinetic and tireless.<br />Inspiration from certain classical composers is audible, and the songs themselves avoid following formulas, constantly turning unexpected corners.  Each one is carefully crafted and distinguishable, while staying loyal to the particular sound Muse has established.  Where many bands try too hard to combine too many elements, Muse succeeds, making it sound effortless and cohesive.  I don't know how they do it, but I do know that this band has caught my attention for good, and wherever they're headed in the future, I'll be there struggling to keep up.
B000294SFW|5.0|I am embarrassed to say that in my extensive 30 year collection of heavy metal, this is the FIRST Motorhead album I have 1) heard, and 2)purchased.  Forgive me all; and it will not be the last!<br />     This music has so many ass kicking elements in it that it's tough to describe.  For those familiar with NWBHM, Lemmy's writing dialect and temp come from that foundation.  I hear alot of early Saxon style rhythm playing and leads (I realize these two bands are a parallel to each other from the same genre - but Saxon has that classic NWBHM &quot;sound,&quot; and has tended to be one dimensional over the years, non-evolutionary in its subject matter writing and music), a smattering of power metal in sound only, the typical punky Motorhead thrash, and a whole lot of ballsy rockin' going on here.<br />     I truly dig the songwriting themes.....forget that fantasy and doom crap; these songs are all about real human fears, power, exhilaration, control, confict and decimation.  My only complaint about the music has to do with the mixing, in that Lemmy's bass sound seems to have been mixed a little too much to the background.  The drumming is awesome, as are the up tempo laden rhythms and riffs, and the timely, short but smokin' leads.<br />     The heavy musical foundation, subject matter and execution are so modern and fresh sounding, that it is simply unbelieveable that Motorhead has been doing this for 30 years.  These guys are the archetype and paradigm for thrash heavy metal! This is the type of album that will not lose the classic Motor&quot;metal&quot;head fans, and will most likely garner much more deserved critical acclaim, with an extended and expanded fan base.<br />     Devil horns to Lemmy and the boyz!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I used to idolise Britney Spears alot as a child.But as time passed,i realised that crazy antics-like her 55 hour marriage,and so-called tunes which she call as songs(except for that Everytime tune).Therefore,my liking and worship for her is now &quot;used&quot; (past tense).For now,my idol is Christina Aguilera.In my opinion,Chris is one good and versatile singer,and as America Online once quoted &quot;The best songtress of the century&quot;,she's unbelievable good.<br />&quot;Stripped&quot; is one of the best featured albums in my collection.Aguilera not only help penned some of the songs,she put up a very good perfomance here.The various songs here,i must say,i do enjoy every one of them.It's not surprise that she get a little too emotional,now that the songs mainly in this album here are delicated to her mum Shelly,who suffered from domestic violence from the singer's dad.&quot;Beautiful&quot; is one great hit with me and my class,so much so that our Lit teacher once played the song for us to &quot;enable us to admire the wonderful point on being in this world&quot;.Here,Aguilera proved to be one great singer,a far cry from her debut girlish-Genie in a Bottle/What a Girl Wants.She also won a Grammy for this single.Another great tune here is A Voice Within.I happened to chance it on radio,and was totally immersed with this song since.I have nothing but deep and ernest praise and admiration for this singer.I also like &quot;Dirrty&quot;.Ignore the critics on the raunchy video and Aguilera's scantily-clad outfits here,for the song is very addictive.It just seemed to play in my head now and then.It's a mix of R&amp;B and hip-hop.<br />Aguilera certainly proved to be a success.Here,she mixed her songs with R&amp;B,pop and classical.And the results? Something very pleasant and lovely.Yes,the &quot;dirrty to demure&quot;, &quot;crass to class&quot; girl is now one budding singer,and so much so,i'm sure all fans or maybe even just mere listeners,are longing for her nextanticipated album.
B0001NBMEE|4.0|&quot;Prince Valiant&quot; is a fun, colorful adventure yarn from 1950's Hollywood. It isn't very faithful to the tone or style of Hal Foster's groundbreaking and beautiful comic strip but is far above the average swords'n'armor pic of the era.<br />Lacking the style of Curtiz's swashbucklers, the solid scripting of Thorpe's &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; or the visual panache of his stunning tribute to the Brandywine illustrators, &quot;Knights of the Roundtable&quot;, &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; packs in lots of well executed, wide-screen action, terrific set pieces, wonderful costumes and attractive landscapes.<br />Done with a straight American accent (apart from James Mason's stage-villain turn as the traitorous Sir Brock) it often reminds one of George Lucas's &quot;Star Wars&quot;.<br />I've shown this to alot of kids &amp; they all love it. Presented in its original 2.35.1 aspect ratio from a really clean print, it looks remarkably good considering it's a B-picture from half a century ago.<br />Oh, it also stars the wonderful Donald Crisp (&quot;National Velvet&quot;, &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;). Overall, a steal for the sell-through price. Enjoy!

B0001UL7RY|5.0|I'm not the kind of person who worships one singer and hates another. I listen to all kinds of music ranging from Linkin Park to Eminem to even Britney Spears and Christina and appreciate good music when I hear it. <BR>'Let go' drove me crazy and I hoped 'Under my skin' would be better. It did! It's like a harder, darker side of Avril.<BR>I do not understand why not many ppl liked 'Take me away'. I think it's an awesome tune! I dream about someone like Chester singing it...so awesome. Not that Avril doesn't sound good on it though. <BR>I loved every song on the album. I suppose there is less vareity but I still enjoyed every second of the CD.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|It's a good movie. <BR>Directing is wonderful! Casting, amazing! Performances, outstanding! Story, interesting but unfortunately predictable! After the first 50 minutes you know exactly what will happen in the end. Even so, it's worth watching it. Tim Robbins and Sean Penn are fantastic. They make the difference. If they weren't in it, it would be a 2 stars movie.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|No matter what anybody says, this has to be one of the ten best gangster movies ever made, if not in the top three. If you are a fan of this genre, Scarface is a gourmet banquet of acting, action, dialogue and intensity. And if you don't enjoy this, all I can say is I'm sorry that you're missing out. The only reason I don't give this movie 5 stars is that I don't know what to make of Giorgio Moroder's cheesy sythn soundtrack and disco tunes. If you think in the context of the movie, that 80's Cuban drug dealers might like listening to really bad disco music (&quot;...Rush, rush to the yeyo&quot;) then this music works in the confines of the Babylon nightclub along with the bad hair, clothes, Belzer's lousy comedy and the mime. But these songs, if they had to stand on their own outside the movie, would be totally ignored. I wonder if Deborah Harry ( then at the height of fame with her band Blondie) knew when she laid down the vocals for Moroder's muzak that this song was designed as junk to suit the movie or if she thought this might boost her singing career. If you account for the disco muzak as necessary &quot;set dressing&quot; for the Babylon it still doesn't excuse Moroder's cheesy synth soundtrack. How much better this movie could have been if it was scored by an accomplished orchestral composer such as Morricone or Williams. If you want more proof of Moroder's shortcomings check out the soundtrack of Metropolis.

B000002LQR|5.0|This is definately one of the best records of all time. Flea's one of the most innovative and funky bassists of the last 10 years, and John Frusciante's solos are sure to blow your mind. Flea and CHad Smith make up what is possibly the best rythym section ever. And Anthony Kiedis's lyrics are random yet beautiful and humorous. But despite all the bands individual talent (which is elite), what shines here is the band's incredible chemistry. The whole album is recorded live, with hardly any dubs. They blend together so amazingly into 17 rocking songs. THere's raw funky songs like Apache Rose Peacock, Sir Psycho Sexy, If you Have to Ask, Mellowship Slinky in B Major and The RIghteous and the Wicked. All driven by infectious funky grooves, supplied by FLea's bass. To hard agressive rocking songs like Power of Equality, The Greeting Song, and Funky Monks. Many people think of Under the Bridge when they hear Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but I Could Have Lied may well be one of the saddest songs you'll hear. Driven by intense passion and somewhat dark lyrics, the guitar is just beautiful. So if you haven't a clue what Red Hot Chili Pepper's albums to get, screw By the Way or Californication, go for the classic Blood Sugar Sex Magik.

B000009EAD|5.0|Iced Earth are one of the best bands in current American metal. I bought their 2001 album, Horror Show, not too long ago, and it blew me away. Some people argue that all the power ballads are too much. I deeply disagree, I think it's a pretty gutsy thing to do all those ballads (6 on this album to be exact.) The highlights of this album are the first three tracks, as well as the final three, which are known as the &quot;Something Wicked Trilogy.&quot; The first three tracks are &quot;Burning Times,&quot; &quot;Melancholy (Holy Martyr),&quot; and &quot;Disciples of the Lie.&quot;  The &quot;Something Wicked Trilogy&quot; consists of &quot;Prophecy,&quot; &quot;Birth of the Wicked,&quot; and &quot;Coming Curse,&quot; which is another example of why Iced Earth always closes albums with style. Let's explain these 6 highlights.<br />&quot;Burning Times&quot; opens the album with a bang. Though not particularly fast, it is punishingly heavy, and it has a great riff that draws the listener in. &quot;Melancholy (Holy Martyr)&quot; is Iced Earth's third best ballad (the only ones that are better are &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;I Died For You&quot;.) &quot;Disciples of the Lie&quot; is even heavier than &quot;Burning Times,&quot; and it's also about twice as fast. &quot;Prophecy,&quot; &quot;Birth of the Wicked,&quot; and &quot;Coming Curse&quot; tell one large story over three songs. The story is very gripping, and &quot;Coming Curse&quot; is nearly ten minutes long. All the rest of the tracks are good, too. So if you are looking for a great power metal record, or want to get into Iced Earth, then this and/or Horror Show is a good start.
B00028HBKM|5.0|It was almost like being there. Some have said it was too bloody. I think that in the current social climate, people are so desensitized by gore in the media, movies, television, etc. that the sanitized versions of the passion are inadequate.  People today are very visual, so I thank Gibson for giving us a more realistic version.  I look forward to more films with this vision of detail and accuracy.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I first watched \\"Lost In Translation\\" because of my affinity for Japan. I was thrilled when it was nominated for multiple Academy Awards.<br />In a Best Picture race dominated by cinematic blockbusters and big studio productions, only the limited release, Coppola-helmed indie continues to touch the heart in such a way that all those who watch it inevitably realize that they will remember it forever - long after images of ghost-haired archers and ocean-going warships have faded from memory.<br />The opening of \\"Lost\\" finds star Bill Murray in a Tokyo cab on a dark night, wondering how he got there, a `has-been' actor escaping the reminders of dying fame and the heartbreak of a wilting marriage in the kagayaku jungle of a mysterious city where he drowns himself nightly in the Japanese whiskey he is there to endorse. The wistful chords of a guitar rise softly in the background, Murray's gentle smirk replaced by a melancholy straight face and sparkling eyes that belie the losing battle of the soul hiding behind them.<br />As Murray's Bob Harris struggles to understand himself and the city around him in the nighttime embrace of a hotel piano bar, he meets twenty-something Charlotte, the young, neglected newlywed played exquisitely by teenage actress Scarlett Johansson. They are two strangers in a strange land drawn together by a chemistry that goes beyond the whimsicality of physical attraction and the frivolity of sex, two people alone in a city of twenty million who find the cure for their solitude - and the beauty of living - in each other.<br />They sing. They dance. They eat. They drink. They go swimming at midnight. They watch movies they don't understand. They sit together in silence. They explore Tokyo - and, at the same time - themselves.<br />Murray and Johansson don't act - they are Bob and Charlotte, the travelers who find in the East some of the answers to life that have escaped them in the West. They are the two wandering spirits separated by age and circumstance who soon realize that knowing those answers only brings forth more questions - the two lovers whose intimacy exists solely in the realm of transcendental human affection.<br />I watched this movie once. I was left in a daze.<br />I watched this movie again. I fell in love with it.<br />Coppola directs \\"Lost\\" with a powerful sense of subtlety long abandoned by the mages of Western moviemaking, a refinement so strong that it left this American stunned, perplexed - nearly `lost' at first viewing. Watching it a second time, I immediately saw in the picture the quick looks and small, telling glances that I had missed the first time, catching the hidden delicacies whose very sense of subterfuge gives the movie such profound emotional depth, a salute to the culture of emotional restraint at its center.<br />Bob and Charlotte don't need an hour between the sheets to show the audience that they love each other. Their eyes - and a rare, aching smile - do that for them.<br />Sofia Coppola, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson have together given moviegoers a look at humanity and passion and romance and life and love so vivid, so emotionally powerful, that only the sight of Bob and Charlotte's final embrace on a busy Shinjuku street can even begin to express a beauty otherwise inexpressible. Words, in any language, would only get lost in translation.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|The phrase that kept popping out of my mouth after viewing this film was, &quot;wow, what a thoroughly interesting little film&quot;. It was thoroughtly interesting becaues of it's intrinsicaly interesting storyline, with the lead character of Evan (Kutcher) finding that he is able to travel back in time to alter his past, with often devastating effects to either himself or his friends. As he continues to travel back and tinker with the past trying to fix first the damage done by life events and then his own tinkering, the impacts become more increasingly harrowing and unpredictable. Never mind any minor holes one might find in the implementation of the &quot;time travel&quot; storyline because no execution of such a thing could be perfect. Just accept it as the powerful and flexible plot device that it is and move on. <br />The word &quot;little&quot; appears in my phrase because it has a small, almost indie movie feel to it. There is very little evidence of this being a major budget Hollywood release. Rather, it has the feel of a well-financed small-studio film or even a film school project that found some significant backer. The fact that it does not have an enormous budget for special effects actualy help the film far more than it harms it. Less eye candy and more focus on the flow of the plot is definatly a good thing here. <br />The acting displayed in this film is solid in every respect. The young actors that portray Evan and his friends both in the flashback/time travel sequences and in the present are engauging and beliveable. The acting of Kutcher comes across as very deliberatly understated at most points and one has the impression that it is carefuly measured, which is probably very appropriate given his comedic personae as seen on &quot;That '70s Show&quot;. Instead of the sort of broad, almost cartoonish work we see in his TV and other comedic work, here we seem him working at making a very different sort of statement. Sometimes he flirts at the edgesof underacting, but overall, he charts a wise and effective course through his performance here. He aint Brando yet, but this guy has a future in dramatic films, no doubt. <br />Some critics here have complained about some of the more disturbing themes that appear in this film, such as the kiddie porn storyline or the setting afire of Evan's dog, or the various killings that happen and then are made to unhappen throught Evan's meddling. To this reviewer, these are the sorts of events that would compel one to take the radical actions that Evan does, that makes him keep going back and trying to make things better, even as the consequences for himself and others become increasingly dire. It's all about motivation, and these sorts of events are just the sort of things that compel people to pursue radical courses of action such as seen here.   <br />I only saw the directors cut and have yet to see the theatrical ending, but from how it was described to me, the director's cut is the way to go. The theatrical version strikes me as a cop-out, a soft-sell that was probably the product of the marketing suits at the studio. The director's cut is far darker and leads one to ask more questions.<br />And for me, that is what this film is all about, as are many very good movies: it leads us to ask questions of ourselves and the world around us. Here, the questions are interesting and weighty indeed: What is the nature of cause and effect? What events *realy* shape our lives and in what ways? What would you do if you could go back and &quot;make things right&quot;? What is  a well-lived life? If you are looking for a film that you can sit around with friends afterwards and talk about such things for awhile, then this is the movie for you.

B0002858YS|4.0|As soon as I heard &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; I jumped on my favorite p2p network and embarked upon breaking as many copyrights as possible. Afterwards I ran to the closest music store and picked up a copy to redeem myself from the onslaught of guilt I had aquired over the previous 48 hours.<br />It is a wonderful addition to my collection, and a great relief from the continuous sound from bands like Three Days Grace, Saliva, and Evanescence which all sound like the same band with different singers.  Its good to hear a progression from the crap that we had to put up with from the first 3 years of this decade.<br />I enjoyed every bit of this album because of the new sound it provided that I had not heard before.  I would give it 5 stars, with the exception of one small problem... the lead singer stole my name (Yes, we really do have the same name).
185984054X|1.0|I usually enjoy Christopher Hitchens' punishing wit, but in this little addition to the list of articles and books &quot;unmasking the saint&quot; of Calcutta, I find him in a very broad sense to be intellectually dishonest and inflammatory.  He throws the spotlight on Mother Teresa's meetings with a few questionable characters (Duvalier and Keating) as if such associations were standard.  She met hundreds of leaders and leading personalities throughout the world, many with whom Hitchens himself would love to have association, I'm sure.  She spoke with a Catholic-formed conscience on issues of abortion, contraception and divorce, which Hitchens condemns as robbing poor women of the one power they have.  Poor women don't want to kill their babies. Further, Mother Teresa also spoke of the need for fidelity and respect in marriage, that women should not be seen as chattels by their husbands.  No mention of that in Hitchens booklet.<br />As for the level of care which Hitchens criticizes? He seems to suggest that all the resources in the hands of M. Teresa's Missionaries of Charity should be funneled into the building of a western style hospital in Calcutta.  It's possible, but it is a rich, Western vision, and not the missionary mandate of the order M. Teresa founded.  They do as effective a work as possible in places where they are asked to come (they do not go where they are not invited, Hitchens forgot to mention).  If it disturbs the author and some doctors that MC care is not Scripp's Clinic quality, then Hitchens is free to donate the royalties from the sales of his book to improve conditions, as are the doctor-critics, who also offer words, but no open door to the poor.<br />I have visited and lived in many MC homes around the world in the past 15 years.  In most cases, they take in the poor and dispossessed that no one else wants, that no other hospital or institute will admit.  What is it that Hitchens has against offering exiled love a place of refuge, albeit a simple refuge?a simple refuge?
B000000ORX|5.0|Its great to see several cuts from NIGHT RIDE HOME featured on Joni's<br />new look back, &quot;THE BEGINNING OF SURVIVAL&quot;, (being released<br />July 27th) . Although &quot;Turbulent<br />Indigo&quot; received the Grammy and basically took its<br />blue print from &quot;NIGHT RIDE HOME&quot;, I really felt the warmth<br />and devotion return with NRH, something I had missed from Joni's works over the years after Mingus. Although I really enjoyed Turbulent Indigo,<br />Night Ride Home is special, moody, sad at times but it<br />shows the real Joni Mitchell that overproduction sometimes<br />hit with its colder touches(during the 80's). I still listened to everything Joni put<br />out but this underappreciated collection of songs hit me just at a time<br />in my life where I was reflecting about life and this music<br />from Joni really touched me. She's deeply spiritual, always<br />seeking answers yet always asking questions in her songs. I have listened to this over and over since its 1991 release<br />and it still one of many Joni Mitchell classic favorites.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|In his own words Robert Strange McNamara tells of his early life and his career, notably his service as Secretary of Defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.  Through his narrative, viewers obtain a unique retrospective on critical international events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the bombing of Japan and the Vietnam War.  <br />McNamara sticks to the history.  His personality is revealed by the way he speaks about events he found moving, but he dodges the tough personal questions, such as those about his family, his responsibility and his sense of guilt.  <br />Clearly a reflective man, the lessons he provides are worthy of consideration by all, not just government leaders.  In seeing some of the same mistakes made in current foreign relations as those McNamara recounts, viewers recognize the cycle of history, and human falliability.
B00004RJ74|5.0|I've watched a couple Quentin Tarantino movies, and I absolutely loved them. I also liked 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico' from Robert Rodriguez. So as you can imagine, when I heard about this movie, I was very excited. Tarantino is a masterful screenwriter, and Rodriguez definitely has decent skills behind the camera.<BR>After watching the movie, I have to criticize one thing. The first half (about) of the movie was flawless, with QT and George Clooney as two Convicts, the Richie and Seth Gecko. When they embark from the first scene on, it seems as though the movie could go any direction and still be entertaining. However, when you throw in a night club that is flocking with vampires (fitfully so, the club is open dusk till dawn), you can't keep the same movie that you had. I give the story a lower score due to the fact that it doesn't fit well. If you couldn't guess from the title, and you hadn't seen the trailer, you would be oblivious to the fact that the second half of this movie is all vampires. I believe it would've worked better as a full movie of either type. Crime or Horror. But nevertheless, I couldn't resist the acting from QT and Clooney, along with Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis. Other than my single complaint, I really enjoyed this movie. As bloody and violent as it is, it's just so fun.
B000003TAB|5.0|though i have an obsession with all of nirvana's albums( Bleach, Nevermind, In Utero, Unplugged)and originally &quot;got into&quot; nirvana by way of nevermind, i have to say that incesticide is a beautiful album and my favorite in the nirvana catalog. although the cd doesn't have the great singles or individual songs as their two studio efforts, like all pieces of art, you have to view the cd as a whole-and as a whole, from start to finish it's solid.something not usally attributed to a collection of b-sides, outtakes and covers-but let's face it, nirvana is an unusal band. nirvana plays much more like a new wave band than a punk band here, and probobly would have been the direction nirvana would have went after In utero. awsome skin-bashing by Dave Grohl on Aneurysm. stand tracks are the afoementioned aneurysm, dive, sliver, aero zeppplin, big long now, and my personal favorite which people always overlook: Beeswax
B00024BHTC|3.0|BEAWARE,Before reading this u may have read an imbasil below, who has unjustly rated this album, well forget that idiots(&quot; a Music fan&quot; from Ireland) incoherent ramblings, whom has reviewed this album without any truth, explanation or justification for their opinion. Another person from Zambia and a couple from England who have rated this 1 out of 5, completly ridiculous, proposterous rating to give an album like this,dont waste ur time reading such juvenile and pathetic comments.<BR>The album yes, is slightly disappointing by Nightwish standards, the band chose a more classical/orchestral direction, well more so than their previous albums and this orchestration direction takes over most of the sound, with the metal music at most time taking a background to the orchestra, this however does pay off on songs like Planet Hell and Nemo but the album in its entirety does not live up to the fantastic heights of their previous albums like Wishmaster and Nightwish`s best effort - Oceanborn. Tarjas voice carries on from the Century Child album, slighlty more toned down but yet incredibly professional, true operatic voice and it really shows on this album, however the song quality overall on the album does not live up to their previous albums unfortunatly, but still there is much talent and quality songs to be found on this album to justify a good 3 out of 5 rating. O and for those imbasils below, i believe Tarja is now close to becoming or already is a Mezzo Soprano, which is a title with a lot of prestige and dignity,  a title she deserves for an incredible voice.
B00004YA66|5.0|All the other reviews will explain the plot etc, what I will say is that It is one of my favorite movies along with my wife's.<br />It leaves you smiling at the end , One other thing in an Interview Dennis Quaid said New Line dropped the ball because they did not promote it well enough...........I could not agree more.
B00005ATQF|4.0|First of all....many Marines say that the first 30 minutes of the movie about boot camp is THE most accurate depiction of Parris Island in cinematic history.  And of course Lee Ermey himself being a former Marine drill instructor tops it all....his profanity laced tirades are totally outrageous.<br />     Second of all,  the latter half of the movie deals with a subject not covered in Vietnam movies,  a squad getting lost and having to face a lone sniper.  Its a radical departure to be sure,  but Kubrick in his usual cinematic mastery makes it very gripping.<br />     So if you like Vietnam movies that are a bit different but still as strong as Hamburger Hill and Platoon,  check this one out....its fantastic.
B00006RINF|4.0|With Ozzfest, expanding radio play and the headbangers ball, Lacuna Coil seem to be getting pretty popular these days. Not that I mind though, since they actually deserve to be. Everthing is pretty good on this album but if you're just getting into them I would recommend Unleashed Memories or In a Reverie instead since they are marginally better. Christina's vocals sound amazing as usual. Haunting in a semi-goth, semi-alternative kind of way. Still puzzled as to why they keep Andrea around. (more on that later) The guitars follow the traditional doom sound but in a brighter way than past releases. Synths add the extra atmospheric touch that only Lacuna Coil are capable of. The drums are solid though held back. You can tell the drummer has alot of talent and I'd like to see him in a setting where he could fully exhibit it like a death or black metal band. Now onto my problems with this album. The problem that has haunted them since the beginning, the guy singer. While he sounds good on the harmony parts but he almost always is off key and sounds drunk on the other parts. I really don't know why they keep him around since he dosen't write much of the stuff and he dosen't play an instrument or anything. He just sounds like a really bad Ricky Martin impersonater crossed with Nick Holmes of Paradise Lost. They must be really good friends with the guy to have kept him this long. I'll give him this though, he has improved over the years but still has a long, long way to go before he's near Christina's level. My other problem with this is the more happy sound they seem to have adopted. While this is their heaviest album in the volume aspect it isn't in other aspects. The riffs are bright sounding and some of the lyrics are on the softer side. Overall this is a good album that will appeal to many people. I recommend their old stuff, Alas, the Gathering, Brave, Tristania, Paradise Lost, Anathema, Epica, Katatonia, Nightwish, My Dying Bride, Rhea's Obsession, and ...How Like aWinter in addition to this.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite For Destruction was the first album I ever got and amazingly it has always been my personal favorite.  The entire thing is just plain stunning in its stylistic diversity (for a metal album), its raw energy and feeling and utter perfection throughout.  Nothing more to say except that this is one of rock n roll's greatest albums and I recommend it to anyone.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Uggggggggggggh.... I finally figured out why kids are homocidal these days... It's like being force-fed deep fried burnt french fries for the prozac laden day after day... Same ol chords, same ol production, same ol formula... This album was written by the RIAA... They should be sued for inducing artists to plagiarize. I'm hoping the masses get the message, there's only so much of the same song we can take people... Don't write any good reviews, if you do, you are completely whacked out on mood stabilizers and you would listen to ANYTHING!!!! It's too late, go get yerself committed until you can listen to real music with soul that is not corrected by a computer. She carries a punk image, but punk rockers wouldn't listen to this even if they were sellouts... At least the Offspring plays punk INSPIRED music... Geez, I am so glad I am the first review here... Not saying anything about Avril, because this is not about her, it's about the CRAP the freakin labels produced and unfortunately, this is going to inspire more mall rats to be shallow and...oh my god...just like everyone else!!! Go get some Aretha Franklin and save your soul...
B00013RC9I|5.0|The music is so romantic, melodious and sweet.<BR>Coming from someone who listens to hardcore, I know I probably don't know that much about Electronic music.<BR>But I found this to top most CDs I have ever purchased.<BR>&lt;333<BR>(Lose your virginity listening to this CD)
B000021XS0|3.0|I know many of you think this is the greatest album in the world, but don't stop reading yet. I have been waiting a long time so that I could put my feelings appropriately into words, so here goes.   When I bought this album I just expected a bunch of songs that expanded on Dream Theater's masterpiece, &quot;Metropolis.&quot; What I stupidly did not realize is that this is almost a rock opera, with a storyline and songs that are all connected. There are maybe one or two songs that would sound okay by themselves. So I am grading this based solely of the reason that I bought this for. Many of the songs are toned down and are less progressive metal than lighter rock and Petrucci's long solos are pretty much nonexistant. After I got over the disappointment that this was going to be nothing like &quot;Awake&quot; I listened to it again and was able to appreciate for what it was. And if I had graded this for what it really was instead of what I stupidly thought it was going to be this would get five stars. It has a great storyline and is interesting enough so that the music is there but is not a crucial part of the album. The only thing I can't get is in the final song it sounds like someone (possibly Nicholas) is driving home, pours himself a drink, listens to the news where something bad has just happened in Washington, turns it off, and then all of the sudden, the psychiatrist says, &quot;Wake Up Nicholas!&quot; and then for thirty-forty seconds of distortion. Am I blind or did anyone else not understand it? Anyway, if you are looking for something similar to &quot;Awake&quot; or &quot;Train of Thought&quot; stay away and buy &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.&quot; If you enjoyed The Trans-Siberian Orchestra's &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; or are a diehard Dream Theater fan this is the perfect album for you.
B00005JN0A|2.0|Hormone-riddled yank teenagers take a gropefest tour to the EU. The general theme has been beaten to death in a bunch of other much funnier movies but apparently someone thought it has not been covered clearly enough. Despite this reservation, I rented this DVD for the sole claim that it included writers from the 'Seinfeld' team.<br />Bad decision. The movie is grounded in drivel and delivers much the same odor. As though the handful (literally, if you get the drift) of raunchy scenes and absolutely idiotic props such as a computer that pronounces the arrival of email with &quot; Mail, muthafukker&quot; were not enough to scrape the bottom of the trench of tastelessness, we are inflicted with a Vatican City sequence involving dead-pontiff jokes and some leering copulation in a confessional.<br />What can I say. Grossed-out, uninspired knockoff that can be skipped without missing much, unless you need a background for a particularly adoloscent stag party.
B0000062Y2|5.0|Although this cd could do with re-mastering, the voices and talents of this cast far surpasses any other version I have heard, or seen.  Ted Nealy as Jesus brings compassion and feeling to his part but the whole show is stolen by the late Carl Anderson who has a voice that eminates a feeling of anguish and frustration in every chord, most definately a man who should of had greater recognition in his lifetime, but one who will always be remembered by old and new fans alike.  This CD is one to have for playing when away from your Video/DVD but if you want the full experience get the film and bask in probably the best musical ever to be bought to celluloid.
B00004TWZF|4.0|1. Humanity: Many critics claim the central themes portrayed by the two male protagonists are the search for freedom and the proclamation of one's individuality.  Yet both Jacques and Enzo are undeniably not free, having self-imposed chains tied both to the sea and their fantasies about the sea.  In what ways does the film express the dangers of escapism and sentimental loneliness?<br />2. Implications: All three characters are tied to their worlds.  Enzo is trapped in his status as the best, Johanna cannot move beyond her desire for a normal life with Jacques, and Jacques is unwilling to depart from the last words of his father.  Do you think this film romanticizes these issues, or criticizes them?<br />3. Evolution: Besson (the director) stresses the super-human qualities of both men.  Do you think these qualities are tied to their fate with the sea, or do they have a choice about their fate?<br />4. Realism: There is a magic realism in the film that cannot be ignored, form the magnetic pull of the ocean, to the unhuman mysteries beneath.  Without these magical elements, does the movie stand on its own as a piece of reality?<br />5. Stageplay: Much of the acting in the film is overdramatized, from the sensual yet sentimental plumbings of Johana, the deaf silence from Jacques, to the heavy and bawdy nature of Enzo.  Do the actors work together in a cohesive whole, or do they jarr the story and create separate entities upon themselves?

0385495323|5.0|This book is truly an achievement!  SimonSingh takes up a seemingly esoteric, difficult, mysterious, exhaustive  subject of  Cryptography  (or in simple terms Coding and decoding) and backed up by exhaustive research , he has written an engrossing book; The  400page read is a fascinating journey for the reader.   The  journey spans a broad range and time period.  The hallmark of this book apart from the wealth of information it has,  is the facile style of writing of SimonSingh which doesn't smother the lay reader with verbiage or technicalities;  The structure of chapters is period wise,  starting with the basic codes used during the middle ages,  with the advancement of  monoalphabetic ciphers and then polyalphabetic ciphers (including the vignere ciphers); then the automation of ciphers which happened during WWII with the famous Enigma machine;  Then comes the intresting phase of cat and mouse game between the cryptographers and cryptoanalysts, which has always happened, but took a intense phase during the WWII, primarily between the camp at BletchleyPark,London (which housed a motley crowd ranging from Mathematicians to Linguists, all in a hectic pursuit to break the German code)   and the Germans.   The simple explanation behind the logic of Enigma is a demonstration of SimonS's  ability to express the technical in the simplest of terms.<br />   I found the  description and concept of  DES , the breakthrough of  asymmetric ciphers , the concept of public key and Private keys, digital signatures  especially illuminating. <br />   The background leading to the development of PGP by Zimmerman and its features is an highlight and very topical.  Next time I buy anything from the Web, i will appreciate the technology of security which happens in the backend;  <br /> The politics of encryption between the camps for free speech vs Government control  is fascinating and becomes all the more urgent in the light of 9/11 and Govt attempts to curtail and control.<br />   Even if you have a passing intrest in science, you will find this book worthwhile to spend time on .  Don't get intimidated by the term Cryptography. This is a not-to-be-missed books.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|alright people, stop crying sellout and grow up...i dont see why so many people refuse to grow with the band and basically insist they keep putting out 'Slipknot' and 'IOWA&quot;...for those that havent seen the ads, this album is tagged with the line &quot;Forget everything that you know...Slipknot is reborn in 2004&quot;, and i gotta say its for the better!...this album shows how focused and cohesive the band can be, they sound tighter as a unit and more controlled into a more bludgeoning force than ever...Corey's voice is still strong but you can tell the Stone Sour influences in his vocal style...and yes, there are two acoustic tracks in 'Circle' and 'Vermilion Pt. 2' (one of the best songs on the album) on this album, they show a whole new side to Slipknot that we didn't know existed before and are brimming with emotion and the trademark creepy lyrics, as well there are haunting electronics on the album closer 'Danger - Keep Away'...however, dont even think that the Knot has gone soft, the rage and brutality are ever present on hard-hitting tracks like 'The Blister Exists', 'Pulse of the Maggots' and the explosive 'Three Nil'...as well, one cannot forget the undeniable catchiness of the first single 'Duality' which has taken rock radio by storm, and is already a crowd favorite...overall, this album is absolutely incredible, showing a revitalized and reinvented Slipknot that is set keep kicking ass all over the planet, and if you refuse to grow and evolve with the band than dont bother, but if you're sticking with them like me and all the other loyal maggots, then strap in and hold on for the ride!...the whole album is amazing, but some of the standout tracks for me are 'The Blister Exists', 'Three Nil', 'Duality', 'Circle', 'Vermilion Pt. 2', 'Pulse of the Maggots', 'Before I Forget', and 'Danger - Keep Away'
B000002572|5.0|Where would classic rock be had Boston's self-titled debut album not been released? This is one of the greatest cds I own. 3 years ago, I had never heard of them...and now I own all of their albums and even saw them in concert last summer - which was an experience I will never forget! If you're new to classic rock, I think Boston's debut album would be a terrific place to start.
B000002J0B|1.0|This CD just not good.  Man who sing songs look a like a man and sound like woman, like woman feeling painful too much, guitar player use guitar that sound cheap, just loud and songs making no sense.  Also naked children on CD cover!  I just try to warn people careful spending good earned money on strange CD. And music fan from Houston, in your review you misspell many words so it look like your english not so great either.
B00018D44U|5.0|I was never a fan of Norah's, but the week this cd was released every music store in town was playing it in heavy rotation, so i started to like it, then i decided to buy it and i love it! it took me ages to get into it though. first i played my favourites and now have worked up to playing the whole cd. My faves would have to be Sunrise, Creeping In, Toes, Humble Me, Don't Miss You At All and The Prettiest Thing. The line in Humble Me 'Baby Teresa she's got your eyes, i see you all the time, when she asks about her daddy i never know what to say', really got to me. it's such a sad song..it made me think of Norah as a mom though, which was kind of weird, but i think she'd be a great one : ) This CD is fantastic and well worth the money. What's the enhanced bit on this CD?
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is awesome. Maroon 5 rocks my socks!!
B00002DE0S|5.0|This is a very good recording of the Concerto's. I think one of the best out there. He uses so much emotion that you can clearly hear. another recording you should look for of the concertos is rubinstein's it's also quite good...
B000002I6T|5.0|In my effort to find more mellow music like &quot;Woodstock&quot; by CSNY et all, I ran across this album in one of those Campus Used Album stores in the early 70's.  I picked it up for a buck.  Then during a entire wicked weekend, listened to side one continously.  That marvelous record player would start the album over and over.  Night and day, it played.  People yelling and people screaming to turn it off.  I made a munch run Sunday at noon, and when I got back, it was gone and in its place was Deja Vu.  Some how I survived to today.  Now I can set the CD to play both sides, continously.
0312995423|3.0|The book was a very easy read, and if I didn't know anything about cryptography or the internet, I probably wouldn't have noticed the glaring errors. As it was, they detracted enough from the story for me that I have to give it a lower rating.<br />A few things that really irritated me:<BR>A 64-Bit key does not require 64 characters, only 8 (maybe 11 if converted to printable text).<br />I don't know where he got the &quot;Bergofsky Principle&quot; about unbreakable ciphers, but I think Claude Shannon showed in 1949 that perfect secrecy is possible (a one-time pad is an unbreakable cipher if used properly).<br />A code-breaking program can't contract a virus just from decrypting something.<br />If you can break a 64-bit key in 5 minutes by brute force, it would not take you 10 minutes to crack a 128-bit key, it would take about 20 billion minutes, or about 38,000 years. The description of the translator sounded like brute force.
B0001AP12G|4.0|All you so-called, would-be, hip-hop know-it-alls who criticize this album for not being true can kiss this. While &quot;The College Drop-out&quot; will not resurrect hip-hop (is that really necessary anyway?), it is unquestionably one of the better efforts of the genre.  Kanye's lyrics are remarkably insightful - &quot;we wasn't supposed to make it past 25, joke's on you we still alive&quot; - and thought-provoking. Y'all need to WAKE UP (as Missy and Jay would say)...and that joint with Talib and Common - &quot;Get 'Em High&quot; - is kah-ray-zee. Anybody with any sense of legit music will appreciate and value this album.
B0000584V3|5.0|I have read over many pages of reviews on Blackwater Park, and I am quite pleased to see the support Opeth is receiving from intelligent people. However, I also see many, many reviewers giving this phenomenal album a single star. This dusgusts me. I read a review saying that anyone who wanted to listen to real music should listen to bands like Good Charlotte and Grade 8. I strongly hope this was a joke. I've listened with an open mind to Good Charlotte, and they are nothing but a no-talent, can't-decide-if-they're-punk-or-goth, sell-out MTV band that writes songs about suicide with touching videos only to show the world that they know something about cliche &amp;quot;teenage angst&amp;quot; and depression.       Wow, that was pretty rough, wasn't it?      But fine, go ahead, like Good Charlotte. But don't insult Opeth simply because you don't like the rougher sort of vocals Mikael Akerfeldt employs. Not everyone does, it's understandable. They were an acquired taste for me. The same reviewer that cited Good Charlotte as &amp;quot;good music&amp;quot; (perhaps simply because they have &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; in their name?) complained that Opeth is &amp;quot;nothing but a scream band with no talent what so ever&amp;quot; (by the way, whatsoever is one word).      First of all, the quality of Opeth lyrics surpasses that of any band I've ever heard. The dark and haunting poetry that flows from Akerfeldt's pen does not paint a scenery before you, but envelopes you in that scenery. Opeth has been oftencategorized as progressive, and that alone refutes any talk of &amp;quot;no talent.&amp;quot; Progressive music is about establishing a pattern of music, and then varying it to different degrees. Those patterns weave in and out of each other, harmonizing and working together to create beautiful music. It takes a far greater knowledge of music theory to coherently structure anything remotely close to being progressive than it does to create a two-minute punk song, the likesof which Good Charlotte probably churns out in under half an hour. The reason Opeth, Dream Theater, and Yes songs run on for over ten minutes most often (of course the Yes epic &amp;quot;Close to the Edge&amp;quot; at around 18 minutes, Dream Theater's &amp;quot;A Change of Seasons&amp;quot; at 23, and Dream Theater's &amp;quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence at a whopping 42 minutes) is because they are more than just songs they are writing. These progressive bands are writing symphonies that cannot be concluded in any short amount of time. The songs are long because a vast amount of time and effort was put into them, not to mention skill and knowledge. The bottom line is, saying that Opeth has no talent is like saying that sugar tastes salty, that the ocean is made of sand, or that the sun is a ball of ice.      For any new readers looking into Opeth, please disregard the one-star reviews completely. They are unfair and completely irrelevent. Blackwater Park may be the highlight of Opeth's career and is definitely worth a listen. If you don't like it, fair enough, but don't insult it on unjust grounds. Respect the music.
0790729393|3.0|Boys from hell's kitchen get in jail.  Tortured and raped by guards.  Grow up and seek revenge Monte-Christo style.  The plot is good, if a little bit too straightforward.      The most interesting character in the movie by far is Father Bobby (De Niro), a 'cool' priest who is as comfortable beating up an abusive father as preaching.  There's Fat Mancho who gives out street wisdom to kids; Danny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman), the lawyer whose skill consists of muttering to himself.  These characters keep the movie interesting.      The boys themselves, however, have little individuality.  And like all coming-of-age movies (American Graffiti, Stand By Me, October Sky), there has to be oldies playing, and the number of boys has to be exactly 4.  Young Carol is an underdeveloped character whom the director expects the audience to remember later on. The prison guards (Kevin Bacon, Terry Kinney) do what the plot expects them to do, and King Benny provides simple mob flick entertainment.  The grown-up boys developed some characters but, ironically, even with the Monte Christo plot, one cannot help but get the sense that the boys, whose lives would have otherwise been very unextraordinary, were saved by the tragic event.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A fantastically made movie about drugs and the world around them, however made in an artistic and taboo breaking way. A very honest look at the world of drugs and the people that get swallowed up in it.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Set in the Napoleonic Wars of the early nineteeth century, Master and Commander is based on the Patrick O'Brian's historical novels. The essence of the story is a chase starting off the coast of Brazil and ending up off the Galapogos islands, between a French ship with its clever commander and the HMS Surprise- the ship at the center of the story.<br />The movie itself is richly laid out in genuine props of the era, which succeeds in giving it an air of realism. Russell Crowe does a fine job as Captain 'Lucky Jack' Aubrey, a man with a history of experience and well respected by his sometimes grumbling men. The supporting cast is excellent with a list of characters that adds to the richness of life on a seafaring ship of that era.<br />Crowe doesn't grandstand and take over the movie allowing the story, other characters and action to speak for themselves. A lot of credit should of course go to Peter Weir for his direction and his adaption of O'Brian's novel.<br />Master and Commander is very reminiscent of old Hollywood epics and a quite enjoyable movie. I honestly didn't expect much and came away very satisfied and entertained.<br />Highly entertaining and recommended.

B00004RF9I|5.0|You want to see some great acting!  I'm mean do you really want to see some great acting?  This all star cast is a testament to the movie's greatness.  William Holden, Faye Dunnaway, Robert Duvall, Ned Beatty are all outstanding.  But it's Peter Finch who died just before the Academy Awards and recieved a postumous Oscar for the mad prophet himself, Howard Beale.  A man who single handedly brings a Broadcasting Network from worst to first.  The actions of the executives in this movie are no different then what they do today.  On my top 5 list of the greatest movies ever!
B00001U0DP|5.0|The pride of Italy Roberto Benini in his WWII masterpiece, tastefully combining comedy with drama in an oscar winning foreign film. A must have. Make sure you watch it in Italian with the subtitles.
0393324818|1.0|Michael Lewis seems unaware that the A's front office is hamming it up in front of him.  Poor journalism if he couldn't figure it out.
0780622553|5.0|In a city covered in perpetual darkness a group of strange beings known as &quot;The Strangers&quot; attempt to understand what makes us human and identify what the soul is.  These strangers change the city and erase peoples memories and assign them all new lives, but one of their specimens also has this unique power.  Now he must save the day and prove that he's not a killer.<br />Much has been said about Dark City.  Roger Ebert called it the best movie of 98.  A visually stunning sci-fi/noir tale of a man who wakes up with no knowledge of who he is or how he got to where he is.  From the opening narration by Dr. Schreber (Sutherland), we learn that is a world that only mirrors our own.  The inhabitants are nothing more than guinea pigs for a group of &quot;strangers from another solar system&quot; to study.  Schreber knows that Murdoch (Sewell) has the ability to &quot;tune&quot; where he can change things around him by concentrating.  The strangers also have this power and use it to change the city and imprint the inhabitants with all knew lives to see what makes us tick.  But they must first take care of Murdoch who they in the process of imprinting with the life of a serial killer.  Then we meet Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) and Emma (Connelly), the detective on the case and Murdoch's wife.  He must learn who he really is, stop the strangers, and prove he is not a serial killer.<br />Dark City is a movie that's hard to forget, not only for its visuals but its great story and acting.  Proyas (The Crow) gives us more of the same dark and dreary visuals from the The Crow, but in Dark City they are on a grander scale.  Proyas delivers visuals with a flare and style all his own.  Proyas and his writing team also delivered an original and brilliant story.  The acting is dead on here too.  Sewell is great as Murdock, Sutherland is amazing as the doctor, Hurt plays the hard edged copy well, and Connelly as usual looks great and is a hell of an actress.  Throw all those elements together into an exhilarating comic book type flick and you have Dark City.<br />What you've heard about this flick is true.  Its a masterpiece!  A brilliant and beautiful film that you won't soon forget.  It's not just a sci fi or a noir flick, its much more.  Its a film about what makes us human.  Although we are surrounded by darkness, the human spirit will triumph and that's just what Dark City is. A triumph.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Not only is this movie condescending towards Japan, it is exceptionally dull, has annoying characters and the subtitles on the DVD do NOT translate the Japanese dialogue. At least it acknowledges the existence of another counrty other than the US, unlike most Hollywood movies.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Tom Hanks at his best. A very intelligent comedy and one of the best reviews of 20th century America in a very light hearted way. Fully deservant of the shower of Oscars it received. Must have!
B00002DE0S|5.0|First of all, I will repeat the words of a fellow reviewer: &quot;This recording shows, far more than any other I've heard, Chopin's ardor for the beautiful but unattainable young soprano Constancia Gladkowska.&quot;  I agree.  Especially in the Adagio from the F minor concerto. Zimerman's treatment is so beautiful it has brought tears to my eyes.  No other version of the many I have heard has had this effect on me.
B00009RDG9|4.0|Aaron Hallam (Benicio Del Toro), has went off the deep end using his special forces killing techniques to fillet hunters who kill with &quot;irreverence&quot; as some sort of social statement.  Now it's up to the man who taught him L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones), a professional tracker and good ol' boy to bring him in.<br />The Hunted is simply a fun, sometimes silly non-stop action extravaganza low on story, dialogue, character development, and overall plot and heavy as a sumo wrestler on visceral, fast paced, beautifully choreographed and even more beautifully photographed action sequences.<br />Staring in Kosovo, in what can only be described as a vision of hell on Earth, we meet Hallam a special forces op/assassin who witness brutal mass murder at the hands of some tyrannical military force.  After his mission is carried out Hallam returns to the world and is given the silver star.  He then disappears into the woods and begins to carry out his crusade for animal rights, or so we're supposed to believe even though the details are hazy.  There's also a moment where Hallam says he was set up, but that's quickly forgotten along with his animal rights stance and we're left to believe that the guy just snapped.  Tommy Lee Jones is brought in as is the case in all these movies where only a retired agent/cop/tough guy can bring down this new threat, a threat he helped create.  After a brief, very brief, ploy by a shady government official Bonham jumps aboard to help bring in &quot;his boy.&quot;  From there we're treated to chase after chase, hand to hand combat after knife fight and it's all breathtakingly captured by William Friedkin of The Exorcist fame.  A man whose made a name for himself by filming amazing car chase sequences.  So who better to call the shots on The Hunted, which is really one amazing chase sequence after another, than Billy himself who pulls everything off...amazingly!<br />You have to give the guy credit for not going the route seemingly all other action movies go these days when it comes to filming high octane action sequences.  I'm talking about endless slow-mo's and irritating Matrix-style visuals.  Here Friedkin keeps the action going at a fast pace.  The many hand to hand combat sequences between Hallam and Bonham are done with so much realism you I almost found myself grunting and grimacing along with the actors.  Bravo.  As far as the story is concerned it's all pretty much window dressing, thin window dressing at that.  Void of dialogue with all other characters (excluding Jones and Del Toro) there just for show.  Although Jones and Del Toro, who are great actors, spend most of the movie running and fighting it still took much skill to play these rolls only relying on physical prowess and the ability to show emotion without speaking.  Bravo again.  There's an out of place theology lesson at the beginning of the film that's just silly.  The story of Abraham and Isaac is employed simply for pretentious purposes I'm sure and carry little weight in the film itself.  Hallam looked up to Bonham as a father and at one point Bonham refers to Hallam as &quot;my boy.&quot;  And of course Bonham is brought in by the government to essentially kill Hallam, but that's as far as the Bible lesson goes.<br />The Hunted has it's fair share of goof.  I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times at how silly some things came off as being.  Hallam's initial motive for killing hunters was simply ridiculous.  Also I have to say that Tommy Lee Jones seems a bit old to be engaging in hand to hand combat with anyone.  The final showdown is simply a one sided fight to what was ultimately a predictable finale that for a moment had me believing things were going to shift.  Alas they didn't and the end seemed like a cop-out quickie to a vaguely symbolic finale.  <br />After watching The Hunted I came away smiling, superbly entertained, and recounting the numerous goofy moments.  I also praised Benicio Del Toro for his great, creepy performance, the break neck action sequences and director Friedkin.  But now in retrospect I find much sadness in the story and the characters.  It's really about two people neither one good nor evil, but walking that thin red line between the two.  The Hunted isn't a great film, but one that resonates in my mind causing a number of emotions.  If you're an action buff, The Hunted will surely suffice if you're in the mood for a quick action fix.  However, and it sounds weird saying (or rather typing) this, but I think there's much to be discussed about the characters, Hallam in particular.  I've found much to empathize with both men and ultimately feel sorrow for them.  Check it out!   
B0001ZXM54|5.0|I first took notice of ZZ Top just a couple years ago.  A country music fan for sixteen years (all my life, up to that point), I jumped at a new album that came out: SHARP DRESSED MEN, a tribute to a band called ZZ Top.  I bought the album, enjoyed the songs...bought ZZ Top's GREATEST HITS...and became a fan.<br />I'm from Central Illinois.  Every now and then, I get a little notice of the music that goes on in Texas.  Now, I can't begin to touch the entire iceberg (let's face it, I'm from a rural farming county), or even get ahold of it's tip.  I know I'm not a thirty-five year ZZ Top fan.  But that doesn't mean I don't like these guys, or respect the awesome talent they have.<br />RANCHO TEXICANO collects some incredible tunes (what I'm guessing is ZZ Top's best).  From the haunting blues (evident throughout the album, really) of \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Just Got Paid\\" and \\"Blue Jean Blues,\\" to the sexually charged \\"La Grange,\\" \\"I Thank You,\\" \\"Tush,\\" \\"Legs\\" (oh, what a classic that one is!), and \\"Tube Snake Boogie,\\" these songs are classic rock n rollers with a mix of everything else.  You want trend-setting rockers?  How about \\"Francene,\\" \\"Heard It on the X,\\" \\"Cheap Sunglasses,\\" \\"Gimme All Your Lovin,\\" and \\"Velcro Fly\\" (this last one got immortalized in Stephen King's epic novel, \\"The Wastelands\\").<br />Well, let's face it: you know who ZZ Top is.  Maybe you aren't as familiar with their music as you want to be (or should be), but you know the name and you know the look.  They're icons--and that's a lot to be said for three guys who just play their simple rock/blues songs.  Whether you like rock, punk, pop, country, or blues, ZZ Top has something for you--probably because they started the damned thing!  Buy RANCHO TEXICANO, give it a listen, and then look me in the eye and say that ZZ Top isn't one of the best bands out there.  If you can do it, I'll personally refund your expenses.
B0000399WI|5.0|If you want a prison film, this is one of the best. Subtly beautiful without a doubt, great story, great acting. A pleasure to watch.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Alright, i gave this one a couple of &quot;listens&quot;, and to tell you the truth....it made me want to go to Hot Topic and wear all black. Too bad i snapped out of it, i was lulled in by this cd's repativeness, repeating crappyness. I can't believe people refer to this &quot;band&quot; as metal, they arn't metal, shock/heavy/rap/rock/crap...their own genre just for them.
B00015HVI8|5.0|I have always believed that Stargate SG-1 is one of the best things happening on TV, and I see no reason to change my mind now.<br />There have been rumors going around for a year or so that the final season is near.  Now, with the premier of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; on sci-fi the intent of the show's producers is clear - the tablet found at the end of season 6 that speaks of the &quot;lost city of the ancients&quot; and all the ensuing related plotlines in season 7 refer to the lost city of Atlantis, and are thus the spin-off point for &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;.<br />Having said that, season 6 is definitely worth watching for its theme development around the deepening mystery of Anubis.  Although Daniel Jackson makes several appearances, it is also anti-climactic since I have become fond of Jonas Quinn by this time.  In season 6, I think that the character of Sam Carter has been getting a progressively tougher edge since the death of Daniel Jackson, and I'm not sure I like it all that much.  I much preferred the softer, more personable Samantha from the previous five seasons.  Perhaps this character evolution is all related to a higher design for the series?<br />The DVDs all come with featurettes and supplementary material and options for the home viewer.  <br />Overall, I give Stargate SG-1, season 6 my usual rating of five stars for continuing to be some of the best TV being produced.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Probably the best translation of a Steven King novel into a movie. You can't miss this one.
B0000683DH|5.0|Back when \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" first hit the theaters, I remember thinking that Khan now ranks with the best movie bad guys of all time.  I think Ricardo Montalban may have turned out the best performance of his career by bringing complexity, passion, pathos, and humanity all at once to the role of Khan.  I'll never be able to read Moby Dick the same way ever again - \\"He tasks me, and I shall have him... I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom, and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up!\\"  Sure, I'm an avowed lifelong trek fan, but I don't think I'm exagggerating this by much.<br />On a more objective note, the movie works very well at multiple levels...  <br />The soundtrack itself is exceptional and, at the time, somewhat ground-breaking for the movie industry.  This is evidenced by the fact that subsequent soundtracks in the sci-fi genre seem to have borrowed from Horner's original score.  I think it was a shame that \\"Khan\\" was not nominated for an Oscar in the original score category.<br />The visual effects, which were state of the art at the time, still hold up over twenty years later.  It serves as a good example and reminder that movies used to have good special effects even in the pre-computer era.<br />The acting was also superior.  I already mentioned that Montalban may have given the performance of his life as \\"Khan\\", but I don't think it ends there.  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley also recaptured the feel of the cameraderie from the original series.  I am aware that Shatner is often criticized for being overly-dramatic, but my opinion is that this may also rank among the top two or three performance of Shatner's career as well (including the TV show).  One of the more memorable moments came following Khan's failed attempt to have Chekov and Terrell kill Kirk: [Kirk to Khan] \\"You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman you keep missing the mark.\\", which was, of course, followed by Kirk's timeless \\"KHAAAANNNN!!!\\" exclamatory.  The acting was so good, IMHO, that the audience doesn't really notice that Kirk and Khan never really meet face-to-face, and the movie doesn't suffer because of it.<br />The Director's Edition DVD comes with a well-produced disc of supplementary material (interviews, commentaries, etc.) as well.  I particularly liked the recent interviews with the actors on their recollections from when the movie was being produced.  My favorite interview was Ricardo Montalban telling how horrified he was upon realizing how much he sounded like Mr. Roarke from Fantasy Island when he started reading his lines for the first time - \\"This is going to be a disaster!  The audience is going to laugh at me!\\"  He then tells of how he fixed the problem by requesting a copy of the original TV show \\"Space Seed\\" where the crew of the Enterprise first encountered Khan, and watching it over and over again until he began to recall his original work with the character.  Shatner also delivers a pretty good interview as he describes how he'll one day make Nimoy and Harve Bennett pay for not letting him in on the secret that by the time  the movie had been shot that they already had plans to bring Spock back.  Whether or not Shatner really knew is irrelevant - the interview is delivered w/ a deadpan that leaves the viewer in stitches.  There is also a good piece about how the visual effects were accomplished.<br />Overall, I rate \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" as the best movie in the entire series of Star Trek theatrical releases, and one of the better movies ever produced in the sci-fi genre as a whole.
B00000F0D1|5.0|The scary thing about Steven King's novels is that they're not that ridiculous. This one in particular, could very well happen. Just remember the penguin always looks south.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I've heard so many people say they didn't like 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' because of all the fake blood. Well first of all, this film collection was made to pay homage to old kung-fu films. Though I'm not a fan of kung-fu movies, I thought it was very creative to do so in the movie.<br />'Kill Bill, Volume 2' is a little bit different. The action has slowed down some, and the story has sped up. You find out a lot of details in this movie that tell you the backstory of the wedding where The Bride almost died, you see her being trained by a Japanese master, you see why the Black Mamba wears an eyepatch over her eye. And then you see the Bride kill Bill. I will not go into details on how she manages to do so. You know how they beeped out the Brides' name in the first one? Not in this one. You'll learn her name later in the movie. Hope you enjoy this film as much as I did.
B00004RFFS|5.0|A different view on vampirism, a city dwelling kind of vampire who enjoys the good life. Based on one of Anne Rice's several excellent books. Great acting by both Banderas, Pitt and Cruise. A pity they didn't produce any of the other books in this quality.
B00008S2VG|2.0|This is very average sounding. Nothing to write home about. Nothing fails, Love Profusion, title Track, etc. have that horrible electronica sound. Madonna sounds flat as well. Her whole look lately is freaky. She's looking way, way too Mannish.
6305718954|4.0|This movie is somewhere between taboo breaking and sacrilegious. It's portrayal of the church as a corrupted institution is second to none. Wonderful acting and effects surrounding a very interesting story.
B0002C4JE4|2.0|I bought this CD since it had 2 songs I wanted not on last year's Best Of (the 1976 version of Something in the Way She Moves and the album version of Country Roads). Since this was just released last month I assumed it was remastered (they had already remastered most of these songs for the Best Of). Well, it was not remastered - what a rip-off. Shame on you Warner Bros. Stick with last year's Best Of, and stay away from all those other recently released Greatest by Warner, like Doobie Bros, Carly Simon, etc (I bet they're not remastered either).
B00006FDCD|4.0|The second best translation of a Steven King novel into a movie (the best being Carrie). It caused a whole generation of people afraid of clowns. The other option is reading the 1500 page book.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Just like Modest Mouse this is crap. Horribly put together music-videos and painful uncreative lyrics. Need I say more?
B0000640VO|5.0|A beautiful movie about a simple, and pretty weird girl. Pay particular attention to the beautiful color selection and Audrey Tautou's flawless acting. Amelie is the feel-good movie of our times and is sure to bring a smile to anyone's face.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I got this c.d I did not know much about Evanescence. Evanescence is a great band! Amy Lee's cool voice is rare and gifted. It takes a break from the racist crap you hear so much that &quot;gangster rap&quot;. Evanescence makes Avril Lavigne look like Britney Spears.The lyrics are lyrics that most people can very much relate to and some of the lines even speak to me, as crazy as that sounds. The band's talent is great and gets stuck in your head after only a few listens. It isn't about prostitutes and pimps it is about the things people go through. This c.d is most defianetly the best c.d I own and after almost a year of listening to it I still have not got tired of it. The best thing about Evanescence is unlike most c.d's like The White Stripes and The Offspring(which I both like by the way) on this c.d it has more of a serious tone and all songs have sort of a different vibe and is consistent. You will like all of the songs and not just one or two which is really a rare quality to find. Evanescence in short is creative,talented and produces beatiful music buy this c.d and you will not regret it and you will have spent your money wisely. Trust me!
0800177177|4.0|You can't go wrong with Drakula, and this is the best translation to film of Bram Stoker's Masterpiece to date.
B000002L68|4.0|Some labels just have a habit of excluding certain song(s) off movie soundtracks.  There are some songs or instrumental beats in a movie that a person may love and hence purchase the soundtrack not for the heck of it but because of that song(s). But leave it to Prince to exclude Apollonia's \\"Sex Shooter\\" and the beautiful piano arrangement/piece whatever you want to call it, which was played by his \\"on-screen\\" father on the piano. But hey, you can't win 'em all.  However, the soundtrack is delicious.  Prince is sexy and the lyrics are orgasmic---apps~
079073804X|5.0|This is probably the best horror film to date, still an excellent movies even though the effects are dated. It destroyed (Linda Blair's) the little girl's career as an actress because people were never able to disassociate her with the possesed girl. She was only 15 when she made the movie.

B00005R23Z|5.0|The best exploration of the possibility of genetically modified people becoming a separate social and economic class leaving behind and opressing those who are not genetically modified.
B000059XUI|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first movie, this suffers from production problems as a result of Donner's sacking by the Salkinds. <BR>It's plainly obvious which scenes were shot by Donner and which weren't. And sadly, they left out a hefty chunk of what Donner had filmed, giving Lester the top billing as director. <BR>Another sad omission is John Williams rousing score, which has been poorly duplicated. Not nearly as uplifting and powerful as John William's efforts in one.<BR>Although the primary focus is on Lois and Superman's relationship, it doesn't save this picture from stinking. Even Gene Hackman's wonderful performance(which was all directed by Donner, with the exception of scenes where Lester used a body double and an impersonator for Hackman's voice) can't salvage this.<BR>So why do I give this three stars? Because it does have it's moments, though scattered, and I live in the hope that a Richard Donner cut, using primarily all his footage, which would bring back all the scenes with Marlon Brando, will eventually pop up and finally put to bed the question of what could have been.
B000050FEN|5.0|A series of freak murders. A detective ready to retire and a new detective make this film one of the best in the drama genre. Will keep you on your feet till the very end. A very similar idea as other inteligent murder mystery thrillers like &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; and &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; but this is the best of the lot.
B000002UAO|5.0|And you know they can't be wrong... the truth will not and can not be denied!
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens four years ago and have shot around 6,000 photos with it (4000 digital, 2000 35mm).  Autofocus is very fast and quiet, which is typical of the Canon USM lenses.  I would not recommend a Canon lens that does not have the ultrasonic motor (USM) focusing.  Optics are sharp throughout the focusing range.<br />The lens is fairly heavy and after a few months of use, you will likely find that the weight of the glass is enough to make the lens telescope out when it's around your neck.  If you want a compact lens that will let you take great pictures in a wide range of settings, this is probably the best lens you could get for a Canon camera.  If you're a pro, you'll probably have a backpack full of lenses and you're not reading this anyway, so I'm not talking to you.  If you want something you can sling over your shoulder and not think about when you take the kids to Disney World, get a cheaper, lighter lens.<br />The Image Stabilizer (IS) makes the lens a lot more expensive (some lenses are offered with and without it), so you should know what you're paying for.  Some notes about the Image Stabilizer:<br /> - The image stabilizer itself is basically a spinning lens element (piece of glass) that acts as a gyroscope.  When the lens moves slightly, such as camera shake caused by your pulse, the gyroscopic element stays put while the other elements move.  Because the gyroscopic element is no longer in line with the other elements, it effectively bends the light just enough to compensate for the lens moving.<br /> - Having the IS feature does not mean that you can take crisp photos with a 1/20 sec exposure while jumping on a trampoline.  What it means is that you can often get away with not carrying a tripod in normal lighting, and in low light when your photos would be very blurry (assuming you're not using really fast film), the IS will make the images significantly less blurry.  An obvious corollary is that you can avoid using a flash in many situations when a flash is undesirable or prohibited.<br /> - The rule of thumb to get crisp photos without image stabilization is that your shutter speed should not be longer than 1 over your focal length.  So if you are taking a picture zoomed in at 135mm, your shutter speed needs to be 1/135 sec or faster, and since no camera I know of has a 1/135 setting, that means going up to 1/160 sec (on cameras with stops in 1/3 increments) or faster.  The image stabilizer means that you can go 2 f-stops slower than you normally could using the rule I just explained.  So if you're shooting at 135mm and you have the IS switched on, you can shoot at 1/40 sec instead of 1/160 sec.  That means four times as much light goes past the shutter, or that you can get the same quality results with 1/4 of the ambient light you would normally need.<br /> - There are some times when you SHOULD NOT use the IS feature.  You should definitely not use it if you are in a car, on a roller coaster, if you are walking, or in any other situation where the camera is moving or vibrating a lot.  You will get blurrier than normal images because the gyroscopic element is constantly moving all over the place, trying to prevent the image from moving.  Only have IS switched on when you are using the camera in a normal, stationary, handheld manner.  You should also not use IS when you are using a tripod, or when you have the camera resting on a vibration-less surface for an image.  The reason is that the gyroscopic element will be spinning even though it's not needed, and while this isn't really bad, the motion could decrease photo quality (I've never noticed this, but this is what Canon claims), and it is unnecessarily using battery power.<br /> - Finally, not all of Canon's IS lenses use the same IS technology; many of the more expensive and newer lenses are better, but it was hard enough for me to come up with what this lens cost--it'll be awhile before I can rationalize three times as much for an upgrade.<br />Onelast note about third-party lenses, in case you're thinking about it.  I know the price may be compelling but there genuinely does seem to be major quality differences, and while all Canon EOS lenses work will all Canon EOS cameras, no matter how many years apart they are in design, it has happened several times that even the best of the third party lenses (Sigma, some others) do not function properly with new Canon cameras.  I happily buy knock-offs with other things, but not with lenses, flashes, or other camera components that actually communicate with my camera.
0517548232|4.0|Henry Hazlitt's book starts with a single lesson-that economics means looking beyond the immediate effects of any act or policy to the consequences of it for everyone.  The rest of the book is a series of short chapters giving examples of the application of this lesson.<br />  Hazlitt's lesson in itself is great.  I wish it were better known.  His examples vary in quality.  Some are a bit dated; natural for a book which mostly dates to 1946.  The chapter on rent control is as relevant today as ever.  The discussion of the cost of war and other types of destructive activities punctures a misconception that is still common.  In his discussion of unemployment, however, he fails to mention immigration and population growth as part of the cause.<br />  The section on tariffs is good as far as it goes.  The problem with his analysis is that transportation today is in effect heavily subsidized.  Oil companies and the like don't have to pay for the air pollution and climate change caused by their products, or for roads, or for the armies protecting the oil flow.  Subsidized transportation costs make nonsense of the idea that local and imported goods are really on the same footing.  Free trade with countries having non-existent environmental laws simply sets up a race to the bottom, with responsible companies heading for bankruptcy and irresponsible companies destroying the economic foundations of their own countries.<br />  Hazlitt swallows whole the idea that growth in GNP is always good and can continue indefinitely.  Given that GNP doesn't include the costs of pollution, resource depletion, the effects of population growth, or quality of life, this is very questionable.  Hazlitt needs to apply his own &quot;one lesson&quot; here.<br />  Hazlitt states in his first sentence that economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man.  I tend to agree.  Hazlitt points out some of them and does it in a very readable way.  Hazlitt fails with some of the other fallacies.  Read the book, but read it with a grain of salt.fallacies.

1400032717|5.0|THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME is a book that is certainly capturing people's attention. In some ways the story of an autistic teenager trying to solve a mystery is not the most captivating of topics. The only way such a topic could come to life is through the skills of a gifted writer, which is the reason THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME is a best seller and the book's main character Christopher Boone will always have a place in the hearts of those who have read this extraordinary work.<br />The greatest strength of the book is the main character and narrator, Christopher, who has Asperger's Syndrome. Haddon's use of the first person enables the reader to understand the world from Christopher's perspective. We learn about his extraordinary gift (his mathematical ability) as well as his personality quirks. We also hear from Christopher why he acts in certain ways which are disturbing to the people he encounters. While Christopher may be unable to interact with the world around him, he is a keen observer of everything that happens. We feel empathy for Christopher when we meet the people in his life and realize the tragedy that has been so much a part of his experience. We admire Christopher's pluck and reserve as he accomplishes things that are difficult for him. Because the reader loves Christopher, the book becomes mesmerizing and we follow his every move with attention.<br />There are a number of reasons why this book should be read. The first, and perhaps most impelling reason is that it is entertaining. The author's writing style is straightforward and Christopher is engaging. Even though most of us would believe we are different from Christopher, after reading the book any one of us could say that there is some Christopher in all of us.<br />Would be writers will find the book fascinating. Haddon's literary skills are remarkable. He also includes little pictures, puzzles, games, and the like which make the book highly original. In an interview I read, he stated that the impetus for the book was not Christopher himself, but the dead dog. He found the dead dog intriguing and decided to tell its story. Haddon believed the best way to do so was through the character of Christopher. He captures Christopher's voice and keeps it consistent throughout the book.ginal.

B0000029DD|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of my favorite discs.  When the album originally came out I was overwhelmed by the range, ecclecticism and rawness of Buckley's voice and lyrics.  His covers are also adeptly rendered.  <br />Buckley's talent is lost on some, but anyone with an appreciation for creative and daring musical exploration will enjoy this collection.  Years after first buying the album I still have it in &quot;active rotation.&quot;  This is not for everyone.  Buckley seems to be a love him/hate him artist, but he managed to indelibly mark the musical landscape and is often cited by other illustrious artists as a point of inspiration and reference.
B00008438V|5.0|I recently bought this movie for the sole purpose of Ilan Mitchell-Smith. Not only is he a major hottie in the film but his acting was superb.  I have read many reviews about this movie and that was another factor in me buying this movie.  I have also watched Ilan Mitchell-Smith in the Wonderworks movie &quot;How to be a Perfect Person in Just Three Days&quot;.  I would highly recommend that movie to anyone who has not seen it.  Like many others I found Weird Science to be funny especially when the guys wore bras on their heads.  I also loved this movie as it was made in the 80's (my fave decade).  A must to see.
B00008BRB5|5.0|While Synchronicity may not be The Police's most musically technical album, it is their best. The songwriting on here is nothing short of amazing, even the non-single songs. &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is an ultimate classic, &quot;King of Pain's&quot; upbeat melody and melancholy lyrics are amazing, and &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger's&quot; intense groove will all blow your mind. As previously stated, there's real jems here that weren't singles, such as &quot;Synchronicity I &amp; II,&quot; &quot;Murder by Numbers,&quot; and &quot;O My God.&quot; The technical production on the album is also fantastic, with a clear, punchy sound, a stark contrast to the bloated deep rumble of late 70's rock and disco. This album is essential for any fan of The Police and/or 80's music, and should be required listening for anyone trying to start their own power trio.
B00005A0V0|5.0|I recall a review that described this album as &quot;faultless&quot; - this does not do it justice.  This album is an epic with its flagship opus &quot;Nine Feet Underground&quot; providing some of the best keyboards (Dave Sinclair), Bass (cousin Richard) and drums (Richard Coughlan) you will ever hear.  Jimmy Hastings' flute and sax add the finishing touches together with Pye Hastings' vocals and conservative guitar work.  The album, with its whimsical lyrics is a reflection of the era but 33 years on it is still a classic.<BR>If I had to be critical, I would probably have left out &quot;Love to Love You&quot; but its almost relief to have a break from clasic track after classic track.<BR>If you are going to have one progressive rock album in your collection, it has to be either this or Camel's &quot;Moonmadness&quot; - Dont ask me to choose!
B000089RV6|5.0|Where to start with Back in Black?  This is easily AC/DC's best work and is certainly one of the greatest hard rock/metal albums ever made.  <br />A tribute to former signer Bon Scott, Back in Black opens with the tolling of bells in the intro of the haunting Hells Bells. It only gets better from there.  Each of the 10 tracks on Back in Black are outstanding.  Of course the 'hits' Back in Black and You Shook Me All Night Long have helped this album maintain it's popularity.  But there are a lot of albums with two 'hits' that don't have the staying power of Back in Black.<br />24 years after it's initial release Back in Black still delivers.  If you are a fan of hard rock or heavy metal you will love Back in Black.
B000006TSC|5.0|As a life long Camel fan, I am used to certain quarters criticising Camel's change of style for this album.  Sinclair's exceptional Bass guitair adds a jazzier feel to the music while his vocals are more refined and are a vast imnprovement on Latimer's or Bardens. Admittedly there are one or two weaker tracks such as &quot;Wing and a Prayer&quot; and &quot;You make me Smile&quot; but the inclusion of &quot;Summer Lightening&quot; with its rippling keyboards that builds to a blistering guitar solo and Andy Ward's exceptional drumming, is enough to place this in my top 5 favourite Camel albums.  <BR>&quot;Down on the Farm&quot; is a whimsical Canterbury-esque piece, unsurprisingly penned by ex-Caravan member Richard Sinclair while &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;The Sleeper&quot; are strong tracks that you would expect from Camel, with the latter not sounding too disimilar from the classic &quot;Lunar Sea&quot;. <BR>Dont be put off by the change of style - this album is a must for all Camel fans and lover's of good music.
B00008BXJG|4.0|Highway to Hell is considered by many to be AC/DC's best work.  I agree that it is their best with Bon Scott but not their best overall.<br />AC/DC again explored some bluesey riffs on Walk All Over You and Night Prowler but they had honed the skill since 1976's Dirty Deeds.  Don't get me wrong this is a heavy album.  One of their heaviest.  The songwriting is excellent the Young brothers' guitar work is crisp and clean and Scott's vocals are delivered with his trademark snarl.<br />This is an outstanding album and should be a staple in any hard rock/metal fans collection.
B0002234LS|4.0|After seeing the previews for this movie, I didn't really want to watch it.  But it had a few surprises in store and was well done.  Certainly worth watching.
B000002IRL|5.0|Horrorscope is the crowning achievement from Overkill.  They have consistently put out quality album after quality album and you rarely, if ever, hear an Overkill fan that feels like any Overkill album ripped him off (try saying that about many other 80's metal bands with a straight face).<br />Horrorscope seemed to put it all together correctly.  Every song is a classic and today, 13 years later, this album still doesn't sound dated.  It is a true classic and is a must have for any metal fan.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|A good movie - good acting, good plot, and well written.  I was happy to see that Ashton was able to act in a different role than the usual for &quot;That 70s Show&quot; - he did a good job.<br />Worth seeing.
B000084T18|1.0|This album is crap. There was only one good song on the whole album. Don't waste your money on this album like I did. Just buy the single of &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot;
B000002NBY|5.0|I grew up listening to this music and although Ive heard it so many times my tape got warped, it is still in the top five albums I have heard. Although Rhythm of the Saints is also a great album, Paul Simon has not written anything as good as this since he wrote it. Its a classic.

B000000JO3|5.0|Okay, let me admit it upfront: I am a fan of Blink-182, Green Day, and (gasp) Good Charlotte. However,I am not in denial; I know that what I am listening to is pop-rock, if that, and the above bands are in no way punk. But I can't totally have no taste in music if I loved this CD, can I? Knowing my mother would object to the purchase of it, I instead burned it from my father who has some of the same taste in music as I do (some meaning he doesn't like the pop bands but he likes Bad Religion and all that, blah blah blah) and I loved it. The songs were intelligent and lyrical yet had that good guitar sound. There were two or three songs that I found a little strong for me but what can I say? I'm not a hardcore punk; I'm a curious girl who happens to have just found a new band to love.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Since so many people have reviewed this album already, I have no illusions about saying something for the first time nor plan on repeating what has already expressed fully and well.<br />I do still -specially for those people reading this after listening to YFH's follow-up the also impressive &quot;A Ghost Is Born- need to point to a couple of important things that this album show about Wilco's consistently surprising output.<br />This album clearly demonstrates that Jeff Tweedy's musical vision and commitment to shed songwriting skins is remarkable and an inspiration, specially in the current midst of so many Rock and Pop icons continuing to repeat themselves, who at best flavor their &quot;butter&quot; differently but go on churning the same formula, forgetting to take the kind of risks that made them important in the first place.<br />Now, unlike many people have mourned earlier, I don't think this album is an absolute departure from what Wilco has been hailed for before. Although this is not &quot;Summerteeth&quot; or &quot;Being There,&quot; Tweedy's love for Pop has not been renounced, &quot;Kamera,&quot; &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; and  &quot;Pot Kettle Black&quot; proved that.<br />More than abandoning former song-glories, Tweedy has evolved, has taken all that he can do and pushed it further into a new atmosphere. Where Jay Bennet was so instrumental in what the albums that preceded this one sounded like, Jim O'Rourke is now Tweedy's full musical partner.<br />And O'Rourke is no Yoko breaking a great band -actually Yoko did not either!- but rather someone who helped Tweedy say well what he was already prepared to say. His production deepens and thrusts these songs to a higher level. &quot; Ashes of American Flags,&quot; &quot;I am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Radio Cure&quot; are magnificent examples of a composer and a producer making music together that reaches farther that either one would have managed on his own.<br />This is a great album, not the end of a certain Wilco but the evolution of a sound into brave, new and exciting new possibilities.e end of a certain Wilco but the evolution of a sound into brave, new and exciting new possibilities.
B0000033TE|4.0|1973's &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; is Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer's most notorious album. On one hand, it's a longstanding fan favorite, with many ELP enthusiasts naming it as the best ELP album. But on the *other* hand, the album's oh-so-grand musical designs have made it an easy target for critics and other detractors. But for those who can handle Keith, Greg, and Carl's daring-do and ambitiousness, chances are you'll enjoy &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; just fine. The band's treatment of classical favorites &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and Ginastera's &quot;Toccata&quot; are mighty impressive. &quot;Still...You Turn Me On&quot; is a beautiful, classic Greg Lake ballad. &quot;Benny The Bouncer&quot; is another of ELP's quickie ragtime piano numbers, but it's great fun, with Lake singing in a faux-Cockney accent. But the album's centerpiece is unquestionably the group's 30-minute epic about man vs. machine, &quot;Karn Evil 9.&quot; What can I say about this mammoth prog-rock piece that hasn't already been covered---it is indeed a monster, with the band throwing in everything but the kitchen sink, and THEN they throw in the kitchen sink itself! Keith Emerson's take-no-prisoners keyboards are a force of nature all on their own, while Greg Lake's booming bass strongly anchors the proceedings, along with some very commanding lead vocals &amp; excellent lead-guitar work, while Carl Palmer smashes his big fat drumkit like a pro. No doubt about it, Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer's &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; is VERY grandiose, but it's great stuff. It may not be for the faint of heart, but if you love progressive rock, then this album is a most-essential purchase.
B000002LE6|3.0|To my ears, &quot;Lovesexy&quot; was the beginning of the end for Prince, who would go on to record a succession of surprisingly uninteresting and stale albums throughout the 90s. There is just too much going on at once. The percussion, computer keyboards, drums, brass sections, guitars, organs, etc. all tend more toward cacophony than melody. Like Beck's disastrous &quot;Midnight Vultures,&quot; Prince's production here is just too ambitious for its own good. Even the comparatively understated &quot;No&quot; meanders into the attention deficiency that pervades the album, as a noisy ovation of applause and spontaneous bursts of brass ushers in the initally promising but ultimately cluttered &quot;Alphabet St.&quot; The crispness of the industrial beats Prince achieved on his magnificent &quot;Sign 'O The Times&quot; is chucked here in favor of hollow and more modern digital production. The key to the success of &quot;Lovesexy's&quot; predecessor was an evident conviction that less is more. On &quot;Lovesexy,&quot; though, more just never seems to be enough for Prince. The only reason this album is interesting at all is that Prince was too close to the magic of his prime to turn out something as obsolete as &quot;New Power Soul&quot; or &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; just yet. Unfocused, manic and over-polished, &quot;Lovesexy&quot; marks one of the most tragic turning-points in the history of Pop, a malaise from which the Artist is still yet to emerge.
1594200106|5.0|This has got to be with out a doubt, one of the best books that I have read. If you can read the book in Spanish, even if you must strugle a bit, better yet! Zafon simply takes the language of Cervantes and uses it as a brush with which to paint this wonderful and intriguing story of a father and son in 1940's Barcelona. This is a must book to read and treasure. It holds its own with the great ones.
B00005JM02|5.0|From the very begining, as every Disney Pixar movie does, Finding Nemo touches your heart. This is a very heart warming wonderful tale of a clown fish boy and his father, who go through two quite magnificent journeys. Along the way they run into some wonderful fun loving characters, who you can really relate to in your own life. This movie is great for the whole family and has something for everyone adventure, action, and plenty of comedy. It has a great all star cast. Finding Nemo will keep you glued to the screen unto the very end. Thank you to Disney and Pixar for another well put together masterpiece!
970051336X|5.0|The Alchemist is a wonderful, magical journey.  I encourage anyone and everyone who has ever had a dream to read this book.  I've read it twice, but I am sure I will read it again and again.  In accordance with the signs and omens of the story of Santiago, the first time I fully read the book was on the night of a Lunar Eclipse.  Before that, though it is a simple book, every time I went to read it, I fell asleep.  So, when the moon was eclipsed, and the world was so obliged, I read The Alchemist.  When the time is right, and you are ready to learn about life from a simple sheperd boy and a fabulous South American writer, you too should read this book.  You won't ever be the same.

B0000WN0ZK|5.0|A phothographer (David Heminngs) gets a slapshot and he believes there's a murder in that picture.<br />The reality is elusive , and watch about your senses seem to reveal you . Nothing is like it seems . The hidden message underneath the script .<br />Antonioni has been called quite often the master of the silence . And in this case , in his first american film he challenges our ancient beliefs , what we usually mean as common sense . What's the truth and where does it begin our disturbed or prejuiced perceptions about the real world ? .<br />Obviously there's a hidden message about the drug world in this statement.<br />The ending sequence in (what we see ?) a mude tennis game is not only a sincere tribute to the timeless genius of the mimo art - Marcel Marceau - , but a clear reference about we state as truth many times what other senses vaguely pretend establish .
0553275976|2.0|This book is so incredibly overrated its sickening. its mainstream tripe for the philistine reader of our age.<br />But I give this 2 stars instead of one, only because I suppose it will be good treadmill exercise for the reader that doesn't read much and wants to make themselves feel literate.
B00018D44U|5.0|I was in a mood to find some new artists, and indirectly heard of Norah Jones.  Amongst the other albums I ordered, I was very surprised and pleased to find this one.  Norah's voice is very cool -- the songs are a little jazzy, a little bluesy and a little rock.  They are all pleasing and complex without being too much, too loud, etc.  I find myself listenging and discovering new aspects of the music each time and this has become one of my favorites.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprized by this mother-daughter show. It's really thrilling play. Very nice actors, nice dialogs. Good fillings of the nice small town and relationship between people. I think it was very nice time expenditure for me.<BR>Thanks everyone for this DVD set!!!<BR>Just love it so much!!!<BR>Waiting for other seasons :)
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I love it this album all its entirety is so DAMN good i really recomend you to buy it
B00023BLXK|5.0|As a huge fan of the original Dirty Dancing, I prepared myself for a huge let down.  I thought that in no way could this movie capture  the magic that the first one did, but I was very wrong.  Although, it really isn't a sequel, but rather more a re-write with a twist, it is a great movie worth seeing for anyone.  The dance scenes were well done, and the acting was superb.  The plot is great because first it deals with the problems that an interracial couple living in different social classes face and it also deals with the struggles that Cuba was facing at the time.  If you are in the mode for a great, well told love story check this movie out!
B000002H33|5.0|Very good CD...I still think AJFA is better, but this one definately rocks. The title track Master of Puppets may be their best song ever, too. Worth owning even just for that.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Differnet style than Star Trek but in my opinion<BR>&quot;Firefly&quot; is the best show since ST TNG.<BR>A must see for Sci-Fi fan.
0939495511|3.0|An adorable book that may seem long at times.<br />The story is about a family with four daughters,Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy. The book opens when the father is away at war. It is Christmas time and the girls and their mother, whom they call Marmee, haven't much to live on but love. This book is a recounting of their lives, until three of them get married and have babies of their own.<br />The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and each<BR>realizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have what<BR>they always dreamed of.<br />           As I said before, this book is overlong at places. I<BR>prefer to watch my soap operas on tv. And some of the words were British, and I never did find out what they meant. Other than those faults, it was a grand book, and I give it a rating of 3.5 stars:)
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw the movie and I thought that it was excellent. It totally portrays the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in the bible Book of John. I did however wish that the movie was in English, but I do understand why it was in Hebrew.  Every Christian that I know that saw this movie felt a deeper understanding of the Bible and the suffering that Jesus Christ went through for us.  I recommend every Christian person see this movie.
B00000DLV1|4.0|The song &quot;Flowers Bloom&quot; is by Mandalay on the &quot;Empathy&quot; record.  Hope that helps!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I was never a big fan of Unearth untill I heard this. The guitar work is simply amazing, songs like Zombie Autopilot are loaded with 80's metal harmonies that are haunting yet beautiful. As a guitar player I'm excited to see the guitar hero making a comeback and bringing technique back to metal.
6305633177|5.0|Why must people complain about the quality of a legal bootleg recording.  This aggravates me.  This DVD is so beautiful and is the perfect look back on Cliff.  And you people complain about quality.  Just listen to what you're hearing.  You'll be stunned.  They guys playing LEAD BASS.  No one ever did that before.  And now you can see him performing and hear him soloing on excellent bootlegs that the band got hold of after his death and released as a tribute to them.  How dare anyone insult anything with Cliff on it.  That's blasphemy.  I would pay anything for this.  And you people complain because you couldn't get it at the same time as your britney spears cd.  Well who cares about you.  You are merely being a d**che and getting in the way of more people experiencing this.  You are therefore slowing down civilization by tricking people into not buying this you filthy d**chbags.
B000003TA4|4.0|Nirvana is one of the best band's of the 90's. Better than Metallica, Husker Du, The Breeders, and The Smashing Pumpkins. Kurt Cobain was a decent guitarist, and had a pair of vocal cords that could both rip your eardrums apart and calm your soul at the same time. His anger could soothe, and his calmness could break your heart to pieces. He did what he called &quot;anti-solos&quot;, so all of you who say he sucked at soloing can eat your words. He didn't specialize in soloing, and made that clear. Kurt Cobain was the ultimate anti-soloist. He used feedback as an instrument too. He strived for such control over everything he did when he played music. Too bad he didn't have that same control over his life and addiction. Oh, and the reason why AFI K. James can't be banned from Amazon: He's part of the staff in charge of publishing these record reviews. Nirvana's Nevermind was a great slice of grunge rock served up to set off the grunge revolution. In Utero was created to end the monster (ravenous, ungrateful fans) Kurt had created. And as the grand finale, he ended himself six months later. Not all things have to end, but if they do, you'd wish they never ended as violent and premature as Kurt did. He should've quit Nirvana and did his own personal music for himself instead of all you overzealous fans who say Teen Spirit &quot;kicks major ass&quot;. He should've had more time to spend. He should've rekindled his love of art and become an art student. He should've still been alive today. <br />May Kurt be blessed.
B000002KE2|4.0|Dear God.  Sabbath changed their sound.  They showed that they had creativity much like Zeppelin did starting with Zeppelin III.  I hate all these people who complain when bands change their sound because they want to hear the same (...) all the time.  Take it from someone who plays an instrument.  After a while, it gets boring to repeat yourself and as a musician you wish to become more creative and change things.  Read on for my review of this great piece of work.  <BR> 1.Wheels of Confusion/The Straightner- A fantastic 8 minute epic that is basically four minutes of a song that sounds very similar to most songs off of Paranoid and Master of Reality except with strings and whatnot creeping in the backround.  The last four minutes are a huge jam of Tony showcasing his soloing abilities.<BR> 2.Tomorrow's Dream- a good hardrocking three minute song with a riff that much like NIB is instantly recognizable and will make you wonder where you've heard it before.<BR> 3.Changes-A great simplistic catchy ballad where Sabbath finally bare their souls unlike Master of Reality's Solitude.<BR> 4.FX-Random effects and harmonics collage.  The reason for four stars.  Need I say more my fellow Sabbath worshippers.........<BR> 5.Supernaut-Back to the rocking.  You'll all probably love the big like minute long drum break where Bill toys with all these cowbells and and weird drum sounds.  The downside to this song is that it's really got a feeling like during that minute he could've actually played a cool drum solo.<BR> 6.Snowblind-COCAINE ROCK ladies and gentleman.  Best song on the album and one of Sabbath's best.  I especially like both of Tony's solos and the backround keyboards seem to really help set the doomy mood.  Excellent use of keyboards.<BR> 7.Cornucopia-short rocker.  Fun song.  No solo. tear.<BR> 8.Laguna Sunrise-Tony whips out the acoustic guitar for this interesting Fluff like interlude.  Fluff is better though.<BR> 9.St. Vitus' Dance-Short sweet hippie song.  Reallyhappy which was unusual for Sabbath at this point.  Nice acoustic work by Tony.<BR> 10.Under The Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes-Don't let the title fool you.  This is one of Sabbath's better shorter doom and gloom songs.  It sets this really dark mood and the guitar riff sounds as if it was lifted from the sessions for their first album.<BR>  Overall-A great piece of work for the open minded Sabbath fan that doesn't mind change.  It's personally my favorite album because of its creativity with Never Say Die as a close second.  But what do I know.  I'm just as musician who loves creativity.  Listen with an open mind.  Keep on Rockin.  That's my two cents.
B00018D44U|1.0|A Norah Jones CD would sound just like one long continuous boring song if there were no breaks between tracks!<br />I really tried hard to find some enjoyable quality in her music. But after the third song, she really starts to become annoying to listen to. It's like someone dragging their fingernails across a chalk board.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I loved this movie! It really stayed with the storyline in J.M. Barrie's novel, but with a few wonderful extras. It was like the play comes to the bigscreen. I loved how the mermaids were portrayed, very creative. Jeremy Sumpter does excellent in his portrayal of Peter Pan, and his costume was very realistic. The soundtrack added to the magic and playfulness of the film. To see Peter and the Darling children fly the way they did was awesome and breathtaking. I can't stop watching this movie. I always felt that the story of Peter Pan was a love story between Peter and Wendy, and this movie reveals that with gentleness and wimsy. A wonderful movie all the way around.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Really!  This has to be one of the worst movies ever produced and speaking as a Brit, I am ashamed.  The plot or lack of any plot(s) is absurd.  The jokes aren't funny, the premise is farcical and it is about as entertaining as being stung by a wasp.<BR>Really, avoid this movie at all costs - it is that bad.
B000002BYD|3.0|(Actual Rating-3.5 Stars)<br />Yield(1998). Pearl Jam's Fifth Album.<br />Throughout the 90's, Pearl Jam was, and still is, an Enigma. Unlike other bands, they despised the spotlight, yet their albums, and the songs off them, became more popular than they could ever imagine. 'Ten', 'Vs.', and 'Vitalogy' were Bona-Fide Grunge classics, and Pearl Jam, instead of embracing their popularity, tried to destroy it. They experimented with New Age in 'No Code', and it was a commercial and critical failure. Then Pearl Jam became embroiled in a Legal battle with Ticketmaster, which put them on hold. So, in an attempt to win back the fans and the critics, Pearl Jam made and produced 'Yield', where they got back to the bare bones of their Early Grunge Days, blending genuine Hard Rock, Punk, and Mellower songs. So, is 'Yield' as good as the Big 3, or is it just another 'No Code' Disaster? Read On To Find Out....<br />Track Listing-<br />Brain of J- An ode to JFK, \\"Brain of J\\" starts 'Yield'off well as Gossard's Black Sabbath-y riff blows out the speakers, and Vedder's questioning vocals echo throughout the room. A Great Rocker, and Gossard/McCready's Guitar Work is amazing!<br />Faithfull- Pearl Jam softens up for \\"Faithfull\\", focusing on Vedder's vocal talents, but Gossard/McCready(I'll refer too them as the duo from here on out) shell out riffs and solos that make this \\"Ballad\\" an intense rocker.<br />No Way-\\"No Way\\" blends Psychadelic Rock with Funk, and by mixing in Vedder's soft-spoken vocals, and \\"The Duo\\"'s bluesly guitarwork makes this an interesting experiment.<br />Given To Fly- \\"Given To Fly\\" is a \\"Pearl Jam\\" Ballad, which means it can go from Vedder calmly belting out lyrics behind mellow guitars, to him screaming out the chorus behind \\"The Duo's\\" chugging guitar. \\"Given To Fly\\" is no exception!<br />Wishlist- \\"Wishlist\\" is 'Yield's biggest hit, but it's a very weak song. Vedder's vocals are inspired, but the song never picks up, and basically Vedder's vocals are all the song has to offer.<br />Pilate- \\"Pilate\\" is another \\"Pearl Jam\\" Ballad, with slow musical measures being interspersed with energetic choruses. Vedder's vocals are top-notch, and \\"The Duo\\"'s riff is enjoyable if a bit dull.<br />Do The Evolution- \\"Do The Evolution\\" is an awesome Hard Rocker, with \\"The Duo\\"'s Folk Rock-y riff(It sounds nothing like Folk Rock though) blaring out the speakers behind Vedder's angry vocals.<br />Untitled(Red Dot)- This nameless song is basically just a weird filler song with \\"What, Go Crazy\\" being said over and over.<br />MFC- \\"MFC\\" starts off like \\"Even Flow\\" with \\"The Duo\\"'s light-hearted riff coming out front and center, with Vedder singing with his usual flair. This is a very \\"happy\\" song, and \\"The Duo\\"'s guitarwork really makes me happy.<br />Low Light- Another ballad, \\"Low Light\\" contains some great vocals and keyboarding, yet it comes out sounding very boring. A decent song.<br />In Hiding- \\"In Hiding\\" picks up the pace, emphasizing \\"The Duo\\"'s skills, creating another light-hearted song. Vedder's brooding vocals and the guitar riff make this a \\"Pearl Jam\\" ballad. Awesome Hard Rocker!<br />Push Me, Pull Me- \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\" is very odd, with Vedder talking behind a chugging guitar, and being interrupted by a choir of \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\". It's like where Roth talks during \\"Hot For Teacher\\", except it's a full song. An okay song.<br />All Those Yesterdays- \\"All Those Yesterdays\\" is a mix between Alt Rock and New Age, very much like the material from 'No Code'. Although it takes awhile to get fully going, Vedder's vocals and \\"The Duo\\"'s guitarwork really shine. Unfortuneatly it takes too long to get to the point.<br />Overall, I found 'Yield' to be a good, yet flawed album. Although I'm glad they went back in a good direction, Pearl Jam still seems like they haven't quite found another Ten or Vs. yet. While the first half of 'Yield' was excellent, minus \\"Wishlist\\", the second half seemed rather bland, with \\"In Hiding\\" and \\"MFC\\" really only standing out. Vedder's vocals were top-notch, and Stone Gossard and Mike McCready's guitar work were also excellent, but that's wasted on filler like \\"Untitled\\" and \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\", which really saddens me. A Good, Yet Flawed Album.<br />(...)really only standing out.

B00005JKJA|2.0|I notice my previous review is getting only \\"unhelpful\\" votes.  So let me try to explain myself yet again.  David Lynch is interested in making preposterous movies.  David Lynch is perniciously interested in making movies that are basically terrible, yet terrible in a dissociative way.  The essence of a David Lynch movie is that it is a load of horse puckey, to quote the apartment manager in Mulholland drive.  What's that?  You want examples?  Well, lets take another of Lynch's movies, Lost Highway.  Bill Pullman's character is established as morosely mellow and more or less inert.  Cut to: a scene of him playing his saxophone in a club, \\"wailing on it\\" as they say.  This is in total contradiction to what we have just seen - contradiction being the main form of literary humor - but more importantly, Pullman is a very, very bad saxophone player.  His playing is preposterous.  One cannot take him seriously as a musician.  Another example, from the same movie, is Richard Pryor as the garage manager on the phone to a potential customer.  He says, \\"We got eight guys here.  I'll let you talk to five of them; and if you can get that price from ONE of them, I'll let you ask the other three.\\"  Any questions?  Is this not self-evidently complete and utter nonsense?  And what about the fact that halfway through the movie Bill Pullman turns into a totally different guy and so is let out of jail.  After all, since he is not the same guy they put in there, they gotta let him out.  That follows, don't it?  Am I making myself clear?<br />No?  Okay, what about David Bowie in Fire Walk With Me?  He plays a Texan.  I am sure he was cast as a Texan precisely because David Lynch figured on Bowie being unable to do a convincing accent.  He says to his casting director, \\"Let's have Bowie play the Texan.  He'll do a terrible job and it'll sound like sh*t.\\"  Am I getting through to you people now?  David Lynch intentionally makes very bad movies.  What?!?!? Another example?!?!?  Well, how's about Laura Palmer saying to her boyfriend, \\"I'm long gone, like a turkey in the corn.\\"  \\"Don't say that.  A turkey's one of the dumbest birds there is.\\"  (tears falling down her cheek)\\"Gobble...gobble...gobble...\\"  Can't you see what I'm saying to you?!?!?<br />DO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THERE IS NO BOY THERE IN THE DARK ROOM?!??!bout Laura Palmer saying to her boyfriend, \\"I'm long gone, like a turkey in the corn.\\"  \\"Don't say that.

Metallica's Sixth Album.<br />After the Massive Success of Metallica(AKA The Black Album), Metallica fans were expecting another masterpiece from the Thrash Gods, Metallica. In many ways, Load was the exact opposite of what everyone was expecting. Metallica decided to drop all but a microscopic amount of their Thrash roots, instead blending Heavy Metal, Alternative Rock, and even Blues in many places. Many fans said Metallica's new direction was a good thing, and other people considered it a terrible thing.

I would have to agree with the latter, and read on to find out why-<br />Track Ratings-<br />'Load' starts off with \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" and \\"2x4\\", which, while having stormy riffs, confrontational vocals, and bluesy solos from Hammett, seem generic because of sloppy writing and repetitiveness. \\"The House That Jack Built\\", starts slow, and unfortuneatly, never picks up, making it seem unfinished. Good lyrics, but there's a horrifying \\"Noisemaker\\" solo here! NO! The best stretch of 'Load' starts with \\"Until It Sleeps\\", a catchy ballad that gets very hard during the chorus. Musicianship is Top-Notch here! Then comes my favorite song on 'Load', \\"King Nothing\\", Metallica at their best! Hammett's dark riff slowly builds up to the insane chorus, where Hetfield's shouts of \\"And Your Crown Means Nothing!\\" force you to bang your head! Great  musicianship! \\"Hero Of The Day\\" and \\"Bleeding Me\\" show Metallica's soft side, crafting ballads with Hetfield's soulful vocals and Rhythm Guitar playing, along with Hammett's bluesy solos and hard-hitting riffs make these great songs. Next up is \\"Cure\\", which is a bad rip-off of \\"King Nothing\\", featuring the EXACT SAME RIFF, CHORUS, AND VOCALS! The only difference is the bad lyrics and solo! \\"Poor Twisted Me\\" starts off with a Bluesy Heavy Metal riff, but Hetfield's vocals sound like Dave Mustaine's on \\"Sweating Bullets\\", which is not a good thing(He sounds like he's dying). This song gets very repetitive after a while, and Hammett's solo could be better. \\"Wasting My Hate\\" is a Fast-Paced Heavy Metal Rocker in the vein of \\"Holier Than Thou\\", with Hetfield's pessimistic vocals and Hammett's punishing riff. Unfortuneatly, Too short and no solo! \\"Mama Said\\" is a country ballad......Need I say more? I didn't pay for Country! \\"Thorn Within\\" starts well, with Hammett's Black Sabbath/Doom-y riff, but overall the repetitiveness turns a hopefull song into a generic Heavy Metal song. Hammett's solo is non-existent! \\"Ronnie\\" and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" Finish Up 'Load', with \\"Ronnie\\" being a slow, generic, and incredibly repetitive rocker that never gets to the point, and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" Ends well, with a Heavy Metal Ballad, with a decent riff and decent vocals.<br />Overall, I think 'Load' is a mixed bag, with \\"Until It Sleeps\\", \\"King Nothing\\", \\"Hero Of the Day\\", and \\"Bleeding Me\\" being the only standouts, and \\"Until It Sleeps\\" and \\"King Nothing\\" are the only songs that even COMPARE to Metallica's earlier material. Load's biggest problem is it's sloppy writing and repetitiveness, which ruins most songs on the album. I think it has its strong points, mainly Hetfield's vocals are good, Lars' drumming is spot-on, and Hammett's Bluesy Riffs/Solos are very creative and original.

B00005JKJA|5.0|I love all the bad reviews.  Thank God for them.  Movies such as M. Drive are not meant to be adored by the masses.  They are meant to be watched and revered time and time again by thoughtful fans of creative cinema.  I love the dope who apparently dislikes the movie because of the way espresso is described.  Go get another latte from starbux and stop complaining about brilliant movies...<BR>I will not explain this movie to you even though I know every aspect of it and have unlocked the mysteries after endless viewings.  I do this not to be a bad human being but to allow you to figure it for yourself and, hopefully, have as much fun and enjoyment doing so as I did.<BR>Plus, I am certain that many of you out there have already discovered the ultimate knowledge such as I have.<BR>I will say, however, that the film is very psychological, very surreal, beautifully directed and with excellent cinemotography.  The actors are largely unknown (a very good thing) and are all very believable as they clearly responded well to Lynch's directing.<BR>M. Drive is an off-beat film that makes one think (another positive).  I hate to do it, but since the purpose of this review is not to explain storylines and sub-plots, but to get the reader to decide whether or not this is a movie for you I will compare it to some others (sorry).  Here are some names (again, sorry): Memento, Usual Suspects, Brazil, Blue Velvet, Apocalypse Now, Clockwork Orange, Lost HWY, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, Pi.<BR>All of the above films are surreal, psychological studies into the paranoid mind and/or psychosis.  These are my kind of movies and thank the good Lord for D. Lynch and let us hope he is currently working on another project (and I don't mean anymore of those commercials of his!)<BR>Also: I cannot believe the cheap price yet B-movies from the 80's are nearly twice the cost.  Maybe Mr. Espresso is the reason for that...<BR>Now how about Twin Peaks season 2 on DVD???

I didn't pay for Country! \\"Thorn Within\\" starts well, with Hammett's Black Sabbath/Doom-y riff, but overall the repetitiveness turns a hopefull song into a generic Heavy Metal song. Hammett's solo is non-existent! \\"Ronnie\\" and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" Finish Up 'Load', with \\"Ronnie\\" being a slow,generic, and incredibly repetitive rocker that never gets to the point, and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" Ends well, with a Heavy Metal Ballad, with a decent riff and decent vocals.<br />Overall, I think 'Load' is a mixed bag, with \\"Until It Sleeps\\", \\"King Nothing\\", \\"Hero Of the Day\\", and \\"Bleeding Me\\" being the only standouts, and \\"Until It Sleeps\\" and \\"King Nothing\\" are the only songs that even COMPARE to Metallica's earlier material. Load's biggest problem is it's sloppy writing and repetitiveness, which ruins most songs on the album. I think it has its strong points, mainly Hetfield's vocals are good, Lars' drumming is spot-on, and Hammett's Bluesy Riffs/Solos are very creative and original. That's all I have to say good about 'Load', but you might just like it. Like I said, a Mixed Bag!<br />RECOMMENDED ONLY TO METALLICA FANS OR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THE<BR>SINGLES, OTHERWISE I ONLY SUGGEST PICKING UP 'LOAD' USED! AT LEAST 'LOAD' IS BETTER THAN 'RE-LOAD' AND THE DISGRACE FOLLOWING THAT!<br />Recommended Instead-<br />...And Justice For All-Metallica<BR>Rust In Peace-Megadeth<BR>Among The Living-Anthrax<br />Thanks For Reading!
0609610570|2.0|I was hoping that this was a down-to-earth book with interesting and useful ideas like Built to Last or No Excuses Management. Alas, it's just a standard, boring, fluffy business book filled with many more words than are called for. It might be worth reading if you're stuck on an airplane with it.
B0000DZEE3|4.0|I find this dvd pretty exiting, it was an exellent camara and a perfect sound. The songs are cool and damn! i was just thown by the view of the stage, the crowd and the red hot chili peppers. You have to buy it! i didn't put 5 stars because they sang some songs i didn't like but that was ok.
B00004R99F|5.0|This came out two years before my 1st daughter's birth. Four years later when she was old enough, my sister gave it to me with a load of other videos. This has always been her favorite, and now her other brothers and sisters love it too. <br />It teaches a good message about father and son. My favorite party is the music, which I have on my computer and play for my kids all the time! Our favorite is the Powerline song and &quot;Nobody Else but you&quot; . If you love Goofy, or just are a movie fan, this is a great movie to buy.
B000002MY3|5.0|I never really liked Alanis until i heard &quot;Ironic&quot;..i then listened to her album and...wow, i jus completely changed my view on her.  My personal favourite is &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, its just...rage and emotion, some think she's crazy, but..i think thats good music.  Same goes to &quot;Right Through U&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot;.  All the songs on this album are different from each other. They have different meanings and topics,no wonder why she won album of the year at the Grammys.  I also love &quot;Hand In My Pocket&quot; and &quot;You Learn&quot;.  I love the harmonica in &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;, u jus cant match it.  &quot;Mary Jane&quot; really shows her vocal ability and her hittin the high notes, i guess u can call it the &quot;ballad&quot; on the album.Overall, whoever doesnt have this album..its a must, ur missin out.
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|I haven't seen this DVD edition yet so I can't really comment on it, but I just wanted to put in one word about the movie.  I saw it at age 5 or so when it was in the theaters, and it scared the stuffing out of me.  There were a few parts that gave me nightmares and still make me shiver.  It's probably not as bad as I've made it out to be, but do use caution letting younger kids watch this.
B00000255F|5.0|This album is fantastic because it brings back to life those wonderful heady, heavenly, tranquil sunny 1970's days.<br />It is a real masterpiece released in 1975, but still popular today, with sound that is both timeless and rooted in those wonderful 1970's days.<br />My personal favorites are the rock n roll' exploration of frustrated loneliness and desire for excitement and life - Thunder Road, the bluesy reminiscence of a summer romance that went wrong in Backstreets, the pumping American biker title track Born to Run and the heady Jungleland.<br />A fantastic tribute to great music and a time of real meaning.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I've always felt that Nofx was the flagship band for anyone wanting to know what actual punk rock was about in this day and age. Nofx has enjoyed massive success over the past 20 years for thier integrity, originality, and humor.  &quot;War on Errorism&quot; does a great job of putting all of those traits to the forefront. The anti-Bush agenda doesn't bother me at all. HELLO!!! Its punk, not pop! Thats why you'll never see Nofx on Mtv. My personal favorites on the album are probably Anarchy Camp, Seperation of Church and Skate, Franco-Unamerican, American Errorist, and The Irrationality of Rationality.
1558908366|5.0|Pretty Woman is a great movie. When Julia Roberts acted in this 1990 classic, she was sexy, vibrant and cute.

B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom Waits is brilliant. &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; is brilliant. Looking through these reviews, it's very obvious that the record is acknowledged by many as a success of rare proportions. That's a safe statement. After all who can listen to these songs - &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Diamonds &amp; Gold&quot;, &quot;Blind Love&quot;, &quot;Anywhere I Lay My Head&quot;, &quot;Singapore&quot; and the rest - and not be touched by them? <br />I first heard this album in 1985, or possibly 1986, and it caught me in a real big way. Actually, I've been a confessed Waits fan ever since I first heard him sing his GUTS OUT in Jersey Girl. I remember I was blow away by a concert on TV in 1984, the day before I saw Bob Dylan for the first time. Don't know how many times I've put &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; on over the years and found myself taken by his sensitivity. The feelings in a song like &quot;Time&quot; or &quot;Blind Love&quot; will always be precious to me.  <br />This is an adventure. In fact from the time you go onboard the ship sailing for Singapore to the time you close up the experience Tom Waits give you with &quot;Anywhere I Lay My Head&quot; you'll be quite impressed.
1401201911|3.0|Not the best &quot;Elseworlds&quot; Superman title: I have two other 'Elseworlds' titles of Superman - the mediaeval 'Kal' &amp; 'Superman: The Dark Side' (raised by Darkseid) - and they're both FAR better than this one, even the fact that 'Kal' is MUCH shorter doesn't detract from its impact. 'The Dark Side' is definately the best story of the 3 ('Kal' doesn't have much time for a story to develop), but there's something else to it that I can't quite put my finger on.<br />Don't get me wrong: it's a good story &amp; worth getting if you like Superman graphic novels, it just doesn't have the same kick as 'The Dark Side'. I think it might be that it's so focused on Superman vs Lex Luthor that the other super-heroes mentioned (Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern) get short shrift. There's also no clear 'bad guy' in it which made 'Kal' &amp; 'TDS' enjoyable: who do you get fired up AT if there's no clear bad guy?<br />I gave it 3 stars because it's &quot;good, as you'd expect&quot; instead of &quot;Wow! that's awesome!&quot;
B00000J9HF|5.0|Piero Cappuccilli portrays the title jester perfectly, capturing his two immense facets: the cruel, detestable clown and the vengeful, loving father.  His voice contrasts between lyric beauty and dramatic ferocity.  His rendition of \\"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata\\" begins with electrifying violence and soon melts into pathetic sorrow.  His smooth bel canto also blends well with Cotrubas during their beautiful duet in Act I (\\"Gia da tre lune son qui venuta\\").<BR> Placido Domingo is also perfect here as the Duke of Mantua and presents the unscrupulous noble's principle arias - \\"Questa o quella\\", \\"Parmi veder le lagrime\\", \\"La donne e mobile\\" - with ease, lust, and sensuous style and control.<BR> Ileana Cotrubas gives an angelic performance as Gilda, both in the lyric beauty of her delicate voice and her dramatic sense of the character.  Her interpretation of \\"Caro nome\\" - comparable only to that of Sutherland - contributes to making this recording the true gem it is.  She is equally moving with the mournful \\"Tutte le feste al tempio\\" and during the tragic duet with Cappuccilli at the opera's finale (\\"V'ho ingannato...colpevole fui\\").<BR> The supporting roles are handled with the same genius.  Nicolai Ghiaurov is magnificent as Sparafucile; his cavernous voice suits the role of the vile assassin, one of Verdi's most malignant musical creations.  Elena Obraztsova - whose deep voice I have always liked and found suitable for such roles as Maddalena, Amneris, and Dalila - excels here as the former.  She is both licentious and tempting as the villainess Maddalena, especially during the trio with Ghiaurov and Cotrubas in Act III (\\"E amabile invero cotal giovinotto\\").  Hanna Schwarz shines here, too, as Gilda's maid Giovanna, a small but impressionable role, which the skilled mezzo-soprano presents the style.<BR> Kurt Moll - in a masterful bit of casting - provides a fierce performance as the Count of Monterone.  His thunderous entrance in Act I and equally wild exit during the finale of Act II (\\"Poiche fosti invano da me maledetto\\") are some of the most dazzling moments of this recording.<BR> Carlo Maria Giulini and the Vienna Philharmonic shine here most of all in an equally gentle and thunderous recording of Rigoletto.  Giulini handles the opera's tranquil moments with care and sensitivity and also excels during the thunderous moments.  It is no exaggeration to consider this one of the greatest achievements of his illustrious career.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I would like to listen to an unplugged album from Britney....
0316168815|1.0|In other reviews of this novel, I have read the word 'literature'. Anyone who thinks that Lovely Bones is literature must be either braindead, or taking a university course staged by Opra Winfrey's Book Club. Think of literature shot through the lens of a bad telemovie, and you are coming close to what Lovely Bones is in reality. Anyone who reads books even remotely challenging will be able to tell you this.<BR>The idea is interesting: that a girl is murdered and looks down upon her family and friends, and watches how they react to that murder. The way in which this idea is executed, though, is moronic. It is soaked in sentimentality, cliche, and injected with great doses of kitsch. Reading Lovely Bones I felt as if I were sucking on a terribly sugary sweet, and I kept wanting to spit it out, which is what I did in the end. That is to say, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. <BR>The fact that Lovely Bones was so popular in the United States can be accepted. Bestselling books, after all, are mostly bad. But that readers think of this as literature is a testament to how far down the track of illiteracy we have all come.<BR>By the way, I'm astonished that the author of 'The Corrections' wrote a good review of this book. My copy has a fragment taken from something he wrote, on the front cover. To quote, 'Sebold has given us a fantasy-fable of great authority, charm, and daring.' Did Franzen and I read the same book? Has Franzen lost his marbles? Did Franzen really write The Corrections?!?! If yes, how could he think Lovely Bones is good? I'm puzzled (and somewhat disturbed).<BR>Undoubtedly this novel will be made into an equally sugary film. I can imagine it as a sort of American Beauty Lite. Undoubtedly, there will also be people who will think that Lovely Bones The Movie is an art film. Undoubtedly, they will be wrong.
B00004X01U|4.0|Two years after the release of the multi-platinum critically acclaimed \\"Ray of Light\\", Madonna decided to return to her roots and do exactly what she is known for, dance music. The result of it is nothing overly amazing, but pleasing to those who just like to relax and have fun. Luckily, Madonna was able to take her electronica to a new level and make into a success, giving her her first number 1 album since 1989's \\"Like A Prayer\\" and her number 1 single since 1995's \\"Take A Bow\\".<br />1. Music- An excellent track. The song is basically about having fun and coming together. Possibly Madonna's greatest dance track ever.<br />2. Impressive Instant- This song is nothing amazing, but more of an expiriment with electronics. All in all it's pleasing.<br />3. Runaway Lover- This is probably my least favorite track on the album. Unlike the previous songs, the electronic beat just becomes dull and uneasy to listen to, and the lyrics are horrible.<br />4. I Deserve It- The best track on the album. Not only does it have a catchy chorus and a sweet meaning, but it combines guitars with electronics(similar to the songs on American Life).<br />5. Amazing- This song sounds alot like Beautiful Stranger, only not as catchy, and unlike the song's title, it isn't amazing.<br />6. Nobody's Perfect- An excellent track. I love the vocoder, the song's message, and the guitars and electronics. <br />7. Don't Tell Me- A catchy song with beautiful lyrics written by Madonna's brother. The orchesta is truly amazing.<br />8. What It Feels Like For A Girl- A sad song with a great message, although I do think that society is just as hard on males as far as putting standards on them.<br />9. Paradise(Not For Me)- Amazing. I love all the electronic noises and cool Japanese sounding music. However, I must admit that Madonna's voice gets annoying in this song at times. This song is very out of place on this album.<br />10. Gone- The guitar and electronics in this song are great, as well the singing.However, although the song is about never giving up on your dreams, these lyrics are nothing great. \\"Nothing equals nothing\\".<br />All in all, it's a great album to listen to if you don't have too much on your mind. But I highly reccomend Madonna's greater albums as well which include \\"American Life\\", \\"Erotica\\", \\"Lika A Prayer\\", and \\"Ray of Light\\".
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"Mystic River\\" is a dark, brooding and painfully truthful film about two crimes that impacts and intertwines lives of three men.  The story centers on Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins), and Sean (Kevin Bacon) boyhood friends whose lives are forever changed when they witness Dave being lured into a car, taken away and assaulted for several days before he escapes.<br />  Moving forward 25 years the three men are reunited when Jimmy's 19 year old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is found brutally murdered.  Sean, a homicide detective investigating the murder struggles with balancing his work and runaway pregnant wife who frequently calls but never says anything.  Dave, who comes home late and covered in blood the night Katie is murdered soon becomes the primary suspect in the eyes of both Sean's partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) and Dave's wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden).<br />  While the murder mystery plays well and will hold most audiances to their seats for 138 minutes the real strength of this wonderfully written film is the depth of screenwriter's (Brian Helgeland) characters with their keenly tempoed pursuit for truth and understanding of the two crimes and impact on their lives.  Moreover, Eastwood is more than up to the material and doesn't flinch while walking the viewer through Jimmy's emotional journey of handling Katie's death to include thoughtfully paced visits to morgue and funeral home.  Penn's change from anguished father to cold-blooded avenger is a real tour-de-force.  His brief talk with his dead daughter while sitting on the back porch is riveting: \\"I know in my soul I contributed to your death, but I don't know how\\"<br />  It certainly can be argued many of the cast members gave performances of their career, especially Penn and Robbins.  The remaining casts were given substantial material to work with and they didn't waste it.  Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden are wonderful as wives to Jimmy and Dave, providing a contrast in degree of support they provide their husbands.  The former blindly devoted and latter suspicious of a husband whose kept her from the secrets of his devastating childhood.<br />  The film's ending will leave some unhappy or unsatisfied, but for most it should remind us what great directing, writing and acting can provide--a chance for a story to unfold in a deliberate, subtle pace with the jouney often better than the ending.in degree of support they provide their husbands.

B0001EBXBK|1.0|Reading the other reviews leaves me thinking that I did not see the same movie. I fell asleep several times and kept checking the clock to see if the movie was almost over. Admittedly, I am not a fan of martial arts movies (I slept through most of Crouching Tiger as well) but I am a huge fan of Tarantino. This movie was everything that Pulp Fiction was not. It was boring, poorly written, badly acted and pointless. There is a difference between clever violence and mindless violence. Kill Bill reminded me too much of Natural Born Killers and not enough of Reservoir Dogs. <br />I know that in any western, 40 bad guys can fire endless rounds at the hero and not hit him. That is suspension of belief. But when 40 samurai-trained warriors are beaten mano a mano by one person that is dispension of belief. This woman makes impossible leaps, seems to float in mid-air, barely breaks a sweat and never gets tired but has to struggle to climb up a balcony in the big fight scene. It's ridiculous.<br />I understand that some of the action is meant to be overplayed but the movie lacks any depth to balance it out. You are tricked into thinking that there is a story behind the mayhem but there really isn't. If I didn't know that Tarantino wrote it, I would have guessed that someone was imitating him and doing a poor job of it. Again, I go back to Pulp Fiction. That was dialogue. That was a story. It had wit, humour and cleverness, none of which could be found in Kill Bill.<br />Is it the lines or the people delivering them? Lucy Liu could not act her way out of a paper wall. Uma is good to look at but delivers every line with a woodenness many trees would envy. The other actors faired little better. <br />Kill Bill now joins the ranks of Rushmore and Jackass as movies for which I want my money back. I could not say enough bad things about any of these three pieces of crap.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the exception to the rule that the music on the radio from my generation sucks. This is purely wonderful music, of genius caliber. Radiohead, with each song and album that the release, will simply put you into a state of awe. This are five seriously talented musicians. Thom Yorke(lead singer) is a modern musical genius, and his other four bandmates (Colin Greenwood, Johnny Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, Phil Selway) work together to produce a sound that no other group of musicians has ever done. Radiohead is a band that will be remembered for generations to come, and OK computer is the pinnacle of their work. Radiohead is a name that will be remembered along with the likes of The Beatles and Pink Floyd.
0156027321|4.0|Okay, so I picked up Life of Pi to see what all the hype was about. After reading it, I am lead to believe that the general reading populous has a lot on its mind in the way of the meaning of religion and life.<br />Pi Patel is an Indian boy fascinated by religion; he takes on several religions at once, the culmination of which is a hilarious scene in which the leaders of each religion coincidentally converge upon Pi at the same time. The actual story of Pi's ordeal does not begin until a good chunk of the book has been spent describing Pi's spirituality. Pi's father, a zookeeper, decides to pack up all the zoo animals, sell them off, and move to Canada. During a storm, the family's boat crossing the Atlantic sinks, and Pi is left to himself with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a tiger. The tiger eventually kills all of them except Pi, and they are left to eachother for the duration. The remainder of the book chronicles Pi's survival and his unstable relationship with the tiger, and their eventual return to land.<br />Life of Pi has a slightly dreamlike feel to it, as if you're never quite sure what is real and what isn't. It is left up to the reader to decide which parts, if any, of the novel are 'true'. The book's central themes focus on spirituality, and it is Martel's portrayal of these in Pi's young and unbiased voice that will most likely strike a chord with readers. Also impressive is the book's ending, which hits hard, and also cleverly parallels the themes within the book.<br />My favorite bits of the book were the parts where Pi describes how he survived; the building of his raft, storing up water, etc. One thing that I found slightly annoying was the way the narrative switches between Pi's voice looking to the past and the author's voice describing Pi in the present. I felt rather like I was being jerked between two states of consciousness. Fortunately, these bits dwindle as the book progresses.<br />In all, Life of Pi was an enjoyable, thought provoking novel, which perhaps merits multiple readings to peruse further meanings.
0345452577|5.0|This is the best novel Kellerman has written in a long time.  It has less gore and more mystery.  I love having to follow the trail of nuggets left by the older physician for the protagonist.  The protagonist goes from clue to clue, doubting at first, but believing and solving in the end.  A very satisfying story.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I've been into Sarah McLachlan's music since 1998, when &quot;Fumbling Through Ecstacy&quot; provided an anchor during some difficult times in high school. I have all her other albums and have listened to them more times than I can count, so I was excited when she FINALLY came out with a new CD last year. I sat down and listened to it, again and again... and was just disappointed. Not at all with her singing; Sarah's voice remains perfectly, sensuously beautiful. Nor so much with the lyrics, which, while I had a harder time identifying with them than with many of her other songs, were still deep and well-written. I think it was the music itself. One of the things I love about Sarah McLachlan's other albums is that they have this innovative quality about them. She uses unusual rhythms and instruments, but makes them flow, makes them WORK. Here the rhythms are conventional (the opening piano and guitar in &quot;Fallen&quot; comes to mind here). It's as if she's afraid to take a risk, something countless people in the entertainment industry also seem to have a fear of nowadays, especially in music and television. <br />Yet Sarah has not completely sold out here (ahem, Jewel and No Doubt). Her lyrics and her voice are gems in a sea of cliched songs and phony singers. So compared to other CDs, I give &quot;Afterglow&quot; 4.5 stars, but compared to Sarah's earlier work, I'd give it 3, for an average of about 4 stars. :P
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Mystic River has great performances. It finally won Sean Penn an oscar and got Tim Robbins one which was well deserved. By now you have heard about the plot and know what to expect. The only thing I think hasn't been touched on alot was the ending. Once you figure out who did it, it really isn't all that great. Why? Because when you learn the motive, it makes the movie seem kinda overdone. The performances are good, but the movie can't quite make up for that.
B0001XAPX8|1.0|What in god's name was Robert Benton thinking? Or Sir Anthony? Or Gary Sinise? Was Ed Harris after the Oscar he was denied last year? This film is a perfect example of a wonderful combination of artists put together & creating a monumental cinematic disaster.. Gary Sinise(narrating here)sounds like he was awakened from a deep sleep, had a microphone shoved in front of him & handed the script to read from. Anthony Hopkins looks like he can't wait for it to be over. I wonder if when he studied acting, he ever thought he'd have to do a scene where he half-heartedly discusses the joys of Viagra. I'm not sure what Nicole Kidman's character was supposed to be...watch her closely..sultry? sexy? femme fatale? I don't think she did either.. This DVD should be free with ANY purchase...Disastrous.....
B00005JMYG|1.0|This movie was ridiculously a waste of my time and money.  I thought Will Ferrell could come up with a better script.  The plotlines were boring and there were only one or two lines that actually made me laugh.<br />Don't see this movie.  Don't waste your money like I did.
