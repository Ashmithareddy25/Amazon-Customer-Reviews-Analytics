B0085P2Z6E|5.0|My sister says, \\"Mind numbingly entertaining. It's perfect to help me prepare for sleep. The story isn't so bad. It's pretty easy too.\\"
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|can't quit watching it.  good characters are good.  bad characters are bad -- but sometimes you still love to watch them!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love playing so far....great app! It's absolutely perfect for horse lovers and enthusiasts, it is very enjoyable and quite addicting too! ^_^
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|I admit that I don't know how to rate \\"Into the Wild\\", or even what to say about it. I suppose slow-paced dramas simply aren't my cup of tea. But OK, here's a heroic attempt...<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" tells the more or less true story of Christopher McCandless a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp, a confused young man on a quest throughout America to find his true self and the meaning of life, while attempting to escape from a dysfunctional family. Like many others, he tries to find ultimate meaning in pristine wilderness, inspired by Thoreau. However, his odyssey ends tragically as he turns out to be unfit for the harsh life in the Alaskan hinterland. Or maybe not so tragically, since he somehow finds closure and enlightenment in his last dying moments...<br /><br />The main protagonist is offered redemption and meaning at several points during his journeys, for instance by the old hippie couple or by Ron Franz (the old man). Franz also advises him about forgiveness. He is also offered love by a teenage girl. Yet, Supertramp constantly refuses the offers, being obsessed about going alone to Alaska. Perhaps this is the conflict \\"Into the Wild\\" wants to explore: are we redeemed by social relationships, or can we find meaning alone? Supertramp clearly believes the latter, constantly quoting his beloved Thoreau. However, the end of the story suggests that the real solution is the former: Supertramp is a complete failure in the wilderness, and his last words about having lived a good life obviously refer to his camaraderie with other members of the human race. Yet, his death isn't portrayed as tragic. Rather, he is reunited with his parents and sister in a near-death experience, after first being swallowed and killed by cruel nature.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is the \\"true\\" interpretation of \\"Into the Wild\\", but if it is, it suggests that what we're looking for cannot be found in pristine wilderness or splendid isolation from our fellow man. Somehow, I find that a more uplifting message than the crank deep ecology many others see in this film, and which I also saw the first time I watched it. I actually skipped most of \\"Into the Wild\\" when Swedish TV was showing it a few years ago, seeing it as yet another Timothy Treadwell story. It's obviously much subtler than that.<br /><br />RIP, Chris McCandless.plifting message than the crank deep ecology many others see in this film, and which I also saw the first time I watched it.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|My kid thought this was the best Lego set to date, and instantly put it together. I wish they had more!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book-lots of action and levels of intrigue. The writing style was very different for me. The main character showed no emotion and yet it was obvious that he had many levels of emotion below the surface. Good plot, good development of the story, lots of twists and turns. Great read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire. The graphics are great. Very enjoyable game, I recommend the game for relaxation and fun.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|An interesting story using a dog as a narrator/view of events.  A heart warming love story but so much more.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Skyfall is one of my favorite bond movies!  I like the addition of some additional Bond Origin information, as well as the dignified nod to the earliest Bond films!

B007SGLZP8|4.0|The ending made the book come together. Had a little trouble with his relationship to the girl until the end. Then it made more sense.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I have always been a sucker for musicals but this is one of my favorites.  Between the story lone and the amazing actors its a movie you can't walk away from.  The music in it will make you laugh, make you cry and make you sing along the whole way.  By the end of the movie you will be able to relate to ever character in some way and I can promise you won't regret watching it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is an action movie for action movie fans. It has a solid plot, lots of action, and more action heroes than you can shake a stick at. I would recommend this movie for anyone who grew up in the 80s and early 90s, when they knew how to make good action movies. This is concentrated Whup-Ass on a DVD!
B0024F08RO|5.0|So many loops and twists in this season, I never knew what was going to happen next.  I love it, what more is there to be said.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game has been a lot of fun to play. You don't need to pay real money to enjoy playing. Be warned though, this game is addictive.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I loved the first 2 titles and I love this one as well. great play style. I can't get enough.
B00127RAJY|1.0|If I could give this zero stars I would. I do not know about the content on the DVD when it plays, because when I put the disk in I kept getting a &#34;Insert Disk&#34; message on my screen. I tried it multiple times on my dvd player, and switched between DVDs just to make sure it was the DVD and not my player. AND in the process I accidentally destroyed my FAVORITE work out dvd due to my own anger and took it out too briskly while switching back and forth and broke the disk. But yea really disappointing. Unfortunately I did not read back enough in the reviews, because other people had the same problem as well. So beware, it works on some DVD players and not others, as I gave it to a chick who lives a floor above me and it played fine. If you want a DVD that works on ALL DVD players and not on just a few then this is not the disk for you.
B000P0J09W|5.0|A group of kids in Astoria, Oregon are faced with their last weekend together as a group before a major corporation headed by the typical jerk businessman buys up their properties and kicks them out.  It goes without being said that they have grown up together and have been best friends since the moment they met.  Along for the ride is the older brother of the ringleader, Mike, his romantic interest and her friend.  The main four, Mike, Data, Chunk, and Mouth are adventurous, smart, and full of childish curiosity that brings them to Mikey's attic where they find the tale of One Eyed Willy and his hidden treasure.  The adventure that follows is in pursuit of that treasure, which also gets them entangled with known murderers, the Fratelli's and their gentle, if not different, brother Sloth.<br /><br />The tale is ripe with booby traps, pirate tales, gunshots, hilarity, and adventure that is now considered a timeless classic.  It's about friendship, loyalty, respect, the abolition of greed and judgment, and about the importance of family, life, and love.  You can easily watch this film as a kid and well into adulthood with relish and excitement.  To me, personally, it's an instant spirit-lifter and reminds me of a time when the world was full of adventures around every corner!
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I just loved the whole cd.amazon got it to me quick. I loved it.bon jovi alone is awesome.The whole cd rocks.every song is cool
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Not one of Kathy Reich  novels has failed to entertain me.This  New novel, Bones are Forever, again takes the reader on a new adventure.  The fast moving story gives a new look into forensic science, interesting and colorful background to a new location.  The best in criminal writing.
0061743526|5.0|This book is awesome.  And as the years have gone by since its initial publication, nothing has changed.<br /><br />The story is still as relevant today as ever.  The characters are well-drawn.  The setting is pure southern Americana.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird is part of the American literary canon.  It's a touching, sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic story that pulls you in from the first page.  It's a must-have addition for any library.
B003XUKVXK|4.0|This CD is great, really like the other performers who showed up. Great idea for them to make a CD out if it.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is another awesome Tarantino movie.  It's chocked full of suspense, violence, and drama.  There's a little comedy sprinkled it too.<br /><br />It'll have you on the edge of your seat.  Check it out!
0375869026|4.0|R.J. Palacio was born Raquel Jaramillo Palacio. She currently lives in New York City with her family. She is married with two sons and two dogs. Before becoming a renowned author Palacio was an art director and graphic designer who designed book jackets for other authors. After designing for over twenty years Palacio decided to write her first book which she titled Wonder. Wonder was released in February 2012. Through Wonder Palacio writes about bullying and how some members of today's society act and how they should act.<br />Wonder is about a boy named August, who goes by the nickname Auggie. He is going into the fifth grade and has been home schooled his entire life. Auggie is special because he was born with a genetic disorder that caused his face to be disfigured. He has had countless surgeries to help bodily functions such as breathing, and hearing. At the beginning of the book Auggie will begin the fifth grade in an actual school for the first time in his life. Auggie is nervous about starting at school because he is afraid of what the other students will say to him and about his face. In the beginning of the story Auggie's peers do not seem to be mean to him. He makes a few friends and a girl named Summer even sits with him at lunch. However, as Auggie's story progresses his peers become bullies. They begin making fun of him. They spread a rumor that if you touch Auggie you will be infected with his disease. They also make comments about his face saying things like it looks like he was burned in a fire or comparing him to Darth Vader from Star Wars who was also badly disfigured. The book is divided into different sections based on different characters throughout the book. In these sections each character shares their experience with Auggie and how they are dealing or have dealt with his situation. One section is titled Via, for Auggies sister. Via shares her experiences and how she is somewhat ashamed of her brother and how she feels guilty for it. Each section has a distorted picture of the character but it does not revel much. Palacio describes most of the characters in the book and leaves the reader to their own imagination to put a face to the character. Throughout the book the reader finds out about Auggies trials and tribulations at school. Auggie has mishaps with bullies during Halloween, and then he goes through life changing experiences when he looses his dog Daisy, who loved him no matter what he looked like. At the end of the book Auggie is brought together with the rest of the students when they attend a field trip with other schools. Auggie and his peers come together when kids from the other schools bully Auggie. His peers then defend him. Auggie also wins the Henry Ward Beecher medal at his fifth grade graduation. The award is given to a student who is kind, friendly, courageous, and one who has good character. He then realizes that going to school was a good idea.<br />I really enjoyed reading Wonder. As a adult I was intrigued by Auggie and his problems. I also like that this book focuses on bullying in schools. Bullying is a growing problem in schools and I think that students and adults should be more aware of the consequences of bullying and how to prevent it. This book reaches out to the audience and shows them how hurtful society can be. There is also a lesson to this book showing the world to be nice to others.<br />References:<br />Palacio, R. J.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is amazing. The only thing I wish would change is that when you exit the app, the music keeps playing.
B009AMANBA|1.0|This must be the most boring movie I have seen in recent times. The photography is poor, the acting is poor, and the story line is completely un-engaging. When a movie is good, I look forward to viewing it again. You could not pay me enough to waste my time with this movie ever again.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Never loved a book so much, read it in less than 12 hours and it probably would have been less if I my eyes weren't constantly hurting because I didn't turn down my bright and because my kindle was constantly dying
0618918248|1.0|I cannot believe the childish tripe passing for reviews. Dawkins book is a joke. There is NO way to prove OR disprove the existence of God using science or any other method. Those on EITHER SIDE making this claim ARE insane or simply lying.<br />Those claiming this vacuous book \\"proves\\" anything are obviously hostile religious bigots whose hatred against any and all religions borders on the pathological.<br />Actually more people have died at the hands of atheist leaders then from any Religious group. But alas, they don't count because it wasn't done in the name of atheism. REALLY?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! So it's worse to die from someone who believes in God then someone who doesn't. Try telling that to the families of the victims. See if they buy into that nonsense.<br />Sadly a lot of pseudo-intellectual pinheads do. lol<br />It is painfully obvious that While Dawkins read the Bible he does not understand about 85% of it.<br />Sorry to those who felt triumphant but in order to ACCURATELY discuss the Bible one must first do a little research into the cultural and architectural practices of the day. And Yes! this is PARAMOUNT in understanding the context of the stories. I know a lot of ignorant fools(especially on youtube) love to babble about how evil god must be to kill children. >PALMSMACK&lt; They are of course babbling about Elisha. (SIGHING) Actually ONE word was misinterpreted.  Which hardly discredits the rest of the story except for those desperately looking for an excuse. I hate to break the sad news for those arrogant individuals BUT the Bible (while relevant to those of us today) was written in style for the time period it was written in.<br />Okay first things first. Those were NOT children. The ancient Hebrew word used was for YOUTHS. meaning young men ages 12 to 25 years old. Second, Baldness in those days was associated with Leprosy.(Elisha did not have leprosy he was merely bald) Next the \\"go on up\\" was obviously a reference to Elijah being taken up to Heaven.<br />Also if the bears killed 42 of them HOW MANY MORE OF THOSE TEENAGERS WERE THERE?! 45? 50?60?<br />And there were NO CELL PHONES, No cars, No police, they had soldiers who were likely more then 20 miles away and the closest residence could have been 10 miles away. So there was Poor Elisha surrounded by a group of TEENAGERS who were taunting him, challenging his authority as a representative of God. They're calling him baldy was essentially them saying \\"Hey! If your a Representative of God, why did he let you get sick?\\" And the \\"Go on up\\" uh hello?! How do MOST PEOPLE get to Heaven? (whether you believe it exists or not is completely irrelevant)THEY DIE! So they were asking Elisha to die! Sounds like a death threat to me! So IF (for the sake of argument) God did indeed send 2 brown bears to kill 42 of those teen thugs, then THAT WAS A GOOD THING! HE SAVED ELISHA'S LIFE!<br />Oh and how about Moses! Now I hope even the little non-believers know that the things described in the Bible HAS happen since! IN a small village in Africa a huge lake became contaminated by Red Algae. And the water turned Red, the fish died, frogs left the lake in large numbers, etc. Oh so that proves that there was no need to for any supernatural act for that to occur. WELLLLL, the problem with fools is they sometimes are looking in the wrong place.<br />YES! There science caN explain ALL OF IT! Yes there is!<br /> I'm sure some of the regions leading scientists used ALL OF THEIR equipment to test the water, and used their considerable knowledge about aquatic life OR did research, and based on all of this science they able to explain away everything that occurred. (sighing)<br />So why am I not bummed you ask? LOL!!!!!!!!!<br />What scientific equipment did Moses have?! Hmmmmmm?.....................Well?! He DID accurately PREDICT EACH AND EVERY EVENT BEFORE IT HAPPENED AND WITHOUT ANY PRECEDENCE FOR THESE THINGS! so how did he do it? No Scientific equipment, No Historical documentation to help him out.He knew because God told him!<br />Oh why didn't God (if he exists lol) tell him the most complex scientific jargon possible? Uh, what is the purpose of language? Is it to show off how intelligent one is?(or isn't?lol) Or is it to communicate?<br />For those who chose the second choice, WELL DONE! Yes, the WHOLE purpose of language is TO COMMUNICATE! So how intelligent would anyone REALLY consider God if he had Moses using the biggest longest Scientific words to communicate to the Ancient Egyptians?! Uh, not too smart! they would have stared at him like he had two heads!<br />And Why did he describe the Nile turning to Blood instead of being contaminated by Red Algae?! DUUUUUUUUHHHH! Let's see. How many people would have understood Red Algae? Hmmmmmm.... Uh, how about none! Including Moses! But let's see.....hmmmm,  a Red Liquid associated with death. Now how could Moses describe it so that even the most primitive and educated minds of THAT TIME understand. hmmmm, Red Liquid = Death. Now what word...........Hold it! I've got it! Blood! LOL! Yes, I do engage in heavy sarcasm.<br />Oh but wait! Dawkins Only Real assertion is how Religion drives people to kill like those Christians who 900 years ago went to Jerusalem to fight off invading Muslims. Who WERE invading the town! And BTW The Christian Crusades ONLY involved about 15% of ALL Christians living on the planet BUT since when do Religious Bigots stick to facts?!<br />Same with the Salem Witch Hunt which involved LESS then 1% of ALL Christians living on the planet and WAS condemned by a Minister at the time! And that both the Governor and his wife WERE BOTH CHRISTIANS! And that was over 700 yrs ago!<br />And the Spanish Inquisition involved less then 20% of ALL Christians living on the planet! Because there WERE AND ARE Christians living in India, Africa, and throughout Europe! And those ended hundreds of years ago but apparently these psychopaths were there.<br />I mean from the way they keep bringing up ancient history, they act as if it happened yesterday! What a joke!<br />The same psychotic losers who tell those of us who are angry about something a politician did 10 years ago to \\"let it go and move on. it was ten years ago after all\\" Hypocrisy much?!<br />And if Religion is \\"GREATEST EVIL\\" Then what about Adolph Hitler? As much as pathological liars LOVE to claim he was a Christian the truth is HE WAS AN ATHEIST! And he killed 12,000,000 people! And Mao Zedong!  Between 49-78,000,000 people! Jozef Stalin (USSR, 1932-39)6,000,000! And he too was an atheist! So being an Atheist is hardly a \\"superior\\" way of life. Those who try to dismiss this are nothing but liars who cannot and will not allow their psychotic narrative (that they cling to for dear life) to be disturbed in any shape manner of form.<br />And if Religion is \\"So Evil\\" the way so many babbling baboons claim then why have so many start charities? Salvation Army? Red Cross? Hospitals? etc.<br /><br />I wouldn't believe a single word Dawkin said if he swore he was lying. He is so creepy. And his take on the Bible is a joke. Again, if you don't understand the times the stories were written, any attempt to understand them WILL FAIL! Like he did! Tell him to come back when he's actually ready to write an intelligent book about the Bible. Until then he can just keep being subjected to mockery from those who have actually spent a little time studying the Bible. Oh and any bad grammar hardly invalidates anything I've said. Except to desperate fools looking for any flimsy excuse to ignore reality. RMEion to help him out.He knew because God told him!<br />Oh why didn't God (if he exists lol) tell him the most complex scientific jargon possible? Uh, what is the purpose of language?

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus is a good app. Works well when I need it! Only use it for the occasional calculation, but it loads fast and gets the job done(:
B004N0I3U2|4.0|Goldeneye is about as far-fetched and over the top as any good Bond movie is.  Even so, it was a fun way to spend a couple of hours.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I have really enjoyed this CD! It doesn't have a song on it that doesn't fit with the others. If you like a lot of emotion and raw aggression in your music this disc is for you! From the intro to the very end this was a very enjoyable experience from an awesome group!
B00CCKWUNG|5.0|Quentin Tarentino's western film, Django Unchained pays tribute to the Italian (spaghetti) westerns of the 1960s and 1970s.  The film is a masterpiece of film-making because of the production, camera work, script, acting and score. What makes this film remarkable is that Tarentino is a superb storyteller with panache.  The 160 minute film never feels that long because one is lost in the story.  The main cast of Christof Walz, Jamie Fox, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel Jackson, Dennis Christopher and newcomer Kerry Washington are all in fine form. He is helped by a plethora of veteran and character actors who pop in and out of the film.  Among them are Bruce Dern, James Remar, Robert Carradine, Don Stroud, Tom Selleck, Tom Wopat, etc.  This is a magnificent western and a fantastic film.  But, it is not for everyone.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Being a fan of the Star Wars universe, this Angry Bird's game with the Star Wars theme hits home. With Bird's using light saber's and Force like powers, a Chewbacca bird and more, whats not to love? Different planets to travel to, a Death Star and more, you will find yourself immersed in Star Wars goodness!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ad me to the list of fans of Hugh Howey! This is a great story and I'll be ordering whatever else he's written soon. A great surprise is how well written the book is. The Kindle version had one or two typos throughout the entire book. Many of the home-publishing authors have several errors per-page and it becomes very difficult to read. This was thoroughly enjoyable.
B009SH5JS4|5.0|It's my go to movie when I've had a bad day. It always makes me feel better. Meg Ryan and Kevin Klein are great together. Jean Reno is superb as always. Don't miss it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Didn't know much about Hayao Miyazaki before getting this movie. I just bought it because I was tired of watching the same old Disney and Pixar films and wanted to try something different. Japanese cartoon is def. different. In a good way. May be a little scary for kids under 7 yrs old. Esp. if you've got the surround sound going.
B004J64QSI|5.0|An amazing experience - especially the finale! Some of the best performances in any Les Mis performance. The only disappointment is Nick Jonas - not quite ready for the professional stage.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|This is a murder mystery placed in the early 50's. Greed is at the heart of the matter, with a couple of murders thrown in.  It's written in a different style than most current mysteries are written.  It was gripping and fast moving. If you haven't read a classic lately, try this one. I would recommend it to fans of mystery thrillers.
B004I744AS|5.0|It's very helpful especially when you don't have access to a book dictionary. I would recommend it to anyone! its great
B004XCUEXY|5.0|I saw this on Vh1. The concert was the best I have seen in awhile. The FOO FIGHTERS ROCK!!! I did not think it could get any better and what came next totally blew me away. JIMMY PAGE and JOHN PAUL JONES!!!!! Dave and Taylor seemed so humbled by them being there and Dave almost lost it! WHO COULD BLAME HIM!!!!!They were playing with JIMMY PAGE!!!! And SEEING THE SHEER JOY in their faces in playing with PAGE AND JONES IS worth buying this DVD. The respect that they showed these LEGENDS was very touching. I got goose bumps. I had taped this and watched it several times. NOW, I am going to buy the DVD. It 's a CLASSIC.....

B001TCHDPS|5.0|This is a great cd. It's like finding a master piece of some art that you never knew existed. Enjoy.
1451648537|5.0|Read this book and you will be inspired, from the beginning.<br />The tone of the author throughout the book is very straight to the point, and sometimes funny as some things are said bluntly.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez's movie was excellent. It was a great story of a beautiful man who kept to his ideals throughout his life. But what made the movie transcend to something extraordinary was the music. This album has heart and soul.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I was an avid Harry Potter fan when the tale originally began to unfold, but unlike most of my friends, I tired of the story before reading all of the books (I know, I know, my bad!) Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is the first book of this type I've read in years, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story was creative and the writing was a joy to experience. It kept me engaged from start to finish.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Had no issues with it, everythin was good to go.  Cheap price for it also!  Love the series can't for seaons 3 to come out on DVD.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|A great, insightful, documentary. This documentary gives a lot of insight to how Vogue creates a great September issue each year.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|OMG this is sooooooo fun but it takes up a lot of space. Other than that it's amazing. Great game and I hope they make new updates for this game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book.. read and you will understand. If you've ever felt alone this is perfect. And we have all felt alone.
0393035158|5.0|Strong arguments...controversial but beautifully written<br />Conscientiously annotated with multiple backing references<br />A good provocative addition to any thinking person's library..
B000MR9D5E|5.0|One of my favorite films of all time.  Just make sure you get the David Attenborough version.  I do not know why they bother dubbing these in &#34;American English&#34; but they are never as good.
B0080BFVPU|5.0|Dialogue is fast and snappy, characters are all memorable.  Was great to see that this came out on the anniversery.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|By the time I finished season 3, within 3 weeks of starting season 1, I was so connected with the characters I actually felt bereft when one passed away....Can't wait for season 4!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Rented this movie to watch with my fiance.  She normally hates Lord of the Rings movies but she said she wouldn't mind owning this one.  I rather enjoyed it myself.
B003L20IHE|5.0|Zac Efron did some very awesome acting in this movies, proving his acting abilities.  I felt that the movie was very subtle but yet showed some hints of things not to do in real life (such as turning the wheel while waiting for traffic).  This was a very touching movie played by very good actors/actresses.
0061998494|5.0|I love Craig Ferguson and found this book about his life really interesting.  It's one of those books that are easy to read and you can finish it in a couple days.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|**NOTE: THERE IS A BOX SET THAT CAME OUT IN 2010 WHICH COSTS A LITTLE MORE BUT COMES IN A HIGHER QUALITY BOX/PACAGE; THIS REVIEW TALKS ABOUT THE 2011 VERSION. KEEP THIS IN MIND.**<br /><br />Since getting into Blu-Rays this is probably the last DVD set I'll ever buy (Since I figured the odds of this ever coming on Blu-ray are almost nil). Frist it must be pointed out that this set is just an amazing value; you get every single episode of the entire show--nearly 6000 hours worth on 32 discs--for a surprisingly low price. But, allow me to talk less about the show itself and focus on what exactly the set contains.<br /><br />As I am here to present only a fair review I must disclose that right away you will notice how the box set is physically put together cheaply; the discs are all on two spindles, which I have never seen a box set do. It is clearly a cost saving measure, but since they seem to pass those savings on to the consumer there is not much I can complain about there. Also I would like to say to any prospective buyer, the only listing of the episodes and what disc each are on is printed on a paper gluded to the back of the box. Save that paper and you'll thank yourself later.<br /><br />While the audio and video quality are nothing amazing (due to how it was originally recorded), the DVDs still present the best quality you will ever see the show in. I must disclose, on a less positive note, my one major gripe for me was how some of the later seasons contain the syndicated version of the show (meaning they are shorted by about a minute each); it's not a deal breaker but that is the one thing that has me considering giving this set less than five stars. Lastly it should be noted that there are practically no special features throughout the set--something I personally would have liked to see. (I'm a big sucker for audio commentaries)<br /><br />Overall if you're a fan, or are shopping for someone who is a fan, jump on this set and I promise you will never regretthe purchase. A great show finally collected in one convenient set!<br />With this set containing 5962 hours of enjoyment (you read that right, 5962 hours), for less the price of a dinner for two how can you possibly go wrong?<br /><br />As a slight aside; I often find myself buying buy sets and never ever watching them once. It has not in anyway been the case with this set. Just pull up almost any disc randomly, hit play all, and sit back and prepare to be entertained for the next few hours. Don't let the slightly cheap packaging deter you. I really hope you take my word on this and give this amazing set a chance--wether you are already a fan or am trying to introduce the show to someone who's never seen it.<br /><br />\\"Whooa Bundy!\\"<br /><br />P.S.  As I mentioned up on the very top there is a slightly more expensive set (about 50% more at the time of this review) released in 2010 with identical discs except it is packaged better. I have never seen it in person so I cannot say if worth the extra money. Again, my review is only about the 2011 version. I just want to keep that clear. The decision is yours. I believe the 2011 set is in a physcialy smaller box (taking up less shelf space) if that matters to you but either way both sets contain the exact same discs, so keep that in mind. Whichever set you decide on will be a excelent choice.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Can literally spend hours mesmerized by this relaxing game. Best is that it is free! My grandson, who is more tablet literal than me, found this game 4 me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|'s Collins writing is riveting! Descriptions put me into the Seam, the arena, the train, the cave without getting in the way of the story. Bravo!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I will watch this  movie over and over again in the coming years. A video library staple i will share.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Book is a fun, quick read but a bit overrated.  Holds your interest just enough for you to want to see how the trilogy ends.
B009LGO88E|3.0|I bought the Circle Pad Pro, because Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance can be used with the Circle Pad Pro.<br /><br />Before you buy the Circle Pad Pro for your 3DS XL, consider the following:<br />1) The Circle Pad Pro requires a AA battery.  The AA battery lid, at least to me, is a pain because you there's a screw you need to take off.  I find this unusual, as the 3DS XL should provide enough weight and pressure to keep the AA battery lid in place.  The AA battery is required, because the Circle Pad Pro uses the 3DS XL's rear sensor to communicate with the 3DS XL.<br /><br />2) The Circle Pad Pro doubles the weight of your 3DS XL.<br /><br />3) With the Circle Pad Pro in place, you cannot access the 3DS XL's WiFi switch and cannot change games on the fly.  You'll have to remove the 3DS XL to do either of those.  I personally find the blocked access to the game cartridge a plus, as the Circle Pad Pro prevents a 3DS game from slipping out when I have the 3DS XL in my bag.  Very nice, at least to me, especially when you have a 3DS game paused before you can get to a save point.<br /><br />To summarize, I would only get the Circle Pad Pro if you bought a 3DS game that bought the Circle Pad Pro.
1594488886|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is the first book I've ready by Khaled Hosseini, and I found it to be magnificent. His characters are developed beautifully and drive the story perfectly. He handles the terrible and on-going wars in Afghanistan honestly, but he's careful to show that life goes on whether we choose to live it or not.<br /><br />I flew through this book. The writing is absolutely spendid, and the story is intoxicating. I cannot wait to read The Kite Runner and And The Mountains Echoed.<br /><br />*I received this book for free through a Goodreads giveaway.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Too much filler, not enough action. It is as though books three & four (and perhaps #5) should have been one book. The tedium of detail became barely tolerable. I am in book 5 now & it seems all too similar in tedium.<br />Mr. Martin has created some very enjoyable characters showing their good and bad sides. Pull a Hemingway, Mr. Martin...\\"less is more.\\"
B00A757EFW|3.0|Definitely a faithful reproduction but the on screen joystick is a little tricky to use. If you can adjust to the joystick then is all good.
0671042858|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite Stephen King books. A journey through feeling lost and the supernatural, from a child's perspective.
B008NR91DO|5.0|As I read some of the negative reviews, I FEEL very sorry for the people that own this. They never got what this concert was all about. If you are to criticize Gary Moore, then you should SRV as well as he was very influenced by Jimi...and thinking about it. I wonder what it would've been to have SRV and MOORE on stage playing these together exchanging solos. That would've been something to WATCH!!<br /><br />I recently got into Gary Moore because of this concert. I was well aware of who he was in the 80s as I was growing up, but he for x or y reason never punched through in America. But Im glad in Europe he had a great career and played at the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival which is something the average rock guitarists or blues players can't say or have in their resume.<br /><br />GARY MOORE - BLUES FOR JIMI<br />This for me was a night of MAGIC. All the elements aligned and Gary was able to tackle with the same fire a lot of the Guitar effects Jimi used to do. Besides that, I love his guitar tone which is huge. I wish this concert would've been longer because it leaves you wanting for me. Wonder if MACHINE GUN would've been played on here what would've happened or POWER OF LOVE from BAND OF GYPSYS because we had BILLY COX on bass and MITCH MITCHELL who, by the way had a very very good chemistry playing with Gary Moore. You can tell BILLY COX was very impressed by MOORE by the body language on stage.<br /><br />I am looking forward for more DVDS or recordings from GARY because again, he was treated by the wayside in America but before you judge Gary Moore, watch this or get some of his cds like BAD FOR YOU BABY or BLUES ALIVE. He was the Irish Blues master in every sense of the word and I wish I would've gotten into his playing years ago, not now after his passing.<br /><br />For me to make a strong statement is for a reason but \\"ALL THE PLANETS ALIGNED THIS EVENING\\" when this concert took place. We are very lucky to say the least that we have this on video.<br /><br />Again, the only other one I could picture doing this would've been SRV because if John Bonamassa who is mentioned every 10 mins wouldve been at this concert, Gary would've chopped him with a chainsaw musically and possibly had to walk off stage.<br /><br />It is amazing that after 43 years after his passing the name JIMI HENDRIX is still a name that is mentioned in the Guitar World. I guess we can proudly say he was LIGHT YEARS ahead of his time.<br /><br />HENDRIX will live in the hearts of us for eternity and we were lucky to say the least that this concert was filmed capturing all the fire and fury that Jimi had, now captured by Gary Moore. Many times, it felt like Gary was channeling Jimi Hendrix at this show.<br /><br />RATING 20<br /><br />RAY ST JOHNr /><br />Again, the only other one I could picture doing this would've been SRV because if John Bonamassa who is mentioned every 10 mins wouldve been at this concert, Gary would've chopped him with a chainsaw musically and possibly had to walk off stage.<br /><br />It is amazing that after 43 years after his passing the name JIMI HENDRIX is still a name that is mentioned in the Guitar World.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|The movie had a good plot, and some good special effects.  Overall I would rate the move an A-.  For a PG13 movie I did have my doubts.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've been following this series from Tom Clancy for awhile. I would suggest starting from the first book then reading the others. Great read!
0553801503|2.0|Not the worst but a let down after the previous work. I think Martin got paid by the word on this one. Often boring, occasionally confusing, dark and depressing. Lacks the humor found in the earlier works. Many first time and maybe last time appearances by very random characters. It feels like he got paid for a minimum number of words and chapters and just wrote words from top of mind. What a disappointment!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is woo fun it is addicting...I have it on my opossum and kindle fire but for some reason it wont work on my opossum...hummed I had a lot of stuff on my ipod game..oh well.. still a fun game
1455523550|2.0|If you've seen \\"Sleeping With the Enemy\\" then this book is pretty much the same story!  How did Nicholas Sparks not know this?  The twist with Jo at the end was a disappointment to me, but I suppose it was just a dramatic try to end the book? (otherwise it would be too predictable).  I skipped thru the book quickly just to see if perhaps Sparks had a different story line -- but not much except small details!  Wasted my time on this one.
B00004W221|5.0|It's a very heartwarming story and gets to me every time.  For those of you who are Notre Damers; you will totally enjoy it.<br />For those of you who are not, you should still see this movie; I guarantee you will love it!

1451635672|4.0|This was purchased for my husband and he gave it 4 stars  We didn't know the movie &#34;Casino&#34; was taken from this book.<br />The book is very well written. Very informative about the mob of that era.  There are no real negative comments.

B009LGO88E|5.0|Since I was planning on picking up a 3DS XL and monster hunter, figured I would splurge and pick this guy up. I think it's worth the 20 dollars if you plan on playing Monster Hunter or Kingdom Hearts: DDD, since you will get the most out of it. Other games are supported (Like MGS 3), but most are easy enough to control and you won't really be playing them long enough to get the most out of the circle pad.<br /><br />Seeing as the next Monster Hunter is coming out on 3DS exclusively and with a chance of it coming out here, the device is going to have a long lasting appeal if you are into the Monster Hunter franchise. Since I'm speaking of Monster Hunter, the right stick controls the camera and the back two buttons can be set up to be the L/R buttons, Left/Right on the D-pad, and Up/Down on the D-pad.<br /><br />The back of the device is slightly curved for extended gaming sessions and feels more comfortable if you have bigger hands. Also, if you have any case that clicks on the bottom (i.e. the Monster Hunter 3 one) you have to take it off to attach the circle pad pro to the 3DS. The power port, headphone jack and volume slider all have a space open as to not block it off while having it on.<br />If you are planning on playing Monster Hunter 3u/4 at all in the future I recommend getting this pad. Also recommend it if you are planning on buying any other (Confirmed Games) and want an easier camera to control. It also makes longer gaming sessions easier on your hands.<br /><br />Positive:<br />* Makes Monster Hunter much easier to play<br />* Better for longer gaming sessions<br />* Locks-in without the 3DS moving around<br />* Replaces back buttons with triggers
B00594XOZU|3.0|I think this app is great but sometimes it tends to stop sending my messages which aggravates me and my friends so they should work on that
B005K17RU0|5.0|Use it every day. Helps me with my outdoor plans.I can see the weather in my vacation locations. Terrific app.
B004HO6HWK|5.0|This a very good one film of full action, it reveals how a &#34;mechanic&#34; works, he neds to place all the pieces in correct place and time so to act so, when he decides to take an aprentiss it probes that is better to works alone. Excellent the scene when his &#34;partner&#34; reads the note without knowing that time was calculate exactly to explote the bomb in the car when he finish to read the note. It remains me the first film with Carles Bronson in the same theme, but in that film the end was another, I recomended.
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids and I love this game.  It is very addicting to see if you can better your score.  I would highly recommend!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|its a good game but they could make it easier to get artifacts and make it faster to regain soals.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the whole reason why I bought my kids the Kindle Fire.  They had played this game on other people's smart phones and tablets and so I had to buy them one to play.

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The series stays strong and compelling.  Great characters, especially Maggie Smith.  She got the best part.  Can't wait until Season 4 is available.
1452115567|5.0|This isn't your ordinary dog photo book. 'Maddie On Things' is a brilliantly photographed journey with Maddie the Coonhound who has charm galore!  Her sweet temperament, extreme patience and extraordinary balancing skills are combined with her best friend's photographic eye unparalleled. Sure there are other great dogs and great photographers, but never has a pair been so perfectly matched and tenderly expressed as in 'Maddie On Things'. Kudos to Theron Humphreys and Maddie the Coonhound!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Yes, it is very risque, but at the same time not inappropriate (so I think).  There's a great story behind the sexuality to help you understand why he is how he is, and enlightens readers to different coping mechanisms.  Also gives great ideas for you to use in your own relationships. :-)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved it, even though it was predictable throughout that she would escape, he would look for her, and eventually find her.  I loved the twist at the end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read all three multiple times and I still love how the first book captivates you into taking the journey with a naive, inexperienced college grad and \\"watch\\" her grow and experience different aspects of life and relationships without losing herself.  The way they help each other find their own personal, internal discoveries while blossoming their own relationship is amazing....and the sex-capades don't hurt either! :-)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using this alarm app now for 3 months , it works great , it allows you to set 3 different alarms , you can set it to your music and it gets loud as the minutes go on , it has a huge snooze button , can't miss it , I recommend this app

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am honestly at a loss for words. My sweet Christian Grey, he captivated me from the very beginning. I felt a variety of emotion for him throughout the entire trilogy. The story was enchanting. Throughout there were several twists that were unexpected. The end of book 3 left me wanting more of Christian and Ana, I actually felt depressed as if I had lost the love of a person dear to my heart. All I can say, read this trilogy, it will definitely be worth it!

0307200477|5.0|This was a book given to me when I was a baby!  I have given it to my three children and five grandchildren and dozens of friends' babies.  So darling how little ones learn to pat the soft bunny, see themselves in the mirror, peek under the blanket, put their finger in the hole.  They feel important to be interactive with their book.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Enjoyable read the ongoing stories of Doctor Brennen continue to be entertaining and informative. Who knew diamonds in Canada. They sad case of missing children is  oh so real and heart breaking.<br />I will continue to be a fan of Bones books and TV.
1400069807|2.0|Anybody who is interested in eating healthy should know all the facts in this book already. There is no shocking new information presented, no genuine discovery, nothing you couldn't get from the Internet if you where really interested in this. The writing style of the author is rather long-winding, and he repeats himself all the time. This book, condensed by at least two thirds, getting rid of all the bloated prose and just leaving the facts, would make a nice compendium of knowledge. As it is, the read is rather tedious and boring.
B009HOU672|5.0|Max Richter has created a really original re-invention of the Four Seasons that brings a freshness and originality to this delightful but rather over-exposed piece of music.<br /><br />You will either love or hate this record, there will be no equivocation.
0525478817|4.0|Although I am only 12, this book for me was inspiring. Hazel is a strong character that has even stronger opinions. She taught me that you do not have to leave a mark on the world, but that you recognize the importance of what you have. It doesn't matter if you get to be famous, or legendary, because you have already left a mark on the people around you.<br /><br />Augustus taught me that you should always dream. Always leave some sort of legacy. Because a life without dreams must be almost lonely.<br /><br />This book shares great point of views on things either big or small. In all it is a fabulous book that can change the ways you look at things. I think it was a great read and should be read by many more people.
B004N44SOI|5.0|I knew the album was going to be great just from what i have heard on the radio, but so many different styles of music.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great story, good quality DVD.  I was happy this came with a download copy as well.  For those with Lord of the Rings, this is a must have.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The author paints a portrait of his key points using historical fact. And he does it without wasting the reader's time. I appreciated his well chosen economy of words to make his point. And being a creative person myself, I resonated strongly with what he had to say about innovative, imaginative people.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of my go to movies when I need some background noise or need to just sit and relax and can't find anything else to watch.  I don't usually like movies with any amount of &#34;gore&#34; but I like the story of this movie so much I can get beyond the gore.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I played this game a few years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. A I recently got this and the expansion and am very pleased with everything about this game. I'm sure if you're reading this you have heard of this game before, but if you haven't I would recommend buying it. And if you have more than three friends get the 5-6 player expansion as well.

B0067QPVJ6|3.0|Been there, done that ... I was pretty disappointed that nothing new was brought to the table. The CGI effects were good but somehow not as visceral as the amazing effects from Carpenter's version. Like the first Alien, part of the wonder of both original films was the alien-ness of the creatures. In both films, the metamorphosis of the creatures was part of the fright. CGI does it so well that something is lost in the process.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|great concert! product was new material, but had 2 skips..would suggest to a friend, matter of fact, have already lend it to a friend..
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Good cast, well paced. Excellent plot.<br />Held my interest through the entire film.<br />Mathew D. (the star) handles this kind of role very well.
0425252868|5.0|I have given this book as a gift three times and read it avidly myself.  It was another that I read until all hours of the morning.  Even though pilots and soldiers on both sides were trained to fight and kill, there was still that moral thought that says &#34;Enough is enough.  I need to put myself in his place.&#34;<br />There was Chivalry on both sides that's for sure.  I cried with them at the end.
B000VDDDVO|3.0|It was not what I expected but that is not your fault.  I will keep this DVD as I ordered it in error.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|All the elements that make me look forward to Tarantino's films are present in Django, as well as the couple of elements I enjoy less in his films, hence the 4 star rating.  Wonderful dialog (and Christoph Waltz chews every line like a delicious morsel - he's undoubtedly the best thing about this movie!), terrific cinematography and direction - full of indelible images, violent and bloody action, and that not-taking-it-all-too-seriously attitude that makes Tarantino's films so watchable and enjoyable.  The only weaknesses are the ones often found in his films, a simplistic approach to good and evil that echoes the major studio films attitude from a bygone era, and a few songs in the soundtrack that scream QUIRKY TARANTINO, instead of supporting the visuals.  All in all, a lot of fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've always liked Nicholas Sparks' books.  This is one of his best.  The story just grabbed me and brings to the forefront the horror of domestic violence.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I was afraid this would be one of those games where you are fighting for your life at every turn but found it to be fun and relaxing...even during the storms when you have to calm the carnivores

B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is seriously an excellent album, and Macklemore needs to be known for much more than Thrift Shop. There are a lot of good tracks on this album like Castle, Can't Hold Us, A Wake, and Victory Lap. My favorite track on the album, however, is actually My Oh My. Being around Macklemore's age and growing up in the Pacific NW, this song definitely brings me back to my childhood watching the Mariners and collecting baseball cards. It won't be many peoples' favorite song, but it just goes to show you that Macklemore is a true artist, capable of capturing raw emotion and energy and putting it in to music. The production on this album is also top notch, and if you enjoy good beats, you will love this album just for that alone. Please, obtain this album legitimately, it isn't that expensive and underground artists like Macklemore truly need the support.

B001LX50I2|4.0|I didn't like this movie on my first viewing. The reason is that it focuses on Hannibal more than the book does. The Red Dragon is a great story, with appearances by Hannibal, but the movie put him above the Dragon.<br />I gave it four stars figuring that for the non-reader this movie would satisfy.<br />I would give it three stars for the book reader. The Red Dragon is excellent and with the cast they have, they didn't need to put so much extra Hannibal. I guess the were afraid people would be disappointed without Sir Anthony dominating the movie. They should have taken a chance. The story holds your attention and with only bits of Hannibal in it, they would have enticed people even more with him.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this for the first time while in the Marine Corps. It was required reading for promotion to Non-commissioned officer. I have since read again and again. I gave it to my son in middle school, and reluctantly he read it. Not being required reading. He has now read it as many times as I have. Must read this book.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble' has carved out a very unique position in the music business by being unique and unafraid in his ability to cover great popular songs of the past with a small mixture of original gems that he has co-written himself.  This has led to his most amazing and diverse album yet in a career that has defied and exceeded expectations time and time again.<br /><br />To Be Loved opens with a great Sinatra cover of You Make me Feel So Young and closes the regular version of the album with Young At Heart.  Michael's phrasing owes a great deal to Ole Blue Eyes on both songs that bookend this spectacular album and special credit should go to music arranger David Pierce who makes the former song swing and bounce with verve.  Buble's music director and pianist Alan Chang handles the lilting and velvety arrangement of the latter song in elegant fashion.<br /><br />In between these two songs is where Buble' begins to stretch himself artistically as well as vocally and shows greater range and diversity than on any previous album.<br />Its A Beautiful Day may not break new ground but it has got to be one of the most upbeat and bouncy break-up songs ever written.  Who knew being dumped could be so invigorating and positive.<br /><br />The next song is To Love Somebody written and recorded by the great Bee Gees and Buble's neo-soul re-do is sensational.  An absolutely fantastic arrangement by the great Alan Chang make this one of the highlights of this awesome album, but wait there are more pleasant surprises to come.<br /><br />Who's Loving You is an amazing piece of music written by the great Smokey Robinson and most famously recorded by the Jackson Five and Buble's version is both quite an artistic risk and a revelation.  Buble' has been quoted as saying his impending fatherhood has put his life in perspective and he seems more willing to take risks on this album than he ever would have on any previous album and the listener is rewarded with one of Buble's most impassionedand soulful vocals ever to be caught on tape.<br /><br />The next song is more in his expected wheelhouse, Something Stupid which owes a great deal to Frank and Daughter Nancey's original version though the flamenco guitar adds something nice to the mix.  Some listeners may notice that Reese Whetherspoon's vocal is mixed low , but this is with intention as it was with Nancey's voice as well as it is intended to be a true harmony vocal rather than a stand out duet.  Their voices blend beautifully as well.<br /><br />Come Dance With Me gets the Latin-Salsa treatment from Buble much like his previous version of Save The Last Dance For Me.  Buble' has said he is looking forward to singing this one live in concert and I do think it will have them dancing in the aisle.<br /><br />Close Your Eyes is one of four original songs Buble' co-wrote and it is one of the most spin tingling and beautiful ballads he has ever song in his amazing ten year recording career.  Written as a dedication to his gorgeous wife and really all the women in his life, it features a stellar orchestral arrangement by the great William Ross who did the magnificent arrangement on Michaels definitive version of Cry Me A River, which Buble himself had a hand in creating.  What a gorgeous melody and what a tender and passionate vocal by that velvet voice.  Wow, if you love great romantic music it does not get much better than this song and this voice.<br /><br />After All, co-written with the great Bryan Adams is one of the best and most contemporary songs Mr. Buble' has ever cut.  It also has an irresistible melody and their voices blend quite nicely.  I think we have a future single at top 40 radio perhaps released after the next probable single, the previously mentioned Close Your Eyes.<br /><br />Have I Told You Lately That I Love You, not to be confused with the Rod Steward song that has the same title, is most closely associated with Elvis Presley as one one his most earnest and tender cuts early in his career.  Buble's understated and tender vocals stand out front much like Elvis' vocal on Love Me Tender with the great Naturally 7 standing in for the Jordinaires.<br /><br />To Be Loved, the great Berry Gordy written title cut made famous by the equally great Jackie Wilson, may be the highlight cover song on this amazing and diverse album.  What an amazing and inspiring vocal, one of the best of Buble's entire career.  Just sit back and listen to David Pierce's amazingly written strings swell and enhance Buble's majestic vocals.  What a treat for the listener.<br /><br />You've Got A Friend In Me, written by the genius of Randy Newman (Remember the song Short People), from the animated movie Toy Story is given the big band treatment by Michael with a helping hand from arranger and conductor David Pierce and it demonstrates what happens when a great song gets hooked up with a great voice for the first time.  If only Buble' had been asked to record it for the movie originally.<br /><br />Nevertheless( I'm In Love With You) is Buble's nod to one of his early idols, Dean Martin, and Buble' sings it with the grace and ease that Martin brought to his best work.  Dean must be smiling down from heaven on his disciples dedicated version. The fantastic Puppini Sisters add their amazing touch to this tender ballad.<br /><br />I Got It Easy is the last original song co-written by Michael with help from Alan Chang and Tom Jackson with an absolutely stellar orchestral arrangement from William Ross.  Buble' thought this song could be slightly polarizing but I think he underestimates the power and sweep of this majestic song that accurately reflects how lucky he feels to be so blessed in his life. Lots of famous and rich singers have felt this sentiment, but have not been able to express it so bluntly and yet so beautifully.<br /><br />The special edition version includes three more songs including a big band treatment of first single Its A Beautiful Day and a tender and venerable vocal on the classic Melancholy Baby, but the absolute highlight of this package is the Ronnettes' Phil Spector produced classic Be My Baby.  Buble' delivers this gem with gusto and verve and takes you to another place and time.  Wow and this beauty did not even make the regular album.<br /><br />To Be Loved is arguably the greatest, but definitely the most diverse and wide ranging album of his amazing career.  How often can you put a CD on your player and not hit the skip button once?
B00004WPFX|3.0|When this record isn't skipping, it sounds phenomenal. Problem is, it skips a decent amount. Biggest problem is that happens the most during Rollin & Scratchin, the most badass tune on this record. Thankfully Da Funk and Alive are fine.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I have been wanting this collection since it came out but the price (over $300) just wasn't in my budget.  I've been watching it and was able to pick this up for around $100 and I jumped on it.  Love the packaging and can't wait to sit down with my wife (who has never seen the series) and watch it again.
0143119680|5.0|Who doesn't like forbidden love - especially when there are witches, vampires and daemons!?!  Fun, interesting and playful - lots of historical references, so students of history would enjoy this as a \\"beach book\\".
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great addicting game for my kindle. Does glitch and lags at times like when the number called is your bingo, it delays registering your number and calling bingo. It is impossible to get all puzzle pieces unless you have Facebook. When I 1st loaded it anyone could chat in chat room ,but not anymore. I don't have Facebook so I can't do a few things. Love the daily tournaments and love that you can buy different daubers and use different colors. All in all , its the only bingo game I really like
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I love Werewolf movies this is the best special effects alone makes worth watch just do not have lunch beforw watching
B00821OX98|4.0|i was worried, mad and i cried all in this shows season. i thought it would be like all the other alien invasion shows but it wasn't i really liked it.
B002N9MK8G|1.0|The cover of this album is awful. I hate the way it looks. The font that was used looks like it is circa the 60's. You'd think they could've chosen a picture where the black pianist and the white singer weren't right on top of each other. I studied graphic arts in Pittsburgh for half a semester and I can tell you that this design is bad, bad, bad! I hope whoever designed this album cover loses her job. I couldn't even bring myself to listen to any of the music. Don't bother with this one.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|The family really enjoyed it. A great follow up to there other movies. Looks great on the large screen TV
B009LMTDL0|4.0|To learn that even the COO of Facebook occasionally cries at work was such a relief.  It has only happened to me a handful of times, but each time was a mortifying experience.  Next time it won't be so embarrassing.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Game sometimes loses where you left off and sometimes loses game completely causing you to have to start at the beginning again. After I got to level 60 the game stopped loading causing me to have to start at level 1 again.  I liked the game but got very frustrated with the problems I kept having.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|To read through his experience and find validation as well as a deeper a understanding of the journey of spirituality here on earth has been a precious gift. I can only hope that anyone who reads this can attain the truth and fully comprehend that indeed there is more than this life, that we are deeply loved and we are never alone.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great novel that is a hard one to put down.  It is a little raunchy but that seems to get you a more tied up in it.  This story is very interesting and made me become a huge Sylvia Day fan!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful story, amazing acts of bravery on both sides of this tragic conflict.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Thankfully as a pilot of 37 years, I have never been shot at while in an airplane.  GSS
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What to love about The Martian?<br /><br />The sheer human factor of this book. I humanize space travel again, in a age of sky cranes, rovers and probes, this places a human back into the role of explorer and not just an observer. The whole book is memorable, but the \\"eureka\\" moments always shine.<br />You will laugh, cry and think while reading this book, i also recommend the audio version, the narrator was excellent (whispersynch rock!)<br /><br />I will keep an eye out for this author, we can expect great things from him.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The game was great fun. I really enjoyed playing. I like that it lasted more than one sitting. Good game for the seasoned player.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|NO spoilers or critique here.  And, I haven't read the book.<br /><br />I watched it by myself in my version of a &#34;home theater&#34; (to achieve the full effect).  And, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />However, little did I know I wouldn't realize the FULL affect until twelve hours later,...while I was at work (by myself, again), thinking about the story,...What's wrong with me?,...a fifty-year-old kid breaking down into a blubbering mess,...the entire weight of the story landed on me,...too much to tell.  I want everyone to experience it.  Maybe some won't.  Maybe some will.  And, hopefully, if you do, it'll happen during the movie, not twelve hours later.<br /><br />At a minimum, the visuals are impressive, especially the dream/hallucination sequences.  And, two hours flew.
B008PALI5S|5.0|Very nice performance! Set up was impresive. Dudamel does a great work putting together two marvelous orchestras. After listening Mahler 8, honestly it's hard for me to listen anything else!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I love this app. It lwt's me see all my pdf documents and make notes on it. The only downside is that sometimes there are only certain thigs I want to highlight/underline but it either does it all or only part ways. It could be my device but then again it might actually be the app. Regardless, it's great and I gotta love it as a college student.
B00BR476TG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but found it to be struggling to capture and reveal a clear storyline.  it seemed to get lost in trying to maintain an action line for those who watched to see the struggles of a Tiger and man alone in a boat and the the more meaning connection with the parable that could have been told.  Unfortunately, for me, it fell short on both sides.  I would rate it entertaining, but not worthy of a second viewing and short of my expectations. I was left numb rather than engaged and provoked as I had hoped to be.
B009LGO88E|3.0|First off do NOT buy these from Amazon until they are going for $20.  They are now available on Nintendo of America's website so you no longer need to import.<br /><br />Now on to my impressions of the actual CPP XL (circle pad pro).  For games that support it, it works great.  I only have Resident Evil but it changes how you play the whole game and makes it infinitely better!  This thing is HUGE but it feels good in your hands and makes it close to the size of an Xbox 360 controller.  Feels solid too, the second circle pad feels just like the one on the system and all the buttons (it adds three) are super responsive.<br /><br />The negatives, however, may turn a lot of people off.  Possibly the worst thing is that when playing a game that doesn't support it, you pretty much have to take it off.  It's extremely awkward to reach the R button and in a complete bonehead move the CPP doesn't work on games that don't support it.  And I mean it doesn't work with them AT ALL.  Obviously the second circle pad doesn't work but oddly neither does the additional R button that's added.  One of the reasons I bought this (yes I should have done more research) was to use it as a \\"grip\\" and make holding the 3DS XL more comfortable, but because playing games that don't support it is so awkward that use is out the window.<br /><br />Just as annoying is the fact that instead of drawing power from the 3DS, it actually requires one AAA battery.  Yes it's only one but it's still annoying.  Even worse is that it completely blocks the stylus!  That means you either need a spare one or just keep yours out all the time.<br /><br />It's a decent, solid piece of hardware but it's enjoyment is significantly hurt by several bonehead moves.
0470474874|4.0|This book presents is a wealth of information and concepts for developing models and the material can be used no matter what version of excel you are using.  It is a cheaper way to gain a lot of information and make great strides in improving your spreadsheets efficiency understanding of how to approach resolving some complex issues associated with excel. If you aren't familiar with Microsoft applications and shortcuts you might be better served in buying a current version that is completely compatible with your application/version but the material and information will be the same.
B0063IH60K|4.0|THIS IS SUCH A CLASSIC GAME AND WILL NEVER GET OLD. I PLAY IT ALMOST EVERY NIGHT WHILE TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP. WILL NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS EASY, CLASSIC CARD GAME.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|The all-star comedic cast of this film doesn't disappoint, though the humor is a trifle stale and a bit forced. I'd hoped to see more of the birds, which were, after all, the pot of gold at the end of The Big Year Rainbow. Few were actually shown, and some of those looked like they'd been manipulated in both Photoshop and Poser--not real. The film is enjoyable but shallow.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|Scenery is amazing.  keeps you on  the edge of your seat.  I liked Silence of the Lambs.  This is a must see.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Great movie about a horrible period in human history! Blu-ray makes it a collector's edition. Highly recommend the Limited Edition!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Amazing continuation of the series and wonderful development of the story. Can't wait for the next book and he rest of the series!
B0081HLMD8|5.0|I usually do not like seeing movies that were made from books - something is always screwed up. I loved the book by Jo Nesbo and was intrigued when I learned the Jo was involved in the making of the movie.  I decided to give it a shot.  LOVED it so true to the book, it was uncanny.  You don't even get distracted by the sub-titles - yes the movie is THAT good.  Do yourself a favor and read the book too.  And while you are at it - read all of the Jo Nesbo's books, you won't be disappointed.
0385349947|5.0|I applaud Sheryl Sandberg for writing this book! She has jump started a national conversation about women and the sometimes hidden, sometimes self-inflicted stumbling blocks they face to fully reach their professional goals. The book is full of personal anecdotes, which give it the feel of a &#34;conversation&#34; with the author. (It is, however, thoroughly footnoted and indexed.) I would urge all women to read this book, and tell them to urge the men they know to read it also.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great product; I would highly recommend it. Great Show to Watch (Must See). Would buy from again!
1452115567|5.0|It's beyond fabulous - and the fact that Theron and Maddie give so much back to the community and to animal rescue makes them angels!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I have watched this several times already to see if I missed anything or just to enjoy again.  This is certainly well done.  Something the big 3 or 4 could learn from.  Take a good story and properly support it and it will do well.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like bingo blitz but it definitely has the occasional screw up that hips u out of credits levelling up. But overall I must say I play everyday.
0316228532|5.0|If you read this book expecting Harry Potter then of course you will be disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you approach this book without preconceptions, misconceptions or expectations of wizardry then you will be rewarded handsomely with a superbly plotted, dramatic, humorous, insightful, rude, lewd and ribald tale.  This book is full of extremely memorable characters, some lovable, others despicable and detestable.  This is a tale of love, hatred, bigotry and redemption; there are wonderfully inventive and evocative descriptions of lusty sex; there are many laugh-out-loud moments, and also teary moments.  As with her Potter books, Rowling gives us huge amounts of detail and back story, and, as with Potter, all elements are deftly and skilfully woven together at the end so that everything makes sense.  The last chapters, where seemingly everyone's lives unravel in one way or another, are a tour de force that had me gasping in amazement at the skill of the author.<br /><br />Stop expecting Harry Potter redux; do expect a terrific read, and you will not be disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played plenty of different bingo games and bingo blitz is my all time favorite. If you are going to play bingo you must play this one.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As someone raised in the 80's, the promise of nostalgia is what interested me in this book initially.  But as I read further, I was hooked on the story itself and the interplay between the seductiveness of illusion and the reality of, well... Reality.  Good versus evil, a romance, a bromance, what more could I ask for?
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love playing this bingo game on my kindle fire. If you have issues they resolve them fast..i recommend this game to everyone
B006VSP906|5.0|Admiring HItchens, one is allowed to see the sweetness of the man as he lets us into his sick room,where although he is hoping for a cure, he is realistic and does not ask for pity. That such an interesting man's life was cut short seems unfair.<br />I had not heard Christopher was ill and now that he has gone, I search for every word he has written and listen to his wonderful videos  and wish that he had been with us longer and had been a little less mortal.
B000002H2H|5.0|I love the older Metallica music.  It has such good music that I can relax to it or jam out on certain songs.  Thanks again.
B007REV4T8|5.0|A bit of a fantasy, but as true to form a very entertaining story as mos of the &#34;007&#34; movies are.  Hope to see more in the future.
B000H305U0|5.0|I love this CD so much that my other one would not play anymore  so I had to get me another one and I love it.  Thanks

B000002GBD|5.0|I ordered this for my brother and he loved it.  Thanks for keeping the older music around.  It brings back memories.
B00C8ULNVK|5.0|Fantastic. All of the songs are composed by Carlos himself.<br /><br />This is the best album by Vives in the last decade. Will it be on par with award-winning Dejame Entrar? I believe it could.<br /><br />More classic La Provincia sound than his previous works. Beautiful lyrics as well.<br /><br />100% Recommended
1602830452|3.0|There are some aspects of these programs that may displease or bore some listeners.<br />1. The short stories are padded out to fill the 45 minute broadcast time slot. This makes some of them slow paced. Some of the padding material does not fit in with the period drama.<br />2. In some stories the most obvious and important clue is ignored until the last few minutes. For example, a person is walking down the street in a cheerful mood. They look at a newspaper headline, They become instantly depressed and kill them self a few minutes later. Where would you look for a clue to their behavior?<br />3. In some episodes Sherlock exhibits immature adolescent behavior.<br />4. In the earlier episodes Sherlock exhibits the symptoms of a severe case of the mental illness of egomania. For example: boasting, ridiculing others, throwing a temper tantrum when something happens that reveals that he is less than perfect.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a CD one can listen to over and over again without becoming tired of such a great talent

B005Y423ZC|2.0|As much as I enjoy Adele's talent as a singer, I thought I would enjoy the live concert. But Buyer Beware! Miss Adele has a potty mouth and uses it during the breaks between songs. Since I don't use this type of language and protect children from it...I feel it was money down the toilet. I do enjoy listening to the 21 CD.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I paid for this download, however due to an error that I was unable to resolve (and I'm pretty darn computer savvy) I could not view the movie, even though I had previously view other movies using the streaming service. I'm certainly owed a refund but I'm sure I'll never get it. The problem had to do wtih the Java version, and even though I updated to the most current version and the sun-microsystems website confirmed this, I STILL was unable to view the movie. I was quite frustrating.
B009JZZRGE|4.0|The Good Wife has consistently been the best written show on tv since it premiered (and yes, that includes Mad Men).  Great plots, fine acting by a terrific cast, and what have they done? Written themselves into a hole they can't get out of!  Of course Peter can't win his race for governor and have his wife continue to be an important litigator (and partner) in a Chicago law firm?  Is Michelle Obama still at her former job or practicing law ANYWHERE?  So the fact that Peter is going to lose is a foregone conclusion and there can't be any real suspense, just fake suspense, which is a severe disservice to the terrific work everyone has put in on the show.  It's unlikely the show can recover from this mistake so I see it limping thru a fifth season and then ending.  so needless....
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I liked this book but not as much as the first one. I would however recommend the book to others.
B004XZR63M|2.0|I recommend this book as a good start for any unsophisticated investor or anyone who is willing to loose its shirt.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I loved this app until recent update. Too cluttered. Too difficult to navigate. More is not always better. Uninstalled and went back to Weather Channel app after using the old version of AccuWeather happily for over a year.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was fantastic, and eye-opening.  I picked it up because the criticism of it by those in the media and random bloggers had me wondering what the fuss was about, and I'm so glad I did.  Most of their criticism is misplaced, in my opinion.  Sandberg presents a compelling argument for why women need to be encouraged to take control of their lives, in the business world and everywhere else.  Her arguments are backed up by solid research and illustrated nicely by her personal experiences.  As the mother of two daughters, I found lots of information here that will (I hope) help me as they approach college, grad school, and beyond. A wonderful, provocative, book.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|To me this was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! I am a huge fan on Tarantino's films and this did not disappoint. Mind you it takes place before the civil war so be prepared for \\"n bombs.\\" I told one of my friends about the movie and he enjoyed it. I would give it a try if I were you.....
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|This movie is stupid! Its more like butt squad! I rather watch Johnny Dangerously over and over for 10 days straight than to watch this movie again.

In fact, the settings menu is completely gone. Tried uninstall/reinstall, no change. Please bring the settings menu back!

B00B2166BS|5.0|The cable just works. It doesn't fit nicely with my poetic case but I can live with that. If the nexus were without a case, the product would stay attached easily. The charging seems to be significantly faster than the usb cord. I mainly bought it because I develop on the device and can't stand my battery running out while testing (you cannot usb charge and debug at the same time).
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Great movie there's quiet a message packed in here. Would watch it again and again lots to be hleanedfrom this gem.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Funny, Funny and Hilarious, our whole family can't stop laughing. I love this show no wonder there is six seasons.It is a must have.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have this game on my IPod, and I found it extremely glitchly and laggy. Every time I tried to jump, I would always end up losing. However, on my kindle fire HD, it is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! This app has wonderful graphics, and is an excellent way to entertain all ages. Love it!!
0345803485|5.0|I wanted to see what all the fuss was about so I bought this for me and one for my friend. We both thought it was a really good read and are excited to read the next one.
B002RKRSV0|4.0|I really loved this book in many ways.  One of my favorite things about it was that when the characters were talking, it would make the pacing of the story a bit hectic, and then the author would begin to describe things in an almost philisophical way that was very soothing.  I loved that continual back and forth of energy flow.<br /><br />One thing that I thought was really interesting about this book was the hindsight.  In hindsight you could see at exactly what point the inevitable tragic end was set in motion.  All the way back to one casual comment, and then the characters were just acting true to their nature, being the only people they could be, the people they were.  And the results led to a man's death.  But just because something so terrible happens does NOT mean that people would not enjoy the book.  It was a very compelling book, and one I'm sure I'll read several more times over the course of my life, and I highly recommend it.
0738727326|5.0|These cards are amazingly gorgeous.  I only had a small preview before ordering, but seeing them now just astounds me.  The detail in the art and the attention to detail in each illustration's representation of their card just blows me away.  These are definitely going to be my favorite for many years to come
B008B92U32|4.0|Fun to pass the time or create humor in an otherwise dull moment. App works well and for the most part it's easy to figure out how to use it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This is probably the best Bond movie ever made. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Watched it with 10 year kids and it was not full of filthy language.
B004N8CP8K|4.0|While I normally use RDP from a computer, there are times when I only had my tablet and needed to address an issue on a managed machine. The thought of using a public computer to remote into a machine makes my skin crawl and is not an option. This app allowed me to do it from my tablet with ample security and encryption for the connection. The interface after the connection is identical to what I would see if I was using an actual computer. I did have to do some zooming to see everything but it is on a tablet after all.<br /><br />This is a good solution for admins who need that occasional RDP connection when a tablet is all they have in hand.
0812548094|5.0|So epic - I didn't think he could pull off another stunt like that!  The Stone of Tears has all of the power and passion of Wizard's First Rule, and careens along with you hanging on tight.  There is no disappointment, either, with the half-segue into the next book; it fits just right.  Loving this series already!!
B000QXDED6|5.0|The title says it all...It's 300! I've watched this movie more times than I can remember. It is a great motivator and pick-me-up. The price was impossible to pass up and the quality was excellent..
B003UBTX7C|3.0|Seemed like David Baldacci had to write a certain number of pages, and he did.  Not as good as the first ones.
B0018CAAN6|5.0|I couldn't believe it took me this long to buy this album.  It was a great deal (thanks Amazon MP3!) and really great music.  Definitely recommended!
B0053O89JM|5.0|good product, love the series, wish there was more, I will miss dr house. I am rewatching it for the second time
B008Y5OWSO|5.0|I love it.  I'm sorry that it ruined United Artists and the mistreatment of animals in this film is disturbing to me, but it's an important film that addresses power and those who use and abuse it.  If you want to see a movie about the ugly side of American history, this is it. Great performances all around (one of Isabelle Huppert's very few English language performances for American film) and absolutely gorgeous frame composition by Cimino.  I think he aims for David Lean and falls short, but not by much. Like I said in the heading, you either love this film or hate it. It's not a Chuck Norris movie.  It's not an Adam Sandler movie.  If you thought The Deer Hunter was too long (especially the wedding scene) then Heaven's Gate probably isn't for you.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Everything works great. I love that it shows you how much time you have, but I don't like that you can only have 3 alarms. Since it is free it is well worth it.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|It was great to be able to watch the movie without having to go to the theater.  With kids it is hard to coordinate a baby sitter etc to go out and see a movie.  I was able to enjoy the movie in the comfort of my own home.  My Dad is hard of hearing and it would be nice if they included closed captioning.  That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars because Netflix does offer closed captioning that is a make it or break it deal when watching a movie with my Dad.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Good book but only about 50 percent of the book is about Tesla<br />Still a good book and a good research tool
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a recommended app for anyone. I was hooked isntantly...not the Oregon trail I was expecting. it free!!! that's awesome. well done making the game. ive had it for a week so far
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Nom nom. This app is amazing there is so much to do and its free, amazing for how long it will last you.
0394818237|5.0|My husband & I read all of the Richard Scarry books to and with our son as he grew up.  He loved all of them; so the tradition continues.  Excellent visual learning and association not to mention fun for little ones & parents.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Great book it was so good. I was so sad when I finished the book. I will defiantly be buying an other one of his books
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Love the band! Love the new CD! It is most certainly my most favorite album of theirs! Would buy again!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I did not appreciate the use of the Lord's name at all.  That could have been left out completely and the novel would still be a winner.  If it was not for that I would have given it a 5 star rating.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great book. The truth shall set u free. Would recommend.<br /><br />Could not wait to get to each chapter. Would be awesome<br /> Movie?
B00005K3O4|5.0|got it fast, great movie,if you just love really really bad horror movies then get this one, its great. cheap too
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My little sister loves this game and it keeps her entertained, so great game, life like horse , wish u could earn money faster tho
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|if it is free why do u have to wait what seem like forever for lives on a game that only last for 60 second
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Love the graphics, the characters and sound. Great for all ages. My issues are: 1. Cost of extra ponies. One is 800 gems. That's over $50 real money, for ONE pony!! That much I should own them all plus extra gems. 2. Takes forever to get coins... wish there was more to do on the game.
B00943SQCI|4.0|I didn't see the tv show and know nothing about it. This review is strictly based on the movie I saw.<br /><br />This is a difficult film to classify. It's dark and is played mostly straight, but it is a comedy. But it's not your typical comedy. It's goofy, clever at times, weird and unexpected. Combine that with the writing and acting and I think this is a cult classic in the making. There are lines that make you say, \\"What did he just say?\\" Then you have to repeat them.<br /><br />Bonham-Carter is always superb. I wish she had had more to do. Pfeiffer just gets better and better. In fact, the whole cast was excellent.<br /><br />If you are looking for something that makes sense, this isn't it. It gets further and further from anything that seems even slightly realistic, but if you are able to go along for the ride, you will find something about it that makes it worth while for you - particularly if you are a fan of the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp/Helena Bonham-Carter trio.
B000001DQI|3.0|I bought this album mostly for a single track-funeral for a friend/love lies bleeding. This is one of my favorite elton john songs. It was worth it for me just to get that song. The rest of the album was okay. Still a decent album, just not as good as some of his hit collections.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very well done. Cast was superb. Woody H. was fabulous, as was J.L.  As with most book to movie adaptations, somethings have to be left out, but the essence was there.  Great movie.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I want to give this idea a try but havent had time. The book is easy to read and makes you want to give it a shot.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I purchased this in April 2012, along with the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus, so I've had it a year keeping a stable overclock at 3.8+ Ghz using the aforementioned fan and heat sink combo. I was able to reach beyond 4 Ghz, with some occasional instability- but I believe that was an issue of voltage tweaking and what seemed to be the limit of my aging motherboard, the Asus M3N78 Pro.<br /><br />As for the stock fan and heat sink, I never even considered using them- let's just say it didn't appear to be robust enough to meet the necessary requirements for maximizing the excellent overclocking potential of this chip. It is a Black Edition, so it is meant to be OC'd- let's not expect the whole package without some customization of our own! If you're looking to maximize performance, go ahead and spend the extra $30 for an aftermarket cooling solution- OR I'm sure you could go well beyond 4 Ghz with water or exotic cooling, but remember the law of diminishing returns!<br /><br />For PC gaming, this hardware serves my purposes adequately when paired with a decent graphics card- I have used both an EVGA GTX 570 SC and a Gigabyte 7970 OC, and both of those cards play well with the 965 BE. The only practical limitation I have personally seen with this CPU, vs an Intel chip, is when running the Dolphin Wii Emulator. In this circumstance, the i7 2720QM @ 2.2>3.3 Ghz on my laptop outperforms this chip, but both are still sufficient for emulation beyond the Wii's native resolution.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you choose to run this CPU at stock, or spend a little extra to overclock 400-600 Mhz or more, it's a great value, and I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to build a gaming PC (or cryptocurrency mining rig that will also be used for multi-tasking); with the savings vs. an Intel chip, you can purchase a better GPU.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like playing this game.  There are some issues like losing your credits due to a technical problem.  I get upset on those days but overall enjoy playing this game.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Since I've got this I've been playing it at every opportunity. Its quick, fun and brilliant. I would recommend it for gamers and non-gamers alike
B004QEP38U|5.0|Sound quality is excellent, all the songs we wanted from the movie are included.  Shipment was swift, communication was excellent very smooth process and I highly recommend this service.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is my 2nd Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus, and I am happy with them.<br /><br />I live in Maracaibo, Venezuela, and for those of you that doesn't know exactly what it means, let's just say we live in ~30°C and 80%+ humidity all year long. It means if we don't have air conditioner, we can't live here. It also means humans are not the only ones suffering here, computers do too.<br /><br />Having a computer in a non air conditioned environment is betting against the odds. And so it is to have it running on the standard CPU cooler provided if you work on 3D rendering software. I found out that the hard way. My previous Intel i7 920 processor and/or motherboard died while rendering (see here [...]<br /><br />You see, when you are rendering a scene with 3ds Max and the V-Ray render engine, you use all of your cores and all of your threads at 100% continuously for as long as the render procedure lasts, wich in my case to this point ranges from a few minutes to up to 14 hours per frame. It is so completely demanding that you can't hardly open the notepad while at it. Of course, it is also the most heat generating process you'll find, wich in my previous rig with the standard CPU cooler was in the range of the mid 70's °C.<br /><br />With my new rig, I keep my temperatures at 50°C while rendering, some 48°C away from my TjMax, and a very reasonable T° for a not overclocked Core i7 2700K, thanks to my Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus and a combination of other case fans. My AMD FX 8320 computer is also well within range, although I haven't tested it thoroughly yet.<br /><br />I read the reviews before buying, and even though there were better ones, the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus was always among the good ones, and you definitely won't find a better one for this price.<br /><br />It is the pipes in direct contact with the CPU that maximizes the heat transfer. You should look for that when selecting yours.<br /><br />Anyway, they are a very good purchase. I am happy with their performance and I highly recommend them for demanding computer processing.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|If you're already a devotee of Judd Apatow films, this one will undoubtedly fulfill your expectations.  And you won't be disappointed.  But if Apatatow isn't someone you're familiar with, and you happen to stumble across this film by chance, there are some observations to consider.  In a nutshell, this film opens as a typical smut-fest with many good prurient laughs, but eventually takes on a much more serious, wiser and  darker flavor.  As a result, the viewer encounters some dramatic depth not usually found in the Apatow genre.
1452115567|5.0|Maddie on Things is lovely.  The photography is amazing and first class and defies explanation.  Maddie is simply amazing.  She is a beautiful Redtick Coonhound.  What I love the most is that she is a rescue from a kill shelter, yes someone threw away this beauty. God Bless Theron Humphrey for rescuing her.  He is  spotlighting a breed that so many classify as \\"just a hunting dog\\", when in reality they are a fantastic family dog, and loving companion.  I can't wait to see what Maddie and Theron do next and anxiously await, volume 2!<br />Thank you again for this book and loving Maddie so

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a good and entertaining game. My younger cousin loves it. Couldn't help but have a shot myself. Glad that it's a free download.
B0078XFYDA|3.0|The material is geared to someone who knows very  little about the theory of evolution.  A previous reviewer had indicated that it had many good illustrations.  There were none in this book.  Maybe they were referring to verbal illustrations.
1452115567|5.0|As a dog lover this book has to be read!<br />I knew Maddie was a special dog, as I already followed her on Instagram and tumbl before i bought this book, but to read the first pages and getting to know the background story about Theron and afterwards looking at all the amazing photographs by him, I fell even more in love with Maddie than i aldready were.<br />One of my friends, who never had heard anything about Maddie and \\"This wild idea\\", read my \\"Maddie on things\\" one day and was amazed by this dog too! She said she almost felt that she got to know Maddie by every single page.<br />That pretty much describes Maddie and what this book stands for.<br />It's incredible how a single dog in the US can leave such an impression on a danish girl like me, just by standing on things :)<br />Buy the book, it's amazing!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This was reasonable written, but included paranormal inclusion to help carry the plot.  I doubt if I will buy more books by this author

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Oh my God, this book is a powerful must read!!! This book has a spirit of its own which teaches all about living through the \\"school of adversity\\" and conquering obstacles like King David against Goliath! Its voice is like the 23rd Psalm: \\"though I walk through the shadow of death.\\" Adam Brown is an awesome warrior; I say \\"is\\" because his spirit lives on!<br />Kelley, you have won \\"the spiritual Medal of Honor!\\" Thank you for being such an example of enduring love.<br />I read the Kindle version, and now plan to buy several hard copies as gifts to friends, relatives, and \\"prodigal sons.\\" I wish to someday have an autographed copy from Kelley, her and Adam's children, and Adams parents with the number 24 embossed on the hard-bound cover!

B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I have never written a review before because you guys always do a better job critiquing a film than I would, so I have always considered and respected customer reviews on Amazon before buying a movie to get a good sense of who, what, where, when, how, and how good.<br /><br />However, this time I was really surprised at seeing such a low rating for this film; a mere three stars for what I thought was an excellent movie.  After reading the reviews and realizing that most of the negative reviews (one star) were given because of packaging and have nothing to do with the film I'll have to reassess my respect for Amazon customer reviews in the future.<br /><br />Regardless of how this film is being marketed, the film itself was wonderful.  I had the pleasure of reading the Oz books and the friend who accompanied me to the film did not and we both enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />Maybe there should be two ratings; one for the movie and one for packaging/marketing, in which case I give the film 5 stars and for packaging/marketing 2 stars.

1476719071|5.0|\\"I need to hear you say it. I need to know you're mine.\\"<br />\\"I've been yours since the second we met.\\"<br /><br />Jamie McGuire's Beautiful Disaster is certainly a book that my inner voice of reason says I should not have liked so much. So...I stealthily shoved that voice in a closet, turned the lock, and melted the key. I absolutely LOVED this book! And that is almost entirely attributed to the one and only, Travis Maddox!<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is a college freshman determined to (literally and figuratively) outrun a seemingly shady past. With the fervent hope that her carefully constructed appearance and demeanor will obscure all hints of her relations and the reputation they garnered her, Abby has convinced herself that her life can go exactly as planned. That is, as long as she keeps to a defined script and only allows certain people to be a part of it. Enter Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox, Eastern University's ultimate bad boy. He effortlessly breezes through classes by day, viciously kicks ass in the ring by night, and loves `em (um, no) bags `em and leaves `em by...well, day AND night. Travis oozes confidence and charm and cheekily welcomes any challenge put in his path. Abby certainly wants to hate this guy, but she finds it nearly impossible. That's exactly how she knows she needs to stay away! But Travis will do anything in his power to keep that from happening. These opposing objectives lead to what I consider one of the most intriguing (and potentially disastrous) wagers I've encountered in a book to date.<br /><br />Abby and Travis, quite simply, put each other through hell on the path to their happily ever after. Both characters are deeply affected by pasts that have left them with insecurities and doubts of whether they deserve true happiness. Abby sees the good in Travis that she does not want to be responsible for destroying, and vise versa. They see the bad in each other too. Neither is perfect. As far from it as you can get. Abby is a very tough nut to crack. She's kind of mean. She's willfully ignorant. She's quick to run away. Travis is a few exits shy of Cuh-Razy Town. He's hot-headed. He's stubborn. He's obsessive. All these traits certainly lead to some explosive conflicts wherein the two find it almost impossible to give in to the other. But, together, Abby and Travis happen to be one of my favorite literary couples, in part because of the perfection of their imperfections. And those are some glaring imperfections!<br /><br />I really appreciated that there was no insta-love between Abby and Travis. Rather, I think there's an insta-WTF. They are both thrown completely out of their comfort zones when they encounter each other more and more in the day to day. I liked that they don't immediately jump into a passionate, whirlwind love affair. Rather, they feel each other out. Yeah, they might be attracted to each other. They might have fun with each other. They might be protective of each other. But that's hardly to be trusted as the basis for more. Instead, they do that very real, very true, very college thing of attempting to be platonic friends. Of trying to create something that will endure rather than burn out like a wildfire that only leaves destruction and scars in its path. What a refreshing concept! And one that, in the end, removes all doubt that they truly belong together.<br /><br />I also really loved the balancing effect of America and Shepley, the couple that serves as the common ground for Abby and Travis. America is Abby's best friend from childhood who has embarked on this far away journey to help Abby stay on track. Shepley is Travis's cousin, best friend, and roommate who has the gift of knowing how to handle the Travis tornado. With all the drama that constantly surrounds the central couple, America and Shepley are a welcome reprieve. They are both fun, loyal, and spirited. They have to be. Not only do they know our main characters better than anyone, their commentary lets us, the audience, know we're not crazy to think Abby and Travis are, um...crazy!<br /><br />I had difficulty connecting with Abby at times. Abby certainly has one of the best poker faces around, and that is certainly something to be admired. Given that the entire story is told from her POV, it almost ran the risk of alienating me as a reader. If it hadn't been for the people surrounding her, namely America and Travis, I would never have been able to surmise half of what was going on in her head. And if Travis hadn't fought so hard to get and keep her, I would have lost faith that she was worth the trouble. Heroines who are difficult for the sake of being difficult grate my nerves, but I never felt like this was the case with Abby. It just would have been nice to see an irrefutable tell to remind me that she wasn't a hopeless cause from time to time. On the other side of the spectrum, Travis reveals so much of himself in his words and actions (that Abby so willfully and skillfully avoids), his conviction is ultimately why it was impossible for me to give up on either of them.<br /><br />The central conflict that arises out of Abby's past was not exactly to my liking. Feeling as though the plot sometimes skipped major chunks of time that I would have liked to see more of Abby and Travis together, I hated to see any bit wasted on this storyline. This part of the story lacked the depth to make me feel invested. Considering that her past is the catalyst for the Abby we encounter at the start and through her resistance to Travis, it felt lacking. Rather, I just found myself irritated at the conflict, and subsequent heartache, it created. To her credit, Jamie does not leave the audience blind here. She gives us more than enough to convince us that Abby's best decision to date was leaving her past behind.<br /><br />Ultimately, Beautiful Disaster was one of my favorite reads of 2012! Travis and Abby are one of my favorite couples! Travis is one of my favorite heroes! Sure, there are things about this book that might have turned me off indefinitely. It may not be everyone's cup of tea. But I am an unapologetic devotee! You cannot always control what you love. And when it comes to Abby and Travis, I certainly wouldn't want to!<br /><br />This review originally posted at happilyeverhungover{dot}com.

B004QX07G4|4.0|I liked this book and had a few laugh out loud moments.  It reads just like Ellen comes across on her show.  A few of the jokes were a little on the silly side, but all in all this was an enjoyable read.
B008LG6SXS|5.0|Their prices are fair when compared to other such web sites.  But I especially like the way the web site is laid out, how you can sort and what information is provided.  There are always pictures of the rooms, clear descriptions of the various room types, even square footage of the rooms.  They make it clear when you are allowed to cancel a reservation without a fee.  People also leave reviews of the hotels on booking.com.  You can see where the properties are on a map - proximity to various sites and metros.  So all in all, a great source of information about an area.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I waited for a new cd from Dido for a long time and this was worth the wait!  If you're a Dido fan, you won't be disappointed in her new music.  Even if you're not a long time Dido fan, there are some catchy songs on there that most people who like pop music will like as well.  Great addition to any music collection!
0452257743|5.0|I love anything Stephen King.  I wanted to reread this one.  It was as good as I remembered it was.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I wasn't a fan of this show for a long time, but after I watched the first couple of episodes, I recently became hooked. The writing and acting are really great.  The jokes are intelligent and refreshing.  I am frequently laughing out loud even when watching this show by myself which is the mark of a good comedy in my opinion.  Go ahead and order all the seasons available because once you start watching it, you'll want to keep watching it.

B000J1AGQI|4.0|I didn't serve in Viet Nam, I was the only conscientious objector my draft board gave out.  I could have gone to England to dodge the draft like Bill Clinton, but we believed that if we did that, we could never come back (Clinton didn't care, I did).  I was 20 years old, but I knew the Viet Nam war was not a good idea.  The movie shows a list of 2 dozen or so who died in the battle portrayed in the movie, and we're suppose to feel badly for them.  But what about the 1800 Vietnamese who died in the same battle?  When we meet a vet, we say \\"thank you for your service\\".  Could someone tell me how I'm better off because my fellow American went to Viet Nam?  Could someone tell me what was accomplished because we went to Viet Nam?  We lost that war, so what did we actually lose?  Anyway, it's a pretty good movie.  After all these years, all those deaths, most Americans still don't get it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Okay, I can not complain about this free calculator.  It is easy to use and has big numbers, what else can I say.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I only gave this 5 stars because I can't give it 5 GOLD stars.  This show is awesome--I love the layers.  It is historically accurate  (and fascinating).  The dialogue is witty and well written.  And the set and costume design are characters in themselves.  The family upstairs is juxtaposed with the servants downstairs and the interactions are both personal and societal commentary.  There's a lot going on in every scene--pay attention to the rooms and the colors.  I just love it.

You need to own this movie (and then maintain your copy carefully..).  From start to finish, you wonder why you're not watching this type of film more often - quirky, interesting, funny, creepy, so quotable.  We have thrown out one-liners from this movie over the years and now our 15 year old will know what the he** we're talking about. Love it. So did he - not surprising.

B005IQZB14|1.0|i was disgusted in her treatment of animals, mainly her mothers horse.  How she talked of loving her mother so much and then when her mothers dies she leaves her mothers horse to suffer and die a painful death. She also did some pretty bad drugs.  I could not finish the book after reading about the horse.  It felt as though she was writing as a way to get rid of the guilt she was feeling in the mess she made of her life.<br />How Oprah loved this book, I don't understand, because she loves animals.<br />Very disturbing!

B008XIXWYW|4.0|I originally bought the DVD because I thought it had the full 45 minute reunion jam of the frantic four. It did'nt, so I ended up downloading the four part get-together from You Tube. Instead of the full gig, we were only given highlights. It would have been nice to have a bonus disc with the full performance - Warts and all.<br /><br />I had been a solid Quo fan from Piledriver in 1972 until the Original band finished around 1982. There was only a brief mention about the original keyboards guy (I think his name was Jess Jaworski - Something like that) - It would have been great to have had an interview from him (If he is still alive) - Things like this, die-hard Quo fans need to know, because they know everything else. The thing which really annoyed me was that there was absolutely no mention (Verbally or written) of early Keyboards player Roy Lynes. He obviously featured on the early Beat Club performances (Pictures of Matchstick Men etc) and was even still part of the early Boogie period of Quo (As can be seen on their BBC performance of 'Doin their thing' in 1970). I knew personally that Roy left for New Zealand (I am a Kiwi myself) but I never knew why he left, if he was sacked etc and I dont have a clue what he did since he left. I am actually going to google his name after this review and find out for myself out of interest. Pete Kircher, who replaced John Coghlan also gets no mention (All we see of him is his meeting of Prince Charles at the Princes Trust concert in 1982). Why was there no interview with him, and again, what happened to him after this line-up of Quo last played together at Live Aid. Virtually every member of Quo gets interviewed (The frantic four plus Rhino Edwards, Jeff Rich, Andy Bown Bob Young and Matt Letley. The only two missing are Lynnes and Kircher. I find that was such a shame. It would have been nice to have credits at the end to explain the reasons that they werent interviewed. On Judas Priest's celebration of British Steel, thereis absolutely no mention or credit  of the drummer at that time (i.e. Dave Holland), most probably because he was convicted and jailed for child sex offences after he left the band. There are plenty of interviews with fans and colleagues too including Paul Weller, Chris Tarrant, Joe Elliott etc. As much as I find Joe Elliott outspoken, I found his utterances to be spot on. However, I thought that Jeff Lynne came across as overdoing the praise, especially when Quo's music was on the wane. The DVD is filled with excerpts of Quo tracks from all periods of their career with no rare performances which is a shame, because I only found out TONIGHT by watching on You Tube that Quo performed 'Is it really me' from Beat Club in 1970. I watched every Beat Club show possible, and I was only aware that Quo played ' Spinning Wheel Blues' and 'April Spring Summers and Wednesdays'. I am just wondering if there are more unearthed Beat Club performances of the Quo from this period. Look what happened to all the performances of Rory Gallagher that were unearthed only around the time of the 'Ghost Blues' DVD. The Lost Broadcasts with Yes, Iron Butterfly etc are others. Is there a Lost Broadcast of Quo? As I say, it would have been nice to have seen more rare performances of Quo on this DVD. I remember seeing Status Quo in New Zealand in 1976. As part of the hype, they had a TV show called 'Gizago' hosted by an English guy called STu Dennison. On that show, they played the promo for Mystery Song, and they also played 'Don't waste my time' and 'Paper Plane' from the Marquee from 1972. These tracks can also be seen on You Tube. However, they also screened 'Roadhouse Blues' from the Marquee. I have never seen this track since, and I dont know of anyone who has also seen this. I have also been told by a guy in Ireland that he saw a TV clip of Quo doing Bye Bye Johnny  from the same Marquee show. Where are these clips? Does Mr Rossi or Mr Parfitt know that these clips exist? Overall, this DVD is compelling viewing. It was overly long, but unusually for me in this day and age, I watched it in its entirety without touching the remote. I lost interest in Quo after 'In the Army Now' but it was the reunion of Coghlan and Lancaster that tempted me to buy the DVD. It would have been nice to have seen the original line-up live in the flesh again but this DVD is a good substitute. What next? The logical thing is for an official release of one of the reunion shows. I will be first in line to buy that one<br /><br />FOOTNOTE - I googled Roy Lynes and found out that he joined the band in 1964 and left the band in 1970  after he fell in love. He was supposed to be the quiet one. The strange thing is that Roy met up with the band when they toured New Zealand (That would have been in 1976 when I saw them, although they did play a festival with Black Sabbath a couple of years earlier) Wiki also reports that Lynes played onstage with Quo in Australia in 2000, and that he also played in Quo tribute band State Oz Quo. Rossi mentions in Wiki that Lynnes looked really happy. Why couldn't any of this be mentioned. If I was Roy Lynes, I would be really pissed off. He was in the band for 6 years and got absolutely no mention at all. I have since found out from another reviewer of this DVD that Pete Kircher had in fact refused to be interviewed. Probably due to him wanting to keep a dignified silence and avoid the sudden interest in re-recognition.
193413712X|1.0|Remember the story of The Emperor's New Clothes?  It's about a town full of people desperate to prove how smart they are, but in the process they prove themselves to be idiots.  That's what I felt like when I heard this book won the Pulitzer.  My god, what a self-indulgent string of gobbledygook.  I wanted to love this book, as I have loved many Pulitzer prize winners before - Oscar Wao and The Hours jump to mind as brilliant pieces of literature that aren't self absorbed like this nonsense.  But Tinkers wasn't even well-written.  It was as if each sentence was disconnected from the one before it - just ideas floating around a page, and we were supposed to do the work of organizing them.  It was truly a slog to get through this thing, each page more painful than the last.  You get the sense that the author is out to prove his literary credentials, but he forgets that he's supposed to be telling a story.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is a great book as all the prior books have been. Love the story but it's getting a little blury with all the additional characters that are being added not to mention that this is still not the end of the saga. Just hope we don't have to wait 5 years for the next book and that it wil tie up all the ends and finish the story of all the original characters. I had to reread the first 4 books since I coudn't remember all the story.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|This is a film that is very impressive.  I was a little lost in the battle scenes, as they seem to just drag on, but the story and film as a whole was very much worth watching.<br /><br />By the time I got to the end of the story, I had tears falling.<br /><br />Everyone who was performing in this film was outstanding and again, the battle scene kind of lost me for a moment, but once getting past that, it is worth seeing.
B00C6BA4SE|2.0|I knowticed that the run time on the steel box is 238 min. The movie itself  was under 2 hr. when it was released to the theaters for the public to view. Is this due to running time of added extras or material that was excised from the original version. The movie was exceptionaly good. The Movie I would rate at 4 Stars when released in the theaters. But with the lack of information on the Blu-ray steel box release, I can only rate it one star. So with what I have at hand I will be generious and rate this steel box at 2 stars.
B008220C38|5.0|Everyone who worked on this film was amazing.<br /><br />It literally kept me on the edge of my seat, trying to stay with the rapid changes of the entire production.<br /><br />It was just amazing to watch.<br /><br />Keira Knightly did one of her most impressive performances in this film.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I have been a Tolkien fan my whole life. I have seen this movie a couple of times and I am not sure how I feel about it. It looks beautiful, just like the Lord of the Rings movies do.

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Stephen Stills `Carry On'<br />Over the last couple of days, Ive been listening to this brand new 4 CD retrospective of Stephen Stills music. Co-produced by his friend Graham Nash, its a marvellous box set. The sound quality is fantastic, and it has a 115 page booklet with many nice images of Stills and the pantheon of great musicians and producers he worked with, as well as recollections, reflections of the significance of his music and track details. I would rank this as one of the best reissues for 2013. It will restore Stills esteemed place in the history of rock music , which in his corner has been overshadowed by the likes of Neil Young. It will also give a renewed interest in his songwriting, which includes a lot of political writing. Stills was a prominent artist in the anti-war movement of the late 1960s and retained a long standing interest in politics as a left liberal in the US Democratic Party.<br /><br />What makes Stills such a distinctive musician and songwriter? For a start, coming from Tampa, Florida and the eclectic mix of Jazz, Latin and Roots music in that region might give you some idea. Then listen to an intensely personal classic like 4+20 (In CSNYs `Deja Vu' album) to understand where he has come from. This collection gives you an idea of the incredible talent and musical range that Stills has. He is mistakenly categorised as folk or at best folk rock.. but he is much more than that. His voice and guitar playing handle Jazz, Blues and Latin with ease. This collection also brought home to me just how important and great sounding a band was Buffalo Springfield. (Why on earth does this band does not have its entire catalogue remastered and on the shelves of every decent record shop is one of the mysteries of modern capitalism). The music from the 1960s, much of it on the first disc, is still a real treat to listen to.
B00979KQ4U|5.0|Bought this unit since it was cheaper than the one available at the local hardware store.  The Installation was a per the instructions, very easy to follow.  Once the ceiling fan and attaching lights were reinstalled, tested the remote kit, everything worked.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|It isn't a literary masterpiece, but it does exactly what the zombie genre is supposed to do.  It focuses on the human reaction to unimaginable horror and disaster.  The structure in particular, personifies the individual experiences - chapter after chapter of personal stories wound into a worldwide epidemic. If that is why you pay attention to zombie stories, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The writing is outstanding.  It is solidly written.  It just isn't a five star masterpiece.<br /><br />My disappointment was small and ideological.  I found it too bad the author couldn't resist showing his adoration of centralized government as part of the cure.  With all the humanity he showed in his writing, he seemed ok with the forced \\"repatriation\\" of independently surviving areas. Sorry, but it bothered me.  Also, I'm no fan of world government. It seems to me if you are going to do the work of building a new world, you would drop some of the baggage from the presently failing world.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|What a great game. It is more than interactive and the puzzles are perfect for anyone's ability level. Worth the money, you won't regret buying this game.
0060723513|1.0|I read this book for my book club. If not for that purpose, I would have thrown it away after ten pages. Supposedly a 'true' story written as fiction (probably to gain a wider audience), the book is the spiritual awakening of a woman who goes on a walk-about with a hidden Aboriginal tribe in the Outback.<br /><br />From the first, the plot is suspicious. Marlo Morgan is 'kidnapped' and driven into the Outback in a jeep. Why she didn't protest or jump out as they headed into the brush is anyone's guess. The tribe she then travels with on foot highlight its members' different talents, and everyone appreciates their various abilities. Is this something new? No. The Apostle Paul makes a case for there being different talents in the body of early church members. So Morgan's 'aha' awareness is not unique.<br /><br />And when the tribe eats, their one meal is at the end of the day. Does this make sense, given that they wake up to a long trek across inhospitable land? There's a reason we 'break the fast' to start the day. Eating before they retire at night is totally counterintuitive.<br /><br />The aborigines share with her pieces of wisdom from their belief system, and the only things she can share back about<br />American culture are how to make gravy and information about cake frosting? Really? Please.<br /><br />I was surprised when I noted that the book had originally been published in 1991. I'd expected it to come out of the woo-woo new age spiritualizing of the 1970's. (I heard 'Age of Aquarius' in my mind as I was reading.) Naturally, now we can appreciate alternative spiritualities for world-views that contain deep wisdom. But those philosophies are not in this book. Instead are platitudes about appreciating each other's gifts, mental telepathy, and such a deep concern for the world that the tribe has decided not to continue into the next generation.Hello? How do you care so much that you leave the world instead of trying to make it better?<br /><br />And that's just the content. Shall I now complain about the writing? Writers usually try to construct paragraphs so that the sentences within one unit are related to a single topic. Nope, not here. Morgan wanders all over the proverbial map (shouldI say Outback?) in her writing style. After being picked up by a major publisher, she really should have had an editor that could have helped her clean up her writing style. Too many sentences start with 'I' to make this anything other than an egocentric expression of one person's less-than-profound assertions.<br /><br />To those who are searching for books that offer deep spiritual guidance and hopeful counsel to a more positive, more fulfilling and trusting belief, search elsewhere. This book isn't it.ust the content. Shall I now complain about the writing? Writers usually try to construct paragraphs so that the sentences within one unit are related to a single topic.

B00B2YH7D6|5.0|From Sound City itself to every band that ever played there, the mixing console, the pictures and videos, the history of recording, the future of music: this is pure gold!<br />Dave Grohl, Krist Novocelic, Corey Taylor, Paul McCartney, Trent Reznor, Stevie Nicks, Joshua Homme, Rick Springfield, etc., etc., etc... These names should be enough for everyone to understand what this is about: The love, the passion, the dedication for music.<br />This documentary places Dave Grohl as the unofficial embassador of rock and he is one true deserving artist who saved a console and wanted to let everybody know what it meant for him and why it should mean the same for music history.<br />A MUST buy for music lovers!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I originally wanted to see the movie but realized I've always loved the books more so I started this one and fell in love I've been out of school for a few years now but this book is the perfect description of what it's like to grow up and the emotions and the fear and excitement. I would highly recommend to any one at any point in your life it's really an amazing book.

B006R1T40I|1.0|This is a review of the CD release. I was a big Bonnie Raitt fan decades ago so I derive no pleasure from this review. But I can't find one song on this CD to grab hold of. All the songs sound very \\"formula\\" and Bonnie's voice sounds tired and strained. I get the feeling she is just going through the motions but not showing any emotion. There is nothing on this CD to come close to \\"Louise\\", \\"(Goin')Wild For You Baby\\", or \\"Angel From Montgomery\\".
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has taken what Robert Jordan started so many years ago and finished it masterfully while preserving Jordan's style and character. A decade and a half after I first started reading the Wheel of Time series, I find it was worth the wait to see Jordan's epic saga brought to a close by Mr. Sanderson. Well done.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From cover to cover I loved this book. The suspense, the constant guessing, the romance, just kept me on my toes. There were just sometimes I needed a \\"chapter break\\" (lol book insider) but I just couldn't put it down. This book automatically goes in to my top 5 favorite books of all time, hands down.<br /><br />Although I loved the book, in the beginning I thought it was going to be your typical goody two shoes teenager falling for the bad boy with the good heart and a bad rep, but boy was I wrong. I couldn't figure out of the life of me what what gonna happen next and I couldn't stop turning the page. Page after page was just something interesting to read. The back and forth between the past and the present (which I've seen before but never cared much for it) just meshed beautifully. It kept you wanting a little more insight to past but also left you with the urge to go back to the present to see what's going to happen next.<br /><br />Not to mention it was written beautifully. I have a few more words added to my dictionary. I really wish I hadn't read it so that I could read it over and be enthralled all over again. This certainly will not be my last time reading this book or reading from this author. I am sincerely in love.<br /><br />Signed x: A Sucker for Romance Books

0062059963|5.0|The romance, competition between the remaining Elite, and danger from rebel attacks ALL INTENSIFY in The Elite. This is no bridge book between the beginning and end of a trilogy.<br /><br />Maxon and Aspen both make excellent cases for themselves in America's heart while some of the other girls start to mean something to Maxon. It feels like at ANY minute, just one person could make a rash decision and it would all be over. In a lot of YA books with two love interests, you know from the very start who the main character will end up and the other guy is just a distraction to add tension along the way. THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE. It wasn't in The Selection, and I know it will continue into the third book because while the love story is the main focus, it's not all that's at stake.<br /><br />I refuse to spoil anyone by saying anything else. Read it!<br /><br />And once you're done, it's going to be a long year until Book 3.

I am drawn to this book and the story. For me, it was not just a story about running but a challenge to the modern world view. There are elements of this book that have challenged me and I hope (and pray) that it will help me to become a better Christian, husband, father and most of all, a healthier and better runner.
1452115567|5.0|This book is about more than just little Miss Maddie standing on things (even though she is adorably cute, patient and skillful when it comes to balancing).  It captures the journey, through pictures, of one man, Theron Humphrey, and his best friend, Maddie the coonhound and their journey across the United States. The photographs included in this book are sure to put a smile on your face and make you feel enthused. Theron is an awesome photographer and an inspiring individual. If you are in need of some inspiration and you love dogs to boot, this book is definitely for you!!<br /><br />Also, you are going to want a hard copy of this book, for your book shelf or coffee table, so you should probably skip the kindle edition option. Just saying.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger games one word WOW! Now I'm going to be honest here, I'm not a big fan of reading especially long books. Even though this book wasn't so long the way the book is written it keeps you enticed after just three pages into the book you can start to in vision all the characteristics of the surrounding environment in which Katiness lives in. The attention to detail in depicting all of the different types of characteristics is astonishing.  No matter what the situations it is really a mind trip. From the detail of her surrounding, to her hunting, to her at the games, or her at the arena you can in vision every part of the story as it is told.<br />After I read The Hunger games I was really excited to see the movie... but when I actually got around to viewing the movie I was sadly disappointed at the results. The movie got some of the major aspects of the book but the book has more details than the movie. This book has been one of my favorite books so far even though I don't read a lot. One this you can be sure of from this book is that you will find yourself in a completely different surrounding than you actually are in. I would also recommend to go to a park or somewhere quiet where you can really be able to visualize in greater detail the book. This was a great book that till now I have read three times really recommend it.

0300108834|3.0|I gave it three stars only because that was the best I could do without reading it first.  A friend recommended this book for my grandchildren.  I hope it will be as good as she said but I was surprised that it had few illustrations.  It is for at least a 6th grader.  I will hold it a few years until they are old enough to read and appreciate it.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|To be honest in the first few chapters I was thinking what is the big deal? However, as each breath taking layer was revealed I had to lay it down and start again! Colleen Hoover has woven a land slide  story that is artfully crafted. It was one of those...I didn't see that coming.....kind of books. I was blown away up to the very last page. Great Book! I will not allow myself to give away any details to prevent spoiling this for others.

B0068FYZIO|5.0|This is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection of Holocaust movies.  I appreciated seeing how one man (a German Nazi) was able to feel the plight of the Jews and see that they, too, are human beings.  For anyone wanting to see how badly Jews were treated during this period of history, this movie is a must.
0545123275|2.0|I've been looking forward to reading this book for a while, because I've heard nothing but good things about it. I have to say that I was mildly disappointed. The main characters, Sam and Grace, tell the story through alternating points of view. A definite plus, because the reader gets a look at the werewolf life versus the human life. But they don't seem very fully developed, and there were some parts of the story where I sat back and asked myself how that could have possibly happened. I seriously think I missed a few pages...Or chapters...<br /><br />The ending really saved it for me. The last forty pages or so were action packed and kept me interested, unlike the beginning.<br /><br />Throughout the novel Grace mentions her friends Rachel and Olivia. These seem like the only two friends she has, and when Sam comes along, she drops them to cling to him 24/7. Not very loyal. Rachel and Olivia only pop up when convenient for the plot, casually vanishing into the background at all other times.<br /><br />I won't be continuing this series.<br /><br />`Shiver' gets 2/5 stars from me.

B005S9ELY4|4.0|Let's get something straight here: GANGSTER SQUAD is based on a true story...very loosely based.  It's an intriguing story, one worth checking out (Paul Liberman's source book is a must-read for fans of real life noir): Jewish gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a former boxer, has made a name for himself in 1930s Los Angeles.  He's brutal (that opening scene is a killer, followed shortly by another) and remorseless, and he wants nothing less than the possession of L.A.'s corrupt soul.<br /><br />Enter the Gangster Squad.  Generaled by a grizzled Chief Parker (Nick Nolte), and captained by a tough-as-nails moralist (Josh Brolin), featuring a cowboy (Robert Patrick), a rookie (Michael Pena) a genius (Giovanni Ribisi), a hustler (Anthony Mackie, because everyone knows 1939 L.A. was racially integrated), and a bad boy with a heart of gold (Ryan Gosling), who happens to be falling for Cohen's latest dame (Emma Stone).<br /><br />Sound familiar?  Well, it is.  It's a by-the-numbers production, featuring over-the-top dialogue and action sequences, a whole lot of coincidence, two-dimensional characters (for example: in reality, Chief Parker was hardly the crusading white knight he's portrayed as here), and violence for the sake of violence.  Think THE UNTOUCHABLES, but without Kevin Costner's off-putting likability.  In the leading role, Brolin is merely cruising, but he knows what to do and does it right.  Penn makes a deliciously hatable villain; his dialogue is atrocious (perhaps intentionally), but Penn digs in deep and growls out every syllable, coming off as truly menacing, in a B-movie sort of way.  The rest of the supporting cast balances their roles well; Stone, like most women in gangster films, has little to do, and there is surprisingly little chemistry between her and Gosling (who is sleepwalking even more so than Brolin).  The acting is, basically, on the level one would expect it to be, given the fact that its stellar cast is basically slumming it up.  However,  GANGSTER SQUAD looks good; it's a gorgeous production that embraces its noir roots and runs with it.  This may seem like shallow praise, but it isn't; if you lower your expectations to a realistic B-movie level, GANGSTER SQUAD is one of the more enjoyable gangster films of recent years.  It's not a classic, but it never tries to be; it's entertaining, plain and simple.  And damn, 1930s Los Angeles never looked so sexy.r,  GANGSTER SQUAD looks good; it's a gorgeous production that embraces its noir roots and runs with it.

B000002VCZ|5.0|Thanks to my purchases of &#34;The Definitive Collection&#34; and the 3-disc version of &#34;The Essential Alan Parsons Project&#34;, I already have most of the tracks on this album. The only ones I was missing were the original mix of &#34;Separate Lives&#34;, &#34;Somebody Out There&#34;, and &#34;The Same Old Sun&#34;. All these songs are good.<br /><br />&#34;Let's Talk About Me&#34; - Really gets the message of the album clear. This song is about how everyone wants to focus on the bottom line, themselves.<br /><br />&#34;Separate Lives&#34; - I got a sitcom type vibe from this, but a bit less so than the Alternate Mix on The Essential APP. It's still a good song.<br /><br />&#34;Days Are Numbered (The Traveller)&#34; - A very dreamy, very sax-driven ballad. Chris Rainbow provides his part very well.<br /><br />&#34;Sooner Or Later&#34; - Great track, Eric Woolfson does it again. Some have said a lot of these later songs represent a falling out between Woolfson and Parsons. I think I can sense that frustration in the lyrics.<br /><br />&#34;Vulture Culture&#34; - Great song about the bottom line. I'm imagining some of those vultures from Disney's &#34;The Jungle Book&#34; dancing to this song.<br /><br />&#34;Hawkeye&#34; - Great instrumental.<br /><br />&#34;Somebody Out There&#34; - I heard that this song was about your own reflection or what other people perceive of you.<br /><br />&#34;The Same Old Sun&#34; - A great way to end the album. This would've made a great song for a movie, maybe even &#34;An American Tail&#34;.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I am still watching it on Amazon. I have already seen the first 1. It is even better. Definitely a Horror Story. It like a scary camp fire story come to life. You know those are always scary and creepy. If you like these kinds of stories, this is for you!
B000002VE7|5.0|I bought the 1990 audio CD and it works great in my computer and my car. The only song I wanted to get from the expanded version was &#34;Rumour Goin' Round&#34;,  and I'm still waiting for &#34;The APP That Never Was&#34; to come out on Amazon MP3. Otherwise, the album is great. I'm planning on using some of the tracks for a piece of fanfiction. Some of my favorites include &#34;Where's the Walrus&#34;, one of the most powerful instrumentals Parsons and Woolfson have ever written. I like 7 of the 9 tracks listed on this CD (the two I don't like are &#34;Urbania&#34; and &#34;Chinese Whispers&#34;).

B0042EJD8A|1.0|Josh is entertainment with a message that is a manipulations of facts that create a concern about the risk of bad water coming out of the ground that you might drink.  That's it in a nut shell!<br />Truth is, most modern wells are well constructed and maintained and do not pollute subsurface waters.  This includes water wells, oil wells and gas wells.  Josh only concentrated on old abandoned wells and poorly maintained wells which is not a modern story.  Also he scares the ignorant about chemical.. Remember Prop 65 in CA, the safe drinking water proposition, that only warned people about the chemical problems but did nothing to solve a non existent problem.<br />I find his style of journalism entertaining and fluffy and wonder how people take him serious.  (I understand HBO support as they are part of the entertainment industry).<br />I have not seen so much concern about nothing, since Dan Brown in the \\"DE Vinci Code\\" made statements about a religious figure that were all conjecture by twisting a bunch of facts to make a good read.<br />Enjoy Gasland and Pink Sky for what they are \\"entertainment\\" and save your money to buy more expensive oil and gas if these movies are consider at all more than entertainment...!!!!

B00991TCOG|5.0|Normally I'm not one to be swayed into buying a CD.  Not when you can buy digital copies or y'know... *not buy* digital copies.  However this was so good I just had to have the CD as well.  It's violin in a very modern way.  I have had both children and adults listen to this CD and they have both enjoyed it.  There isn't singing (save for a few words on the last track) just awesome. You can really hear the creativity.  Instead of the normal usage of dubstep that takes over music there are some traces of in here, but it's used to emphasize her violin.  It doesn't over whelm the music and it's barely discernible.  It's a very unique approach. None of that overbearing Skrillex crap.  Let's just say that I wouldn't be taking the time to write such a flattering review if I truly didn't find this to be excellent and enjoyable.  I don't foresee anyone regretting this purchase (of the CD, not necessarily a purchase via Amazon. Just the CD).
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This DVD along with the tribute DVD \\"I'm Your Man\\" caused me to buy the Complete Studio Albums Box Set of the first 11 studio albums, his newest CD, 4 documentaries, and a live DVD/CD!  I like that the insert provides which album the songs are from (thus the purchase of the Box Set, as he covers songs from nearly every studio album on this DVD.)  I had the \\"Best of\\" and \\"More Best of\\" CD's, but now I want to hear everything.  I actually prefer his voice and performance at 73 than when he first started, for instance the performance of Bird on the Wire and Suzanne on this DVD are both better than on the original albums, due to the great band, back-up singers and Leonard's voice has gotten better.  I find a lot of concert videos get a little boring, but this one held my interest to the end, probably due to the complex and thoughtful lyrics by Leonard and the great performance by all involved.  I very much liked that he gave attribution to everyone in the band (twice) by the end of the concert, including his writing collaborator, Sharon Robinson.  This DVD definitely made me want to delve deeper into the works of Leonard Cohen.
B004XWMXW4|3.0|After listening to Lindsey Stirling I wanted something different yet still kind of similar.  I purchased this CD and it's only okay. You could easily go with out it and not feel like you're missing anything.  There are 2 tracks I liked and that was it.  I've played in my car for one week only and then never again.  My Lindsey Stirling CD however has been in my car for months playing and I'm still really enjoying it.  That should tell you something.

B009NH6JRE|4.0|This series is great and there's no doubt a few episodes in this season are among the best in the series.  But forgive me for saying this, S3's writing, directing, and acting all take a hit.  With it's original show-runner's departure, Season 3 suffers from poor acting in the first few episodes, a terrible pregnant stomach, and the good guys not being all that likeable.  The show's main villain, The Governor (played brilliantly by David Morrissey) comes out more likeable and realistic than any of the characters you are used to seeing from previous seasons.  Andrew Lincoln, however, is superb once again as Rick Grimes, the show's protagonist, and should probably win an Emmy, or at least be up for the award.  He's simply spellbinding as a man transformed from the conscientious leader to a ruthless protector, twisted from various traumas.  You see up close and personal what a zombie-apocalypse does to the human soul with Rick and The Governor going head to head, trying to hang on to humanity while surviving and protecting those they care about at the same time. Morrissey, if possible, is just as good, or better than Lincoln as The Governor.  But once again, the show suffers from acting in the beginning, and gets better as the season goes on.  There are a few times where the \\"good guys\\" are simply idiotic and you want them to get what's coming to them.  As you learn, it's not necessarily about good and evil, as it is about lengths one will go to live.  This season isn't as much about deaths and zombies (although there's plenty), as it is about human transformation and mental stability.<br /><br />Best Episodes: 03 \\"Walk with Me\\", 08 - \\"Made to Suffer\\", 13 - \\"Arrow on the Doorpost\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last few episodes are good, but not great, which is why this season isn't as good as the previous two, but still better than mostly anything else on television.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really enjoyed the first version and the second is even better.  Wow on the Kindle HD.  Can almost keep up with the kid's high score.
B004I744AS|5.0|Very good dictionary app. Word games are great. Especially hangman. Just like when you were a kid!! Can't go wrong with this one.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Wish the picture was clearer.  The lack of quality really shows up on the Kindle HD, but it's free and the kids enjoy it.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|This was very basic, just the two movies in one blu-ray case.  No DVD version, no special features disc, no digital download.  BUT it IS two Blu-rays of the films for $15.  I would gladly pay the lesser amount every time for just the film.  I don't need the fluff.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Not only is this book well-written, tense and exciting in just the right moments, the pictures and notes also add to the adventure. It was fun to watch the story unfold itself in and around the peculiar photographs. I love the way the story starts with an everyday kid and slowly weaves itself into a highly readable fantasy / horror novel. To watch the idea grow and move along is a treat.<br /><br />A slight word of warning: if you have a young advanced reader who reads books for this age group, you might want to read this book before she does to determine whether or not the young adult themes (a tiny bit of sexuality / language pertaining to sexuality) and adult language (swearing) is appropriate for your level of comfort. If you have a teenager, however, he or she is probably already familiar with the words and ideas that may be too adult for a younger reader.<br /><br />I borrowed this title from my state's digital library but loved it so much that I am going to purchase it to keep. The ending of this book leaves itself open for additional storytelling, and it looks like the sequel is due out in January 2014. Can't wait!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game I seriously feel like I'm making my own jurassic park!! don't like the slow pace though. but other than that it great
1452115567|5.0|I must credit my daughter for showing me \\"thiswildidea\\" on Instagram!!  She caused me to become an addict!!  To take a step outside of your everyday, familiar life such as Theron has done is a great leap of faith. He shares with us a humble and simplistic perspective on life by bring us all on his journey.  Opening up about himself and what events in his life propelled him to take a chance on what would make him happy in life and to have a best friend like Maddie by his side.  The roads traveled and moments shared in his book, \\"Maddie On Things\\", shows us how diverse and caring people can be. Maddie's trust, skill, endurance and desire to please Theron shows in each photo.  By Theron making the world aware of the need to adopt homeless animals and those individuals who have chosen to make a loving pet part of their lives no matter the circumstances should be an eye opener to anybody that takes the time to enjoy this great book.<br />I thank you, Theron, for being selfless in your journey, visiting a local bookstore and giving us the chance to meet you and Maddie was a delight!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All in all, this series was really enjoyable. I started the first book, then put it down, as I had just seen the movie, and there was little if any difference. After several months, I picked it back up, and by the end of book 1, I was hungry for more. The two following novels, were entertaining, as well as enlightening, a study in why and how revolutions occur. The final novel ended in an appropriate manner, not a feel good ending, but a very realistic ending. I recommend the whole series.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Too many phonies have reviewed this film. The review at the front comes to mind. It's a good movie and nobody needs to hear about whether your butt buddy liked 'Scooby Doo' or not.

B003VANOFY|5.0|They rock. Great range of sounds. The range on the signal is pretty good. I can go the thirty or forty feet to my bedroom and still be listening to my computer. The only complaint I could register would be that they loose signal pretty often. However that is due only to the fact that my system of computers is right by my desk-top tower and the signals get crossed with my wi-fi. I changed channels like I read after looking up the issue. But that is only because how I have things set up and not a fault of these head-phones.<br />Thanks Logitech!

B0048EANOM|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies and the movie itself is absolutely worth 5 stars.  The digital transfer seems pretty good.  In the early part of the film the colors are muted and the images don't seem to be as sharp as they should be, for a Blu-ray presentation.  However, by listening to the commentary, I found out decisions regarding the visual images were intentional.  I suppose because the time of the assassination was chaotic and confusing period, the decision was made for the visual aspect of the film to reflect that confusion.  As the film progresses, the visual changes, and becomes clearer along with the story.<br />This release has a few special features, at least some of them were also included on previous releases.  The first extra is a full length audio commentary by Oliver Stone (205 minutes).  Next is the documentary Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.  Then there are several deleted/extended scenes, including an alternative ending.  Multi-media essays are included.  Finally the theatrical trailer.  The movie is great, the extra features are fine, but the reason I gave this Blu-ray disc only 4 stars is the special features portion of the pop-up menu.  I HATE IT.  All of the special features are in white type with a red background, so as I arrow up or down, the whiteness turns ever so slightly brighter.  The problem is that I can not see the change in the whiteness.  I have to assume the 'highlighted' area is the top item, then count down as I hit the arrow button and hope I've selected what I want.  The problem is that I am often wrong.  It's very frustrating.  Perhaps, younger people have no problems with this type of design, but as someone with some age related visual deficits, I have great difficultly with it.  Thus only 4 stars.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Its your basic matching game. I thought it would be like a rubix cube, but this better. Its not terribly complicated and it kills time like no body's business.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|THE GAMES IS VERY ADDICTIVE I HAD IT ON MY LAST PHONE IT BROKE SO I BOUGHT THIS GAME AGAIN WELL WORTH THE MONEY THANKS!!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like any other game of solitaire. Not much else to report. I have the free version and the ads only pop up at the start of a new deal. They dont bother me much except for the video ads. They are long and you can't skip them until half way through the ad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son and I both like to play this game. It is entertaining and keeps our attention. Great for all ages!
B0083O0ZHS|5.0|“The Visitors” was Abba’s eighth and ultimately final studio album. For the loyal Abba fans, this album was quite a shocker. Best way to describe it, “The Visitors” is not your usual ABBA album. The group at this point consisted of two formerly married couples who were now both divorced so the sessions for “The Visitors” could not have been easy. The songs on “The Visitors” are no longer simple and light pop fair but instead the themes of break ups, loneliness, moving on and even the Cold War in Europe are all very present on this beautifully written and beautifully sung album. The over all feel of the album is far darker then the previous year’s “Super Trouper” but far more satisfying in the end. With each listen this album gets better and better. Just listen to the paranoia infused opening title track which deals with the communist oppression. Frida uses her voice as an instrument to convey fear and panic unlike on any previous ABBA song. “Soldiers” is another politically motivated track that sounds like a paranoid tango. The subject of facing the aftermath of a failed relationship where no one is to blame is beautifully handled on the stunning and deeply personal “When All Is Said And Done”, an international hit stunningly sung by Frida. Further displaying her versatility as a vocalist, Frida also does an amazing job on the simple and haunting “Like An Angel Passing Through My Room” and on the powerful “I Let The Music Speak”. Continuing with their new found maturity, ABBA moves further in the serious path with Agnetha doing a beautiful and heartbreaking lead on “One Of Us” and on “Slipping Through My Fingers”. The only trace of the ABBA of the 70’s is evident on the Agnetha sang “Head Over Heels”, a solid dance track that should have been a world wide smash, and on the Bjorn sung “Two For The Price Of One”, which would have to be the most strange song ever recorded by ABBA.<br /><br />This is a great treat for CD/ABBA collectors. This re-master contains the original mysterious album artwork, both front and back, along with beautiful alternate cover shots for the singles inside the booklet. The booklet also has fascinating liner notes and brand new commentary with both Bjorn and Benny. The packaging itself is also great as is the sound. However, the best part of this re-master is the addition of SEVEN Bonus tracks that are included here, including the never before heard “From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel”, demonstrating how the song progressed from one take to another. “Should I Laugh Or Cry”, originally recorded during the “Visitors” sessions but not included on the album release, is a gem. Featuring another great vocal lead by Frida, it was previously only available as a B-Side to “One Of Us”. “I Am The City” and “You Owe Me One” are two never released songs that were recorded after “The Visitors” as tracks for ABBA’s next studio album which never materialized. The songs were relegated to the vaults for years but are now available here as bonus tracks. “Under Attack” was one of the last few ABBA songs recorded and shows the group entering the early 80’s electronica craze with style. “Cassandra”, with shades of “Chiquitita” echoing through it, is another beautiful song. But the real masterpiece has to be “The Day Before You Came”, masterfully sung by Agnetha. What a way for ABBA, the biggest selling band in the world in the 70’s, to end their chapter as an active group. Having all these bonus tracks on one cd, makes this Deluxe version of “The Visitors” a must have. And the bonus DVD makes this a Deluxe indeed. So much material that is a delight for ABBA fans. The promotional clip for “When All Is Said And Done” is a treat, and ABBA singing “Two For The Price Of One” and “Slipping Through My Fingers” on the Dick Cavett show is another rare find. Highly recommended for every one, not just ABBA fans.ans.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I'm hooked. My husband keeps trying to beat my score... but he can't!!!! Addictive game. I kill my battery lol
B009X01FJS|5.0|I was looking for a case that would offer some protection for my Kindle Fire and also had a stand on it.  This worked out perfect, I can use it in landscape mode for videos and portrait mode for recipes.  Repeating a tip others gave: when you snap it in, make sure you have the charger port on the correct side if you don't want to have to take it out of the case to charge it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had such a strong following I thought it couldn't miss. But it did. For me, the start was weak and the ending was weak. I liked the middle, but a good book needs more than just a good middle.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very addicting game find myself waiting for my life to refill. Would recommend this game to anyone. Even my children love to play it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice big keys and easy to use.  Perfect for quick calculations.  Would recommend for anyone needing basic math and calculation functions.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|this would be a great game if you didn't have to spend hundreds of thousands of coins to evolve 1 dinosaur. I guess I will have to spend hundreds of my own hard earned money to enjoy this game...or NOT. Beware this game can be very frustrating
B000002LOE|2.0|I thought I was purchasing the audio file only for $7.38 then a few days later the actual CD came in the mail. Why would I purchase the audio file and the CD? Makes no sense. Then the S/H is way more than the item price. I am none too pleased about this seller's listing. I would have never bought this had I know I would have to pay an outrageous S/H fee for a CD that I DO NOT WANT!! So annoying.
B0055SWM08|1.0|YOU CANT BUY HINTS!!!! I will change it once you fix it!<br /><br />One two three four five six seven eight
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Kevin Bacon is outstanding as a the retired, traumatized FBI agent desperately trying to stop the very charming but brutal serial killer.  The serial killer is no less terrifying because he is behind bars, but is ultimately more terrifying because he is in jail.  A must see for crime aficionados and people who like heart stopping suspense.
B002L6I9Z4|4.0|First thing the new 5 year old did is try to take it apart...it's LEGO so what else would he do?  But he was taking pictures at his birthday party within a minute or two.  That said, it's simple, outside and inside as well.  Before you know it, he had it hooked up to charge.  I assume it's as easy to download to the computer.  The party over,  PopPop and Memaw were headed home for some rest.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It's mind blowing to see how each &#34;small&#34; action can affect another person so much.  My ex-husband committed suicide last October and I found that we were all struggling with the one question, &#34;Why?&#34; This book shows that it's never one thing, just many that snowball until the person feels they have no other choice.  My heart ached for Hannah and Clay, and I disliked the other characters for their contribution to Hannah's demise.  This is truly a book everyone should read.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I loved this book. Very inspiring the only thing is it took Me forever to read but we'll done Louisa May Alcott!
1603420398|5.0|This book has lots of different designs that should please anybody.  Many shaped to choose from.  Would recommend it to anyone.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The acting was incredible. Only at the end do you realize the significance of the story....makes you honor the strangeness of LIFE.
0425263916|5.0|It was realistic...and exciting..sexy and believable...I'd read it again and again..I can not wait for the nest book with Gideon and Eva..two flawed characters that you grow to love

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Bought this for my husband and now I'm hooked-absolutel love the episodes-it's wonderful to be able to watch them in sequence.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The DVD seems to be endless-I love the episodes having missed them when they aired on TV.  Bought the DVD as a present for my husband and now I'm hooked as well!
1452115567|5.0|I love Maddie on Things. I followed their journey online through the various social media, but there is nothing like having a a tangible item to look through. I was under the impression this whole time that the photos were taken with a DSLR, not an iPhone, and was pleasantly surprised to see I was wrong. The book makes me smile, and a bit jealous. I would love to go on a journey like Theron's with a wonderful friend with me.
B008P9M614|5.0|Dr. House is a &#34;household&#34; name in my circle of friends.  He, and all his exceptional support staff, are such a fun and engrossing group that we always have something to chat about.  We even bought this DVD series to watch once a week (again) and chat about it throughout the week before watching the next one.  If you watch this from the start, you will be addicted.  That I'm sure of.
B006PFSVYQ|5.0|This isn't just a sweet and fun movie about a bunny, but about a child wanting to stretch his wings and explore the possibilities in life, even though his father expects something else.  LOVE it.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Bought this for my daughter - we loved this years ago when she was younger and now my granddaughter loves it also.  Michael's legacy lives on.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|My granddaughter just downloaded this for me and I have already used it a couple of times.  I plan to use it in my jail ministry as well as other times when I need to find some help.  Thank you for offering this.
0071771263|3.0|CD shouldn't be for audio files only. It should contains the 5 tests to be as real Toefl practice. Otherwise, it's okay.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old nephew for his birthday because he wore out the one I gave him last year. It was received promptly as promised and in great condition. Love, love the Lion King and the price was AWESOME!!!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Watched this movie on Amazon streaming. It is a great movie. Not much action, but still had me riveted.<br /><br />Denzel does an excellent portrayal of a pilot in denial. Movie has a powerful, believable message that leaves a lasting impression.<br />One of the best movies I have seen in the last year.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game gives so many boosts and is so hard but to me that means fun also there are so many people.
B003XREL98|5.0|Very immersive setting and characters, great showing of character, setting, and action rather then telling. I feel like I understand a little more about India, her people, and her relationship with Britian in the early 20th from this work.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|One of the best I've ever played. There are a few flaws, but over all great game. I want to play for hours.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This is a long-running show, with around 100 episodes over four seasons so far.  It has some good, strong characters, and some very good acting.  There's a lot of Chicago politics, and a lot of intra-law-firm politics and maneuvering.  These politics, plus the family dynamics of Alicia (Juliana Margulies) and her disgraced ex-State's Attorney husband Peter (Chris Noth) and their teen-age kids, provide the ongoing story thread.  There are some interesting and off-beat supporting characters, as well, who are central to these plot(s).  Each week, there's a new legal/courtroom drama.  These provide the backdrop and some interesting one-shot story lines, but (with a few exceptions) there's little continuity in the courtroom.  My wife and I have sometimes compared the complex politics, double-crossing, backstabbing, etc., to that in the Game of Thrones.  There's not a lot of deep intellectual content here, but it is a captivating continuing story.  We often stay up late watching multiple episodes because we have to see how a particular scheme plays out.  If this sounds at all appealing to you, sign up for it.  You'll like it.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Great songs, meaningful lyrics, and wonderful tunes.  A good album of pure Box Scaggs that is thoughtful and measured. Enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm all caught up watching the entire series and love, love, love it. Costumes and dialog are delicious. Can't wait for season four.
B001232S9A|5.0|Great album, great price! I was also able to download it very quickly with no problems whatsoever. Sounds great too.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Item was just as described and works perfectly for the kindle. Rather than pay outrageous prices somewhere else, just get it here
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|That is what happened to me with Rashomon, where women seem to have no rights and men are always fighting. The actors act like savages, lacking the human values that are found in our culture. But as I got further into the movie I realized that there is much that we can learn from other cultures. A recent documentary told the story of our female soldiers who were  routinely being raped by male soldiers in a war zone and the top brass routinely covered it up. How would the Japanese react to this news? Even more important, how does the US population react to this story or to the fact that many US states are passing legislation to make it impossible for women to have an abortion or to use contraceptives?
B004W2UBYW|1.0|What a boring read..I would not recommend this book to anybody. It is alot more fun listening to the screeching of fingernails on the chalkboard.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Never read the books but watched with someone who did.  I was happy with the movie and she said it was very true to the books.  Double win in my book.
6304500831|5.0|Great movie at a great price. I would highly recommend that you purchase it here online if you are looking for one
B008Y73940|4.0|The premise is interesting...A lawyer who uses his car as his office...The interwoven plot works well, interesting characters come and go...McConaughey is well cast in the lead roll...The movie moves along with few 'dead' spots...Worth a look.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This is one of the absolute funniest movies you will ever rent. I highly recommend it. It is basically the story of anybody who has been married for any length of time.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|In less than a decade, technology, in the form of e-readers, has changed the way most of us read books.  Perhaps most striking is the manner in which this technology allows busy people to have access to multiple volumes all the time—without needing biceps of steel to carry the encyclopedic weight.<br /><br />Indeed, while most e-readers weigh in at only a couple of ounces, the typical reader can have 200 books in its memory.  This allows you to carry not just a single book, but also a bookshelf worth of reading material in your carry-on luggage.<br /><br />Technology has also had an impact on the way authors are writing books.  Where there once was an established way to publish via agent and publisher, now the Internet has made it possible for almost anyone to publish.  Online book publishers such as Lulu.com, Instantpublisher.com and Createspace.com publish thousands of books a year online.<br /><br />Among the positives to this technology is certainly the sharing of information as well as providing a means for a writer to sell books.  Some books are even given away as a means to gain involvement in blogs or other information sharing.  The free book may also be to provide introduction to other books or products.<br /><br />Always Know What to Say:  Easy Ways to Approach and Talk to Anyone by Peter Murphy provides a ready example.  It can be downloaded for free to Kindle readers.  There is no hard or soft copy version available.<br /><br />According to the author this book “is for anyone who wants a straight to the point explanation of conversation skills fundamentals.” After reading the book and applying the principles, he suggests, “you’ll have much more fun talking to people.”<br /><br /> &#34;I point out key distinctions you can apply right away to go from being tongue tied and unsure of what to say to having fun meeting people and getting to know them better. If you read AND apply what I cover in the book you`ll make steady progress and become muchmore at ease talking to people.&#34;<br /><br />This book is not for you if you already have very good conversation skills and are comfortable meeting new people and letting your personality shine. You need to go elsewhere if you are looking for &#34;secrets&#34; and advanced strategies to achieve conversation skills mastery. You`ll regard this book as common sense.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read the entire Reacher series and find them all to be great reads. This one ws no exception...Hope there will be more of them
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What I liked about this novel was that it was a fresh story, with great character development.  I felt connected to Victoria and found the &#34;language of flowers&#34; theme interesting. I didn't feel that the story was predictable and thoroughly enjoyed the journey  as Victoria finds herself.
B00BGV0YD0|5.0|Morrison Hotel as well as the rest of The Doors catalog of music is timeless! Just listen - the words and music speak for themselves!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The children play this every chance they get. My 3 yr old loves it and engages in its fast paced action.
B000002HNR|5.0|The Doors concerts were always different, never predictable. There will never be a group like them, and when Jim was created the mold was definitely broken! You will not be disappointed with this cd - magic at work.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging to say he least! I highly recommend this to anyone., try it and you won't stop fixing the leaks.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've already read the book and loved it.  I think The movie represented very well overall about the main characters' emotions.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app, its a great entertainer on long car rides and evident on short rides or days when boredom sets in- fast. Awesome games, great way to spend downtime. Especially reccomend it for kids.
0316019984|5.0|This was a surprise birthday gift for my son, who as a little boy enjoyed all of the DC Super Heroes.

B007LB1O3I|2.0|Well I broke down and bought the album - amazon.com had it for a decent price, and I figured even my least favorite Madonna albums gave me at least that much enjoyment.<br /><br />It's not very good, really. And I am very disappointed. I wasn't keen on Hard Candy (which, just like this album, has a lame double entendre for a title), but I still love the Moroderisms of Confessions on a Dance Floor to this day, so I'll still give any Madonna album a listen. I suppose MDMA just about stays moderately entertaining all the way through, but none of the songs are very memorable, at least not for the right reasons. Forget any alleged 'ageism' on the part of radio stations - if none of the songs here became hits, it's because she simply didn't come up with any hooks that demand to be played on the radio. Something like \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" or \\"Give Me All Your Love\\" are frantic, but they don't have any grace and they don't compel anyone to dance. Oh, and the titles are tired phrases that we've all heard before, numerous times - and I am surprised that a icon of poweful womanhood named the lead-off song after a DVD series where drunk college girls take their tops off. I also wish she wouldn't drop her own name so often (like rappers often do), since we know whose album we're listening to already.<br /><br />Oh, and the lyrics are terrible - they sound like one of her children wrote them (when they were five). References to Abe Lincoln as one of her \\"Superstars\\" drop with a clang, and didn't anyone tell her \\"buzzing around/like a moth to a flame\\" is a mixed metaphor that draws attention to how stupid it is? A lot of the rhymes just seem tossed-off, like they were the first thing that came to her mind and she couldn't be bother to re-write them (or pay someone to come up with something better). Those weak lyrics just make the whole thing sound so half-finished. It's one thing to hear a woman in her fifties repeatedly call herself \\"girl\\", then quote one of original rivals, Cyndi Lauper (then Robert Palmer, then her own \\"Lucky Star\\"...... talk about stuck in the 80s) - but it's quite another thing to hear her drop references to the drug MDMA. It's kind of understandable that she might capitalize on a designer-drug's resemblance to her name, but I wish she had resisted. I find it totally unbelievable that the 21st Century Madonna casually drops drug references or still hangs out with peons who do. It's not clever and makes her seem like Grandma-Goes-To-The-Disco, trying too hard to sound clued in. Never has she seemed so detached from pop music, from her own public image, from everything really.<br /><br />I'll say this for her............ No way would any other pop music diva come up with something as brain-meltingly bizarre as \\"Gang Bang\\" - and then stick it right up front as the second track on the album. Exactly who is that song supposed to appeal to? (I imagine it was supposed to invite some fake 'controversy', which it might have if anyone outside her fan base actually paid attention to the album.) Still, I'd like to see Mariah Carey top that.  Or actually, no I don't.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Always has great puzzles for free and so many more to purchase as well. I love it and play it all the time. It's a great way to sit down and unwind after a hectic day. Beautiful puzzles that are are from really easy to really hard, so there's something for everyone. I've never had any problems playing on my Kindle or on my husbands iPad.
B00007LTIA|2.0|Definitely the Yes album that's likely to divide opinions - and probably the one album that gives an entire mini-genre of rock a bad name. As a Yes enthusiast, I've listened to all of their albums, and enjoyed most of them - but this is where I draw the line.  Not exactly awful, but the 'haters' are quite correct.  This is what happens when people forget that it's actually *hard* to write songs that are 20 minutes long, let alone four of them - and it's even harder to make a career out of it, as Yes have clearly discovered in the long haul.  Just because you have a double album to fill, and you got away with extended song suites once before isn't justification to do it over and over.  If people accuse progressive rock musicians of being egotists, it's probably because they presume that their talent will come through when working up these 'epics', and that they've somehow earned the right to the indulgence of 80 minutes of our time.  I'm glad they tried, as rock would be a lot poorer if people weren't making the attempt - but that doesn't make the actual results any more listenable. I'd prefer to have liked this album, but having listened to it many times over the years, I find it a struggle to remember any gripping melodies or any impressive instrumental passages (except for an Alan White drum solo, and I can never remember which song it's in).  No sir, when it comes to the Topographic Oceans, I definitely will not be diving in.  Roger Dean's cover is one of his best, I'll grant him.<br /><br />If I had to pick one song that wasn't entirely unsuccessful, it'd be \\"The Revealing Science of God\\".  And if you're a newcomer to Yes, I'd start with the more manageable works from the period, like 'Fragile' or 'Close to The Edge'.  Remember, those are the albums that primed the rock audience for something like this, since I doubt that if they'd plunked this album out first it would've been accepted - and I'm sure even this album's fans will agree it probably demands a lot ofa listener, either a newbie or obsessive.  If you must take the plunge into the Topographic Oceans (and as much as I think it's unsuccessful, I'm glad I at least dipped a toe in), I'd reccomend a dip in some of their shorter albums first before working up to this one.
B009NPA3Q4|3.0|I liked only about half the songs.  It seems Phillips voice sometimes gets so repetitious that you can't tell one song from the other.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I have watched this series in the past on my own, but my wife and I started watching it together this past weekend and she is hooked!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|This screen  play was written true enough to the original that I was not disappointed. If you read the boxed series in the 70's you will appreciate this installment.

B0098466CK|3.0|Good album, but older albums are more exciting: this one doesn't want to make me pick up my battle axe...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved the book. I was truly impressed with the research and literary references in bedded through out Stephen King's novel.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Miserables Combo Pack had every application I had hoped for.  I loved the bonus sequences like 'the making of..' etc, interviews with the actors and director.  Wonderful to see Cameron Mackintosh input and his passion for the project.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Good, a continuance of the love triangle and teen drama of the other twilights I can't seem to stop watching. lol.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This was a great action/comedy. All the main actors were well paired with the characters. It was not a waste of my time.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold Fry sets out on his pilgrimage with no set plan other than to walk until he reaches the town where Queenie lives in a retirement home.  The novel is set in the English countryside which adds to the charm of the novel. His unlikely gang of followers; among whom is a man in a gorilla suit, add to the already richly developed character of Harold. As he interacts with them we see him gaining a understanding that other people have issues as well.  There is a clever twist to the plot and a very satisfactory ending.
0061564893|5.0|Excellent book, written by a credible sailor!  Capt.  Menzies writing style is accessable and flows nicely.  Great to give to friends with dogs and vets too!!!
B007V65R54|5.0|If you don't have a hardcore statistics background but involved in making forecasts, this is a great book to help you out. As a management consultant, i found the ideas useful and i am excited to try them out soon.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|After reading this book the first time I now constantly go back and read it again. The story line pulls you in and doesn't disappoint in any way.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|I throughly enjoy the Men In Black trilogy.  I have the first MIB on VHS, but wish it on dvd.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The best, most believable, character Matthew has been disposed of - unless he is to make a remarkable miraculous recovery - his second in the series.  One can almost tell what was to happen next as all the cliche events rolled out.  The question was which show had last used the vignette.  Upstairs Downstairs Reveiew deja vue.
B000VS6R26|5.0|I loved how I got my package not even 5 days after I had ordered it, and to top it all off the package was in great conduction and was not messed up
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Wonderful adaptation! Lord Richard Attenborough is a wonderful director. Casting is good too! A must see...for young and old - enjoy it!
B000FBJFSC|1.0|The font formatting was inconsistent.  One page was in small font and the next in larger, darker font, so some words were missing between pages.  Very disconcerting to read.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|I bought this for a gift for a friend who is a West Side Story fan, I am sure she will get a great deal of pleasure out of it.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I'm familiar with the Cirque Du Soleil but have never seen one of their shows.  I've always wanted to but it just never happened. Any way we purchased our first 3D HD television and I've been trying to build my 3D blue ray library.  I saw this at Walmart and decided to give it a try. My sister was visiting for the weekend and I thought she might enjoy it.  BOY WAS I RIGHT!!!  The visuals for this \\"movie\\" are AMAZING, STUNNING, SPECTACTULAR!!!  We were in awe from beginning to end.  The reason why I write \\"movie\\" is because it's not really a movie. At least not to me. There seems to be a plot, girl finds boy, girls loses boy, girl looks for boy, girl finds boy again...Whatever.  Forget all of that.  Just think of yourself as having a front row seat in an amazing circus!<br /><br />I have watched this at least 12 times in two weeks.  I am just in awe of the 3D effects, which are the best I've seen thus far.  And that includes Coraline and Dispicable Me, which are among the best of them.<br /><br />I cannot wait to have my mother over so I can blow her away with this visual beauty!  I don't know if I would have loved this as much as I did were it not in 3D, but it is and I did!!!!<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B0031RS2HC|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this book. I had heard so much about how good Lee Child's books were. I found that the main character got away with far too much in the way of killings which for me made the story too far fetched.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|Great Movie. Very Poor Streaming! Had to restart multiple time throughout movie. Watched most of it in very low quality.
B005NB5RWM|3.0|You have to applaud Ted Turner for attempting to recreate the epic events at Gettysburg, and this film does just that in terms of scope and scale.  The battle sequences are the best moments in the film:  The recreation of Chamberlain's right wheel down Little Round Top is thrilling, as is the recreation of the opening moments of Pickett's charge.  The film comes up short however as a dramatic offering.  All of the characters are too stiff and wooden (Lee especially), and the \\"dramatic tension\\" between Gen'ls Armistead and Hancock is laughable.  And then there are the fake beards, which are abundant, and seem to get worse as the film trudges on.  The most egregious can be seen on Jeb Stewart, as the false facial hair appears to be connected directly to his ears.  It's good entertainment, but one can only wish Spielberg had stepped up to the task.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love, love, love this show.  I hate to see the season end but know next season will be even better.  Would recommend this for everyone!
B00C32R64G|5.0|Volbeat is amazing! The vocals are so smoothe, guitar riffs are perfect! I would say this is the best album that I have heard in years. I'm a fan!!!
B00A85EMVK|4.0|We have just purchased a 3D TV. This movie is so much fun to watch in 3D.<br /><br />Loving forward to watching it over and over.
B001LF347E|5.0|Always lovely to have Merlin around. The commentary is great.
B005GT3XGS|5.0|i do not like writing. just really happy with it not happy write not happy have to do this not happy with write
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Finally, someone is so perfectly addressing the merits and setbacks of being introverted in a way that doesn't trash extroverts but embraces the important balance of the two.  As an introvert it isn't something I discuss much but it is certainly a book I'd recommend introverts and bosses reading.
B00BESM14U|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised on how close the movie was to the novel; for many parts of it I remember thinking, this is exactly how I visualized it while I was reading the book. Casting was great too.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Up to Lee's usual high standard of production and musicianship.  Some great new tracks, together with some awesome re-makes of older ones - River Man and Maybe Tomorrow are stand-outs for me.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I'd probably give this book about 3-1/2 stars...  it is a good story, generally well written, but the pace is slow and it reads like the first half of a book rather than a full book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show, classic. If your a history buff and love seeing the culture this is the perfect show. Seasons keep getting better!
B0095MVOMC|4.0|This is a good game to pass the time. Good graphics and great pictures. I thoroughly enjoy this game and believe you will also.
B00BSBXA98|1.0|A little hokey, understandably very little story. And then, a Beatles song. And another. And another, with misguided skit after misguided skit. Porn for children of the sixties, now in their sixties; for the rest of us, more magnificence muddled by some vague obligation to Art, and Statement.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Nice to have a new show that is not completely predictable. Quirky characters and really good filming. When two of the same characters are in the same frame, they keep it from looking hokey.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent sets, scenery and costuming. The writing is good and number of the characters are interesting and very well played.
B00C32TPZE|4.0|Different feel from previous album release but I still really like the album as a whole.Has more of a laid back feel to it.
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|Woody Allen is an intelligent and humorous conceptualizer. But he doesn't love his characters and thus fails in all but the most superficial ways to make them loveable.
0307352153|2.0|Other than the fact that my views on our culture as Capitalism, PR and ad culture were confirmed than what could you expect than to find out we don't much value anything like quiet, contemplation, deep thinking, etc. Pretty obvious I'd say and expanding on that alone could in the right hands make this a valuable book.<br />As it is it is not a valuable book, that is, for anyone who knows anything much about what she's talking about. Maybe a novice of some sort would be fascinated by all the psycho mumbo jumbo and the flip through, skip over, boring, research.<br />I think I bought this book, forgive me, I should know better, but a blurb is a powerful distractor and since I buy a lot of books without browsing through them; I buy a lot of books from Amazon, I didn't look it over before I bought it.<br />Again, as I usually do, I blame her editors. I believe that anyone with half a brain could see that this book had no distinguishing, other than pretty worn out,cliched thinking about introverts vs. extroverts,well thought out,or even somewhat original platform to launch from. So it's almost entirely derivative based on a lot of \\"used\\" research that made it impossible for me to read.<br />Scholarship it's not, quality non-fiction it's not. Then what is it?<br />It's eminently throwawayable but I'll try to pawn it off, and maybe get something for it, as nearly new.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I am really shocked by how good the book is. It reads like a story, but at the same time it offers a lot of insight into the operations of a company from an IT perspective.
B000FC11A6|4.0|Don't be discouraged, The this book took me a while to get in the groove.....BUT The parallel past and present and descendants who are in the dark about what roles their fathers played in WWII is plausibility a d skillfully crafted. THIS IS A GOOD BOOK I RATE IT solid overall 4.<br /><br />I am NOT a mathlete, by any stretch of the imagination, but I found the cryptology fun to follow and for the most part could follow, except when two of the main characters would go off on brain tangents and even for instance, break down the random mathematics of their McDonald's order. There are only a few of these sections in the book, but some of them go on for pages.<br /><br />As for the OVERALL story, plot, characterizations, I give this book a 4.5. It was worth the 900+ pages. You truly get to know each and every character, except one, the enigmatic Enoch Root, which I desperately wish there had been more explanation about, and his organization.<br /><br />Having read a lot about WWII, and seen a bunch of documentaries on the topic as well as interviewed surviving vets myself, I find his characterization of the war -- on both fronts to be highly realistic and in tune with what was actually happening as well as the state of mind of the solider/sailors/grunts on all sides. I rate this a 5. Bravo.
0812983459|4.0|Harold Fry's marriage has been in a vegetative state for years; his relationship with his son nonexistent; his life a mindless vacuum. Then one particularly ordinary day in April, he receives a letter that turns his day into a particularly extraordinary day. An old friend he hasn't seen for 20 years, and who once did him a great favour, is dying in a hospice in Berwick. Harold sets off to post her a letter, but gripped by a sure feeling he'll be able to will his friend to stay alive, he keeps on walking, intent on making it all the way to the other end of the country.<br /><br />Equipped with only the clothes he stands up in; no hiking gear whatsoever, Harold's journey becomes the reader's as he makes his slow and winding way to Berwick, most of the time, accompanied only by his thoughts.<br /><br />In writing this book, Rachel Joyce has dug deep into the human psyche, yet managed to bring us a book of deceptive simplicity; a story that stays in the mind long after the last page is turned.
B0043XS7IC|5.0|great band, great music.<br /><br />what else is there to say, if you have never heard them before google it.  I'm sure there are hundreds of songs you can find online to listen to for free just to see if it is the right taste for you.
B000OVLINI|5.0|My book went around the world, passed on from one friend to another. It has a story on its own aside from the intensity of the book. It is beautifully written in its own dark manner. Infectious. I have read this book 5 times. I still would read it again.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is an absolute blast! It plays perfectly on the Kindle Fire.  Great graphics also.  I highly recommend it!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I am absolutely in love with DM's new music!<br />If your a Depeche Mode fan like myself, you will definitely love their new cd!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Just needed replacement for old cable.  Works great and my kindle is not always charged.  Works with out products also.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Not real challenging and you use a lot of lives and do not get a lot of game play when playing the game.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I loved this book!  As a fan of Star Trek, the moment I saw the title I was instantly amused.  I completely love the premise.<br /><br />As we all know, when the crew goes on an away mission, the Captain, First Officer and Science Officer are always on the mission and they will always survive.  Unfortunately, that doesn't mean everyone survives.  That's where the \\"red shirts\\" come in.  These low ranking extras have a very low survival rate on these missions.<br /><br />What if the red shirts started to catch on?  What if they figured out that there was something bigger going on?<br /><br />This book is like Star Trek meets Stranger Than Fiction.  It does an excellent job of parodying Science Fiction in general, but Star Trek specifically.  Here are some of my favorite quotes from the characters as they are trying to figure out why their ship makes no sense:<br /><br />\\"Something will explode on the bridge, ... There has to be damage there, whether it makes sense or not.\\"<br /><br />\\"inertial dampeners don't work as well in crisis situations, The ship could do hairpin turns and loop-de-loops any other time and you'd never notice. But whenever there's a dramatic event, there goes your footing.\\"<br /><br />There is plenty of other light hearted laughter at the expense of the beloved show, but I won't spoil it any more, just read the book.<br /><br />I do have to give one negative, though.  There was language and swearing that seemed completely unnecessary.  It detracted from the experience for me.  Other than that, I loved it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is such a fun game.  I like that each level have their own levels.  If you get stuck you can then go back or forward and play the next level.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Good book. I can't wait for book 2. This world has a lot of potential. Good character development. Would have been nice if more time was put into the last few chapters, but he had to set up the next book. Overall well done
B009FZHYKU|5.0|An intense finale capping an awesome season. It's amazing to see how the living have become so much more menacing than the &#34;walkers&#34;. Really good show!
B009O07NMA|4.0|I am a<br />Not normally a. Outcry music fan but after seeing these guys at the ACM awards I am now a fan. The cd is fun and upbeat and I truly do enjoy listening to them
B0074VA2T2|3.0|My grandchildren are too old for this app but It would be very good for the correct age group and I don't know anyone ..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The easy navigation makes the game so much more fun and the loads of options provide a lot more gameplay opportunities. I only wish they would give you more options of horses from the get go.
0307352153|4.0|This has been the book that I have been waiting for! As an introvert, people kind of stare and don't know what to make of you. Why aren't you talking? Why aren't you engaging? Because I am observing and thinking people! This is what Susan Cain points out quite well in her book.<br /><br />The book is engaging and well written. Cain not only explains the way introverts function, but how the world and business is really set up for extroverts and not introverts. As a pastor, I particularly found the section on churches very interesting and useful.<br /><br />Cain's main point is that introverts are not useless, they are not shy, and they are not engaged, but are processing a different way than society expects, so they kind of get shunned and passed over. Leaving space for quiet and for thinking is useful in almost all walks of life, but especially useful to help introverts engage.<br /><br />Wonderful read and worth it!<br /><br />I received this book free from Blogging for Books. I am not expected to write a review a certain way, so the review comes from my own thoughts and not from the publisher.
B0086221SS|4.0|I liked this movie but can't honestly pinpoint the reasons.  I felt that it was rather dark. In fact, it was unnecessarily dark.  It is not a spoiler to say that the leading lady becomes attracted to another man.  This piece of news is given in the description.  Yet, she isn't grounded mentally and has a real difficult time demonstrating love and intimacy.  When you consider this issue it becomes strangely interesting.  Why would a person that cannot demonstrate love, fall in or out of it?  It is this strange behavior that had me watching all the way to the end.  I kept expecting a mental clarity or closure and I'm still not sure if I got it.  It was an interesting ride but not especially cheerful. Do not expect cheer just because it has two comedians in it.
0786956127|4.0|it was everything i expected and a little bit more, double sided, and goes well with dungeons and dragons starter kit.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|As a mental health therapist, I was interested to see how the characters and their difficulties would be portrayed.  The book was fine, simply written.  There was a bit more football than I would have liked, although I appreciate being a fan was important to the development of the characters.  Just could have used a bit less of it.  Why is it that either the Father or the Mother, is mostly portrayed as bumbling, or angry, or inert?  In my many years of working with people and families, including work with some unsavory folks, I've never found the human character a simpe one.  If you love football and are intrigued about the content, read this one.  It handles the mental illness in a straightforward and kind manner.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love how the book is written, it gives more interest  in  it and it makes you want to finish it.
0060090367|4.0|This book was pretty good.  This is the first book I read by Marian Keyes, and it won't be my last.  The book was a little slow in the middle, but then I read the last 100 or so pages in one day.  It is a page turner! Great book!
B00881PTRC|3.0|I just installed and began playing a one player game, subject animals. It saddening me to see the little guy begin to take form. Unfortunately the animal was zorro...huh? The dictionary couldn't define it. I plan to play again  and not jninstalll just yet.
B004RKXN44|5.0|The book everyone waited for Hawke and Sienna. Does anybody know who the Ghost is? This book is the best!!!
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|Hats off to Accuradio for the excellent music mix they provide. No matter which category I select, the offerings fit nicely to give just the right touch and feel I was hoping for.
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|Fun enough game. Nice graphics. Good abilities, rewards and incentives, but incredibly laggy after latest update...so much so that it actually interrupts game play and makes you dire since this is a hand-eye coordination/speed type of game. Disappointing. Will upgrade star rating if this is fixed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I love this show and love that it's offered on Amazon Instant Video. While the streaming quality isn't always as good as Netflix, I'm willing to put up with a couple of hiccups in order to watch it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|good for the mind would like updates sooner and when the kindle crashes you don't lose everything you worked on thank you<br /><br />//-
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|A co-worker of mine recommended this (I work in a library) and I got totally sucked in! I think I sat and read it in an hour or so, a very fun read

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has changed my life!!! I am now looking at the world with a much different perspective now that I've read it
B001F0WXY0|3.0|I'm going to preface this by saying that as a kid I absolutely loved the movie (I know, it's actually terrible, but I was a kid, cut me some slack). I had never read the novel before, so I was excited and fully prepared to like the book. Unfortunately, the best I can say is &#34;it's okay.&#34; I felt like the story line had so much potential, and I kept waiting for it that potential to be fulfilled. In fact, I was waiting right up until the last page, and was left feeling let down.<br /><br />The book takes a long time to get anywhere and has a fair amount of characters who seem important, then drop off; I know they come back, but it's not until another novel, and I'm not sure I would bother reading them at this point. Herbert did a good job of explaining the motivations of the various groups and characters, but I found myself wishing he'd ditch Paul (main character) and follow the Fremen (desert natives) or Alia (Paul's unusual sister). In fact, although Herbert spent quite a long time detailing Paul's actions and motivations as well as those of other characters, it seems that the more time he spent, the less I cared about the characters.<br /><br />The novel has a very political/religious warning feeling, and it's clear the author is writing a warning about the power of faith and politics, especially with blind followers. It also has a superficial eco-conservation feeling, but I couldn't get over the fact that Herbert seems to be trying to say that people should be very ecologically sensitive, while writing that his characters are striving to completely change their ecology and environment. It just had the feeling of being at odds.<br /><br />One of my biggest complaints is Herbert's reliance on &#34;jargon&#34; in the novel. He's got some made-up word in practically every paragraph, and it's often difficult to ever figure out what he's talking about from context. Luckily, there is an extensive glossary, but it really takes you out of the novel if you find yourself flipping back and forth all the time. And in the Kindle version, it's just plain annoying to go back and forth. I really like it when authors use some &#34;local&#34; words in their works. It helps pull you into the world; authors like Tolkien, MZB and countless others have done it to great effect. Just look at the amount of people out there who try to learn &#34;elvish,&#34; or Klingon. But Herbert seems to delight in popping these words in, with very little (or no) explanation as to what they mean, or why on earth you should care. They come across as awkward and contrived, and not only don't add to the story, they completely detract from it. They don't explain anything, don't add to the cultural feeling and just get in the way.<br /><br />I wanted to like this novel – I really did. But I just can't. Because I bought it, I may give it another try in a few years, but for now, all I can say is &#34;meh.&#34; I've certainly read worse, but I just can't for the life of me fathom the following this &#34;classic&#34; has. It's not bad, but it's not good by a long shot. If you want to read it, consider borrowing it from a friend or the library first. At that price, I would have rather had two novels I liked than one &#34;classic&#34; that was just okay.<br /><br />By the way, I do have the Kindle version, and I was very wary of purchasing it after reading all the issues with spelling mistakes. I had bought another novel with so many of these issues, I didn't want to go through that again. I am pleased to say, this version has less mistakes than many printed copies of books, so if you're holding off reading it because of that, don't.

B007SGM084|5.0|These book were awesome. I appreciated every detail from beginning to end. The intro held my interest, the body was tastefully hot and heroic and the ending is every woman's dream. You gotta make this into a beautiful adult movie. I can't wait until the movie comes out. Christian is every woman's dream man who fell in love.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Just perfect for keeping up with and remembering a variety of things.  Dandy.  And certainly handy.  And how bout them colors.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I did the Jillian Michael's DVD this morning.  It's a pretty good workout and it goes by very fast. My arms are KILLING me this morning and I didn't even use weights!  I only have 10lb dumbbells and I need to buy 5lbs this weekend...they use 5lbs in the DVD and I wouldn't use anything more, especially to start.  I feel like I'm going to be very sore later today/tomorrow lol! But over all I think I was able to do 16min of the 20min workout so not too shabby!<br /><br />I think once I learn the moves better too I'll be able to breeze right through it

B0064MPXFA|5.0|This has everything, romance, intrigue, politics, courtroom drama.  I'm hooked.  The actors are superb in each of their roles.  You get to know each character, but not so well that you are bored.  They keep you guessing.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|We all love this movie -- my 2 1/2 year old, 4 year old, my 46 year old husband, and myself (44). There have been a couple of rainy days where we have watched this movie two times in a row.

B007W1BLN0|5.0|I tend to watch this movie quite often when the BIG city (Dallas) starts to drag me down. It is up there with Pursuit of Happiness in regard to grounding my stressful roller coaster. Definitely a must see.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I am not usually a fan of novels written in the first person, as I often find them disjointed, but this is an exception, and an exceptional one at that.  I had a lot of fun trying to figure out what was happening, and got some right and some wrong.  Very enjoyable.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|great clock, it works in background which is great. not draining the battery. and it gives the weather. only thing I don't like is to use your own music you have to buy. but for free, its an alarm clock and it works
B005DJREJS|5.0|I hadn't heard of this show until it was available free on Prime streaming for a limited time.  Easy to watch 22 minute episodes, interesting characters and some real laughs.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love the way this author captured the thoughts and feelings of the main characters (the children) with such sensitivity and honesty. This book should be read by children and adults alike. My 10 year old granddaughter read this book and I believe it was a valuable lesson for her life and the lives of others.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|Don't do this to yourself. Not sure what some people see in this movie. I was happy after it was over
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Oh my it jumps of the screen.  Being filmed in the ocean the 3 d graphics are great and the story line is one of the best too.  Great for Kids!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great, fantastic, worth waiting for, didn't compare to the original though, but I wasn't disappointed as the characters are firmly entrenched.

B00C1S945G|4.0|I've seen several episodes I missed when they aired.  Can't wait to see the rest of the season. A great way to get lost in space.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Nothing will compare to The Ring but this series is great being written by the same people.  The 3 d Graphics were great and I recommend for all children
B009CF7GRY|1.0|As a stand alone movie, I may have given this as high as two stars. My 8 year old daughter laughed a couple times and shook her butt to the music. But that would assume I had never heard of or seen the orignial. When watching the remake and having knowledge of the original, this receives ZERO stars. It's as if someone found a 25 year old movie script and said \\"ok, lets make THIS movie. We don't even need to make any changes. It's fine as it is.\\" The script was virtually the same as the original. The original had moderately funny dialogue performed by good actors, and it worked. Take that same dialogue and give it to these modern day \\"actors\\" and it does not work. I can't tell if the writing didn't hold up well over time or if the main characters were just that bad. Unless you are an 8 year old girl who has never heard of Footlose before, stay as far away from this movie as possible.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|I bought this movie so my kids could watch this classic piece of comedy. The amount of one-liners and repeatable text is amazing!

B007IV1E2W|4.0|I think I like the Amy Pond episodes best of the new Dr. Whos.  I started watching Dr. Who's in the 70s during the Tom Baker era.  It's nice to see the series bought back with good writing and good characters but with modern production and quality special effects.
B0091WUZJE|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Not a new plot, but anything with John in it is worth watching.  Good supporting cast.  Very young Vera Miles.

0545259096|3.0|Originally posted on 5/14/12 at Melissa's Bookshelf.<br /><br />Well, to be blunt and 100% honest, one sentence in the synopsis taken from the dust jacket sums up the way I feel about this book and this series: \\"That should have been the end of their story.\\" For me, The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy has gone downhill with each successive book.  I loved Shiver -- in and of itself it was a delicious read and actually felt like it could have been (and really should have been) the end of the story of Grace and Sam. I was happy when I finished that book and it really felt like a story that had been wrapped up and tied with a pretty little bow.<br /><br />Forever was not wrapped up at all. A gaping hole with a giant question mark is what I felt like I came to when I reached the end.  Yes, the title implies \\"forever,\\" but the ending just doesn't make me feel \\"forever.\\" It's more like I'll be forever wondering what happened to Grace, Sam, Isabel, Cole, and everyone else, except that I don't think I plan to waste much time thinking about it. I suppose I should have realized after reading Linger and not enjoying it as much as Shiver, that perhaps I should be wary of the last book in the trilogy, but unless books just get progressively awful for me or I have a change in taste/preferences, I usually feel like I have to finish a series.<br /><br />Oh, how I wish I'd just read Shiver and enjoyed my happily ever after. It's not that there weren't some exciting parts in Forever. The efforts to save the wolves and give them a new home made for a dramatic read and I did enjoy that aspect. I also appreciated more from Isabel's and Cole's point of view, but again, there was no closure for the two of them, either. I can live with being left hanging if I know that there is another book coming, but this is it, folks. There is no more.<br /><br />Other things I appreciated: (1) The research that Stiefvater mentioned she had done on wolves in her Author's Note. I felt like what she had written about the nature of the characters as wolves seemed quite realistic and I definitely thought it added to the story. (2) The story was told from multiple points of view. I liked hearing Isabel's and Cole's voices and not focusing entirely on Grace and Sam. I guess I felt that way because I was a little bit tired of the way Grace and Sam's story was headed at this point.  But the things I did appreciate saved Forever from getting a negative rating, in the end.  After all, I do try to be fair.<br /><br />My final thoughts are simple.  If you haven't read this series yet, read Shiver and leave it at that.  Enjoy that story for the satisfaction it provides and re-read it to your heart's content. I'm not sure if I'll be able to re-read it because I know how the rest of the story ends (or doesn't).
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Watched and enjoyed mostly. I liked the way the humor kept it from being too intense but the violence was a bit much. Worth seeing
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I got this as a birthday present for myself. I absolutely love it and so does my husband. It's one of those pieces you never get tired of.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The story is well laid out with facts and fully supports the existence of the afterlife without any religious overtones.  The good doctor was obviously selected to relate the reality of life beyond life in a clean, clinical style.  Read this book and understand who you REALLY are.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game was good in the beginning but as you get deeper in the game. Its more and more expensive.You will really go through some money to get the game finish.So if you are a person that need to finish a game expect to fork out a lot of money.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Gets a little repetitive later in the book and some of the turns-of-events seem quite unbelievable to me but given the topic as a whole, i guess that doesn't disqualify it as a good yarn.
2067002627|5.0|This was just what I needed to follow the action in Normandy while I read a detail account of the invasion..
B00BESM14U|5.0|Characters are so well developed that you can really relate to their experiences and by the end of the movie you feel like they're your friends. Story line has a few surprising twists. Really great movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|used it multiple times on my computer and kindle fire. pretty accurate and use it to monitor multiple areas. highly recommended
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I had not read the book so i did not know what to expect. The movie started out slow and gradually built into an exciting climax with excellent acting and directing. A definate must see if this style of movie interests you.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|you cant  beat free and this game works great on my kindle fire. i highly recommend this for everyone. thanks!
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|There's no doubt about it, Save Rock N Roll is an in-your-face arena ready bombastic show of recording, it's the sort of record Green Day could have done if they'd have focused on a dozen songs deeply instead of glossing over three dozen of them. Every chord, every melody, every slam bang and crash is orchestrated for maximum effect, unfortunately the production tries just as hard and about ruins the experience.<br /><br />Joining hall-of-shammer's Death Magnetic and Scream (from Metallica and Ozzy)Save Rock N Roll is brick-walled and clipped to distortion. Gone are all traces of individuals playing instruments, all meaningful uses of bass and any dynamic range whatsoever. Save Rock N Roll sounds like it's being played on ripped speakers on the worse system and blown speakers on the best (as high-end equipment on accentuates the negatives).<br /><br />What a shame, too. Stump's healthier physique and experience allows him to drive his range up near young Chris Cornell levels (though he'll never have Cornell's crooner voice) anyone who can pull off a line like \\"my songs know what you did in the dark\\" and suck you in deserves props, massively. Unfortunately there's a wall of digital haze between Stump and the listener, he sounds like he's singing through a bull-horn, all the time, in every song.<br /><br />The first half of this record cruises along, one ready-for-radio hit after the other. The only worth-while duet here is with \\"Foxes\\" on \\"just one yesterday\\" and it's about as good as sentimental rock ballads go. Unfortunately the fun derails there. The Mighty Fall feat Big Sean is not just a misstep, it's a headlong dive off a cliff, the train officially derails here. If you want to mix rock and rap you have to look at Linkin Park on how to do it correctly, just dropping a rap into a song is well.. so ten years ago. And with lines like \\"I'm a dick, I'm addicted to you\\" there's no saving this. if you're still paying attention after that the next three songs stand up as solid if not outstanding, but then Courtney Love comes in, why? We don't know, it certainly doesn't add credibility! She rants \\"it's Courtney b**\\" and blubbers on about who-knows-what ruining an otherwise perfectly good song just by being there.<br /><br />By the time you get to \\"save rock n roll\\" feat Elton Jon, the only other guest on here that works, it's an obvious attempt at a big arena song, a stand up and wave your hands we're going to play this song for 15 minutes type of song. But, it's merely okay and a record that starts so strong should end stronger. The problem is it feels like this song was mapped out to be exactly the song it is rather than organically occurring, it's the least objectionable misfire and a perfectly \\"ok\\" song.<br /><br />Overall you'll probably find yourself listening the disk to just get back to the first two tracks, but that's not to say the rest isn't worth listening too (minus two songs) it's just to say that it comes crashing out of the gate, but hobbles over the finish line.as solid if not outstanding, but then Courtney Love comes in, why?

B0090X4GLW|5.0|I love the sound track. The one thing that I would have liked more would be that they would play the whole song and not just the parts that you here on the movie
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love teen, I read a lot of it. I read through this quickly and I was impressed with the level she takes the books. I wish the film had done better at the box office because I would have loved to see the rest of the books made into movies.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Chipwrecked is a great movie. My whole family loves it. It is easy to follow along and you want to get up and dance with the songs that they sing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent calculator, easy to use, has all the functions you'd need and then some<br />Can't beat the price, great choice for down load
B003B02O14|3.0|This book starts slow, gets very good in the middle, and has a poor ending.<br />I am a big Grisham fan, but this is not his best work.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|The more I hear this album the more I love it.  So far the one I gave it too was pleasantly surprised at how much she liked it right away.
0393338827|5.0|If you want to feel like you are getting the true insiders view of just what happenned in the financial crisis, this is the book to read. This will open you eyes to the strories behind the story, and allow you to personally meet several people who were highly involved in what went down here. Michalel Lewis has a particular way of writing about any topic that is uniquely his, and pleasure to read. I have enjoyed every book of his that I have read.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|My wife is not a Tarintino fan and she loved it.  If you're a Tarintino fan, I don't need to say anything.  If you're not, give this a try.  I can't decide if it's better than Pulp Fiction, but at worse it's a tie.  This will be another one I'll watch a few times to get all the stuff I missed the first time around.  Acting...everything, 5 Stars!
B008220D5K|5.0|I am VERY shocked at the negative reviews.  My husband and I watched this in the theatre and laughed harder than we have in quite awhile!  So what there is no direct plot? Yes, the profanity is a little high but makes it all the more hysterical! SO true to life situations, reactions, and results.  Having two daughters, this movie was definitely relatable. 5 stars all the way!!!!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|The second book of the Selection series was a roller coaster of emotions toward the Prince. He does beautiful small gestures that tear at your heart strings and in the next few chapters does something that makes you want to slap him across the face only to completely redeem himself in the next chapter. It was exhilarating to read!<br />America is a great antagonist - she is complex but relatable, willful but realistic. You want her to have her hearts desire wether it be the prince or her first love. Watching her struggle with the two makes you believe in the simplicity of simply loving someone - you know before the dirty laundry, bad bathroom etiquette and life gets in the way.<br />I have enjoyed this series so far - I also do recommend the novella about the Prince that came out between one and two. It gives you a clearer view into Maxons world. Makes him less untouchable and more relatable as a man.<br />Well done, Ms. Cass. I can't wait for the next book in this series or anything new.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I started watching just to waste some quality time, but ended up learning much more than I expected.  Seeing the inside of a chicken barn and how they (the chickens) are processes is something not quickly forgotten.  You'll find the section on antibiotic-resistant bacteria interesting as well.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The story unfolds in three main parts; two introduce our characters in their current life, and one explains the background story. The author writes well, paints the characters in a believable way, and draws you into their stories easily. The fact that this is based on real circumstances is also appealing!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey! Such a wonderful show. There is absolutely no cursing, nudity, profanity or violence. I love that it is a wholesome show..that is hard to find these days. Although, I would not recommend it to men. My husband finds it boring. More of a ladies show. Lots of drama and romance :)
B003Y5H574|5.0|I really like this movie and would recommend it. The actors are great and do a good job. Funny and fun!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW... Just WOW.  This book wonderful and tragic.  Sky & Holder... I want to hug them both, what a crazy ride.  Not often does a book make me cry, but this one did it for me.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this movie. Great cast who did a super job. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves the musical.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|There are enough reviews on the content so all I will say is buy it.. It is a great read and amazing value!
B007IUBU86|3.0|This is a solid first offering from Adrenaline Mob.  None of the songs are truly memorable but a decent album when you want some metal in the background.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is an unbelievable film, a true eye-opener. Food Inc. truely changed the way I buy food. Don't purchase GMO's!!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app is Great for PDF's and it's free! I would recommend this app to anyone with a Kindle Fire.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|With a pace that feels like the Irish countryside, you travel the past and present with Jamie, a man who survived a dark childhood to become a man on a search. You won't forget this warm tale.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It is not a spoiler to say this is a zombie book. Frankly, pretty much all zombie tales follow the same track.  The author managed to find a novel way to tell the story that freshened up a tale we have all heard before to make it interesting again.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Works well! I love the dual ability to charge Ipod and Android devices as this was a device that has been needed for some time. This charger also delivers decent charge speeds, but I still think a home wall outlet is the fastest  that I have found for any of my devices. The only flaw I found with the charger is what Anker considers a plus feature.... No LED lights.  If many vehicles are like my'n, however ----2 car plug with only one that charges when vehicle is on or off and the other charging only when vehicle power is on ---- then it can sometimes get annoying if you don't remember which plug is which. So, I  do get that some people are distracted by LED lights. But, I don't find a very small LED light that indicates power very distracting (even at night).  That is probably a personal preference factor.  For me, I find it LESS distracting to have the light as I don't fumble with my phone and/or Ipod as much looking to see if they are charging or not. All in all, great charger!
B0027MJU00|1.0|Slow, plodding, dull.  I found all the characters totally unlikable and didn't care what happened to them.  Her technique of going back and forth I time was a bit disconcerting and disconnected.  Sorry I wasted the money.
0880793082|5.0|Great deck and excellent production. I wasn't sure whether the cards would have the greenish tone some customers complained about years ago, but I can see they all look wonderful.<br />The size is perfect too. Standard card size, easy to handle and shuffle.<br />I'm very happy with the purchase.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book is a must read! I loved every minute of it , I did not want to put it down!!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I am a big fan of this series.  I only hope something bad doesn't end this season, I know they want us to come back next year but we are already fans so we will be back next year.  Loved the 100th show.  Hope they keep it going forward with their relationship, it would be nice to see them get married this year, there is always tension between married spouses working together.
B000FBJG04|5.0|This is one of the best firsthand accounts of WWII ever written.  Whether you watch the HBO series first, or read the book first, it doesn't matter; the book is outstanding and the mini-series does it complete justice.<br /><br />I will also recommend my favorite Ambrose book, &#34;Undaunted Courage&#34;. It is about the Lewis & Clark Expedition, and it is absolutely amazing!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|One of the best seasons, hated to see the Captain go.  I'd already seen season 4 so I know how it picks up from here, but I remember thinking that I don't like it when they leaving us hanging for the summer.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it's the best one I've read in a long time! It kept my attention and it was hard to put it down. It's a MUST read!!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The mixture of religions was interesting.  I am glad I didn't pay $10 each to see it in the theater.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|On Season 2 now and thoroughly enjoy this show together.  With my husband's British heritage it is just what the doctor ordered!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|All three of the books are longer than they needed to be with Blomkvist and Salander going off on what seem to be extraneous excursions. The large number of characters in the third book made it difficult to follow at times. In the dangerous and shadowy world that Larsson exposes, it was nice to see evil get its due. The books are a sad commentary on the level of morality in Sweden and, by extension, the rest of the world, but this is obviously Larsson's point.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Really enjoy this story. Somehow this makes me feel in RPG game. I would buy season 3 when it become available.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is my only qualm with Season 3 of Downton Abbey. It was so unnecessary and cruel, happening right after his son was born.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Great actor but poor story. Matt not play it any more? I would prefer to see him back to the theme again.<br />However, this one might make this series end.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It is the best game I have played in a . Long time everyone should have it<br />It passes the time really well
1891252089|5.0|I recommend this publication to Ashtanga Yoga practioners.  It has detailed images and description of each asana as well as notes on practicing.  It's designed to stay open so that you can easily refer to it as you practice.  Money well spent!
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Incredible renditions of these great songs... plus great choreography in the dance scenes.  Do not miss it.  Watching the movie is even better than listening to the sound track I found out.<br />Jerry
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|i ordered this for my fiance's birthday, it arrived in plenty of time and in pristine condition! he's a huge Floyd fan and has owned this movie many times over the years (he keeps giving it away to friends who haven't seen it!). We may need to purchase more copies.
0307887448|5.0|Loved it!  I started it and couldn't put it down.  I think I finished it in a day.  I just want to say that.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|This book had no beginning middle or end. It created a million questions and answered none of them. This read was a complete waste of time!!!
B0038P59A0|5.0|Really love this. I've been into the anime called Detective Conan: Case Closed. Some of the tricks they use are...odd, and complicated. And you just can't see it happening in real life. But Sherlock Holmes is really intriguing. I loved the graphics and the plots. And those bits of comical genius from Downey Jr. It took me about three years to watch this movie. Sorry I waited so long. Loved it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|2nd read. If you haven't read it once I suggest you start. Not only an exciting read, I think we could all learn a thing or two from CK. RIP
B001FD5KJM|5.0|He's hot. Funny. Sarcastic. Egotistical. Genius. And Pepper Potts makes a perfect counterbalance. Love the movie. Love the man. It's all good.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I loved this movie: the story, the visuals and all the characters. A great addition to The Lord of the Rings Trilogy
B000VYNYN0|1.0|Terrible!  Wish you could give a negative star rating.  A friend recommended this movie to me.  All I can say is that they have bad taste!
B000FA675C|5.0|I have read it twice and enjoy it as a thriller and mystery,not as a statement on the Catholic Church.
0525953728|4.0|The first two thirds of this book is spent talking about all the training and missions this seal went on before he was picked to be part of the mission to capture Osama Bin Laden.  The best part of the book is the last third when it dives into the details of what happened on the night they were sent in to get Bin Laden.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|Good short historical review of technology advance with explanations why and how development decisions were taken. I liked the book.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|As a guy when my wife mentioned she wanted to see this movie I was not overly thrilled, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The movie is funny throughout and the songs they sing are very good.  This would be a good movie to add to your collection!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like most angry birds versions. They are fun and frustrating at the same time. lol  You just want to do better so you play the same levels over and over until you get 3 stars.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|After I read THE HOST, it became my favorite book forever. Even if the HUNGER GAMES come awefully close, they couldn´t top this one. There´s no book I´ve read so many times over and over again, without getting bored or feel a lack of exitement. I love to live in the caves with Melanie and Wanda every single time. So I was more than excited when the movie finally came out.<br />Of course, it can´t completely reach the brillantness of this book, but over all, I´m more than satisfied with how it turned out.<br />There are changes, sure, some make sense (Seekers wearing white instead of black and using peace instead of glocks), some don´t (why do they have to sratch persons out :-( ) and some are simply acceptable (Ian´s new hair color and the main Seeker beeing blonde and white). but all in all, I´m more than proud of how the movie came around.<br />I simply love to share the world I´ve grown to love in books with people in my life who don´t read that much with the help of a movie. The adaption was amazingly close and I´m sooooo glad it didn´t turn out to be completely altered like BEAUTIFUL CREATURES, RUBY RED or, even worse the DELIRIUM TV-Series! 5 stars straight out of my heart !:-))
B00000J9HF|5.0|Verdi's best opera with passion and drama is well sung and keeps its thrill with this collection of opera stars.

B001AKTZOQ|5.0|This cd is pure John Fogerty.This recording from 1970 may be their best! The original album of 11 tracks have stood the test of time.The 3 bonus tracks are a nice addition as well.The remastering on this cd is very close to the sound of the original vinyl Lp.I did do a comparison.I believe that any CCR fan would find this cd a must have to their collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a great read, hard to pull myself away at times, finished this book in record time.  great read. buy it
B008NW67E0|5.0|I LOVE this album. I love Mumford & Sons in general, but Babel is just fantastic. It's got a bit of a happier sound to it than Sigh No More (well, except for &#34;Broken Crown&#34;), and it's just fun to listen to. I listen to it all the time and can't get enough of it.
B0090O07RS|5.0|EXCELLENT CONCERT!! GREAT RESTORATION ON THE VIDEO, BUT THE AUDIO WAS EVEN BETTER!! A MUST FOR ANY DOORS FAN. MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT THE CONCERT HAPPENED BEFORE &#34;RIDERS ON THE STORM&#34; WAS RELEASED.
0590259385|5.0|I first discovered this book when my family and I visited a new library on a U.S. military base in Japan.  I instantly fell in love with the clever rhyming and rhythm of this book, and my now-10-month-old daughter loves it!  She squeals when we learn that Dave's mom is a bat--every time.  She is taking more and more interest in the cute illustrations, and gets excited every time I pick up this book to read to her.<br /><br />Every time I returned \\"Is Your Mama a Llama\\" to the library and checked out a new bunch of books, I missed having it and would borrow it the next time.  This pattern repeated itself.  We have been in Japan for almost four months, and have checked this book out four times so far.  I have it memorized!  I finally decided to buy a copy of this book for us to have when we return from Japan next month, and a copy for our niece who is turning two.  I have read many books for young children, and this on is--by far--my favorite.  It is very well-written and has interesting illustrations.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|This was a great movie, appropriate for both children and parents. Like many animated movies today there are two levels of enjoyment and kids will enjoy the animation while their parents laugh at the antics of the many video game characters from our own childhoods.<br />I bought it and have already watched it three times.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|.One of the best movies i have ever seen. Great performances. Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I like his books.  I don't think they come up to the level of Clancy but they are still good. Took me awhile to warm to the character.
1452115567|5.0|As an owner of a Coonhound I can really relate to the book,<br />Coonhound's are great companions and such silly lovable dogs<br />and he has really brought that out with Maddie, it also shows<br />how close man is with their dogs
B00518HBD0|3.0|Not their best work, but better than a lot of the crappy music that's on the radio these days.  The 2nd half of the album sounds like a series of breakup songs - not very heavy, kind of whiney.  In my opinion this band is at their best when they attack dark, angsty themes with a heavy sound.
B0041D843M|5.0|When I first ordered this book, I thought it would be a tough read since I'm not into reading health and nutrition books just because but this book was a pleasant surprise.  It was very informative and full of scientific studies and facts that are hard to ignore.  I have definitely made a change in my diet after reading this book.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Why do movie with black co-stars, have to be about fights between the two?<br /><br />  Haven't we left that behind, but they keep dragging it up, from the cesspool of life.  This movie is about racial hated and getting even.  Just like the Lincoln movie.  I don't want to watch blacks in chains.  It's violates my sense or morality.  Do they want people to look down their nose's at them?  This movie<br />does nothing to elevate their status, but put a bigger burden on their shoulders to carry.  I won't rent a movie with racist overtones.<br /><br /> Maybe this is part of their life, but not mine and I refuse to watch them exploit my ethnicity, because of their indentured servitude.  I don't like his acting anyway, if you can call it acting or just attitude.  Who would watch this crap?<br />It dehumanizes blacks and put a chain around their necks.<br /><br />Read the 'Exception clause.'<br /><br />13th Amendment Text<br /><br />Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.<br /><br />There is a moment under way to enact the 'Exception Clause' in the 13th Amendment, to send all the brownies in jail having<br />been duly convicted, back to their roots in Africa.  Repatriation under the 13th Amendment.  This mean even if a browny get a<br />speeding ticket and is found guilty of violating the law, they forfeit their Constitutional rights under the Exception Clause.<br />Sad to say.  I wouldn't want that hanging over my head.  So, behave yourself and respect others and the law.<br /><br />IF I WERE A BROWNY SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE IN JAIL TO GROW OLD AND DIE, I WOULD HIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER<br />TO PLEA MY CASE, THAT I VIOLATED THE 'EXCEPTION CLAUSE' IN THE 13TH AMENDMENT AND SHOULO BE REPATRIATED<br />BACK TO AN AFRICAN COUNTRY OF MY CHOICE.  WHICH IS BETTER, TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN JAIL OR<br />GAIN YOUR FREEDOM IN A NATIVE COUNTRY?  WHERE YOU COULD EVENTUALLY FIND FREEDOM.  THE 13TH AMENDMENT<br />EXCEPTION CLAUSE, IS A 'GET OUR OF JAIL' AND IT'S FREE.  IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION!  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS REACH<br />OUT AND GRAB IT.  LIFE IN JAIL OR FREEDOM IN NATIVE COUNTRY?
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|My favorite WWII combat story thus far (and I just finished Band of Brothers).  A wonderfully written and constructed character driven story.  Highly recommended.
B000FA675C|4.0|If you cannot separate your religious beliefs from your entertainment reading, stay away. The second time I read this I found three internal errors; that is like having a treasure hunt inside the book! Like a free bonus! By the way, the errors did not cause any real problems with the storyline or anything, they were mostly trivial. They made the second reading more fun, because I was motivated to pay closer attention, thus bringing out details I may have glossed over otherwise.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|all you have to do to join the review group is put your title as the review group<br /><br />temple run 2 is epic. you can like, change your characters and like all that stuff. and also like, fall down cliffs and stuff. epic.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an app well worth it. There are so many useless apps out there today, today it is so refreshing to find one that actually worth something, but it is free! I have been using The Bible for three days now and I am actually using it everyday. Not only can you use it as a bible and just read as you like, it also will set you up with programs to guide your reading and provide reflection material. There are so many different programs to choose from, the categories are endless. I am currently doing three programs: read the bible in one year(everyday I am presented with a certain amount of chapters to read in chronological order, completing it in one year), parenting(everyday for seven days I am presented with bible verses to read and reflect on all pertaining to parenting, completing it in one week) and marriage(everyday for seven days I am presented with devotional reading and scripture pertaining to marriage, completing it in one week). There is so much to choose from and you tailor it to your likes, life and time available. I recommend this for EVERYONE!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book couldn't stop reading it! I can't wait to read the next book! Hopefully the movie isn't too bad...
B0078XGEK2|5.0|This is a classic!  Should be required reading for every person. Anyone who reads this will benefit from what it says.  A timeless set of lessons, examples, and verbatims designed to help us see ourselves and others more realistically.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Great fun.  I love playing uno and this is great when I need to kill time at the doctor's office.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|The entire album was a pleasure to listen to.  It is definately on my Christmas listening list for many years to come.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this program.  Can't wait until I can watch season 3.  Hurry and get season 3 out on streaming.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|EVIDENCE OF ATTENTION TO DETAILS.......INVENTIVE! I await the next installment with new invention<br />New and improved. Different color fonts.<br /><br />@<br /><br />!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This is my first time trying to record via my computer. When I got the interface, downloaded the driver and Ableton Live Lite 8 software I was still apprehensive. However, I clicked on help, followed the simple directions and within 30 mins. this 'newbie' was recording. Now I'm running rampant through all of the sounds and &#34;licks&#34; that are included in the software. This is so much more than what I originally thought. Being a 'newbie', I am so glad that I chose Focusrite.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Angry Birds Space capitalizes on everything you loved about Angry Birds, but gives you exciting new locations and physics.<br /><br />The space aspect works very well with the existing Angry Birds method, but now you have to worry about planets' and moons' gravity, asteroids in the way, etc. It makes for an exciting twist.<br /><br />However, the ads are so intrusive that they tend to suck a little fun out of it. I understand that the Free version must have ads, but there comes a point when it's obvious they just made the Free version to sucker you into getting the full version. The ads pop up so frequently and so annoyingly (full screen) that I had to dock this one star despite its amazing gameplay.
0307593525|5.0|We have only tried a couple of recipes so far but they both turned out great on the first try.  The directions are easy to follow so even a below average cook like myself can get excellent results.  We plan to try many more because of the great food we have been able to create so far.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|IT KEEPS MY SON HAPPY WHILE WE ARE IN TRAFFIC. HE LOVES THE SILLY CARS AND FUNNY THINGS THE PIGGIES DO,
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and challenging. Time trial mode provides lots of variety. Trying to beat my personal best keeps me playing well into the night.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|first time i have ever been disappointed by a michael buble cd.  he is straying too far from what has made him the artist that he is today.  i do not like his new songs at all.  i am not some blue haired older chick either.  that is how his voice sounds best, singing the oldies.  very, very disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome. it is flawless and could not get my eyes off of it.  I am in heaven
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Other than the prolonged saga between Anna and her husband (both characters I like), this season has lots of surprises and an amazing finish.  Best season yet!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book two I  much better than book one. I am looking forward to reading th  third. What really happens to them all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is extremely good. I would recommend to all people aged 6-13.Very fun,it turns into the only game you want to play on your kindle!
B00005JM02|5.0|Two thumbs up! I'm in my late 20s but I still love Pixar movies like no other. It's just an all around great movie!!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like the the game, its easy to learn, easy to get some things. I wish it was easier to get the high end things without having to pay for it though.
B00004RJ71|5.0|For everyone who loves gangster movies this movie is the best one that was ever made. Sadly but true in many cases this is the life most people lived thru something like this. I love how raw some scenes are in this movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole series is hypnotizing. I finished all 3 in a month and only want more more more! I relate heavily with Mr Grey and Anastastia's relationship in my own. Id like to thank this book for making me find and remember the love I have for my very own Fifty Shades :)
B0002858YS|3.0|I ordered this accidentally, but it isn't bad so I decided to hold onto it. It has a couple of tracks on it I like.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book because it's full of battles and helping and dangerous things.<br /><br />The first time I read this book I was in love with it. It was wonderful
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I thought it was pretty funny... disk plays well and the case is in good condition. I don't have any complaints.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Talking Tom app for kindle fire HD is very delayed and does not pick up very much sound. It is cute though!
6305776369|4.0|the disk is in good shape, plays great. I recommend to those looking for a stupid movie to have a good laugh at
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|This app takes forever to load, but then it is very helpful. I could just ask someone a question on the phone faster than this app.
0788859544|4.0|I expected a used movie that wasn't all scratched up, skipping and freezing, etc..and that's exactly what I was sent.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is awesome. I really recommend it. It is easy to get around, and is very informative. I am glad I got this app.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Non stop action and drama. One of the best shows ever! Michael Chiklis gives great performance. A must see television show
B006YC74E8|4.0|There are no captions to what the buttons mean... problem!! If I don't want one effect, it does not let me keep it original. I just got it and it is confusing!! I like what the final products turn out to be though. I recommend this to anyone! (who knows what the different buttons mean...)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Man! I thought the first one was good and this in an improvement. They did a great job sharpening a already good game
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it! I have nothing bad to say. It has an easy layout, and lets you backspace. Whoo hoo! 5 stars!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is truly gifted with that fabulous voice and those great songs she sings....especially Rolling in the Deep.<br />What a treat to listen to everything on this CD.  Truly wonderful.
B000MPEIF6|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I've watched it time and time again. I watched the entire series over several days, and it was really fun to watch the story evolve.<br /><br />It's a good action film with Zombies, but made before Zombie films became the big thing they are today thanks to Walking Dead and the like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for the whole family.  Challenging and exciting from young to old.  Addictive game that helped pass time on our vacation traveling.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|It's rare these days that a movie comes along that everyone is the family can enjoy.  PI is one of those movies. Great cinematography, really good acting and a well told exacting story.  How they trained that tiger is a mystery to me.  Highly recommended.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Excellent Classic!!!  All the better in Blu-Ray! Good combination with digital and DVD also!<br />Recommend it highly, always good to have this classic.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Steven S delivered at an animated level on this one.  If you're not familiar with Tintin this will open the door to the comic strip series for you.  A pleasure to watch!
B00783NPVI|5.0|Having brought many collectors versions of the film's this is by far the best . The prop flowers are a great keepsake and really make the product worth buying.
B0070Z9KWM|4.0|Interesting story that got the message across at a rating under R...it can be done and done consistently.  This makes the film accessible for the entire family.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|A wonderful film in every way. I have been a motion picture student and fan for fifty years and Miss Lawrence is the finest actor I have ever seen. Period. Just glad to have stayed alive long enough to witness her level of art, a level where she alone resides. Hooked since Winter's Bone. Thank you JL for touching my heart so deeply.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I started reading the book after watching the movie. Both the movie and book are brilliant. The writing flow was different and terrific. Overall a good read.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is such an enthralling book. I read it in a single day. I couldn't put it down. Kiera Cass is an amazing author. I cannot wait for the third book to come out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I personally loved this game. It was interactive, had good music, got me mad a couple of times but it didn't make me rage quit because I wanted to see what came next, good story, even the hints were good the hints still made you think outside the box but gave you a general idea. I think my IQ level went up lol. My brother and I both loved it. Totally worth the 2.00. Can't wait for more rooms to come out I will pay the money. Long story short..... GET THE GAME!!
B00BI745AA|4.0|The best part was Ann Hathaway even if she is only in the very first part of the film.<br />It was hard to watch a movie that I already know every single part of it, being a fan on the musical itself. No intregue.<br />And as usual loved &#34;On my own&#34;.<br />Plesenlty sorprised by &#34;Marius&#34; performance.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, have to definitely use the hint button. I gave it 4 stars only because i didn't like how it ended, i wanted to keep playing, come out with the next soon.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Clasic Tarantino style, not so crazy as others.<br />Well deserved supporting actor oscar.<br />Good story too.<br />Expected more from DiCaprio, I like him as a villan.
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|I just love the way that this author has simply chosen to write a sex scene exactly how it should be done, without being afraid to use certain words to describe it. This story claims to b erotic, but it is much more than that!! It is definately hot and undr no circumstances does it fall into the light fluffy catagory that I have come across lately. The story is entertaining and written to a good standard. Again thgis is where the author stands above the crowd of authors who 'Think' that they have a well written piece. For the price of this book, I was pleased to have found one with a higher class catagory to it. Well worth every penny. :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I give the entire series 5 stars!  Streaming video with Prime is easy and fast.  Very little wait time for it to download, no huge pauses for buffering.  (I think it would also depend on your internet connection, but I had no problems with mine)  If you haven't watched any of Downton Abbey, I recommend starting at the beginning; and Seasons 1 and 2 streaming video are free with Prime membership.  Anyone who loves old England (and new England) will enjoy tremendously.  Much, MUCH better than Upstairs/Downstairs.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Well what can I say? I just love this movie! As a parent of a child who played with all the toys from this movie and now they are up in the attic while he is at college. How could you not relate to this movie.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|It's the CD I play most in my car. However I would have been wiser to purchase the DVD becasue the show they put on really adds a lot to the music.
B008602KQI|4.0|I recently just breezed through the Hunger Games book.  It hooks you in and keeps you reading until the end.  After reading the book I of course wanted to watch the movie to compare it to the book.  While I wasn't disappointed, there is only so much you can include in a movie.  A lot of details were left out and still other minor things were changed to be more suitable for the movie...which is okay.  That being said it was still a well directed and filmed movie.  My recommendation would be to absolutely read the book though.
0385504225|5.0|DAN BROWN IS A EXCELLANT WRITER. HE HOLDS YOUR ATTENTION FROM START TO FINISH. YOU NEVER WANT TO PUT HIS BOOKS DOWN.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|I bought this without knowing much about Diana Krall. I am glad I did. There are a lot of cliches used to describe her voice -- smoky, sensual, etc.-- but the fact remains that she knows how to sing, period. She does not use voice gimmicks like other singers do to get her message across or to claim uniqueness. Add her piano, and it is a very good package.
1401324649|2.0|Ver funny tale regarding a stolen suitcase, a few apparent murders, and a fuddled inspector.  The plot became tedious as one unbelievable coincidence after another puffed up the plot.
B000YAX3P0|5.0|I've heard a few songs on Pandora and really liked them so I decided to buy the album.  It's great from start to finish.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is a lot like the one for the DS, but does have a few new levels. This game will keep you playing until you finish it. So, if you are considering getting it, do and you won't be sorry.
B005NNV4TU|5.0|This is one of Pink Floyd's best albums that has been put out the digital remaster makes the sound awesome
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The acting is great for the most part. There are several known actors and a few unknown that give realistic performances. However, the plot has some major holes. It's still entertaining though!
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead is my new favorite.  It wasn't until I purchased Netflix subscription that I even knew about the show, which is odd because I watch a ton of TV.  I started watching S1 Episode 1 and had to turn it off as Rick Grimes was coming out of the hospital in the loading dock area.  Creeped me out!  Glad I gave it another chance....now I understand the &#34;walkers&#34; and enjoy seeing them receive the mandatory &#34;cranial massage&#34; which awaits them.  All caught up on 3 seasons....awaiting the airing of S4 this fall.
B0063M22QO|5.0|With such a variety of formats you can stay entertained for hours.  Even young people are captivated and pleased when they succeed.
B008ROZAQU|3.0|So so plot, but wonderful Mancini soundtrack makes the ride better. Red Buttons is entertaining, and Elsa Martinelli is enjoyable watch. The rest of the cast is just bearable. Exploiting and mistreating animals for profit is a big downer plus everyone being a chain smoker is also a downer and makes it objectionable for family viewing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I love this show!  It is a wonderful escape from modern reality, without feeling like you completely turned your brain off :) Absolutely love it!  Just finished Season 3 and can't hardly wait for Season 4...  I would say, we are addicted!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rio is a GREAT Angry Birds.  It is extremely challenging and is constantly being updated to give everyone a gaming challenge.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|sound stopped in the last 20 minutes of movie, tried several times to get it to come back, would like a refund on this
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Another GREAT Richard Gere movie!  Gere's attorney character takes on a case for a young man who is mild mannered and gentle, but accused of a horrible crime.  The character building and relationships are wonderful in this movie.  THEN there is the huge twist near the end that NO ONE expects.  Yes, watch this movie.
B000002GZ1|5.0|Enough has been said about the sheer magnitude of this album's impact on blues and rock, so I'll speak about how important this album is for the student of guitar.  I'm a twenty-something guitarist who experienced a renaissance in my playing after listening to one of the great masters (Mike Bloomfield).  I stumbled upon this album after watching a documentary on the Doors and catching a reference that guitarist Robby Krieger made to the Butterfield Blues Band.  Now that I've paid more attention, I've noticed many other guitar greats (e.g., Carlos Santana) mention this band and this album as being a milestone* in blues rock.<br /><br />Bloomfield's playing is sheer genius--not necessarily because it's super fast, but because it compliments the rhythms and progressions with absolute perfection.  If you are a beginner, start by playing the rhythm guitar parts (generally dominant 7th I, IV, and V chords) and master the 12-bar blues progressions.  Then, slowly begin to add the lead parts by using minor pentatonic scales to match Bloomfield.  Use your ear!  Stay in first position if necessary, but just try to listen along and \\"feel\\" what Bloomfield is doing with his guitar and how he works through the scale and how he resolves with the progression.  For that matter, you can also play along with Butterfield's lead harp parts which are equally as masterful.<br /><br />While I'm a big fan of Page, Hendrix, Duane Allman, Clapton, and that gang, Bloomfield's playing on this album is almost uniformly rooted in a very strict 12-bar-blues format in the most common keys with a few exceptions (off-hand, I believe Born in Chicago is in A; Mojo Workin' is in E; Shake your Money Maker is in E; Mellow Down Easy is in A; and Screamin' is in F [odd but cool]).  In other words, you can pick up your guitar and play along with this album and work on your ear and timing instead of memorizing complex changes and patterns.  Even if you aren't a blues freak, the guitar playing on this album displays the fundamentals of all classic rock and rock.  You'll better understand how those guitarists that I named in the beginning of this paragraph play the way they do.<br /><br />Just remember, listening to and playing along with this album was how some of the greatest guitarists learned their craft.  If you are patient, Bloomfield will teach your more about the guitar than any gimmicky book or video ever could.  It's like painting alongside Da Vinci.<br /><br />*that goes 10-fold for the song \\"East-West\\" on the next album
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I think, as everyone else, this book finish a couple of chapters before.<br /><br />Lauren, if you are going to create a love triangle, have the courage to make your character choose. Is not fair just leave it to the audience to decide what she did in the future. I guess you thought that if you kill one of them it well make half of the people angry, but with this you accomplished to leave EVERYONE unhappy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game a lot but think there are way to many ads. I like the way the cards move.
0451232852|5.0|Am loving this book and just about finished.  Can hardly wait to get into the next book in the trilogy.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|easy to use. all of the alarms & timers can be viewed on one summary screen shot. sounds can be customized with mp3s.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It took me quite a while to make the decision to read this book; &#34;Mystery&#34; is not my first choice. Boy, what a page-turner! I couldn't put it down. Warning;the end is frustrating
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It's so quick and easy and really grabs your attention for a long time. I couldn't put it down until I've read all 4 the available books in the series.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As I was reading I kept thinking &#34;that's me she is describing.&#34;  Wonderful book!  My favorite line - What would you do if you weren't afraid?&#34;  I will put up in my office!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a great and awesome game because  it's like you really have your own horse by the way horses are my favorite animal
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was hooked after the first few minutes.  I will agree with the other reviews - it was too short.  I do recommend you spend a few bucks for a game that challenges your mind, memory and skill while it is entertaining and relaxing as well. You will not regret this purchase.  Don`t waste your money on a game that doesn`t leave you pleased with your purchase, give this one a try. Look forward to the next one.  Graphics were great!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I wanted a calendar that the whole family could see and edit, we choose the Google calendar. Once we had that we needed something that would work on our Kindles when we were off line. This program works great with our old Kindle fire and my newer Kindle Fire HD. It's easy to sync to Google with one button plus it has a auto sync that you can set up. I also get SMS text messages to my phone on what I choose to have sent to me via the app settings.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Since my husband is a lawyer, I know that the cases and legal situations on this show are less than realistic. But I love watching the show anyway. The story lines are engaging, as are the characters. The acting is usually great. The show really hits its stride halfway through the season, and I am hoping Season 2 is just as good.
0316044695|5.0|This is by far one of the best books ever written.  I was unable to put this book down.  Definitely a must have for any military buff or book collector.  Marcus Luttrell is one tough SOB.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I LIKED THIS BOOK VERY MUCH  AND  THINK. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ADOLESCENTS AS WELL AS ADULTS. IT REALLY  HELD MY INTREST  .
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Have never read a bad Lee Child book. But I really wonder what happens to Jack when he gets older?
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I only managed to read approximately one chapter in this book, because, by this point, the heroine eyes had changed colour and her mouth, initially small, was now wide and full! Little things like this should never slip through proof reading.
0811879542|3.0|This is a neat book, but the pages are very delicate.  Not a great item for a small child because it could get damaged quite easily.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Right from the first season, this storyline has kept me on pins and needles waiting for the next one, and has had the same effect on many of my peers.  The basic premises of a family of English aristocracy living in Hardcore Castle begins just before the beginning of WWII, and slowly reveals the decline of such aristocracy due to world circumstances and, in short, &#34;changing times.&#34;  The story is not limited, however, to only the family proper, but to their relatives and to each of the numerous housekeepers of the castle, so it's impossible to be bored or even try to predict the futures of all of the cast members in the suspenseful, heart-warming and sometimes devastating circumstances they all live through.  The actors are awesome, the costumes are sublime, and many of the scenes are breathtaking, not to mention the background music, which is haunting. In short, Downton Abbey is captivating - can't wait for the next season!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is an awesome case.  I have purchased three of them, and would definitely say that it is my go-to case if I ever need to get another one. It does not stretch out, stays clean, and keeps the phone safe.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Excellent book. Different angle from other war books. Deserving of its number 1 ranking in Australia for 2012. Thoroughly captivating story.
B001226B0S|4.0|I used ot be a king.<br />Built my life on sand.......that's me. Felt that was true the first time I heard the words,
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Great movie!! If you like action movies... This is a great one! It's a movie I can watch several times.
B00AYJCEYC|3.0|His voice sounded strained, not near as powerfull as I heard on the TV. I liked the songs, just not as pleased with the voice.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Really good movie. About a boy who believes in several religions, not sure how I felt about that. But not one I could watch more than once.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It works. Bottom line, it's functional. It didn't really stand out, or go above and beyond expectation, but it does what it's supposed to, and that is give a smooth interface with Facebook on the kindle. If your a big facebooker, you definitely need this.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Received DVD as promised. Great entertainment. The actors work so well together...making their characters come alive. Wish their was more to come.
140053271X|3.0|It seems to be a limited device, but it has potential  I think a good price it new should be about $55.00. I have one as a backup to my kindle P.W there are two pros ,the SD card slot and it can be rooted, but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted. Very very limited web browser no Facebook or anything useful, the browser on the the paperwhite is much better. It is a pretty well made device.<br />It is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhite.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Received the DVD as promised. DVD was very well put together. Great special effects. Can't wait until next Hobbit DVD comes out.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|slow start like all of jj Abraham's shows with the over arching mystery being revealed oh so slowly...it is like season 1 is a twenty hour set up to the real story.
B004UPANGM|3.0|Probably wouldve liked it more if I were 20 years younger- or drunk while watching it! The over acting by the cast actually plays out very well given the overall theme/ style of the movie.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Big Bang Theory is, without doubt, the funniest series I have ever seen. My wife and I discovered this series, which is now in its sixth season, recently and fell in love with the characters, the concept and the actors. We were thrilled to discover that we could purchase the first five seasons on Amazon. We typically went through three to four episodes every night. Amazon offered this hysterical journey through the lives of nerds, geeks, geniuses and the occasional &#34;normal&#34; folk at a very reasonable price. Big Bang Theory is a definite &#34;must see&#34; to everyone and anyone who loves to laugh uncontrollably.
B008ROG6E0|3.0|Not a lot of action- more of a movie that makes a commentary about a dystopian future and how people accept/ react to it
1439170916|5.0|How old is cancer? What are the roots of our battle against this disease? Where are we in the war against cancer? In this comprehensive book's almost 600 pages, Siddhartha Mukherjee  does a magnificent job in answering these questions. The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, a Pulitzer Prize winner, is a powerful, engrossing read, beautifully expressed and understandable to a lay person.<br /><br />As this scholarly book takes readers through the ages, the author sites specific cases, some through his own oncology practice, that give the book a human touch and facts that a lay person can relate to.<br /><br />Cancer is possibly one of the oldest human diseases. Although we've come a long way in learning what it is and what can be done toward curing, or at least controlling it, cancer, in many respects, is still a mysterious disease.<br /><br />We tend to lump the different forms of cancer altogether. In many respects there is a commonality among the many different kinds, but oncology, the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of cancer, has learned that cancer is not a disease, but a whole family of diseases. These diseases are linked at a biological, cellular level. The particular types of cells, though different within the various types of cancer, abnormally divide and multiply, and eventually \\"take over\\" critical organs of the body.<br /><br />Each type of cancer cell has its own look, its own personality, its own method or pathway it takes through the body. Interestingly, when cells break away from their origin, for instance, with breast cancer, those rapidly multiplying cells might attach themselves to another part of the body, a process called metastasis. Even though it may be in another part of the body, it is identified as metastasized breast cancer.<br /><br />The study of cancer and its treatment involves a multitude of disciplines, from the many oncology sciences, to cancer screening, to specialists in surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, and even palliative care. In some cases oncologists have isolated probable causes of cancer, such as smoking and working with asbestos. Screening for early detection, such as pap smears and mammograms, have allowed treatment before cancer spreads to other parts of the body.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Couldn't put this down.  Based on true history with great intertwining of a great story - I loved the characters.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie really opened my to why I had suspected food in USA is poisonous to consumers. I have often wondered why it is dangerous to feed honey to babies in USA, yet ever where else around the world, babies eat raw honey and honey comb. Reason being the food in USA is poisoned by the manufacturers in a game to cause consumers ill-health and cause them to be dependent on drugs for solutions to eating poisoned foods.<br /><br />Once in 1997 a friend of mine came to visit USA. On a trip to Walmart, she observed to women standing side by side blocking the aisle; these women were approximately 3 feet wide. We had to go the next aisle in order go around them. When asked what caused them to be this large, I replied, \\"processed foods in USA are poisonous and unhealthy for human consumption\\". The same can be said regarding feeding domestic animals human food. Human food in USA is the number one cause of cancers and tumors and untimely death of pets. If the food is not good for the pets why eat it? It is only in USA that food is bad for pets. All over the world, what people eat, their pets eat.<br /><br />Definitely Food Inc gives the viewer an informed decision on choice of food products. Unfortunately, many are addicted to the \\"natural flavor\\" and \\"artificial flavor\\" found in most foods, and with their bellies overpowering their will, many will eat their way to disease and death.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for all audiences. My advise: watch the movie, consider your health, change your diet, read the Bible and get right with God; live better, eat smarter. For those that argue against the Bible dietary laws; has not following the Bible's laws helped anyone who is unhealthy? Think about it.
B008S8PPPG|1.0|read a review in the new Yorker magazine.  middle of the road  and that's being kind. pablum for the masses  uninteresting  etc  blah  blah  blah  annasantafe
B0023S50DO|5.0|I found the movie exciting, enjoyable and a action movie. Of course I liked the actor and actress. I would recommend the movie to see.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great site.  Lots of information.  Love the recipes and DIY ideas!!!  I love to pin stuff that I find interesting and then know where to find it when I need it.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I love a woman in action film and especially like the actress Milla Jovovich. I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it and would see it over again many times.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I liked this series, not your typical predictable sci fi<br /><br />Like able characters and walter is always adding another dimension
B005H29GSI|4.0|We're all big Angry Birds fans in our household, so we were anxious to give this game a try. I can definitely say we all enjoy it! It's fun for the kids (sometime with a little help or bending of the rules) and us parents enjoy it as well. It's just a goofy, \\"real world\\" take on the popular video game, and it succeeds in providing entertainment for all ages. What more can you ask for in a game like this? The rules as laid out make it kind of hard, especially for younger kids, but rules are made to be broken in this case. It's probably not going to become a family tradition or anything, but as a fun little distraction on a rainy day, Angry Birds On Thin Ice is recommended.
B0035LQYH4|5.0|Though I must say I forgot how dark it is.  It was great to be able to watch it on Amazon HD!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and the fantastic performances of the entire cast.  While the live singing meant it wasn't as polished it allowed them to make their performances much more emotional!  I'd recommend this film to anyone who enjoys musicals or historical drama.
B003L16FAE|5.0|How can you not love this classic Ahnold action flick?!  One of those movies that if I'm on the couch on a Saturday channel surfing and I stumble across it, I just figured out what I'm doing for the next hour and a half.  The gratuitious bicep close-ups makes the price well worth it.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|The game might be fun if there were instructions to get you started and more coins so you could play long enough to determine if you like it or not.  As it is, you need to buy additional coins before you have enough practice with the game.
B00A77II0U|4.0|If you get stuck the hint buttons comes in handy especially if you have to turn it off and come back to the game later.  All in all this game is good so far.  Kinda surreal, trippy, creepy clown involved.  Fun game
0061733199|5.0|Every man should have and read this book.  It is a GOLDMINE of information, written by a former SAS officer (read: one very experienced, very bad dude).<br /><br />Tells you everything from what kind of plants to avoid eating to what to do with the jet fuel leaking out of the fuselage of the plane you just went down in.<br /><br />Buy this book.  Read it.  Put it in a freezer bag and store it just in case shtf and you need to call on it one day.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Works great, and is very nice to have for the games that support it. However I never remove it from my 3DS XL because I personally find the system uncomfortable to hold without it. I would say I have average sized hands for an adult male, and the way I have to hold my hand to reach the right bumper button as well as the (abxy) buttons makes me bend my hand into a weird position that gets sore after a short time. Luckily the Circle Pad Pro fixes that and makes the system comfortable for longer gaming sessions.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I enjoyed this one as well as all the other books I`ve read by these two authors.  They always seem to have a pretty good plot and make it interesting enough to hold my attention.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It is the Roman circus right down to the elite fashions and hairdresses with the twist of using children for gladiators and having futuristic technologies running the games. In true 1984 fashion the elite have their way most of the time and even when they don't the starving peasants have no chance of changing a world that uses them as slaves for the elite. No happy endings either.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Pretty good read but then again I usually enjoy books by Baldacci.  It had a pretty good plot and there was enough action to keep you interested.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Finally a great movie starting a \\"Tiger!\\" We need more movies featuring one of nature's most beautiful creatures. Fantastic movie for families and anyone, really. I watched it over a couple of days and it takes you on an emotional ride. It asks a lot of questions about the human spirit and how fragile we really are. It seems God is the ultimate practical joker and should we take God so seriously, makes you think!<br /><br />MOPOP
B001NHNG64|4.0|The read was smooth and intriquing. It was not predictable. The character of Jack Reacher is a hero that we need today. Strong and thinking. Flawed but reliable. I can't wait to learn more about him.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Highly recommended.  Definitely cleared up why somethings worked and others didn't. Definitely a must read for anyone in a committed relationship or is about to venture into one.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. The motion picture &#34;Les Miserables&#34; 2012 is exceptionally well done with an all-star cast and extremely worthwhile. The Blu-Ray quality if top-notch and the movie is absolutely beautiful to watch. Highly recommended.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really like this puzzle. It reminds me of must. I will definitely get the next one when it comes out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Suzanne Collins you have made me love this book all over again because it was my 2nd time reading it
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I totally enjoy this series.  Everytime I watch an episode from it, I find some small little detail that I missed the previous viewing.  I highly recommend it to any Star Trek fan!!
B006BZ8WAI|2.0|Words can not explain how much this album sucked. I like Korn and I like Dubstep. I, however, did not like this album.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. I get so many great ideas and recipes.  I no longer need a recipe book and exercise magazines. Genius.....
B00701897I|4.0|I've been a Tintin fan ever since I was a kid and was so glad they didn't make the characters &#34;lighter&#34; for a younger audience.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This took me quite a while to read, but it was worth it.  The author grabbed me with her presentations of real people instead of names and events  A revelation for anyone who ever thought history was dry and boring.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game, thought the first one was really good and this one is an imporvment in every way so easy 5 stars, and it's free!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series.  Maybe just a glorified soap opera, but it held the attention of both my wife and I.  We watched all three seasons and watched past our normal bedtime because we were waiting for the next surprise.  Waiting for season 4 and beyond.
0465011047|3.0|Man's inhumanity to man - this theme just kept coming back to me while reading this book. The other theme: the strength of the human spirit. Kang Chol-Hwan outlines a tale of survival and renewal that were both interesting and stupefying.<br /><br />I wasnt aware of the large Korean-Japanese communist contingency inside of Japan that repatriated to North Korea in the 1960-70s (of which the author was part), only to see their fortunes stolen and families thrown into prison camps like Yudok. The severe struggles for food and basic clothing were hard to stomach for me, knowing how bountiful those items are elsewhere in the world.<br /><br />As a memoir of this man's childhood, you get coming of age stories wrapped up inside a concentration camp. The mistakes we so routinely make as children are life and death decisions in Yudok. One scenario Chol-Hwan points out that stuck with me was where a friend of his was kicked into a septic tank by a rogue 'teacher' and then was left to wallow in the filth for 20-30 minutes only to succumb to illness days later. From lows like that, the author takes you to highs where he taunted North Korean military while living as a fugitive in China. The whole escape was especially enjoyable, you could feel the emotion so well.<br /><br />Chol-Hwan covers a wider range of feelings in 200 pages than most will cover in their lifetimes. And that's probably the most remarkable thing about the book: the author does all of this while never really getting into any details or character development. It may be a cognitive dissonance type of thing to omit the details of something so horrific; I respect the decision but it ultimately takes away from the book.<br /><br />The ideal audience for a memoir like this is hard to pin down. The material can be graphic at times so I think you would need to be at least high school age and slightly knowledgeable about the historical context from the 20th century. Anyone can get something out of a book like this but the more you understand about WWII, the Cold War and the Korean War, the more this book will resonate with you. It's chilling, haunting and most of all necessary.the more you understand about WWII, the Cold War and the Korean War, the more this book will resonate with you.

B0013F1D02|4.0|Son saw this at school and wanted us to watch it. Very entertaining great cast. Whole family watched together. Rent it today.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I did not see this coming. I really loved this book. It was emotional but I could feel the love. I'm ready for the next book!!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Intense action; surprise &#34;M&#34;'s past history and great background scenery. The train action intense and mind boggling.  Wow!<br />thanks for the movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game look forward to playing everyday. It's a lot of fun and there is always new games poping up.
B000002LFZ|4.0|Great music from the past to drive along and singHope singing does not constitute and infraction. Thanks for the music.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I enjoyed this book on many levels. The story unfolds slowly, with mystery, so you learn the character's voices before you know their stories.  I enjoyed learning about the language of flowers and wish there was a companion picture or illustration book.  I found the descriptions of new motherhood exhausting and found myself skipping forward a bit for relief. Over all a good read and I would look for other work by diffenbaugh.
B005D6O12O|5.0|I have a large and wide foot, and these size 11 fit well.  I have done alot of walking with these shoes and had no problems with my plantar facitis (a painful foot condition where the tendon on the bottom of the foot gets inflamed, esp. if not wearing supportive shoes).  I work as a nurse and feel confidant that I can make it through a 12 hr shift in these shoes.  The little bling on the side is nice too.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded the app on my kindle and I find it to be a decent game for what it's worth . I find most games on Amazon cheap and fun to play.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It is wonderful to have all six movies, and my son & I are enjoying watching the Star Wars saga in order.  Excellent quality too.  Great value for the cost as well.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed the ladies beautiful classical piano references, The music carried and directed the story line from which the characters eveoved. Enjoyed the ending.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Excellent acting, great visuals, though not as fantastic as those in LOR, no suspense or real action yet.  This was only the intro, so it sets the characters, the stage and the conflict, but plot development has to wait for the next installment, unfortunately.  I was ready for more.  Oh well, something to look forward to, huh?
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Liked the first part but it fell apart at the end and left me wondering where did it go wrong.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I do not like this movie - it is depressing but the Amazon Prime movie option is wonderful! I do love Amazon Prime!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We enjoyed watching this on a date night.  It certainly has violence and I wouldn't watch it with children due to this
B0091THRCU|4.0|The case was a bit tight at first but like all fabric type cases it eventually stretched enough to make a firm not too tight hold on the iPhone.
0385535147|1.0|I read all of Grisham's stuff. Generally because I like his characters. I found this book so bad that I had to find a spoiler so that I could stop.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|I love this game however; I have to say it is a bit too challenging. I don't take the time to continue with it because I find my anxiety rised to quickly.
B0007939NO|5.0|I first saw this as a stage play in college during the 1960's.  Later, I saw the movie version with Cyd Charisse, Gene Kelly, and Van Johnson.  I loved them both, and I loved the adult fairytale that was so beautifully told in words, song, and dance.  I was very pleased to find this CD version on Amazon.
B0099114WO|5.0|This was a lovely film about an older couple who has been married for 31 years.  They both have settled into the routine of their lives.  The wife is very aware that it has grown stale and she longs to have that spark put back into their relationship.  The husband doesn't understand this, but when he realizes he might lose her and that she is serious, he unwillingly goes along with it.  What truly makes this movie are the two lead actors, Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  They both offer exceptional performances bringing comedy and drama into a real life situation.  Meryl ads just the right girlishness into her character, Kay, while Tommy invokes a guy cut off from all emotion as her Husband, Arnold.<br /><br />Although these days I wonder who is still around that has been married for 31 years. My generation doesn't seem to have a handle on long term relationships to begin with. They do not know how to make it work or are even aware of what it truly entails. It's not all hearts and roses. This movie would be a great documentary on how to show that marriage and long term relationships are serious business.<br /><br />Kay enrolls she and her husband into a week long extensive couples therapy session in Hope Springs, Maine. It's a quaint, cottage like town where everyone knows that many of the visitors are there to meet up with the head couples counselor, Dr. Feld, played by Steve Carrell.  Kay is desperate to revive her marriage at all costs and Arnold will be forced to get into it whether he likes it or not.<br /><br />Do they find a newness in each other and passion for what was once there?  You'll have to see the movie to find out.  I enjoyed this look at a married couple finding an avenue to breath new life into their relationship.  It was very honest and moving.  The movie manages to keep it light while finding just the right moments to bring in the emotion.  This is mainly successful due to the gifted actors playing the roles.  In less capable hands, this movie would've fallen into a snooze fest.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are a delight to watch in action.<br /><br />Other movie goers who prefer the blow 'em blockbusters that move at a fast pace will likely be bored with this though. I imagine those not knowing much about the seriousness of relationships will also likely want to slit their wrists while watching this. I loved it and I think anyone who has had problems in a long term relationship will be moved by this movie. If you enjoy character driven stories, then you may like this as well.would've fallen into a snooze fest.

B009O2XY12|4.0|I like the buttle games.  I wish I could get some of the other games downloaded to my android pad.  I finally got Candy Crush, but there are some others that I like and my computer is not as comfortable as my android.  This bubble game was fun and offered excellent pasttime.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Violent and full of language....typical Tarantino...but also very funny. If you are familiar with other Tarantion films, you will find this one is actually a bit more tame than some of his work. I watched it twice and had an absolute blast both times.

B00BGIBVP8|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie on a date night, and we laughed so hard we cried! I highly recommend it to couples near or in their forties that can laugh at some of the real, even awkward transitions that happen as you are raising a family and rocketing into middle age. I really enjoy all the Apatows! (written by Eric's wife)
B00846REIS|5.0|Very addicting, I'm in love with Gideon and Eva. I can't wait til Entwined in You. I can read it over and over.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Just as strong as the last half of the first. Love the plot and the character embellishment. Straight out of the comic book, as I remember it...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love this game!!!  On a big screen it's awesome!!!  Better than playing on my IPhone.  !!!  We can see more détails and it's more fun to play!!!

B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I'm a big Quinten Terintino fan but hubs is not.  He didn't like this movie very much but I looooved it!  It's a bit quirky and gory and classic terintino directing so if you're into that you'll love this film.

B007XIC1GI|4.0|The book kept my interest. It was a little vague on some details and abruptly ended. I would recommend this book
B005IA9JZO|5.0|This is a great movie. Loved it as a kid and now my kids love watching it. So glad I bought it.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Good book, started off very interested but became a little stagnant in the middle. Ended okay but was a little hard to get through
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I was afraid that Castle and Kate's on-screen romance would ruin the competitive tension between the characters that drove the show.  That has not happened, and that's good.  Some of the best episodes of the series are here in Season 5, starting with the season opener.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I had watched the first couple of seasons of this show when it originally aired,then lost track of it. I'm glad to see the entire series is on prime. Michael Chiklis' performance is outstanding as a bad cop. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good intense cop drama.

B006AN78XS|4.0|Great movie, very original. . Ending could have been better, in my opinion ..but.. Overall good though..Owen Wilson is hilarious.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not a Stephen King reader but my niece recommended this 800 plus page book. I am glad she did because I could not put it down. great story and concept which really made you think. Would highly recommend.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Knocked up to me is almost a 'cult classic' - any time that movie comes on 'E' or where ever I love to catch it ... this one was funny, raunchy, inappropriate BUT generally a cute view of life in the 40s as a married couple.
B002VECLVY|5.0|It's sad but beautifully shot. I love this movie . Colin is a wonderful actor who conveys so much with just a look
B0094K1QR8|4.0|Nothing earth shattering like Shawshank but a cute, entertaining movie.  She is always adorable and he is never hard to look at despite my wondering if he can act in any role other than 'that guy'!
0385344228|3.0|Overall, I liked the book and found it easy to read.  However, you have to overlook a lot of inconsistencies which have been pointed out by previous reviews.  My main question is how does a child get to be 14 growing up with educated parents and among a close-knit community without having someone make the observation that something is wrong with his emotional development? Where were his teachers? Where are the grandparents that are mentioned throughout the story who never show up to support their daughter? Did they not recognize something was wrong with their grandchild? It is obvious that the parents think their son could be the potential killer since the father disposes of a knife and iPod yet he keeps asserting that his son is innocent. How is it possible that the grandfather, a real looser, has so much influence from prison? I rate this book on par with a Nora Roberts/Sandra Brown novel, a good read if you can overlook a lot of facts that don't make sense.

B00821OX98|5.0|Not really sure why I never watched an episode of this series in its first runs.  But now I am addicted.  I watched the entire 2 seasons in 3 days.  Cannot wait for the season to begin.  So happy I gave it a chance.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Amazing remake! I saw the original and I love the remake. The musical version was able to convey emotion that the original movie left implied but unspoken. Beautiful!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Great new music. Really like most of the songs. Not sure about strawberry bubble gum... but love don't hold the wall.
B007QJBHRS|4.0|Doris Day, I've known for making some good comedies and this is one of them. This is a good movie that doesn't let you down. Cary Grant is also good in this role of a playboy.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I've waited for the end for many years, and now that I have it I want more.  I want to know what happens after.  That is all I will say.  No hints or spoilers here.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I have always thought TNG was the best of the Star Trek series. The series is so positive and hopeful and the story lines are less likely to be resolved by blowing things up than so many sci fi series. Many of the stories are thought provoking and not every show is wrapped up at the end with a thorough resolution - which I find refreshing. That being said, I had forgotten how wooden some of the acting was - if only they could all have been half as good as Patrick Stewart - and the stories that were once quite topical have become a little dated. It's still a great series, I just wish it was as good as I remembered it.

B00C2VIA52|5.0|Great game, i think it is a mix between warcraft (mainly)with some aspects of yugioh tied in there; I love it.
B00881PTRC|4.0|A lot of fun, and easy to use. Some words are very hard, and unusual...the graphics are very funny and I love the background music as well.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I played this game on my xbox 360 which is not as good as PC but I thought I'd get it anyway. Ever since then I've wanted to try out the PC version but I don't have a good computer. Once I saw this I was glad because I thought it'd be somewhat like the PC so I got it. And I'm so glad I did! BUY THIS APP FOR YOURSELF OR YOUR KIDS!
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This is our new favorite show. I can't believe I had never seen this show before, I ended up buying all three seasons and my daughter and I have watched them several times. I don't want to give anything away about this show so I'll just say Watch It!! It's amazing! you will not regret it! Watch all three seasons back to back! Then watch them again!! I Can't Wait until the new season starts in the fall!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The Shield graphically illustrates what most large, inner-city police forces probably must deal with on a daily basis.  We don't always like the way the principal characters deal with crime problems;  but we don't dislike it enough to trade places with them and become the enforces, either.  The writers subscribe to a belief that rules and regulations often inhibit the ability of those we hire to keep us (and themselves) safe safe from  personal harm, and their ability to enforce the law.  So we can appreciate their frustrations and their willingness at times to bend the law in order to to enforce it.  Characters are well written and well portrayed.  Constance violence (murder, torture) etc and drug-use and gangs are realistically depicted; so if you are squeamish, choose a Disney movie.
B009Y6UCRC|5.0|great blues music & as usual amazon mp3 delivered.  will for sure buy more music by these two artists.  music at it finest
B004AP9W46|5.0|I love this book mainly because it tells the story of creation and the fall of the Angels. You could almost imagine that it really did happen that way!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Watch this you love it.  A supernatural adventure of two brothers the Winchester's fighting paranormal evil and saving lives. If you like Supernatural shows your love this series.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I can see how this style of writing wouldn't appeal to everybody.  The author doesn't drag things along.  She keeps the story moving forward and I enjoy that quite a bit.  So far she hasn't dragged anything on longer than she should have.<br /><br />This book has some good action in it.  Cat continues to be tough and smart in regards to her skill set.  She does show her ignorance at times in regards to vampire culture, which she should.  Normally when characters do really stupid things it annoys me a lot.  Cat's mistakes are mostly based on her not having all the information.  She tries to make smart decisions instead of the old 'I shouldn't do this but I will anyway' routine.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is my FAVORITE book out of the three. But I recommend that you don't read this series of book until it is finished. It ends at a \\"cliff hanger\\", and it is sooooooo.... suspenseful for lack of a better word. Otherwise, you should totally read it. All my friends absolutely obsessed with The Selection series!!! :)
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I chose this rating because of 2 reasons 1. The legend that if you read all the halo books, the legendary mode campaign on all halo games is not as hard. 2. It is just a great opening to the halo series and I would have to say it is the best (and most confusing) storyline anyone person will ever read. I especially loved the way this book is not too detailed like the Narnia series but has just enough detail so you get a really good idea of how the characters feel and what the characters see.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I was not as happy with this app as the simple fb app.  It slid around too much on the screen and was small in pring and once enlarged you could not just move forward without readjusting.  The basic works fine for me.

B005CRY2O6|3.0|there are some great, fresh recipes in this book, many of which look so tempting i want to cook them all at once. pretty photographs, plus Ottolenghi writes in an accessible style.<br /><br />the quality of the kindle version, though, really irks me. several photos don't follow the recipes they're supposed to represent, and in many ingredient lists, every thing is jumbled together. for example, a list might start off with &#34;dressing,&#34; then list what goes into the dressing, but instead of a break between the next group of ingredients, it just keeps going. one has to read the recipe very carefully to make sure the right ingredients go where they should.<br /><br />i recommend buying this book in print. although some of the spices called for are not available at your local grocery store, they're readily available online. i'm looking forward to cooking from this book. i just hope i don't mess up based on the jumbled ingredients list.  :-/

B001ANSSDC|4.0|I watched the movie on which this book was based before I ever read the novel.  Although it shouldn't have come as a surprise, Hollywood revised the story and of course created the &#34;happy ending.&#34;  If I had read the book first, not sure I would have felt so good about the movie ---- regardless, I did enjoyed both.<br /><br />Now the book.  As with most books vs movies, the book is much better at character development, so the reader becomes more familiar with motives and quirks and can more readily empathize with the various personae.  The storyline here involves a young man released from a mental health facility back to the custody of his family, after a long rehabilitation period -- it is so long that the young man isn't quite aware of exactly how long he was gone -- he thinks months, it's actually years.  He has hopes of reconciling with his wife.  He wakes daily to a fanatic regimen of exercise and fitness routine that takes hours and most of a day, in hopes of getting to be the person his (ex-) wife would want him to be.  (It turns out he was overweight just before the incident that led to his commitment to the mental health facility)....  Also, the man's father appears to have a chronic gambling problem, which his mother has lived with for many years.  The father seems bipolar himself at times, and has distanced himself from this returning son for many years.  It is heartening to see the family become reconciled, and the young man to awaken to reality of knowing his wife has moved on, having divorced him during his rehabilitation, resettled, and has children, living happily without him.  (Spoiler alert - the novel ending is quite different than the movie here!  Sorry, Jennifer Lawrence!)

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My fellow human beings, The main argument I'm seeing against this amazing peice of literature is that the vocabulary is &#34;unrealistic for teenagers&#34; or &#34;unrelatable to adolecents&#34; I however belive that we must examine the people who this book is marketed to, who it was written for, the nerdfighters. These are people who have words like &#34;monotonous&#34; and &#34;lacerate&#34; in their everyday vocabulary. These are people who understand the power of a well-worded metaphor. The interesting conversationalists. The smart ones. The ones who make great friends and wait for several minutes trying to think of the perfectly selected word. The ones that fear oblivion, the ones that think fearing oblivion is ridiculous, the ones who do both. The ones who read books and watch videos that encourage them to be intelligent. The nerdfighters. thank you John. Thank you Hank. And thank the entire nerdfighter community. I love you guys.<br /><br />Sincerly, nerdfighter forever, Mia<br />DFTBA
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Very cool to see Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller together in the same novel! Switching between third and first person was an interesting twist.
B000FA675C|2.0|I didn't like this book, it is against my morals.  Not my type of reading material.  Will know better next time.
0062059963|3.0|I will say that I enjoyed reading this book, even though I didn't think it was very well crafted. In short, it was a romance novel that tried way too hard to be dystopian.<br /><br />The strongest part, I think, were the characters. America is tolerable and relatable, and I really was rooting for her. Though I found the love triangle to be contrived, I also liked Maxon and Aspen both. The gems were the supporting characters, though. I think the highlight of the story was the Marlee-subplot, and America's family was charming as well.<br /><br />The world building, however, was pretty weak. I forgave the unrealistic concept of the Selection for the first book because it was fun and didn't try to be anything else. The second book was a little too ambitious. America talks a little about the world as it used to be, but it's all vaguely constructed without any real knowledge of politics or revolution. One plot point is America reading the diary of the country's founder, and the whole idea that he created this radically different state just because he wanted to was unrealistic. It felt to me as if the author constructed what she thought a \\"dystopia\\" should by reading other YA fiction instead of actually doing any research on regimes and revolutions, and so she ended up with an unrealistic and unconvincing world. The author underestimates the power of oral tradition - the country is only 3-4 generations old, but no one remembers how things used to be. Which is ridiculous, especially when you consider that these people were probably unhappy from the start (and that the US was founded on anti-monarchy principles, which is something that people would not be likely to forget). The Odyssey was passed down by word of mouth for hundreds of years, you'd think that people would pass down some memories from the old country.<br /><br />The rebels sub-plot was underdeveloped. It could have been a really good way to legitimize the world, but it felt like \\"oh, also there are rebels who attack the castle sometimes.\\" If we had found out more about what their cause was, it would have felt more relevant, but instead, they just felt thrown in there for grins and giggles.<br /><br />The writing was good, but unremarkable. It was an easy to devour - I read it in three or four hours. Overall, I would rate The Elite 2 1/2 stars, but that being said I will probably read the next one. My hope is that something will come out of the rebel cause that makes the world more believable.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|And entertaining. An interesting approach to a zombie apocalypse and well done. I enjoyed the cultural differences in response to the crisis, war, and recovery, as well as the commonalities.
B0065CCM76|4.0|I got this colelction on sale, thinking it'd be worth a few dollars.  Once I started playing it, though, I remembered just how much I really liked some of these songs.  &#34;Fire Lake&#34; is probably my favorite Seger song, though for thirty years now I've been trying to figure out just what the heck it's about!  I also like &#34;Rock and Roll Never Forgets&#34;, &#34;Against the Wind&#34; and &#34;Shame on the Moon&#34;.  And, of course, &#34;Old Time Rock and Roll&#34; is a better song than all the songs it praises!<br /><br />I had to take off one star, though, because as much as I like Christmas music, &#34;Little Drummer Boy&#34; is my least favorite Christmas song--and maybe my least favorite song of all time.  So when I put this collection on my MP3 player, I left it off and have listened to the rest of the collection many times!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this app.But there is one problem. After a while the levels get very hard.It is like the enemies of angry birds are on your side but you have to make a plane or car.
B009AP2G26|3.0|The music this season continues to be AMAZING.  However, I really wish they would let the new cast members shine and let the graduates go.  I've loved Finchel and all the originals for three years, but now I am more interested in Marley and Jake's generation. (I really like the new characters).  I am finding the whole NYADA storyline tiresome.  Also, not thrilled with the way they are handling the Klaine break-up.  I think Blaine is being too wishy-washy and apologetic; Kurt, too righteous.  I miss Blaine being his old bad-a** self.  (Spoiler alert) Yes, Blaine cheated, but only because Kurt was distant and completely unavailable, caught up with his exciting NY life.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really enjoy being able to read my book anywhere with the app for my phone.  It's nice when you don't have your kindle, but you usually have your phone with you!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book, very unexpected. I thought this book was just going to be the sex, but there is a fantastic story to these books!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is a wonderful musical with quality music and acting.  It is so well done that any age of one's family can enjoy it.<br />The story covers every range of emotion, and is all-encompassing.  I have followed this musical through the years,<br />and was so thrilled with this production.  Congratulations to all who were a part of it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Well I truly hope there's going to be a book 3 because this is an amazing series. Although I do feel like they're driving the selection out longer than necessary, it is an extravagant book.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found the book truly fascinating. It is either one of the most profound and important books of the age or it is a well intentioned piece of imaginary fiction. That I cannot tell you which of these two it is is some indication of why I feel it is well worth the read.  Glad to know that he is recovering.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|Still working great (for the one month I've been using it).  Will be 5 star rating if it stays working for more than a year.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is very addicting.  I downloaded it when I first received my Kindle Fire in December and have been playing it over and over since.  It's still as much fun today as the day I downloaded it.  I love how it's three different Mahjong games into one giant &#34;Quest&#34; and how you receive artifacts as a reward each step of the way.  This game always has something fun and different and not the same boring game over and over again.  The training tool at the beginning is perfect and makes this game very user friendly.  Great game for the whole family.  Even my elementary age son loves playing it.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Really disappointed.  The trailer made this look it might be funny, a bit entertaining and possibly historic info.  Failed on all levels.  not worth your time.
1577314808|5.0|Only have read 3 chapter; it is a slow read for me. Because I find the content very valuable and WANT to learn the process, I review many times.<br />I have experienced tiny windows of 'Now' and they are wonderful.
0061537969|5.0|This book is so touching. There are a few parts where you get a little bored with the information the author is giving you. But in the end this is valuable information for the story. I cried a lot during this book, I guess because I have a soft side for animals. After finishing this book I looked at my dog totally different. I learned that yes he is a dog but he has thoughts and opinions just like humans. This book is just life changing!! READ READ READ

B009NG1Q96|5.0|Okay -- first, all of the other reviews that I have looked at since reading Elite on her -- must have been on crack! lol! No, seriously come on people! This book was amazing! I could not even put it down once I started reading it! I loved it even more so than the first one I think!!!!! So, don't listen to the others -- you will love it!<br /><br />Now for my Review!<br /><br />First of all can I say Oh MY GOD! I loved this book!!! I absolutely adored the first book, The Selection, but this second book to the series, The Elite, is beyond words! I loved it! It soaked right through to my heart and I could not put it down. I literally read it from start to finish within twenty-four hours!<br /><br />America and Maxon are the most beautiful couple, though complicated by Aspen's presence at the palace. I find that America is starting to shine from the first moment that she met Maxon in the garden to the time that she kneed him in the groin - I have found that their love to be honest and open and genuine, even when America did not see it at times. A letter that America's father wrote her had these two messages to her that I found to be the most truthful about her and the prospect of her becoming the princess and then the queen: \\"America, I know you don't see much in yourself, but you need to start.\\" \\"You have it in you to lead, America!\\" Those are true! America is headstrong and confident and has it in her to be the best for the country of Ilea. She can push change on them, but at what price? Maxon begins to share with her things that he shouldn't which ultimately almost led to her downfall - but in the end they share a moment, forced upon them when she learns just how much he does love her and how far that he will go for her. He loves her and she does love him - she will fight for him to the end! Do you think they will change their world as the Italians would like to see it? Do you think they have it in them to fight Maxon's father for change? I am sure the king would have things differently especially after their run in when he forcibly put on her shoulders just what he expected to happen if she and Maxon were to be wed, that she could cost them everything ... but in the diaries that she read, couldn't they stand to loose everything if it meant a better future?<br /><br />This book was breathtaking! I just finished and I can hardly contain myself. I want more! More! More! If only the next book was released like yesterday so I can keep reading! I also have to say that this would make an excellent movie series, better even than Twilight I think (and I love twilight). I think that I might go back and reread The Selection and then The Elite all over again because I love it just that much. It does make me a bit sad though that Aspen is left in the shadows. She loves him but in a different way. It still makes me sad, but that love with Maxon at first forced in a way but grew from friendship over time into heart wrenching love. I don't know what I would do if I was forced to stand back and watch the man that I love be with another person, and I can certainly see where I would be head over heels jealous!!! Wouldn't you?<br /><br />The only thing left to say to any reader and the author about this book is that if you love a good romantic book, somewhat historical if not fictional, with action and adventure - and intrigue .... this is the book for you. And,,,,,, the cover is beautiful!e things differently especially after their run in when he forcibly put on her shoulders just what he expected to happen if she and Maxon were to be wed, that she could cost them everything ... but in the diaries that she read, couldn't they stand to loose everything if it meant a better future?<br /><br />This book was breathtaking!

B000FBJFSC|5.0|This book is masterfully written. I grew up Catholic and kind of poor and I laughed and cried over the family members and situations this author writes so compassionately about. A must read.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I had read that portable headphone amplifiers were recommended to truly appreciate quality cans. I love music but never knew how much I was missing until I purchased the E17. I plugged it into my laptop hoping the reviews that I had read were right and boy was I pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />These were everything I had hoped and more. I realize that these are not top of the line but they are a vast improvement over the computer sound card or anything coming out of my iPod touch. Never again will I listen to music without an amp or quality headphones.

B00008OWZC|3.0|Big Zep fan since around 1975.  I went back and forth on whether to give the CD 3 or 4 stars.  It's Zep, it rocks, and it's better than most of the other stuff out there.<br /><br />That being said, HTWWW was a let down for me.  Most of the Zep fans I talked to said it blows TSRTS out of the water.  Disagree. For me, TSRTS is a better performance, and the sound quality is much better.<br /><br />Also, I'm talking about the original TSRTS.  Have not heard the remastered version.  Would be interested in hearing the new material on it, and the remastered quality, but the editing of the originals keep me from buying it.  Maybe someday.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This show is just funny enough, just dark enough, just real enough to make it a great series. Can't wait to see season 2. Good stuff.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Who would ever believe this movie was filmed in the late 30's!  The remastered DVD is excellent, especially the color.  The sound is good, if you have an updated TV set.  This has always been one of my top 10 movies, ever, with Errol Flynn at his best, playing the rascally Robin Hood trying to disenthrone the evil Prince John, who rules England, while his brother, King Richard, is off fighting in the Crusades.  Lots of action, and good for the whole family.  Definitely a classic swashbuckler, not to mention Erich Korngold's magnificent sweeping music score.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Having Kindle on my smartphone ensures that I always have good company whenever I have a few spare minutes. As someone with little patience for waiting in lines or for appointments, having the Kindle helps keep me in a positive frame of mind. I have used to to buy eBook versions of 19th century and early 20th century books when I saw at rare book stores and auction houses and wanted a reading copy, not a valuable hardback edition.

B000FBJHZS|4.0|This book was fast paced and well done.  It did take some suspense of reality in the success of the heroine though.  Overall, a very good suspenseful read.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|The production is good, though not perhaps quite as good as some other versions I have seen.  Still a better than average watching experience.  Lushly photographed and costumed, timeless tale, and good acting.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This book was recommended by senior management so I read it. I did not think that an tech book could be much fun, but I found myself drawn to the characters and interested by the correlations of IT and manufacturing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it seems that the only thing that God is good for in this book is to curse, blaspheme, and blame. When something &#34;good&#34; does happen, then it is thanks &#34;goodness.&#34; Hedonism, narcissism, and corporate ethics are breading a godless, thankless, and proud generation.<br /><br />I would recommended it with reservations.

068485743X|5.0|First of all The First Five Pages was written for a different era. the time when you had to submit a manuscript to get published. that however doesn't matter. What this book is about is the structure of writing and writing well. If your an Indie author in particular you will love this book. It has changed the way I look at my writing and its impact on the reader.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I think everyone ought to read this book and know the type of hidden atrocities that are happening in this country. The main character, Shin grows up in a deplorable camp and the reader in drawn in with sadness and compassion. The escape  itself is remarkable but it is the journey into his thoughts that is so revealing and makes this book so captivating.

AND TO THOSE US, THAT ARE IN AND AROUND AVIATION AND ALCOHOL, WE KNOW THE CONSEQUENCE OF ABUSE AND NOT BEING IN CONTROL OF ONESELF.

B00BJS7104|3.0|WE MUST AND SHALL BE  AWARE, WHAT IS ON THE SCREEN IS ENTERTAINMENT AND NOT A SUBSTITUTION FOR LEARNING THE BUTCHERY AND BARBARIC WAYS OF SLAVERY, NOT ONLY IN AMERICA BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. DO NOT ADD OR TAKE AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT...
B00AYLTMMM|3.0|This was an interesting movie about an individual trying to balance his spirituality with his sexuality, while enduring a very debilitating and life-threatening physical condition. I thought all of the characters were placed in situations that for many people would be uncomfortable. Helen Hunt's character is still a puzzle to me and I have to wonder if she took the role just so she could show off a fabulous physique at age 49. Fundamentally I think the movie was well directed, shot, etc., but I just didn't care for the story in general. Somehow I felt like I was intruding in very private--well--sessions and breaching a therapeutic and spiritual confidentiality. I didn't think Helen Hunt's performance rose to the level of an Academy Award nomination, but then I'm a Midwesterner with different expectations of actors than my coastal friends. But overall, this was an okay movie, but not one that I would watch again or tell someone that it's a &#34;must see&#34; film.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is simple, secure, sleek. I love everything about it. My kindle goes every where with me and this case helps me protect my kindle from scratching, etc.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I am twelve years old and this woud definitely  quantify for the est book I have ever read. I salute to you Adam Brown.
B00BP4WAZS|2.0|I'm a gamer, AND I love me some animation, but I honestly cannot say that I'm impressed with this at all. Don't know why, it just didn't do anything for me.
B0045EJY90|2.0|it didn't have audio jacks in back to record from a cassette player so i couldn't use it.<br />  sorry maybe you will have one next time .<br /><br />  paul m
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a gift for a young girl.  She was thrilled with the set and watched the series during Spring Break.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|If you're a Quentin Tarantino fan you'll love this! Lots of action and humor tied in!  You won't regret this one! I could watch it again and again!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app.  I travel and was using my phone but now I use this app even at home. I have dumped my alarm to use this on my kindle.  It is a must have!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I love MJ and this movie is a classic! Great music videos and clips! Definitely something for the whole family and its a nice short video (about an hour). I was very impressed with how the material was remastered for Blu Ray
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is a very nice app to use when you need just a simple calculator. thank you for having it.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked this novel.  It was well written and a heck of a lot better than her other book, &#34;The Last Letter from Your Lover.&#34;
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Watched this with my 11 year old granddaughter and we both loved it.  Had a good moral message to it.  I would have preferred Jesus to help out along with all the mythical characters, I think that would have added to the storyline.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This book kept me guessing and held my interest.  I would lik to read more books by this author (kindle)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book and didn't want to put it down!!! Just wait till the end you won't be able to stop reading either! I'm onto get a new Nicholas sparks book!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. I can't stop playing when my mom tells me to get off I say just a couple more minutes.
B007NVIB5U|5.0|This cast is brilliant! They are talented, an ensemble cast that is captivating and intelligent. The writing is strong and emotional! I am sorry there were only two short seasons!
B004WKH4PS|4.0|It was great fun visiting the 40's. Joan Crawford turned in a stellar performance as an enabling mother who would stop at nothing in the hopes of earning the love of her sociopathic daughter.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The character development was great in this book.  We saw the movie after and we were very disappointed that they changed the roles of several of the characters.  Read the book, skip the movie.
B0052BZ6X8|2.0|Weak plot, holes in plot, slow, weak CG effects. I probably should have turned it off sooner but I felt like I needed to get my money's worth by finishing it.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Harry Bosch must follow where truth leads him.  Even when the upper most managers in the police force are willing to let evidence be ignored and buried, Harry is not.  He values people regardless of where hardships have pushed them.  He has no choice. He must seek the truth.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I would rate this album as really her best one as I have enjoyed listening to all the songs she sings on this album
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much. Sometimes I never stop playing. Also I think I have a real horse when I play for a long time.
B00BXKKNFS|4.0|It does not block all the adds but I am happy I got it though I think that people should not have to pay an extra $15.00 to have it when you have already spent quite a bit for the Kindle. When you buy a computer, cell phone, lap top you are not subject to ads so why should you be when you buy a tablet.
